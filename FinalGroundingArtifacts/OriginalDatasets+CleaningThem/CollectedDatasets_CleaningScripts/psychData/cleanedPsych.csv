But nonetheless, I found myself curiously fascinated by my lack of concern for my health, social and physical.

"Are there ways to avoid letting chronically angry and verbally abusive people affect your mood? I have a bad-tempered family member that I cannot avoid. She used to yell at me a lot and got violent sometimes. Since I stood up to her several times, she has not dared to attack me directly. Instead, she goes around yelling, swearing, slamming doors and will raise her voice to make sure I hear it if I am far away or in bed. I donat mind curse words in general, but find the intent and vehemence of her swearing offensive and it is degrading to have this constantly directed at me.",1
For as long as I could remember I liked being alone. I think itas starting to really effect me though as I start to get older and enter the adult world. Every time Iam out with friends I feel uncomfortable and awkward.

"I have very low self-esteem. Every therapist I have seen in my life has made a point of telling me I am homely and unattractive, whether I brought up the subject of my looks or not. In a group they were intent on assuring another patient how pretty she was, but at the same time putting me down. We both had short hair and no makeup. Other therapists have put me down as unfixable unattractive, even when I had long hair, makeup, and a basically fit body. Male and female therapists alike expressed this opinion, even when they liked me as a person and enjoyed working with me. I know Iam not a supermodel, but I think Iam pretty enough for people in general. Why would providers tear down a vulnerable patient like this? (From of USA)",1

My boyfriend has a 13 yr who is very clingy to him. Sheas had instances where she would call her mother while she is at our house and cry when she doesnat get her way. This of course would spark and argument with between her and my boyfriend. Of course when we first started dating she felt like he was spending too much time with me and my kids.

He said that he was concerned about me and that I should take care of myself more because I always left me last.

"My brother is 12 and the youngest of four, twin brothers (13) and myself, sister (18). I donat know when it started but mainly within the last year, it has gotten worse. Over small things, such as the Internet being turned off for bedtime or a stick being taken away from him at a park or basically when things donat go his way he gets severely angry. It has progressed from a short tantrum to now taking an hour to calm him down. He wonat talk, he just screams no matter what you say. He has recently started to be violent, starting drastically in the last 3-4 aepisodesa. He goes completely red in the face and his temperature goes through the roof and he sweats profusely. He is destructive towards anything, kicking doors/walls, breaking things off shelves, kicking stuff over. It can get to the point where he needs to be restrained and we canat leave him with himself. My mum is scared that people will take him away and that breaks her heart. We try and talk him down but itas getting worse and worsea (From Australia)",1

"I find myself increasingly disillusioned with society and with my peers.

"Some information one may need to fully assess this question is the girl in question was about 10-11 years old and the boy was about 11-12 years old. Basically the boy sibling demonstrated aggressive behavior in the household from hitting to throwing objects and the girl witnessed it. I learned in psychology that one can learn aggressive behaviors from an adult when young. I was wondering if the girl, now about 12 years old, is now showing aggressive behaviors did she learn it from her sibling? Can she be fully conscious that their actions are wrong, knowing she understands right from wrong fully, and be able to change her behavior? Or can one FULLY attribute her behavior to the behavior of the sibling and the way she was conditioned to aggression or does the she hold some accountability of their actions, based off that she understands right from wrong and does behave well in other settings?",1

"Iave progressively isolated myself due to underlying issues committed in childhood prior to overcoming a self-indulgent bout of negligent atheism, all the while hypothetically considering punishment to come in the afterlife (though never later in life, which was the largest sort of akarmica disregard). Should I be held to the standard of faith persevering through childhood regardless of my situational experiences that may have influenced me/made me sour? Probably. May this post-isolation, asocial behavior, and cognitive deceleration be overcome? My optimism says that with genuine help and love from another/few who is/are unpaid and not eager to jump to diagnoses while also being invested in my growth, it can and will be. My pessimism speaks on the idea that this pragmatism is often used to manipulate and regress.",1

I started being homeschooled at the end of 10th grade, because the school in my area was terrible. Iam extremely social online, just not in real life. Most days I stay in the house, along with what I described. Iave always wondered if doing this means thereas something wrong with me.

Mental health care can be expensive and I donat wanna waste anyoneas time if I donat actually need help.",1
"I was disabled as a child. When I was a child wearing cloth diapers became a comfort for me. Now as an adult I still like the soft, warm, comfort, and pleasure, I get from wearing a double cloth diaper and plastic pants at night or when I have the house alone.

I am going to be honest next time but donat know what to say? I also have a problem with washing diapers because my secret is not out. I feel like I am lying and hiding. This makes me feel fantastic and I do not know what to do?",1

"My parents really hate my boyfriend for the following reasons: 1. He had been with so many girls in his life, he even slept with them, he even cohabited with 2 of his girls in the past, and my parents cant stand it, that is why they hate him so much to the point of disowning me if I still choose him. 2.

"I wanted to understand the link between the upbringing of one , past experiences ,and past ideologies and how much it can affect ones current reasoning. Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience. For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past. In other words , a person who grew up in a religion , and changes his religion, can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past. In other words how much control do humans have to truly shape their reality based on their logic and not be biased based on any past experiences or at least not make a decison base on that fully.",1

We keep arranging for him to come here and he always seems willing but each time there is a reason that he can not.

"I recently came to the realization that all my life, since maybe 8 years old, I have been micro-harming my body. I bit my lips when I was younger, possibly the first of these occurrences. I would seriously go at them, biting and scabbing, never giving them a chance to heal. Then I remember biting/clipping off my cuticles. Something Iave been doing for years is flossing WAY too hard, on purpose. I have floss sticks so I purposely make my gums bleed, literally cutting out parts of my gums (none of this is severe, all on a amicroa level like I said). Another one is always picking at my scalp, again purposely creating scabs and picking at them. Sorry for the graphics, but I am so curious as to why I am doing this. Is it a nervous release?

He is a brilliant and completely selfless person who simply does what he has to do to get by. Heas the type of father every child deserves.

My mom also goes on travel a lot with her ajoba but I believe she is really going to see him! Plus, I eaves dropped on their conversation and she was telling him that she loved him, that she couldnat wait to see him, and even worse, at the end of the conversation she said aI love you.a I just can not look at her the same way, I want to scream, tells someone, but Iam afraid she will lie.

I have to mostly buy food and drinks when we go out. I do not mind, but if he does buy me something he takes it back if he is annoyed. If he does buy a gift he expects me to give him one in return. I do not enjoy going shopping with him as it always ends up with us arguing. He then points out I donat buy him anything. He does not live with me, but stays every night with me. I have a family to take care of and he does not hardly contribute. But now when he does decide to contribute, he eventually takes it back, even if it is just bread.

"Growing up, I never thought I would be in a long term relationship. I thought maybe Iad have some boyfriends, but nothing serious, I never wanted to get married, have kids, etc. I think part of it was how I was raised- my parents never wanted me to depend on a man, and my mom was a pretty staunch feminist who discouraged me getting involved with boys. Even as I got older, she frequently disapproved of my relationships. But more than that they stressed that I should take care of myself and put me first. Itas helped me be independent and goal-oriented, but sometimes I wonder if itas also made me a bit selfish and unsuitable for relationships.",1

I am a 35 year old woman and going through a depressing phase of my life. I have been married for over 10 years now and have two young sons. I have known my husband since our school days and we were good friends for about 4-5 years and then our friendship transitioned into a relationship from which he eventually backed out in fear of his mother. But eventually not any significant reasons known to me proposed me later for marriage for which I also agreed as I was in love with him. To me most probable reasons for him proposing me 1. he felt guilty towards me 2. He eventually thought me best suitable out of the proposals he received for marriage and as he knew that I loved him might have thought me to be submissive to him and follow him blindly for whatever he says.,1

One of the girl (very petite) was taking time to get out of the car and he suddenly picks her up and moved her out of the car.

For example: the other day at kindergarten she stood holding here cup in the kitchen, until the teacher noticed that she was just waiting there, instead of saying she wants a drink or she walked up to the teacher and showed here left over sandwich and wouldnat tell the teacher she finished or wants to throw it away, the teacher had to ask here a few guessing questions to which she would nod to until she guessed the right one.",1
"I feel I am far too old to be grappling with this at this point in my life. I have a 2 year old, a newborn, a beautiful wife, a mortgage, and am a recent graduate from law school. I canat stop lying though. The lying has always been for remedial things (telling people I played football when I was really in the marching band, etc.), but it has now infiltrated into all areas of my life. I have lied about past successes in school, work, faith, and general areas of character and integrity. I have been in sales for about 6 years now and I lie to customers about successes, mistakes that I have made, personal accomplishments, etc. I have most recently been caught by my boss lying about making a sales call I really didnat make, and almost lost my job over it a over something he really wouldnat have even cared about! I have a wife, a 2 year old, and a newborn who all depend on me, and I feel like Iam selfishly regressing.",1

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 3 years, and plan on being together for a very long time. A few weeks after we became intimate he told me about his golden shower fetish, but told me that he was only interested in it because of his ex and that he no longer did it. I later found out that it wasnat true and that his fetish started long before his ex was even in his life. I tried to understand it, and even did it sometimes for him, but now itas at the point where he only wants me to be the one to do it, and he doesnat even like watching ahis videosa anymore. Iam not into the idea at all. It turns it and me completely off makes such a mess!

"Well for over the years ive been obssesing with people and all of them were women, an older women, since i was a young teen. I dont know why i get obssesed with them maybe because i see them as a mother figure. Some of them took me years to finally get over it and others only just a short period of time.

"It seems to have come to pass that I have lost all ability to feel emotions, other than a certain amount of anxiety and self loathing. Also, the feelings that tend to flood over you unexpectedly, which I can recall, like waking up on a Sunday and feeling a rush of comfort being all tucked up in your bed when its raining outside, mystical feelings that you get sometimes walking through nature, kind of feeling the avibea of a room or when youare in a crowd, any of those things that canat necessarily be classified as emotion, but seem to be more of a spiritual connection between mankind and reality. Those beautiful buzzing feelings.",1

He always promises us that he will never ever do it again and that he has realised his mistake , but a couple weeks later he brings home something that is not his. He has so far been caught at a grocery store where he was forgiven, stole from me at home to buy few books. All our efforts have been futile.

"My heart stopped feeling and my life has not been the same since then. I am an 18-year-old girl. Earlier this year I broke up with my boyfriend that I was with since I was 14. This break up came as a great shock and I went through a lot of pain. Two months later my godson of only 10 months dies. His death hit me hard because he is the first close family member Iave lost to death. He was my pillar of strength and the reason that I kept going even though I was broken into pieces so when he left everything changed. My heart shut down and I became spiritually confused. I havenat cried in 5 months now and I donat remember the last time I felt something genuinely. I hate who Iave become even though in a way it saved me from any pain. How do I become okay again? And if I do will the feelings for my ex still be there because I never really got over him? And what happens if Iam stuck like this forever? (From Namibia, South Africa)",1
"Iam an only child, and have always been an introvert. For the most part I enjoy being by myself, but it can get really lonely at times. I have been in few relationships since my middleschool days, and most recently, a year long long distance relationship. She lives in California, me in Massachusetts. We just came to the conclusion that things cannot work out between us at this stage in our lives, being so far apart. She really dreads the distance and wants someone close by to constantly do things with, and who am I to deny her that? It would be selfish. I just want to throw in here that we did meet in person, twice, and it was the most amazing 10 days each visit, that I had ever spent with someone in a LONG time. There was no shyness involved even when I was meeting her for the first time as we had been constantly talking over the computer and phone for months.",1

These photos contained him and another women (selfies, dinner together and shopping). I was and am completely furious.

He told me at that time he got people off the street to take the photos and I naively believed him.",1
"My girlfriend and I relocated together to California and, as I got a great job, she said she could work from anywhere with her job, as it is commission based. In the last 3 years, she has not been able to contribute to the expenses for anything. She does cook every night for my 2 sons, does the shopping and some lite cleaning.

I sometimes love them too much and other times I just canat stand being around them. When I start to feel irritated by my some of my friends I immediately decide that I wonat talk to them ever again, but I always feel guilty about these feelings because I have no real reason to feel this way.

She commands me to tell her I love her even when I just said it and then tells everyone I refuse to but everyone just heard me.

"I have been having this aproblema for a while. Initially I didnA t think it was bad, I just thought it was part of my personality. However, I have seen, for a few years, that it is an obstacle. I donA t seem to understand feelings. I know, in theory, what they are, but when i have to interpret them or understand why they are happening, I get confused and frustrated. I have emotions and feelings, that much I know. I usually see the world in a more logical manner, as much as possible, but i canat run from feelings and when an emotional situation occurs (with me or others) i try to put it together but itas too complex for me, which I think itas odd because other people around me comprehend them so easily. For example, I know how anger, happiness, etc, looks like, but in a real-life situation, I canat understand them or why people express them with such ease. Maybe itas a skill that I should have learned when I was a kid? Should I tell someone? (from Portugal)",1

Just this morning, I went to a restaurant and as usual got super stressed that there were no vegan options. Then, the breaking point, I looked up and saw a deer head on the wall and that moment, felt so stressed and sad. I immediately began hyperventilating and my eyes filled with tears.

He can sound quite normal in some situations, until you manage to catch a comment that is off the wall.",1

I would immediately know when it was coming on, it sort of felt like I was starting to feel someone elseas emotions who was trapped and frightened and very desperate.

I will be very thorough as that is what needs to be done to understand me. I live with a single mother, and my younger sister. My father abandoned us when I was 3 years old which I never got over.

"Ever since I was little Iave never fit in. I didnat have any friends at school besides family members. I did have an invisible friend, but I hardly ever went out to recess. I always stayed inside and read books at the library. But it never bothered me that much. Also I had a problem that my sister(she doesnat live with me) mentioned I had when I was little. I would always repeat what another person said to me, not to be snarky, but I just couldnat help it. I researched this a little bit and I now know it to be echolalia. I also enjoyed picking at dead skin. I was moved up to magnet schools (for highly intelligent childrenaor thatas what they said), but I still didnat fit in.",1
"I have a friend who we call each other abest friendsa;. however she is not really open to me. I have invited her to meet my family around 5 times. always rejecting and coming up with excuses. I invited her again for the last time hoping it would be fine to meet my cousin and sister at a restaurant. so it would only be us 4. She replied in a sad tone (voice message) saying her heart is beating fast, shes anxious, shaking and nervous, there is going to be too much people, she doesnat know anyone (although its only me, my sister and cousin). i told her she always goes to restaurants and meets people but whats the problem with this? She wouldnat tell me whatas wrong and we ended up fighting. She told me to google it for an answer. I googled and only thing i could come up with is social anxiety. she said no. however I have no idea what the issue is. Can anyone help? btw we have been friends for around a year.",1
Last week my partner rung me because he was stuck at work and could I pick him up? I had just finished work myself and was just sinking onto the sofa so I said Iad rather not Iam so tired a can someone there drop you home? He said head asked and we hung up. About a minute later I called him back and apologized of course I would pick him up a I felt awful that I had even hesitated. My issue now is that I canat get past my initial reaction despite the fact that my response was a positive one. What I want to know is which is a true indication of me as a person? I canat seem to find a satisfactory answer online to is it your reaction or your response that denotes your values and morals. I feel awful that my first reaction was to be selfish and I feel that shows who I really am. Thanks,1

I noticed that I tend to avoid eye contact with others whether they are good friends of mine or a family member. I try to but always feel my eyes wet and irritated. Most of the times I canat hold a normal conversation (I talk to others but not as much as Iad like to) and feel that Iam lacking concentration or donat give enough attention to others and what they are telling me. On the other hand I often wake up feeling down(sad) and actually donat want to communicate with anyone else. I used to think Iam just a shy person but I realised it could be something more. Iam 19 so shouldnat it be like a second nature to me?,1

"distorted thinking, amplified emotions, & daily crying spells. As opposed to the same class of more recent anti-psychotics, such as Seroquel, I am tolerating this one very well a with the exception of weight gain. I have been dieting & exercising in an effort to eliminate or decrease this side effect, but have still already gained 5 pounds! Iad like to know if this side effect will subside as my body gets acclimated to it, or with time. I discontinued the others because this is the one side effect which I will not withstand. I discontinued the others due to this reason. If the answer is no, then should I try the older anti-psychotics, such a Haldol? Do they cause weight gain, too? Will the other drugs help my symptoms? Iad appreciate your opinion. My psychiatrist says he isnat sure about my concern, since the medication is so new. Thanks in advance.",1

I am a single mother with a 9 year old son with ADHD. I have been raising him on my own with little to no help from his father since he was born. 2 years ago I met my boyfriend who has terminal cancer. My boyfriend and I have a great relationship except we canat see eye to eye on the way I raise my son.

Iam 14 years old and recently Iave been worried about some problems. And I blame myself for all that knowing that I can hurt somebody. When I was 13 I didnat know about all the paraphilias that existed and never thought of anything related to it but I had an experience with my dog. I never forced or touched my pet in any way and it lasted a few seconds until I realized it was bad and never did it again. Also sometimes I tend to watch people in their private parts. now that Iam aware of the consequences I avoid doing it cause I can affect other people and also myself. I know watching people like that is normal during adolescence but I canat help feeling guilty. Do I have a problem or do I need help about this experiences?,1

If the law says you canat force someone to go to the doctor and get helpahow do you get them help. My mom has suffered from bipolar mania for years. We know because the first time she had it when they had the ambulance take her because she hadnat slept for 7 days the doc said it was bipolar. No episode for years then for about the last 4 years she has had at least 1-3 episodes per year. Now itas getting more frequent. She in in major denial. Weave even set up doctor appointments and she made us cancel. At 71 I donat think her body can take the level the mania is putting her through. Is there a way to force help on her? How do we address it to her when she is in denial? Do we wait to have the conversation when she is not manic or during manic? HELPaWE ARE AT THE END OF OUR ROPE.,1

"The other day my family and I were out at a restaurant, and this child in the booth behind us kept screaming and yelling and wouldnat stop. Around the third time he yelled I had an image flash in my head of me strangling and then cutting up the child. I felt an immense anger for some 5 seconds. Then after that, the thought faded and I was very emotionally detached for the rest of the dinner. I felt no emotion whatsoever and said nothing. I had no urges to do anything but sit and stare at the table. I donat know why I had such a violent thought, or strange feeling after. I did not act on my thought (just to be clear).

I am very impulsive sometimes I found myself buying a very expensive dress. Now life seems very purposeless I was loving my teacher but now he is not my teacher anymore thatat why I closed myself to the other boys but I also closed myself to the girls.

"I have been married to a woman for thirty two years and I have been persevering with what I consider to be some very serious problems. She has a very unusual lack of and often times a total absence of empathy, sympathy and understanding for even her friends and those closest to her including myself. She is a fair weather friend. Sheas your buddy until you need her help and she stands her friends up without so much as a phone call. I have seen two friends of hers at different times become temporarily bed ridden and ask for her aid at which time she completely abandoned them and never saw them again. I was ill for 9 moas and unable to work, She consulted a lawyer and tried to have me thrown out of the house, sick with no job. When trying to discuss a marital issue she cannot bear the suggestion that she is doing something wrong and becomes defensive, angry and sometimes vicious, so when thereas a problem then I just have to live with it. She has a very unusual lack of remorse and was very cruel to the little dog we once had.",1

"Hello, I am on here regarding a recent introspection I seem to be having of myself. I am no expert, I havenat a PhD, but Iave noted over the past year my emotions have become more and more dull. I rarely feel bad about hurting other people emotionally and physically, in fact, the other day I almost bludgeoned my sister with a hammer. I only pretend to be apologetic. I get an adrenaline rush instead of guilt, and the lines between fear and excitement in my mind have become blurred. Iam still doubtful though because I am a sadomasochist, I like to get hurt as well as hurt people. Iam not completely emotionless, I cry (albeit over selfish reasons). I get angry. I laugh. I know how to act nice as well, everyone who is not close to me can rarely discern my intentions. At certain times I can make myself feel a certain way. I am still a teenager so maybe I am in way over my head, but I am reaching 18 soon, and I fear I will let this part of me consume my being.",1
Iam 16 and I am going through extreme guilt and regret over 3 incidents. Once when I was 9 years and was going through little inspection of my cousin sisteras (6 years) private part while playing doctor. Rest 2 when I was 10 or 11 years old. I went to my grandmaas home where my cousin sister who was 6 or 7 years came we were playing a game in which I was mother and she was the child. When it was the time to feed the baby we thought we would act like breast feeding (and at that time we had no boobs at all). In one chance I was the mother and in another she. After few months when we met again she told to play that game again but I refused . I worry if she would tell her mom and put entire blame on me(as I was the older one) and then they would call the police and I would be called an abuser.,1
"Iave been seeing the best therapist Iave ever worked with for almost three years and, in that time, heas helped me significantly, including with coming out as trans and gay and gaining confidence to date and try out relationships. Iave been on several dates with a great guy who is also trans and gay and we just discovered that we see the same therapist. I would say the chances were slim but my therapist is out as a queer man and many of his clients are queer. Additionally, as Iam out socializing more, trying new bars and parties, and meeting more people, I realize that my therapist and I will likely be running in similar circles.",1
"Hi, Iave had this problem for 4 months itas been 24/7, but things have all of a sudden felt like everything is getting like fast forwarded or rushed like I sat in a dressing room for an 1 hour and it felt like 30 minutes I donat know whatas wrong with my perception of time is there any way to fix this??? And I feel very emotionally numb like Iall laugh but I wonat feel anything. and words on boards seem blurry to me even though Iave never had reading issues like maybe not blurry just that my mind canat quite comprehend. I know I have depersonalization but are some of these problems something else",1
Everyday I wake up Iam angry. If I donat wake up angry something small may happen and Iam mad for the entire day.

Iave been having a lot of thoughts that come from a voice that doesnat sound like me. This, as you can imagine, has given me some concerns for my mental-well-being. My biggest problem, however, is that I donat know how to talk to my parents about my concerns. I feel as though my dad would just laugh at me, and say you are a moron which is what he usually does when I ask him for help on other things. I just donat know who to talk to, or how to see a professional if I canat even ask my dad.",1
I donat think I have the right to be sad because my life is great compared to most but I donat feel happy. I have no one to talk to and I feel like my mind is just full with different problems. I donat go to regular school because I constantly feel like I donat fit in or my self esteem gets in the way.. Iam confused with what is wrong with me or if there is even anything wrong with me.

So far I am in a firm control of these compulsions, they never slip in public. But when I am alone, sometimes I justacant. And its like something overtakes my body while I just scream internally. Its like my own mind is trying to imprison my consciousness in a prison while replacing it with raving lunacy, while I fully realize what I am doing and what is happening around me, but am too deep to regain control. My therapists and psychiatrist do not believe me and keep convincing me that I am just making stuff up. I dont know how to convince them to take me seriously. Lately I have been considering hurting myself badly, just to prove them that I am serious. But It seems ridiculous to me.

This sapped her confidence and in turn, her desire to compete. She has a natural talent that has gotten her to the place where she is. Now, she has to put in the work to compete against the girls at her level. If she did put in the work, she would dominate.

In reality, she still does well, but just not placing within the top 3 like she used to.",1

Plus she got me to dig deep, where we were not exactly at a great spot to end. But, I was afraid of this next thing happening, and it did. Today in my session, it went fine but then towards the end,my therapist got quiet, so I didnat know if I was supposed to talk or not. When I started to, she said, okay tell me but then we have to end, because I need to be somewhere. I donat know if she was making sure I knew last week was rare, or if she thought I disrespected her, took advantageA etc. Now, MY ANXIETY IS THROUGH THE ROOF. I donat know what to do.

"Hi there, my son has been alienated by his father for the last 13 months. It took for the Guardian ad Litem to enforce my ex-husband to put our child in counseling. I have wanted this since the day that my cousinas daughter taped him confessing that he did everything because his dad and step-mom told him to. My question to you is, how in the world would 3 counseling sessions even do anything for my child? He was released after 3 sessions by a counselor who said that my son is smart. Is this even possible? To help a 12-year old get through this and just diagnose him as being smart? My child is not dumb and knows how to play both myself and his father. Thank you!",1

She would also bully me and exclude me in class. She would also tell me that I was a lesbian and another boy would also tell me this as well. It really hasnat had much of an effect of me (I havenat talked to any adult about it) but I have come to the conclusion now that Iam gay, but I donat know if I just think I am because of this and itas just my reaction to it or if I actually am.

I am at a loss. I donat know what to do. I now have her sleeping in my room to make sure sheas safe. She said she feels safe, but Iam unbelievably concerned.

I havenat told anyone as Im worried that they will say that I need to let my dad know and I donat want to break up the family, and worried that they will judge me for keeping it a secret for so long, but she is having more and more of these phone calls, and i really donat know what to do.

"Iam a 15-year-old female. The past 6 months of my school life and sleep schedule have been deteriorating to me physically, but recently it seems like my emotions have been going haywire too. I used to get 8-9 hours of sleep nightly, but have now gotten 4-5 hours of sleep for the past 5 months and have been holed up in my room doing homework more than ever.",1
"More and more I find I have been having murderous thoughts. I donat even have to know the people I kill in my mind, sometimes they are complete strangers but I still feel a specific rage towards them that compels me to think of their gruesome end. My thoughts also progress in gruesomeness. For example around 5th grade my thoughts would just be putting someone in a punching bag and punching them till all your anger is out. But around 8th grade my thoughts were more along the lines of like cutting each finger one by one and slowly and dipping the personas hand into salt water to increase the pain. And in 9th grade, my thoughts were more like cutting and scraping the living flesh off the bones while the person is alive and fully conscious. Most of the times I even laugh at my thoughts because I can see them suffer. My friends think I need help.",1
"Hello. When I was little, my dad used to pin me on the bed to pull my underwear down and bite my bum until it bruised, all the while I kicked and screamed. I wasnat able to sit down at times afterward. I also have brief flashbacks to when I was left home alone with him. He would call out my name in a high-pitched voice to sound like my mum, and he would get me to go in the bathroom. From where our toilet was positioned, I could see him fully. He would laugh when I went in and turn to me (still exposed). The flashback ends there, but I get this sick feeling about it. I donat remember leaving the bathroom, and I remember him doing this more than once. I also remember someone opening my bedroom door, and I would pretend to be asleep. Thatas as far as that memory goes. A lot of the time at night I would listen through the wall, but I donat know why.",1
"Ever since the day I was born, Iave always had problems expressing my thoughts and getting out what I wanted to say. I often write notes rather than talk to people because itas hard for me to put in words what I want to say. This makes me seem kinda dumb and crazy. The deal, is that, while in school, I am taking a lot of classes that deal with speaking and yes, Iam unfortunately unseasoned. As I am in a sociology class, how I can express to the class in a lecture how on Herbert Spencer and the functioning of society. Donat get me wrong, I am of popularity at my high school, and have many friends but I really canat even to them express what I want to say and it feels like Iam from another planet.",1

"Iall keep it brief. Iam 14 and a girl and Iave recently started having really scary thoughts about being a pedophile. I really donat think I am at all, but I keep having thoughts that convince me that I am, and then I convince myself that Iam not, and then the cycle repeats. Iave mentioned this to my mom and she told me that she would support me no matter what, but that I am NOT a pedophile. That comforted me. I just want to stop the cycle of thinking about me being a pedophile and it ruining my life because I feel like itas making me more and more anxious. Just to be clear, I am like 90% sure that Iam not, but I need help. I want to make sure that Iam not a pedophile and I want to stop thinking about it!",1

I knew something was special with us, but being young, didnat really know what to do about it. Since she has come back into my life, I have been seeing her every once in a while, and emailing each other every day for over the past year.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 months and itas really been getting serious and weare in a long distance relationship. I met his family and friends and they absolutely love me. He met my family and friends and they absolutely love him. Before I met my boyfriend I used to smoke pot on and off. Then I decided to quit and he said aThatas great, but if you were to continue my feelings for you would be the same.a I still quit anyways. Then a few weeks ago I smoked with some friends to relieve the stress in my life and I hadnat talked to my boyfriend at all that week. So I told him about it because I love him and I tell him everything. When I told him, he flipped out on me and said I was a liar and deceitful and that his opinion of me had lessoned. Then he ended the conversation by saying aI need to think about where weare going.a",1
"Iave started dating someone recently and Iave realized that we are fairly bad at it since we canat really seem to get into very personal topics. We met through a mutual friend almost a year ago, starting chatting on social media a few months ago and texting. Even though in the beginning personal topics were discussed, weave talked mostly about non-personal stuff, which I was okay with since I wanted to save them for face to face discussions. Last time we were out by ourselves, nothing happened, it just left me with a strange feeling. Also Iam now leaving it up to him to propose going somewhere, will see if it happens. Next time we have the opportunity to talk, what questions should I ask or what should I talk about? How do we get into personal conversation and avoid or at least reduce irrelevant garbage? Thank you.",1

"This is a non-life threatening or dangerous in any way problem, but I simply donat know how I feel about someone and itas been bugging me a lot. Basically I met someone who I very much admire, to the point where I want to be more like that person, I always find it enjoying to talk to him and am personally proud of knowing him and being his friend, despite the fact that Iam not sure whether he considers me a friend or not. I genuinely want to get to know him more and spend more time talking to him, despite not knowing how to go about that (but thatas another issue). I also highly value his opinion and advice, and I trust him a lot for some reason. Iam also overwhelmingly sure itas not something romantic and I struggle to even find a word to describe what I feel towards him: admiration, respect, friendship?",1

Recently Iave been trying to stop by plowing my head into my studies (small success, but like any old habit, it wonat go down without a fight). Theyare weird scenarios I come up with, or sometimes I just pretend the people are there listening to me while I talk to them. Sometimes I even pretend they respond. Is this normal?",1

I started obsessing with thoughts like ayou know youare a horrible persona and aif you canat save a bug how can you expect to be seen as kinda. I tried hard to get it out but I couldnat do it.

I always find myself having a conversation with at most four figures, I say afiguresa because no oneas actually around me, I always hear a response and yes I can see them-visually speaking.

Iam not sure what steps are appropriate to take in this regard. Can I take a no contact order, which includes third party informants, out on a therapist?

I donat know if this have something to do with it but as a kid I was very angry who seemed calm. When someone would annoy me I would just hurt them out of no where, I wouldnat have remorse for them when I did this, I would just examine their crying faces and try to see what was happening with them. Almost like they were my lab rats and I was the scientist experimenting. I need help.",1
"First I will give you some background on myself. I am female, 25, married, stay at home mom to my two kids, who are ages 5 and 2. I have an issue, and I hope you can give me some information as to why this might be happening. Ever since I was 16, Iave talked to myself. I will literally create scenarios and HAVE to act them out, even speaking out loud. I will create other individuals in the scenarios with me. Sometimes these individuals can be famous people and sometimes they are people from my past. Most scenarios are situations that arenat something that would actually happen in my real life, such as me being an actress. These scenarios can last anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour. And once the scenarios / talking begins, I become occupied by it and it comes first on my list at that time. Iall even put it before my daily chores. Iave tried researching this and havenat had any luck. I hope you can help. Thanks!",1
My girlfriend and I have been in a long term relationship and have been living together the past 8 months and moving on better even after all my mistakes prior to living together.,1
"A loved one is suffering from mutism since experiencing a traumatic event. She is not talking at all. Not to family. Not to anyone. I have been looking online and it seems selective mutism is an anxiety problem. She is also listless, does not engage in activities that she normally has before this, does not eat or sleep well, and seems distressed when she has to leave the house or be without the company of a family member. What is the best course of action to getting her back to her old self and over this issue? I think therapy might help but not if she is not talking. I also do not want to make her talk if she is not ready to talk but this is not normal. Thanks for your time.",1
"I have plenty of friends, but I feel very alone. I feel like a constant disappointment to my parents, and I donat know how to feel comfortable with them. Iave been eating really really badly and Iave been having a stomach ache for a couple of days this week. Iave been procrastinating to the point where i rarely do my homework. Also, I love doing theater, yet i havenat been able to get into the mindset of memorizing lines. Is this just the season, a phase in my growing up, or is something legitimately wrong with me?",1
"The inability to finish a task has got to be the one aspect of my personality I am simply failing to cope with. Through the years I have been able to learn and adapt myself so I can function in a small measure, but this bleeding away of my motivations has become unmanageable.",1
"So I started talking to myself when I was about 6 or 7. Iave always felt a little bit psychic. Which has nothing to do with this I think. But everytime, a week before a loved one of mine dies, without notice. I get a dream, which I wake up crying and the dream tells me I should start treating this person right, and outta nowhere. EXACTLY a week later the person dies. On from that, I have always talked to myself.",1
" I have been married to my husband for 5 yearsaand we have 2 kids together. Recently, I discovered that he was on the computer looking up his ex girl friendas web page. He was engaged to his ex girlfriend for 3 years and then he discovered she was cheating on him and they split up. My husband tried his best to get her back but I guess she did not want to come back and decided it was over. However they both wrote emails to each other, even while my husband and I were dating. Now she is married to some other guy. My husband had saved her web page on his favorites. I had no idea he would do something like this and it has really upset me. I canat help it but I donat trust him anymore. He keeps saying he didnat contact her, but I find that hard to believe. I want to leave him. Do you think that is that the right thing to do??",1
"I think I need to be more careful about what I share.A  I recognize that I shouldnat email my therapist between appointments, because its asking her to work for free and I should be able to deal with things myself.A  I want to take things slowly and ease back into therapy.A  What do you think?",1
My 9 year old daughter does not want to listen at all. When she doesnat get her way she says everybody hates her. Iave made many attempts to improve the situation and none of the actions Iave tried seem to be working. I have tried taking away things. I have tried positive reinforcement. What should I do????? She is acting out in school almost every day. She even talks back to adults. I have lost control.,1
"I need advice on this subject pretty urgently because I canat seem to get it out of my mind and it makes me feel like giving up completely. This probably isnat the place but I donat know where else to put this a a Most recently I had a bad week and came into my therapy session that I had written down on the calendar , only to be told I wasnat scheduled that day for an appointment. I wasnat feeling great anyway day and honestly I could have probably declared an emergency and talked to someone in emergency servicesaBut I decided against that ,since the girl at the counter told me I could wait and see if the next appointment showed up or not and I would see my therapist if they didnat show . So I waited awhile I was waiting really heavy thoughts started getting to me and I kept repeating it was all my fault this happened in my head aitas always my fault a.i should die a Stuff like that ..I worked myself into a emotional state.",1
"My wife and I have been married about two years, and had dated two years before that. Prior to getting married, wead discussed our plans for having children many times, and it was clear that children were more of a priority for me than they were for her. Before marrying we agreed that we would have a single child, but not before we were both done with graduate school and settled into permanent jobs. This seemed to me like a very responsible and reasonable compromise, and I happily agreed.",1
"So to start from the beginning, Iam overweight and have a very bad relationship with my mother. My mother is honestly perfect in everyoneas eyes, where as I am her dull, uglier daughter. So even though she supports me most of the time when it comes to weight etc, she canat stand me. Sheall constantly mutter how Iam disgusting to look at and that she canat see me and all that. Then we have these huge fights, and even if I accidentally show her Iam crying or whatever sheall ask me to stop being dramatic etc.",1
"So, I just wondered in your professional opinion if it is either maybe me going crazy or if there may be a chance (obviously I know thereas always a chance), but if there maybe an actual high likelihood my sister may be sociopathic. I think its important to note that Iave looked at quite a few signs, but havenat been able to come to a conclusion for years now.",1
"In the past two weeks my ex girlfriend and I of 27 yrs have started getting along well, she is friendly and polite when I visit her. She responds to my phone calls and texts quickly and always makes herself available to me. She told me last night that she feels sad when I leave her to go home and that I should be staying at her apt but I blew it. I let her down once too often.",1
"My wife and I are almost 30. Weave been married for two years, and I can count on my fingers the amount of times I have had a peaceful time with my wife. Here again are the holidays and all hell is breaking loose, evidenced by the finger scratch marks on the side of my neck from a fight last night. I have been faithful to my wife, i have tried to take care of things around the house to the best of my ability but she is constantly unhappy- says aIam not happy.a",1
"We met when he is doing his exchange at my uni. We hung out for a couple of weeks before deciding that we will officially date and then break up when he goes back his home country. When he went back, we had minimal contact until one day, he told me that he was seeing someone else. I then told him that I canat keep in contact with him anymore because it isnat healthy. He immediately broke contact with the other person and started to text me everyday.",1
"We have been together for 3 years and neither have us have ever cheated before we have always been so faithful and loved each other so much, I know that he had taken drugs before and Iam not ok with it so he has always hidden it from me ,",1
"My parents have been married for around 18 years and about one year ago they havenat seen eye to eye. My dad is a type of teacher who teaches people about having positive attitudes, etc. Heas started trying to make everything opptimistic in his life, but thereas some conflict with my mother. Sheas often pessimistic and only thinks about how thingas effect her. She always blames people for things that go wrong, even if itas out of thier control. Plus, she rarely blames herself. My mom is very resistant to change and doesnat like to do anything new. Though, she sometimes does different things. Sheas very possesive of her things and doesnat like to share. My mom always has to be in control and know everything, even though she doesnat tell us everything. She takes after her father who has a simualar personality. Anyways, my parents havenat been getting along and Iam worried that things will end badly. My mom has said she will try to change, but I havenat seen any improvement. What should they do or what can I do?",1
"My Stepdad is crazy. He hasnat done anything to hurt me physically, but just today he said, and I quote. aI hope you end up weighing 300+ pounds.a This made me think back on so many things, he would sometimes insult me on other matters like how aIgnoranta I am. He is the one to talk, the man smokes and drinks, even though he is completely aware of the consequences, he downs sweets like I down water, and I only ever feel safe when he isnat around.",1
"Iave been dating someone I care, but something is severely wrong. He said he loved immediately after we met and became hyper attached, obsessed with me. He was very jealous and would accuse me of cheating if I went out with friends and didnat text for a few hours. I managed to calm down his jealousy and to his credit, he stopped worrying about much 2 months into the relationship.",1
"My husband does not handle stress well. He works at home and at times when I call him, he jumps down my throat and yells at me for bothering him. At other times I may just ask him a simple question and he answers me nastily.",1
"I do definitely find teenager girls attractive (16 and up mostly) and as far as my research goes there is nothing biologically wrong with it (itas a grey area in terms of social and legal issues though), plus research shows that many men respond with arousal to teenagers, they just donat pay as much attention to it as I do due to fears of being a pedophile.",1
"For quite some time now, Iave had this overwhelming sense of emptiness as if something about myself was somehow off kilter. Everyday I go through the same self-scrutinizing process. Waking up, awhat the hellas wrong with me?a Showering, awhy am I such an awful person?a Brushing my teeth, aDamn, my conscience is seriously a hot mess right now.a You get the idea. This vicious circle is pretty much part of my everyday routine. The scariest thing by far was my recent revelation of my sociopathic behavior. Yeah, Iave tried to justify why I do the things I do, but itas a waste of time. Deep down, I donat believe my petty justifications anyhow. Itas pretty futile and silly to lie to your conscience, but I digress.",1
"My husband does not handle stress well. He works at home and at times when I call him, he jumps down my throat and yells at me for bothering him. At other times I may just ask him a simple question and he answers me nastily. He has a lot of good qualities, does a lot for me and does a lot around the house, but he does not know how to control himself. He gets all worked up over little things. I believe he needs to be on medication but he wonat take it. He also has anxiety. He doesnat cuss at me but the way he talks to me makes it hard for me to be loving and intimate. He will apologize later but will do it again. He wonat go to counseling. How do I stop this?",1
My Sister got divorced about 2 years ago from a very angry man who she was married to for about 40 years. She lived in fear for a couple of years. She has since the divorced been to a few doctors about this bug thing and feels that no one believes her. She did have a mold problem in the place she moved to. I am totally confused as to how to deal with this. She has now added sleep walking to it and is doing things while sleep walking. She even let herself out of the house recently. What do I do? Any advice?,1
"I believe, and my family members also believe, that I was suffering from serious paranoid delusions for years. I also had repetitive physical movements that I couldnat control, and some hallucinations. I came out of it spontaneously, without medication two and a half years ago.",1
"My husband is unpredictable, violent & uses highly abusive language very often and even spits on my face. At the same time he enjoys a very good status both professionally & personally. He is highly qualified. His profession is very much responsive in nature towards society. He is a journalist in press media. Unpredictable ?a? My husband, me & four other in-laws family members were taking walk after taking meal at night. My husband slapped me at my shoulder, lovingly. So did I. Again he did the same. (The same I did. He acted the same again.) But this time when I did, he got aggressive & forcefully pressed my neck with his hand & pushed me aside. The whole situation / environment became tense & horrified. Everyone present there thought that my husband was kidding with me.",1
"I feel as if I cant controle my emotions, I often get paniced and scared of thoughts and ideas that wont happen. In the past couple of years I have off and on had trouble with social anxiety and general anxiety. I suffered from panic attacks when I was in situations where I donat know people and am in a new environment.",1
"As long as I can remember, negative thoughts have seemed to take control of my mind completely. I never see myself living a happy or even peaceful life, I always imagine my parents, siblings and friends turning against me. I often think of skipping my home, family, studies and move to a different country where no one knows me. I know this seems like the thoughts of an average teenager but my imagination goes beyond this. Since I would hate to see my parents hurt, especially because of me, it is a constant thought in my mind that if my parents were dead I would do this and that. Sometimes in the past I have always thought of killing them my self.",1
I am 20 years old i have 2 kids (both boys) and I have a fiance.. our relationship has been up and down for the past 8 months. I have these uncontrollable outbursts with him. I say things that I donat mean to say. Our relationship is on edge right now. But I think it might be because of my birth control. I am taking yaza I have done a lot of thinking over the past few nights and I have been trying to figure out why I yell at him for stupid things.,1
"My wife and I have been married for 2 years. It is the second marriage for both of us. She has an 11 year old son and 14 year old daughter from a previous marriage. We have shared custody of the children along with her first husband; he has primary custody during the school year. We live in a different state from her first husband. The children travel occasionally during the school year to stay with us, and spend the summers with us. I have a good relationship with both of the children. When the children are in our home, the son frequently expresses strong reactions against sleeping in his own bed. He would prefer to sleep in our bed with his mother and me or on the floor next to us.",1
"About 3 years ago it all started with a full blown panic attack ! At the first time i didnat know what was happening to me so I drove to the emergency room. They told me that I was ok and it was due to stress.It was hard for me to believe it. Iam a mom of two beautiful little children (2 and 4) and yes I causes stress sometimes but I just could not believe that stress can cause something like that. In a short time I experienced everything from depersonalisation to derealization and even more. At first I thought I might have a brain tumour, or a stroke and I feard that I might have something with the heart. When the docs told me that I was ok, I believed them and my fears went away. But not the dp. This feelings made me think that I could be a danger for my kids and that I could harm them because it felt like I will lose touch with reality. I did a lot of Google research what was probably the worst thing I could do ! My intense fear of becoming schizophrenic was born!",1
"I am an 18 year old guy whoas been dealing with a lot of anxiety. Following a recent move, Iave begun to hear voices, sometimes in my head. Those ones tend to say very bad things about me. Sometimes outside of my head, which usually sounds like large crowds or whispers. These voices distract me all the time to the point where I have a hard time understanding what people are saying, or what I am reading. The part that bothers me the most, however, is the fact that I am unsure if I am just making these things up in my head to somehow punish myself. I cannot make them stop though, and the conflicting ideas of aIam making this upa and aI canat make them stopa causes me a lot of trouble and confusion.",1
"When I was around 7 years old I remember that my grandmother had made me sit in her lap and suck on her breast. I think this only happened once, but Iam not entirely sure. I know that we were alone in the room and she smiled at me while it was happening, but I donat remember her reaction or if she said anything. I was able to not think about what happened to me for a period of time, but I would still think about it sometimes, throughout the years, infrequently. Now that Iam 19 the memories have started to come back again and more frequently and I donat know why.",1
"Iam separated from my ex of 27 yrs, but still keep in regular touch, she has asked me to remain friends. Over the years my ex feels that Iave let her down too many times and has collected all of these thoughts together and is now very resentful of me.",1
"My boss gets scary and we donat know how to deal with him. It all comes across passive aggressively, weall be working and he complains that no one helps him clean, so we start cleaning and he complains that no one is doing their job. If we tell him weare running a few minutes late, he punishes us by saying we canat come to work at all that day, and then will complain the next day about how no one wants to come into work.",1
I feel that a large part of love is finding that person that you admire. A partner that can constantly energize you to do better just by the mere fact that you want to aspire to emulate them.,1
"Hi, I am 33 year old, mother of a 5 year old girl. I am married for 7 years. I was working till my daughter was born. Then I left my job to take care of my daughter. My husband is very good and understanding. I love him so much.",1
"When I met my boyfriend, it was an instant attraction on the phone. He was a friend of a friend and came highly recommended. When I met him finally it was an instant attraction in person. We both felt like it was just right. The glitch, to the perfect story comes a few months after we started dating. He misses dinner and a weekend we were supposed to have together and doesnat return my phone calls.",1
So I had been dating this girl for 2 years of high school. She is a senior in high school now and Iam a freshman in college. We went through the summer and decided we were going to try dating.,1
"I have been feeling unhappy for about two years now, but i have only just opened up to my mum about how i feel. The school have recommended i go seek help however my mum seems to be avoiding the subject of my mental health is there any way i could do something myself?",1
"I have worst case of white coat hypertension. Last time at Dr., BP was 167/106, HR 126. Thatas highest either has been in awhile. For years I just wouldnat visit a DR. b/c thought of having BP taken, heart auscultated, pulses palpated. Iam not scared of Dr.s or anything else for that matter. Iam not nervous. I hate public speaking and having my BP measured. HR and BP react identical to both scenarios. Trying to explain this bizarre affliction I say that I wouldnat be more nervous singing National Anthem, Live, at Super Bowl. Thatas no lie. Iam aging and have to visit Dr. from time to time. I went nearly a decade without anyone taking my BP or HR in clinical setting. A decade! That is how awful it made me feel. It used to be a terrible form of embarrassment. aIam a big strong guy, why would anything so silly as that make me nervous?a Having been to different docs over last 3-4 years, having some age to me, I donat mind telling nurse what the deal is, and my heart is racing and BP severely elevated.",1
"Iave recently been cut off from a couple of friends who I have romantic feelings for. I canat shut off my feelings for them and I was having regular panic attacks about it, so they no longer talk to me. We had been living together and they asked me to leave. Itas been three months and I canat stop thinking about them.",1
"Hello, Iam a girl from Middle East and I suffer a lot from everyone around me. I canat even start with the main issue. But its related to my parents and family. They seem not to love and support me. They even donat know my hobby and simple traits.",1
"for a long time now i have felt empty and bored with life, i have had no ambition or motivation to do anything, i always see how people have dreams and aspirations but i have no desire for anything, not even money can buy me happiness. i have one friend that im not allowed to hang out with.",1
Every time Iam left with nothing but my thoughts itas the same story. I have an extensive conversation with myself about everything negative about my life and it always leads to me trying to figure out whether or not I might actually have a problem. Almost all of my friends and family have some form of mental health issue and it puts a strain on me to attempt to decode whether or not Im just experiencing something normal or something that I need to deal with. Its exhausting. I went out one night to a bridge only to discover it had no sheer drop but was a long incline. I still dont know whether I actually wanted to leap off or if I was trying to prove to myself that i wouldnat do it and that I was just overthinking myself. In short. I have no idea whats going on in my head and I dont know what to do. Its hard to describe since i forget my thoughts until the next time im alone.,1
"For the last three years, I never felt right. I started to cut myself because I wanted to punish myself because I hated myself. I am a very insecure person and I have never like one thing about myself. I was able to stop for awhile but when something emotionally threatening occurs, I canat help but to hurt myself.",1
"I have been suffering from obsessive fears for 7 years now, however for one year I have developed an obsession about having anxiety during a special moment where I am supposed to be happy. Before a special exciting moment happens I get the thought of anxiety and immediately start panicking and dwelling on the thought, which in turn makes it worse.",1
"Three years ago I had a huge panic attack but didnat recognized it as such.I was scared that this is an Heart attack or a stroke. In the hospital the doctors told me that everything is ok and itas just due to stress.Two days later, the next panic attack followed and I was experiencing depersonalization and derealization. This feeling was so scary and I just felt like I was going absolutely nuts.I was so scared that I will lose control and that I could harm my kids.",1
"Iam a 25-year-old male attracted to 16-year olds. I thought this was normal since lots of men are into teen girls. 16 is the age of consent in my state. Recently, people were calling this person online a pedophile for being attracted to 17-year olds despite only being 20.",1
"A month or so ago my 16 year old son told me he thought he might be bipolar because he experiences intense feelings of rage over little things, like someone making a rude comment to him at school. We talked about it and I said I thought some of his feelings were normal and he needed to learn how to deal with those feelings, maybe use techniques such as relaxation and visualization when he got upset.",1
"Sometime before I was five, my dad left my mom and my mom passed me off on my grandparents. Since I was a child, my grandpa always screamed at me, beat me and told me how Iad always be a loser, a nobody, a ditch digger in prison and a druggie like my dad. I still see his face yelling those things to me till this day.",1
"My daughter is currently ten months old. Her legal father (L.F.) is not her biological father (B.F.). L.F. has played a very active role in raising her. He has taken on a paternal role since day one, and she has grown to call him dada. My daughter has never met B.F. However, L.F. has now decided that he does not want to be a part of her life. Is there any potential my daughter will experience any long-term adverse effects due to the sudden loss of the bonded relationship she has formed with L.F.?",1
"I have a question about the fit of my therapist. I have been seeing my for about a year and a few months. I have questioned the fit the entire time, but Iave really improved and and feel she is helping me so I always chalked it up to my issues as to why I am questioning the fit.",1
My husband and I were married in June. Eleven days ago I found out that he slept with his ex wife a amonth and a half agoa according to him. His ex-wife is the one who informed me of their affair.,1
"There are times where I feel completely fine emotionally, but Iall find myself thinking aI hate my lifea or aIam a worthless pice of crapa or something else along those lines.

"My large family is planning a reunion next summer and being with all of them is too anxiety provoking. I donat want to go. I love them, I just canat be with them all at once.

"I have recently discovered that my grandparent has been living a lie nearly all of her life. This grandparent has stated that her mother died when she was really young (which is true) and that her father died shortly thereafter (not true, he lived through to his 80as). She has stated that she was an only child but recently it has been uncovered that she had both an older sister and an older brother. When asked what nationality her family was, she will state Polish and French but through an ancestry blood dna test of us younger generations she practically fully Jewish. I found a lot of information, including a first cousin of my parent, through this dna test, as well as a birth certificate which shows that my grandmother is actually 4 years younger than she has said that she is for the last more than 70 years. Her birth name is completely different than the first name she has now. If it werenat for the dna test I never wouldave found out any of this information.",1
I am in a mild state of mania right now and am on manic spending sprees. This started a couple of months ago when I bought a whole new wardrobe which I needed because I have lost 77 pounds in the last year. This triggered my manic spending. I am totally out of control and have already racked up more than $2000 in credit card debt. I fear it will be a lot more if I canat stop. I cannot take antipsychotic drugs because I have tardive dyskinesia. I have seen therapists in the past but didnat feel like I was getting much help. I really need help. My husband doesnat know how much I am spending and I am terrified heall find out.,1
"I appreciate this service and wondered if any light could be shed on my problem. I find that in my life, I have often grown very attached and love my girlfriends dearly. I have always been the type of person who loves people and I am proud that I am kind, have great empathy, and am loving to all those around me. Many people love to be around me and I have never had a problem socially and can get along with just about anyone. I listen VERY well and am always absorbing what others say and I take everything seriously and really think about others when they speak to me. I have this personality because I value and take friendships very seriously.",1
"Firstly, I wonder about myself. There were times in the past when I decided to give it up, but I started looking at stuff again (the almost-entire majority of this thing was looking at pics/vids) and then that would continue for a while. I know I have to change. Itas either move forward on the path Iam on, or end up perpetuating a cycle that thrives on the exploitation of those who donat comprehend exactly how theyare being used. It seems like many things in my lifeamany grand ideasaget left behind like forgotten toys. I donat want that to happen with this. Iave heard of the recidivism rate of offenders and itas a bit daunting. My prime hope is the theraputic process. But Iave only had three sessions of psychotherapy and I donat have all that much money, so Iam worried that I have to skip appointments so I can pay my bills and such. Itas depressing.",1
"A therapist I saw for about 4 years when I was 18 has stayed in touch with me for the last 4 decades. She did things that were above and beyond therapy such as loaning me money when I finished college and relocated for work. She also shared her failing marriage with me, about 20 years ago. Sometimes she is very open and shares a lot, and other times she shuts down.",1
"My four-year-old daughter is an only child. We live in a wonderful community, and so she has always had plenty of time around adults and children of all ages. She has one girl cousin three years older than her whom she adores. When my daughter was two-and-a-half, my brother and his wife had a second child. Around this time, other friends began having second children.",1
"I want to live my life without all of the negative thoughts and worries. I want to enjoy life again rather than thinking of it as ajust having to get through ita. I have avoided going out with friends because I feel like it doesat matter if I go anyways, like nothing is missing if Iam not there because nobody seems to have noticed.",1
"For a long time Iave found it difficult to make friends despite trying really hard (joining many things where I have ongoing contact with the same people, local things, initiating further contact etc). Work is a difficult option given commuting distance and hierarchies Iam at the bottom of.",1
"When with others I like to be device-free. Knowing I have no control over the connectivity of others, I am inevitably presented with someoneas phone in my face as people I am with want to show me a photo or something on Facebook (which I deliberately took myself off of), this repels me but I donat want to be rude or self-righteous, it makes me not want to be around friends/loved ones, it also depresses me, I am seeking strategies to deal with this.",1
"From a young age I always felt a little blue and alone, despite being from a large family. I had temper tantrums, wet the bed until I was nearly ten years old, sucked my thumb, and had other adjustment issues, etc etc",1
"So whenever I start to like someone and they begin to actually get close to me I begin to dislike them or find flaws and then everything they do becomes annoying and I canat stand to be around them. This happens to people I have crushes on. This person I liked admitted they had feelings for me and I thought I had feelings for them but I just began to feel annoyed. Please help, whatas wrong with me",1
"I wake up, Iam fine, someone does literally anything that I donat agree with or approve of then I get angry as hell. Like for example, Iam unpacking my lunchbox and I got warm fruit cups that I want to put in the fridge, my mother is closest to the fridge so I ask her to take care of it, she says no. That is infuriating, like I have all these people who just fain lie and sat like its some sort of game.",1
I have never been a afeelings persona and I rarely feel or show strong emotion. I am a teenaged girl so I expected to get a bit teary or whatever. I feel like a lot of the time I only respond to things because I know I am supposed to. like crying a funeral or showing remorse if I did something wrong. But it is strange because I have a natural ability to sense peopleas emotions and I have been told I give good advice and I really seem to understand other peopleas feelings unless I am personally involved in the situation.,1
"I get stuck for hours daydreaming or mentally processing unimportant thoughts. It feels like the world through my perspective is more or less a screensaver for my mind. I typically donat notice when my fingers or arms get cold or when blisters start to form on my feet.

"Hi there! I am a cutter. I think I like it too much. What I like about it, is every time I cut and the blood rushes from my arms or legs, I start feeling light headed and cold. That drowsy feeling is what I yearn for. The warm blood running down my cold body(stress running out of me).That is what is feels like. After that you realize I are still breathing and I focus on that and then get this rush of energy. I donat know if it is adrenaline or what, but it feels really good.",1

My girlfriend and I have been dating for more than two years now. We both love each other very much. My girlfriend likes making friends and she is a good listener. Whenever she talks to male friends I get jealous and I keep thinking about it whenever Iam not with her that oh she must be talking with him or she must be with him. She started liking this guy who she thinks he is cute and spending time with him at school while Iam in class or talking and texting to him all the time. We had argued about it and she said itas nothing but just friends but I always doubted her and checked her phone that she made any calls to him or texted him and after a while she completely stopped talking or texting him. Then at work she was talking to this dude and giving rides to him to home after work in the night and again we had a fight over this issue and she stopped talking to him also.,1
We have just found out that our 1 year old grandchild is not our Sonas child. We have loved and bonded with this child and want to continue to be in his life. Our Son says he wants no further contact with this child. Are we being selfish to want to continue to see what we feel to be our grandchild?,1
"As of late Iave noticed some startling changes in myself. Iave always been a clear minded person, one who wasnat easily distracted, and Iave always had a good memory of things. As of recently (the last few months), Iave been stuck in a mental fog. I canat think clearly, or understand simple concepts anymore. I feel as though thereas a wall blocking me from mentally going past it, and trying to get past it only makes the confusion and fogginess worse.

"Hi, My older sister of 5 years has expressed hatred and rage towards me my entire life. When we were young she was mentally and physically abusive to me, insulting me if I came near, and hitting or pushing me down if I was within reach. Our parents tried to address this themselves, but finally just told me I couldnat change her and to stay away from her. My sister has stated that her hatred started the night I was born because she had to quit watching TV to go to the hospital, and that afterwards she was forced to share my parents attention with me. She rationalizes that it is perfectly normal for siblings to hate each other.",1

Too tired to think, and to focus takes a lot of conscious effort and energy. Itas especially apparent during conversations, when I suddenly realize I havenat been hearing anything theyare saying. Itas not that I get distracted- I just disconnect and donat even notice the disconnection starting. I have to consciously force my attention.",1

Sometimes I could accept what she said but only in some occasions and only in a certain way of her communicating with me. But mostly, I cannot accept what she has told me, and I donat know why. Iave repeatedly told her that thereas a way to talk to me so that I can accept all she said easily, but she wouldnat listen. She always stick to this one principle that it is a childas duty to change his way and follow parents way. Iave tried, but I just canat seem to follow her way.

"family, friends, even strangers repeatedly and all the time. They donat have an urge to act on these fantasies thankfully but they are a very prominent morbid obsession for them. I am the only true friend theyave ever had and the only one theyave ever told about this as well as one of the very few people theyave never thought of killing. I know that this person has a very high tendency to bottle up emotions a they have panic attacks, extreme social anxiety, ect. In short, theyare a trouble individual. Could you give me a general idea as to what tends to cause homicidal fantasy? And, more importantly, what is the best way for me to support them through this as their friend? What can I do to help? And how can I find help provided that they donat have the money to go see a true professional?",1

I know the fear is irrational, I have no idea how I became afraid of it, I have been my whole life. The fear stretched into involving coughing, and I hate the sound of anyone around me coughing. When I hear someone cough, I get very angry very fast and I feel an impulse to hurt them, but instead of hurting them I hurt myself (punching myself, hitting my head).",1

He and I are both ecstatic and so is my family. The problem is, his mother has made it very clear she does not like me (she told me) and that she is not happy about this. I had a miscarriage 6 months ago when I was 3 months along. When she found out I was pregnant with that child she asked me why I didnat get an abortion. When I miscarried she acted like nothing happened and was happy. She then told me how her son would not be having children for a long time.

"My girlfriend seems to always have something wrong with her. As soon as one thing stops hurting, the next day something else hurts. 4 months ago she started getting very queasy when she ate anything, and would vomit it up, eventually. She was only able to keep food down once a week or so. It got worse, where she couldnat hold down water even. She stopped eating altogether. 5 trips to the emergency room only resulted in treatment for dehydration and instructions to feed her light or clear food. She still couldnat eat. Sheas lost 85 lbs. (Sheas overweight to start with, but still unhealthy). We got a hospital to admit her, but nothing physically is wrong. But now she has become paranoid and psychotic, sheas sure everyone is plotting against her, even myself and her daughter. Sheas been in the hospital 14 days now, transferred to the psych ward, and is on a hold for at least 2 more weeks. Whatas happening? How did it get to this?

"I have a little sister who is several years younger than me. We grew up together and had a fine relationship back then. Up until I turned into a teenager in high school, her attitude started to change. I realized she started to bad-mouth people that she didnat get along with so I keep a distance with her. Things get worse due to forceful interference from family members. Until later and even now, whenever I try to get over the barrier and mend our relationship a bit by looking to her fine points and praise her, she became so conceited. It gets to the point that shead bad-mouth me or even her brother (also younger than me) to make herself look good in front of parents and others.",1

"I was about 5 when I began hallucinating. It always started audibly. It would be many voices, all at once. I couldnat make out any words but they sounded angry. It would start out quite, then get louder, go quiet again and get even louder each repetition, until they were so loud, I would notice nail marks on my head from clenching so tight. During all this, the visuals would begin. I could see my blinds moving, the floor breathing, the walls would turn red, in a plaid design and begin dripping like blood. Eventually the walls would begin to cave in on me. I remember being so overwhelmingly scared, I would try to scream for my parents, but I couldnat get a sound out. I was, in a way, paralyzed. The episodes would last maybe about ten minutes and persisted at this intensity for about 4 years.",1
"Q. Are hallucinations in any way a projection of either the unconscious or the subconscious mind? To state an issue that occurred in my own family, when a family member underwent a surgery, her sodium levels dropped. She is one of the rare cases where low sodium levels induces hyperactivity and hallucinations. Although we have been told that the reason for her behavior is rooted in biological causes and changes, I would like to know the impact of such changes on the subconscious mind and whether there is any information unknowingly projected out by the individual through hallucinations. The aforementioned family member, post-surgery, looked at a fan and starting scolding it as if it were a person. Yet when asked what/who she was scolding, she answered saying that she was scolding the fan itself.",1

Recently there has been little things that have made me concerned about his anger again. He has yelled at our child (at the time he was 6 months) because he was crying.

My head starts hurting and I feel lightheaded and weak. I start feeling as if Iam losing my breath. But the psychological effects are even worse. I feel so vulnerable and exposed whenever Iam in the sun. Itas like Iam underneath this huge spotlight that I canat run away from, so I get panicked when thereas no shade near by.

Last year, it was photography. He was talking about wanting to be a professional photographer. He bought many many books on how to become a photographer and to submit his photos to get them published. Although I believe his photos are very nice, he never once submitted one of them. He also convinced me to buy a very expensive digital camera which he has not used in months. At the time he wanted the camera, he said that if I bought it for him that he would help pay me back. This never happened. In fact, he began looking up other expensive lenses and equipment. He was constantly looking on websites and in catalogs to find more stuff for his photography.",1

I always think heall leave me for some pretty girl heall meet. And no matter how much he assures me that he loves me, I canat supress that doubt and fear, and I push him away. I want him to hate me just so I can prove he was just messing with me, but at the same time pushing him away is not what I really want.",1

But this time is wasnat at all scary and I was a women voice.

To be honest I donat know what his feelings for me are really, because he never expresses himself.",1

"Hello, My boyfriend lives with me and we are having too many issues this early on. From Day 1 he has told me I need to change. He has never accepted me for who I am. I do have trust issues and can be insecure, but he refuses to see or work on his issues. He has told me that I refuse to communicate positively, and that maybe I am just happy with who I am and then says if that is the case we will just go our separate ways. He will have outbursts and then 2 hours later text me a novel claiming he loves me but that he deserves to be happy too. He calls me selfish, yet the only thing I hear is about him. HIS stress, HIS happiness, how HE had it so bad growing up and refuses to deal with people who wonat change, etc.",1
"My 2 best friends have been ignoring me for the past 4 weeks and I just spoke to both of them. They both said they donat want to be friends anymore. This all started because they thought I was around them too much. One friend even said that dealing with me is stressful and bad for her health. Iam currently on the floor crying because I did nothing to deserve this and we were all fine the day before. I simply hung out with one friend after school twice and she got annoyed with me and wanted to be alone yet didnat tell me. So in 30 minutes of speaking with both of them, I have lost 2 of my closest friends. Also we all have the same friends because we are all in the same friend group. (From the USA)",1

It also made it so when I got even a little bit stressed out, Iad get a lot of muscle tension, which would only worsen the brain fog/cognitive decline/short term memory loss.

Iam naturally shy and a bit of a loner. I donat make friends easily even though I would like to. My relationship with my mother is very difficult as she was very controlling and manipulative. When I was young, I wasnat very rebellious and I stayed home most of the time even though I was dying to go out. My mother knew this, which was easier for her to control me. She told everyone that I prefer staying home and Iam not so much and outdoorsy type.

I know that Iam strange because people told me all the time when I was in school. Iam not aware that whether something is strange/wrong with me or not, only people tell me that my behaviour is not normal. Lately my parents told me if I donat change myself then they are going to take me to a psychologist.",1
"One of my family members is excessively paranoid. People are always plotting against them, casual comments made months ago are taken out of context and used as evidence, any wrongs done are never forgotten nor forgiven, and once they have decided that a person is aagainst thema, everything that they do is viewed with suspicion and searched for hidden motives. Most family members have cut contact with this person, and they have few close friends but a large circle of acquaintances who respect them. For whatever reason, I am still viewed as mostly trustworthy, which has resulted in this person leaning heavily on me for support and attempting to get me to join them in criticism of actions that I think are benign.",1

"My husband and I have 3 very bright children ages 6, 8, and 9. The oldest is a girl and the two younger ones are boys. My question is how do I get my husband to listen to me when I try to point out that I feel he is being too aggressive with his reactions and discipline methods? Our children are very close in age and very high strung a itas likely genetic as I am also high strung and have had issues with ADHD since childhood. He seems to be getting less and less tolerant and more easily over-stimulated. He yells frequently, but he is not physically or verbally abusive in my opinion. He is constantly at odds with my daughter and part of the reason is because he competes with her in defense of an issue. He is always wanting to have the last word and fights endlessly for his point to get across. He is this way with me as well. He is always growling and barking, and seems to be constantly annoyed by the kids. He loves them, but they just seem to be a burden to his being.",1

At 14 I started to feel like no one was real like theyare all robots that are programmed to respond to my actions. The people that I feel are actually real consist of my partner, best friend and younger brother. I also lie just to throw trouble elsewhere or just because I can.

"I found myself really looking up to this amazing teacher, and telling my friends and family about her. I looked forward to seeing her everyday at school. I started to really open up to her, as she made me feel I could trust her. She always cared about me, and was always there for me during rough times. She was always open to listen to my problems and offer advice. Summer rolled around, and we kept in touch everyday, I would share with her my summer days, and she would share hers back. She made me feel cared for, and always loved hearing about my day, as I did with hers. It is now my junior year, she told me she wanted to meet.

Once I found out it has made things worse. It has made me completely obsessed in checking up on him. I check every single number on his call log, I even dial the numbers to make sure that the other person on the line is a male. I continuously ask for his phone and go through all the messages.

When I asked my dad about it, he was initially concerned with the distance and length of the trip, because I do get anxious at times and can have panic attacks. After speaking with my dad, he seemed to be okay with the trip except for not having known my boyfriend for long enough.

So I knew that if I left something particularly atastya in the garbage can, I needed to take the garbage out or do something because the dog was going to get into the can.A  My husband wouldnat do that.

About the people who bullied me, about my mom ignoring me, about my mom constantly checking her Facebook, about her rather going drinking with friends on a Friday, about everything. I am angry about every mistake that I have made, I am angry about every thing Iave seen people do that was not okay, and Iam angry about every single thing that has been done to me, and Iam angry that these people are now aaccomplisheda and are happy with their crap lives. They have friends they go out with, they have always had friends, they have always had big smiles on their faces at school, but me? a",1

Iam supposed to be in the third but I failed my very first year. Itas been like cycle, everything is repeating itself all over again. I canat explain why I failed my first year. I didnat fail any exams a I just didnat go. I kept lying to everyone about it. Summer came and I had to fess up. My dad wanted me to pull out but I insisted on going back because I knew I didnat fail for the reasons he thought I did. It wasnat because I couldnat handle the workload a I just never tried. I gave up in an instant. No one forced me into medical school a Iam here on my own accord.",1

"My wife is a brilliant lady and she loves me very much, so do I. I married her 4 years back without the knowledge of my parents as they were against this marriage.

"I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. My parents have met him on several different occasions and it seemed like they got along.

" Me and a guy both used to be friends with this girl. Around the same time she fell out with us both because of similar reasons. However, recently weave been talking a lot her mental health. She posts stories which are based on her life in which she refers to delusions and hallucinations of scary creatures. Sheas very manipulative and she told us, this may not be true, that she used to not be able to eat because it used to make her sick. Neither of us are friends with her now but we donat want to just ignore the fact that she has symptoms of mental illness. However, neither of us are quite sure what we should do. Do we confront this girl or talk to a professional to find out more first. We would greatly appreciate your help, thank you.",1
I am experiencing a vicious cycle that I want to break away from. I have seen doctors and have been on medicine and nothing seems to work so I thought I would a forum to see if any outside source may help. My mother and grandmother are very negative people who believe everyone should be miserable if they are. My mother though takes it to a new extreme by extreme guilt trips and pushing all the blame on everyone but her (usually it falls in my lap or my grandmothers because we are convenient) She always also tells everyone what a bad guy I am and how I show her no respect. I have gotten to the point where I am trying to tell her how I feel and what it is doing to me. I keep telling myself maybe she might get it and I try to stay strong but cry every time because of how bad she makes me feel. I try to sound strong mentally but it is killing me.,1

"Dear Therapist, I have been receiving psychodynamic counseling for the last 4 of my 41 years of life. I have found it a painful process but very helpful.

"When I was 15 years old (I am 30 today) I sat on the edge of the 16th floor window seriously considering to jump because I couldnat handle what my father kept saying about me not achieving the scores he wanted me to score in high school. The 2 only things that stopped me were my religion, I am a Muslim, and in Islam; taking your own life will send you to hell fire. The second factor is I was worried about my mother, she is too sensitive and I was almost certain she wouldnat be able to handle and live with such an action.",1

"My mom is a schizophrenic and will not accept treatment. She has had absolutely no relationship with me in the last 3 years since her breakdown. Before that she did the basics of raising me, food, clothing, school, etc but was verbally and emotionally abusive and occasionally physically abusive. She had a VERY rough childhood and she actually raised me much better than what she had, so I wonat be too hard on her, but it did affect me.",1
"I have a friend who was married 8 months ago. She has recently found out that she may be pregnant which is happy news since they have been trying for about a month. However if she had a discussion with me that greatly concerns me. Her favorite band is playing in Chicago, states away and she immediately bought plane and concert tickets for her and me so she could go see them. However she is obsessed with the leader of the band. She says that he is the exact same guy that she has seen in her dreams as a love interest before she even knew this guy existed in real life. She is taking this trip to Chicago just to meet this guy. She says that according to his personal details she thinks they would have a soul connection and that if they were in a relationship it would be intense and he would understand her more than her current husband. She is convinced her dreams mean she needs to be with this guy and that if she goes to Chicago he will want to be in a relationship with her.",1
"Since I childhood, I find it rather comforting to be all alone. I donat have many friends, and even with the few I have I feel awkward to be alone with them. I go to extreme lengths to avoid social interactions. Whenever I get a day off I stay in my home all day, and I keep assuring myself thatas what I want even though I know itas not true.",1
"Iave been dating this guy for three years and I believe weare in love. Iave known since we started dating that he enjoys wearing womenas clothing and has thought about becoming a girl.

" I believe this is a symptom of some underlying issue, but I get extremely annoyed in cars when they have to make too many turns or go through too many curves. I will yell at my husband when he drives to find straighter routes. Other things to note that might help with a diagnosis is that I have a tendency to catastrophize. For example, I feel like my husbandas family does not like me. I will stew about it until I become worried that they are going to kill me and leave my body somewhere. Another example is I felt an old coworker was using me. Then I heard that they might move into the same building that I was currently in. I became paranoid that this coworker would come and start using me again. Also, I donat know if this is relevant, but I always wear black business casual. I do not feel comfortable in anything else.",1

They have raccoons living in the attic, there are open holes in the side of the house, both have collected things beyond what can healthfully fit in their space, they have 8 cats and some other little things I am concerned about. The house is a constant mess because they canat keep up with maintenance and general cleaning. I do know they realize that some things need to change, like plugging holes in the house that raccoons are getting in but when i offer help or suggestions they are super sensitive or just say ai know, buta. There is always an excuse or reason they have not gotten to it yet. I live across the country and canat physically help around the house. There is a extensive history of self esteem issues with both parents. So how do i talk to them and help them realize I am extremely concerned about their lifestyle without them shutting down or getting extremely hurt?",1
"Thank you so, so much for reading all of this. Iam not at a very good place right now. I get my schoolwork done when I have to, but I waste a lot of time writing poetry because itas the only place I express my thoughts. Iave forgotten how to do anything but smile; I feel like I have to act happy and be there for other people all the time. Iam a bit of a hypocrite because I always advise my friends that their own health should come first, but I donat believe it myself. What I do believe is that I only matter based on what I give to humanity. I just canat convince myself that thatas not true. Iam so tired, but I sort of like it because it makes me feel like Iam doing enough.",1
" Iam slowly coming to the realization that there is a greater possibility that I have some mental issues. Most of the time I feel numb a kind of like Iam outside of my own body watching myself do things. This happens a lot when Iam nervous (in any kind of social situation). Iam unhappy and I hate that because I donat have anything to be unhappy about. I live a blessed life thank God. For that I am eternally grateful, I really am. My life hasnat even been that hard a the hardest thing Iave had to go through was just a big move and my crush (,his family) and my own family making fun of me. Its pathetic a extremely pathetic, Iam aware of that. If I could tell you whatas wrong with me I would, believe me, but even I donat know that. Thereas just this extremely unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach that I just canat shake. Not to mention this completely hopeless attitude to life that I canat change. This looming sense that nothingas going to work out.",1
I donat know what is the problem with her she keeps on speaking and fighting with the family. if we say anything to her she doesnat listen and talks very rudely to her children. I tried a lot to change her but she doesnat change at all. She blames my dad and his family for this problem. She fights a lot with my dad and her children to. I am really frustrated with her because she just keeps on blabbering stuff and doesnat do anything. We thought she needs a psychiatrist so we wanted to take her there but she says that she is fine and my dad needs a psychiatrist. She thinks very highly of herself. She doesnat really care about her children too. I have a brother who is a special child but she keeps on being negative about him that he will die eventually. We get really tensed about her as she takes everything in a negative sense. We joke around with her but she starts fighting. She doesnat even accept her mistake. It is really frustrating seeing her like this. Please help me out.,1
"This year, one of my best friends has gone through a lot of issue with his other friends. He really feels like he has no one left besides me. All he ever does is work or stay at home. He rarely comes to church anymore. He deleted all of his social media accounts and now he wants to switch to online schooling. Iam really worried that he will fully isolate himself if he does that but I could also see how it would be good for him. I only want whatas best for him and Iam not sure if I should encourage him to stay in public school or do online schooling like he wants.Is this type of isolate healthy?",1
When people honk their horns I think they are honking at me. I scream at people for teasing me. I assume people want me dead when they give me criticism. I sent a nasty email after being dissed by a coworker. I said that a football teammate is my least favorite team mate because he made fun of me in front of my teammates. I am currently in treatment and the only thing that changed is my blood pressure levels which changed for the better. I walk on eggshells around my coworkers even though they personally never harmed me. I wanted to tell a scammer who was trying to scam me to go screw herself after I found out that someone was trying to scam me. I was bullied as a child and in my teenage years and that is giving me a lot of problems.,1
"As long as I can remember, Iave had an issue where if I am holding a partner for more than 5-10 minutes, I get really physically tense. It builds in intensity, to the point where I just have to break away into my own space for a while. It can happen sat on the sofa, or when going to sleep. I donat feel emotionally distressed, just a build of muscular tension where I really need to tense muscles as the tension builds to unbearable levels. It does feel like I need to escape/run, but Iam not at all emotionally panicked, itas just a physical response to something. Itas rather like a purely physical portion of a fight/flight response.",1
"I havenat felt like Iave been at home for about a year or so. Itas like to me, my own house is just a place I live in, and that thereas nothing special about it. But at the same time, I donat want to leave. I hate moving, Iave done it 3 times already. I know other people may have moved more than that, but still, itas like I want to go somewhere else. I recall a week ago, I was in my house, home alone, and stressed out about homework when I suddenly screamed, aI WANT TO GO HOME!a But a second later, I realized that I was in my house. But my next thought was aIam not homea. I talked to my dad about and I have a therapist I can talk to, but, I just want to know this NOW. If I canat make myself at home in my own house, where can I?",1

I know that this isnat a therapy session but I have told you everything I would have told you in person and my blood and urine results came back clean. Please, give me some advice.

"A few days ago I was on Facebook and an old friend saw me and struck up a conversation. I had not seen or talked to my friend for well over 40 years. We were neighbors growing up and when we were both about 18 we hung out together for a few months. We were never serious, just a couple of friends having a lot of fun. I was a musician and a biker and we partied together for a short period of time. When we were talking and talking about the old days, my old friend asked me if wead ever slept together. I said that I had wanted to but no, we never did.",1
" For a few years now, I have been suffering mentally. I wonat go into great detail but I will say I have horrible social anxiety. I want to be able to speak and express myself to my friends and my boyfriend so that I wonat lose them. Now, the problem with that is, I am so scared to ask my parents about letting me see a psychologist or a therapist. It just feels like they might not take me seriously or think Iam seeking attention. And I donat want them to look at me differently like Iam some psycho because I have anxiety. I want to tell them, but I just canat. I donat feel like Iam worth their time.",1

"During the summer this year I began researching the debate between evolution and religion. That was the biggest mistake of my life. My research caused me to develop an anxiety about life and death. I feared that thereas nothing after this life. I wanted to know if there is an afterlife, and I eventually found what I was looking for. Being a scientific person, I can only believe something if it has good evidence to support it. Thankfully reincarnation fit that category. I learned about it and found immense peace with that belief. I was anxiety free until around the time of Thanksgiving.",1
"the closest thing I can liken it to is being repeatedly teased, taunted or chastised, even though most of time thatas far from the truth. I donat feel able to talk to anyone about this because I know it makes me seem immature, but I want to stop these behaviours to give my parents a bit of a break. I feel immature and itas stopping me from having any independence. I was bullied and isolated during primary school and I remember the feelings that trigger the crying episodes as those I often experienced back then. Iad like to know whether Iam being immature and if I deserve to receive any help in stopping these behaviours- and, if so, what I can do to ensure this happens.",1

"I am a shy person by nature, I generally dislike and donat care to be social. But in this past year Iave gone further than that, rather what I would call paranoid tendencies. Even so much that Iam afraid to tell people my name, how old I am, and similar information, so I often end up lying. When I say something truthful I want to punch myself.",1
"My parents are humanitarian workers, so we travel to developing countries around the world. We moved to Jordan last week, and because the English speaking schools are too expensive, my parents put me in a French high school. In my old school, I was a hard working straight A student, and I took my grades very seriously. However, being in this school completely destroyed me. Being a non-fluent French speaker, I couldnat understand any of the classes and would always get a 50% grade.",1
"I feel so confused.Since I was 10, I have been an anxious person. I was bullied around that time, and I have always been made fun of. I feel like that never really affected me. Then, when I was 12, I remember feeling horrible sensations inside me. I donA t know if those feelings were sadness or anxiety, I just remember being in mere pain. Then, after I turned 13, those feelings were decreasing in intensity. I was definitely still anxious, but I guess I was used to it, so I really cannot remember my emotional experience at that time.",1
"My earliest, clear childhood memories began at about age 10-11. From what Iave read, blocked memories are most often associated with some kind of traumatic event, but what I can recollect of my childhood was, while certainly not perfect, generally happy. (Although I suppose the whole point of this is that if there was trauma and Iave blocked out the memory, of course I wouldnat remember ita? Itas all a little frustrating.)",1

"So from what other people have told me, Iam not exactly considered normal. People often seem to find my behaviour odd. Iam very introverted. I spend days at a time sitting in my room without anyone else, and Iave had full blown conversations with myself for hours on end while doing so. I tend to talk to myself very often, even in public without realising it. Usually I recite the numbers a1 2 9 10 5 9a if I realise that Iam talking to myself in public because I start to panic and think people are going to think Iam strange even when no one has noticed. Itas something thatas been happening for a long time now where i will suddenly just say something out loud and realise that I said it and a sudden panic comes over me so I recite those numbers to calm myself down, sometimes I add other random numbers between 1 and 10 as well.",1
My parents always told me that when i was young i was a aleadera that iam the one that led the group of friends when we were playing or doing sports or any kind of activity.

"I am 26 years old. I am starting to worry about my financial future, as I have graduated with $85,000 in student loans. I am worried about retirement savings and I am worried about my short term future. I am worried that it would be irresponsible for me to get married and have children when I am in debt. The majority of my loans are private, so repayment plans are at a minimum. I have calculated that even with accelerated payments, that I can only be debt free within 10 years with my current salary. Thatas 10 more years of living at home, no room for savings, and delaying the family that I know I want. I want to know if it is smart to think of these rewards when I have the burden of debt hanging over me? I know that my priority is to eliminate the debt as fast as possible, but I can only do so much and I am scared that 10 years is too long of a time to wait for a family.",1
"I almost never received any love from my father and I spent very little time with my grandfather and I think my attraction to older men has a lot to do with this. Iave just never had an older man as a role model growing up or any man at all until I was about 15 and by that time, I had already crushed on multiple older guys.",1
"Over the past 30 years, my parents (and particularly my mother) have never been satisfied with the level of effort I expend toward family relationships. As a child I was accused of ignoring and not liking my sister, and forced to seek her out to apologize for hurting her feelings. My sister, by the way, used to pin me to the ground and pull hair out of my head and painfully tickle and pinch me when I was young. Now she is divorced. She has always been a kind yet very negative, sarcastic person with a mean streak. I find being around her very tiring.",1

"If Iam doing something new I get very anxious, because it is new I canat accept it and deal with it as it comes, I have to make phone calls and send messages to find out everything so what comes is less of a surprise. I have even been known to reject some things in order to reduce the anxiety I was feeling and get back in control. This has led me to not having a job when I was capable of doing the training for it, itas just that I canat settle not knowing what things are all about before I start. I worry about how I will cope and how I will do things, plenty of what ifs and howas, I know it isnat the way, but I find myself doing these things and then feeling guilty if Iave not completed them.

I have recently moved to another city (for the 3rd time, because of university and my personal travel passion) and started school 1 year ago. I have made exactly 1 friend by now, and without me he would otherwise be the lonely guy because he is very shy and introverted (I am an introvert too, which is probably why we connected easily). To be honest, I would be the lonely girl without him as well.",1
"If Iam talking to a friend, it is usually about our common interests, past events, other friends, and in some cases re-enact past conversations, but with different dialogue.

Unfortunately, due to economy, he lost his job and because of this he was involved in a gray area business. Now, he is about to be charged with a felony. His lawyer proposed that he should get a job as soon as possible before he gets charged. However, he canat find a job where we currently live. Instead, he was able to find a job in his hometown in another state. Conveniently, the job is so close to his parentsa house. This is where I have a problem.",1
"My mum and dad divorced when I was around 9, and for years he took it all out on me and did things like starve me, hold me to the ground and lock me in my room for days.

" Hello! Since breaking up with my girlfriend of 2 years I have been having problems with my mental health. It started with a panic attack on the night it happened which included strong paranoia. Since then I have developed a lot of social anxiety. This has come to a crisis point where I have had to suspend my 3rd year at university because I felt very anxious about everyone thinking I was crazy and meetings were terrifying me. Another factor to it was that the place where I was staying constantly reminded me of her, so I felt like I was going mad in it.",1

" I havenat gotten a psychiatric diagnosis yet, but I think it might be safe to assume I have anxiety. As much as I try to tell myself that Iam being ridiculous, I just canat shake the feeling that something catastrophic will happen to me or those I love. Iall sit in my room and worry about things for hours. Iall actually feel physically tired from worrying sometimes. When I get like this I turn to my art. Drawing is one of the only things I can do where my head isnat a buzz with disaster scenariorizing. Itas nice to be calm, but after a while I start to wonder if constantly turning to something like this might not be healthy. Even if Iam being distracted from my current problems, Iam not really coming to any kind of resolution with them. And ignoring the problem feels like it could only make things worse. So when it comes to anxiety, could using books and art as a kind of coping mechanism be healthy, or could this kind of escapism only be destructive in the long run?",1
"My boyfriend immigrated here when he was 5. His family is very involved in their native culture/church and he is not. Due to them previously needing financial help and therefore him being in debt, he is unable to move out for another 1-2 years. They strongly prefer he be with someone from their culture and would constantly pressure him about it. Throughout our relationship they would tell him he should leave and try to set him up with other people (sometimes while I was standing there in their native language).",1
"Since the beginning of secondary school, Iave been noticing that Iave been feeling more down. And I also experienced an increase in anxiety. Iave always been an anxious kid, but this increased and now it has reached to the point where sometimes I canat eat in public much. Since I am dealing with overweight issues, i feel like anything everyone will be thinking why Iam eating even though Iam fat already. My family donat understand this, they keep on eating outside while I just want to go home.",1
I have been with my partner for four years now. I started to notice him staring at girls aged between 5 to 10 and very young teens. I first noticed this when we were in the car together and a little girl walk by and he was undressing her with his eyes. I didnat say anything and thought it was I was reading to much in to it.,1
I am really worried about a lot of stuff. Iam afraid if anyone whoas close to me is late (Even 2 minutes late). I try my best to block it out but it takes over most of the time. Also I hate the way I look. I hate the size of my breasts (normally girls would love to have my breasts). I also get really sad for no reason. It just happens spontaneously. I have problems coping with these emotions as well.,1
"This has been an on-going thing for almost my whole life since I was born, my family wonat do anything about it so Iam just in need for advice.

"Five years ago my younger step-sister and I had a falling out over something that I really thought was just a misunderstanding. From the beginning I told her I wanted to repair the relationship only to be completely shut out by hera no communication via social media, email or text. Throughout the years I have continued to send tentative contact her way and have been ignored, even after the birth of her son which I thought would soften our relationship. Because she is my step-sister and I am not around her mother and my dad very often we almost never accidentally cross-paths. The few times we have she has been friendly to me, as if nothing is wrong. She encourages I interact with her son and calls me Auntie to him. I always see this as signs of hope for us, but when I reach out to her I get nothing back.",1

"Every few months I start feeling a sort of mix between deja vu and dissociation? Starting last year, I have infrequently had this feeling of being in autopilot and being an observer looking through my own eyes as something or someone else keeps going, whether it be driving or working or whatever I may be doing. My personality doesnat change, it just doesnat feel like me doing it. I start feeling a bit sick to my stomach, and vague, obscure memories of similar experiences start rushing back, almost as though Iam remembering bits and pieces of dreams Iave had but previously didnat remember, similar to the feeling of deja vu. Itas a very intense experience and I usually get rid of it by forcing myself to sleep through it, but Iad like to know if thereas more behind it, and whether I can prevent it or just let it run its course when it happens.",1
"I stopped loving my daughter. I usually live alone with her thousands of miles from my family and her father, and my whole life is devoted to her, who is just turning ten years old. I am a bipolar2 and a borderline 50 years old woman. I struggle being a mother with mental health issues. Now sheas in europe, visiting my family and her father, and I donat want her back. Suddenly, in the past three weeks, I stop having any feeling whatsoever for her. I even try to picture her in pain, or crying, to see if it would stir any emotion in me, but instead I feel nothing, like I have never loved her. Iam in a panic, sheas due back in a month and I just canat face her, Iam scared I would make her life miserable if she was to come back to me",1
"Recently I feel like I have been acting odd and people are starting to notice. I randomly zone out and have visual hallucinations like tall silhouettes and people following me. Thereas also a voice in my head that will whisper to me during the day, but becomes extremely more vocal at night. Sometimes theyall tell me to do odd things like hide under a desk or confess my undying love or hate to a stranger. Sometimes itas worse, they just whisper my name over and over, sometimes tell me to kill or hurt people that I wouldnat want to. They also seem to control my thoughts and feelings, because sometimes they say I need help and I believe them. Other times they say I donat and I believe them. They generally control how I feel about people. Iam also convinced that other people can read my thoughts, maybe not everyone, but definitely most people. Nobody else believes me and I really do want an answer. Thank you very much.",1
"Okay so I was bullied during primary school by kids younger then me which made it so embarrassing that I never told anyone. They used to make fun of my weight and thatas where I think my issues began but I never acted on them. When I went to secondary school at about 12, although I wasnat being bullied anymore, I went on a diet. Gradually I began restricting further and further until I became dangerously thin, by the time I was 13 I was in a dangerous state, believing that a banana would make me gain a ton of weight,",1
"My little stepdaughter started calling me mommy out of her own about 8 months ago. My husband and I didnat correct her, although we did teach her how to say my name.

How can one approach a situation where most staff on the floor go out at the end of the week for Friday night drinks but not everyone is included. It feels horrible to hear them talk about their drinks the following week. As a solution I thought of organizing drinks that included everyone on the floor. This would be held on a different Friday or other night at a different location to avoid a clash.,1
"Hello all, I have been asking this question my all life. I have a lot of feelings toward pet like my puppy but nearly none towards humans. I tend to do things to manipulate to make them think of me as a good person who cares about them so they would come in handy when I need them. The thing is I am totally unaware of my doings when I do it but only after when I start to analyze my actions later. I realize that my actions become something natural, like itas common sense for me to pretend that I care about someone. And when I come to sense later, I would feel odd about myself but no guilt or distress.",1

"I am married and now pregnant. I came to my momas house for delivery of my first baby. My eldest sister left her husband and is awaiting a divorce.

My mom wakes up at 5 am in the morning and throws tantrums and tries to wake my sister up so she could help her in the kitchen. My sister is an adamant and lazy woman. She yells at mom for every other reason. In between these two women who cannot speak their heart without using proper words, it seems like Iam sandwiched. But it seems more like an issue with my mother because her anxiety to get things done immediately is affecting my niece a lot. Iam in my 3rd trimester and my mom seems to be a devil! Uncontrollable emotional torture is what I can say. My sisteras husband was abusive and she came home to be at peace but I donat think itas a good thing.",1

It makes me feel afraid to go to sleep and I usually end up being awake until the sun rises. If I do fall asleep, I almost always get awakened by nightmares.

"Iave been having trouble for the past 3 years with various things like hearing strange voices tell me to do things and once in awhile seeing strange things that no one else can see. For a while I thought they were messengers sent to me and I was terrified of them but couldnat get away. Now Iam doing a bit better. I think this is some type of psychosis?

"Let me begin with the symptoms I have had all my life. Ever since I was little, I have been anxious in large crowds, especially in crowds full of strangers, so much so that I spend a lot of my free time, not at work or school, at home. Time outside in situations with people, I find myself struggling to find a topic of conversation, or continuing on with a subject. I find myself saying things at the wrong time, or reacting oddly to other peopleas reactions. At times, I seem to incorrectly read peopleas emotions, whether spoken or not, and I tend to get angry and frustrated when there is no need to be. Because of this, I am conflicted, because when I am at home, I wish to be out with people doing something, but when I am around my friends and family, though I do enjoy it for some time, I end up wishing I were back at home.",1

He has had a previous drug problem which he has soughtA help for. I found out last year that for most of the time we had been together, he was cheating on me with prostitutes. At that time, I was pregnant and we went to see a therapist and decided to work through it. Over this past year, he claims to have not cheated but Iave found that he has been texting prostitutes several times. He denies ever doing anything and says he hasnat cheated in a year. I do bring it up very often as Iam skeptical about how truthful he really is.",1

"Hi! Iam a 17-year-old high school senior in San Francisco. Ever since I was in elementary school I would spin up stories to gain status or recognition. Now in High school, Iave been through several relationships (6) that all ended for one different reasons, but I recently realized that a lot of it has to do with the fact that I love falling for someone more than being involved in a relationship, and after I get bored with one person I let the relationship fall apart.

Over the past 15 years since leaving domestic violence I have struggled with Ataxia which is the result of assaults to my head. I have found it hard to fit in since. My age group (Iam 72) lives a normal life while Ataxia limitations put me in another basket. I could only keep up with the aged persons.,1
Where do I start? So Iave been doing a lot of self reflection and I believe I have a plethora of mental illnesses. Iall start with the events that have shaped my life to this day.,1
"Iam very confused as to what this means. Recently, even when I am exhausted, I have not wanted to fall asleep. Itas not that I canat fall asleep, as when I do decide to sleep, I fall asleep very quickly. It has been bothering me, and I would like you opinion. What does it mean, when you are completely exhausted, but have no desire to go to sleep? I have searched everywhere, and no one seems to have posted something regarding this issue. Please answer, it is effecting my school work.",1
"My boyfriend says he will break up with me if I donat stop doing this thing that I do. He says itas my childish attitude but Iall try to be more specific. This happens when I get my feelings hurt. I deal with my emotions in front of other people and affect them instead of dealing with my emotions in private. I ruin plans or create drama/a scene by either reacting outwardly with my emotions (screaming/throwing a fit but I do that much less than I used to) or I react passively where I still show that I am upset but instead of being just plain aggressive, I am passive aggressive where I run out of the room drawing attention to me and I affect those around me and often ruining the vibe/good time. I do the latter of the two the most.",1
"I donat know how to say this but Iall try my best. Over the past few months abnormal thoughts have been taking over head. For example, when I fight with my mom thereas this voice in my head that keeps telling me that i should hit her and hurt her, and at times kill her. This is what made me realize that I should probably see a counselor.",1
"I have been in an unhappy marriage for five years, since our daughter was born to be exact. Although she makes me feel so lucky and a very happy mom, my husband and I seemed to agree to be a team and work together for the sake of her happiness. I always thought that doesnat matter how difficult our relationship gets, I would never leave him because I donat want our daughter to grow up with divorced parents. I promised this to myself, until I met aThe Onea.",1
"Hello, Over approximately the last year and a half I feel as I have become a very unstable person. I am constantly becoming angry over very little things and sometimes I notice that I am angry for no reason at all. It is usually a very intense anger and I feel as it controls me and I mostly cannot control it. It is like every little thing sets me off into a rage and I make very poor decisions such as punching something, breaking something or throwing something. I have punched three holes into the walls of my house and have broken more things than I can count. I have also been having a constant feeling of emptiness, it is hard to describe but it literally feels like something is missing from inside me and nothing can fill it. Sometimes if I drink alcohol the feeling subsides but sometimes it can make it worse to. But nothing else I have tried make the feeling go away.",1
"Hi, Recently Iave noticed my partner has been really moody and down so today I asked how he is. I got the same response as usual, which is that he canat really describe it, stuff is getting caught up with his issues and because we had been arguing a lot lately.",1
"My mother and father were addicted to drugs my whole childhood (father still is, momas not but still messed up from it) and me and my brother grew up having a tumultuous childhood and also were in fosters homes off and on.

"if anything makes me angryatrivial or truly important, I might put on a wild, embarrassing, very inappropriate, and very unhealthy display of rage. I never physically attack another person, but Iall start hitting my own headahard, repeatedly, with both handsasometimes open hands, sometimes fists. Not in a astupid me!a kind of gesture like slapping oneas foreheadathese flailings have no intended expressive meaning. Theyare the exact same as an angry guy punching a wall or a piece of furniture. (Actually I do that plenty tooausually if Iam hitting myself, itas because thereas nothing else nearby thatas asafea to hitasafe for the thing itself, or safe for my hands.)",1
"I am 34, married, have a daughter who is eight years old. I love her a lot. I probably have very low self esteem and also obsessions/compulsions. In the sanityscore.com I scored 75 in self-esteem and 56 in obsessions/compulsions. Although, I am sure I didnat answer a lot of questions correctly.",1
So I will often either when bored or stressed (from anxiety) or just for fun A head out on a walk (or home) and there is a couple things i might do. Either play a trailer and pretend like im the director and people are reacting to it while i play out the characters in the trailer or play a rap song and be the rapper or me (and I often have a little backstory when I do). Or alot of times I might just pretend Iam me singing or playing guitar and being amazing at it while family members or school mates are watching.,1

"Where to begin. About 5 years ago when I was very young (16) I met my first love, to whom I lost my virginity to and fell deeply in love with. However, his parents at the time were getting separated and he took this out on me. He didnat treat me right and I broke things off after about 2 years a not because I didnat still love him but because we had too many issues at the time.",1
"My brother started by reading about the chi power and other stuffs related to it. He is 15 years old and in 10th grade of high school.

"We are together by 8 months now. He is 10 years older, divorced with a daughter that lives with her mom in another city. We are also in a long distance relationship, we live 600km away. We spoke many times per day, he used to send me video with love declarations, we made plans for marriage and moving in the same city, everything was perfect, like he came, he hugged me and I felt like I never did, no more pain, frustrations or bad memories. Just love and the future in front of me.",1
"Iam a student at the university, Iam the first in my class but I have a really low self esteem and confidence I always think that Iam always little than the others Iam not satisfied with my self even with my knowledge in my field of study. I feel always that people are watching me. When I go to the board to do a presentation I forgot sometimes what I have to say and my face turn to red. I have no stable decision and I feel weak.",1
"I am usually a very happy individual and throughout most of the day I am quite upbeat and friendly. However, I find that sometimes I will become irritable for little reason. If my shoes feel weird, if I canat find something, just setting up my computer, or for no reason at all, can cause me to become irritated. It is not to the point where I am yelling and screaming, but I feel a strong urge to break something or to exert force of some kind.",1
"I have a 15 year old daughter who is lovely in many ways. She is talented and generally self-confident, but seems to be oblivious to social constraints about what is or isnat appropriate to say. She speaks her mind with brutal honesty a think of a petite Dr. Gregory House. Most people who have known her for a long time are accustomed to her acerbic nature and take it with a grain of salt.A  Some people find it amusing/entertaining, but her inability to filter her comments is starting to cause problems in some of her peer groups. How can I steer her toward more socially appropriate behavior? (age 48, from US)",1
"I am 17 and recently I have felt urges to do things that make me feel this weird kind of satisfaction. For example, holding objects so that they touch the center of my palm and breathing in deeper than usual (Iave described this to others as breathing in until it aclicksa, almost like yawning but intentionally). These things make me feel good/ satisfied but only for a second or so which makes me want to repeat them or distract myself.",1
My partner and I are having a lot of issues communicating. She feels she canat communicate with me as I am defensive and that I keep trying to talk my way out of issues and blame her for everything. She feels I am not mature and act like a child. (Iam 32 and she is 41).,1
"I am in a solid relationship with a man who is quite a bit older than me. We have been together nearly two years but I have known him for 3. He has, of course, been in many other relationships and was even married for a short period a long time ago.",1
"Iam an only child living with his mom. My mother has had a very harsh time. Mostly a bad husband who wasted 30 years of her life in verbal fights. My parents are divorced now, so since my father literally tossed us out, my grandmother is taking care of us, as my mother always took care of the household and no one hires her in her 50s.",1
"My husband and I have been together 11 years. I started to write this letter because we canat agree on moving into a new house.A As I began writing I realized it is about much more than whether we move or not.A My husband cannot handle change. No matter the situation, he gets completely overwhelmed, starts thinking about the worst possible outcome, and stresses himself out.",1
I have a long history of trauma and deal with symptoms of CPTSD on a near daily basis. I am on a low dose of Zoloft and see a therapist once a week. Progress has been very slow but I do see a steady improvement in my ability to self-regulate and a shift in some of my very fundamental patterns of thinking.,1
"Lately Iave been feeling very strange. Iave always considered myself to be very bright but lately I feel like Iam slowly turning into an idiot. Iave loved reading ever since I was young, and I used to be able to read an entire book in one day, but now it seems like the words make no sense to me and I often have to read things over and over again just to understand simple sentences.",1
"I donat know what to do anymore, I avoid my thoughts and feelings by focusing on anything to keep my focus off of how I really feel. I know my actions are unhealthy, I know it is affecting my life negatively, but I am afraid. I canat get anything done, I canat focus on important things, because that makes me think about myself, which leads to me feeling worthless and hateful of myself. I have problems remembering things, and I think it is linked to my repression. I need help, but I donat want my family knowing just how broken I really am, I donat open up easily, I am not even sure if anyone notices how much pain I am in everyday. I want to scream it at them, but I fear how they would judge me. I also tend to put others before myself, and that is part of the problem here, they have their own issues, the last thing I want is them to focus resources on me, when I feel they would be better spent on almost anything else.",1
"So the issue is I donat know what is wrong with me, Iave been searching ever since I was 14 or 13 I donat remember, it happened around that time. I was once a rowdy kid, in school i would interrupt class, I was craving attention i believe, I wrote on the back of a piece of paper that was meant for an assignment, of all of the reasons Iam fucked up, the teacher read it and gave it to the principal, they had a psychologist evaluate me, the duration of the evaluation i just looked at the security cameras and ignored his questions.",1
"My grandmother has some mental health issues. She has a hoarding problem with junk, and especially with cats. She currently holds a part time job that does not pay the bills. Her house is destroyed between all of the cats and no upkeep. She does not have heat (it gets very cold here in the winter), electric, or running water. My grandfather has many health issues and has been living with my mom and dad who care for him. My mom and dad have tried frequently to get my grandmother to live with them along with my grandfather. She insists on living in the house with the cats (both living and dead) and piles of junk. EMS arrived at the house one time to help my grandfather and almost had the house condemned. My family and I want to help but do not know where to start.",1
"furniture, pots and pans, plates, cups and eating utensils, furniture. He would wander around the house at night naked! A few times he tried to leave the house naked! He was smelly, would not take a shower. He also had numerous fender benders with the car. Sometimes in the middle of the night, he would be caught just standing there in the dark. He had/has no interest in anything he used to do. He is on an AP now, so he doesnat have the positive symptoms, but he has every one of the negative. Is he really paranoid schizophrenic? Could this be a misdiagnosis?",1
"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 10 months. We live two and a half hours away from each other until I graduate from college in May, but we still see each other every weekend and I stay with him whenever I have breaks. He is an amazing guy who obviously loves and cares about me a lot. Even though I know this, I will still find reasons to get upset, sometimes creating problems out of thin air.",1

Itas beyond credible. And itas become the only thing she can talk about a all day, every day. I really donat know what to do. This is destroying her, and itas destroying me. I donat even know where to start to look for help. Thank you.",1
Iave always been the smartest kid out of all in my family and thatas why everyone expects too much from me. My mom and dad love me way too much and so do every other relative of mine.,1
"I am hoping you can point me to a direction on how I can read more about this issue. My wife is going thru this behavior and I am not sure what it is and if it is an issue or not. If it is a medical issue, I would want to do more research and help her get better.",1
"I met the man of my dreams about 7 months ago. However, I keep breaking up with him for no valid reason. My mind is constantly in a battle with itself. I always feel like someone is going to hurt me and I am extremely guarded. I am fortunate that the man I am seeing seems to understand that I have the issues I have. But I am so tired of hurting him, and it just feels out of my control. I feel like I am incapable of love.",1
I have a long history of lashing out on people who donat deserve it at all and now I have a partner. I am extremely concerned for her safety. I care about this person very much and the last thing I want to do is hurt her.,1
my brother is successful and smart. iam not. because of my brother my parents are pressuring me so much and im expected to accomplish many stuff and be the first in everything.,1
"My daughter is 8 now and seems much different than my other children. She has always been more attached to me, needing to be with me all the time, flipping out when dropping her at school or making her sleep in her own bed. She will be up drawing in the middle of the night. Always has to have her ears covered when flushing a toilet or starting a bath. Must be listening to music 24/7. Is becoming increasing more violent. Shows zero emotions unless its anger, sadness, or attitude. 2-3 times a year has a complete angry, violent to herself, screaming, breakdown that she says she acan;t stop.a Literally nothing makes her genuinely happy. Always mopey. One pediatrician said 3 years ago that it was just anxiety.",1

"I am a 17 year old male and I live in Boise, Idaho. I have had chronic insomnia for a while and I simply canat sleep but when I do I sleep a lot. I have an IQ of 150 and I heard that high IQ individuals usually stay up late. The chronic insomnia however makes me have sound hallucinations sometimes and I constantly lose touch with reality, I sometimes pace around the room in bliss while making weird grimaces. I only do so at home when alone. I sometimes feel like losing it and running around like crazy in public or flying into a rage. I barely manage to control myself.",1

"Looking for information or help with something I am teaching my foster daughter. Not sure how to describe it, but when you have a toxic member of your family and they want to give you something or buy you something.

How can I explain this better to her or find information on this?",1
"I am having a lot of problem in my relationship recently. And it seem to be the same problems that happened in my last relationships too. I had many broken heart relationships in the past too. I feel like I canat handle a normal long term relationship. When things are normal and perfect, I tend to start ruining it and getting anxious. I start picking up a fight or being unreasonable and non sense to my girlfriend. Luckily I havenat made any serious damage yet because I try to hold it up but itas just escalate more and more in my action and behaviour until I brought us down together. Then I feel satisfy and guilty.",1

"Within this month, some extremely frighting and scary things have been occurring to me. I have begun to hear noises in my head saying different things with different accents, they tell me different things all the time. Once I remember seeing a man in the forest all alone, and hearing voices stating to murder him. At some times, definitely a lot in my school, it feels like the entire day was one minute, I sometimes literally cannot remember anything I just did. It is extremely terrifying.

I am always silent all day, and when confronted I simply answer with the quickest response I can.",1
"Iam 30 and have never experienced the feeling of being embarrassed or shame. I constantly read and see the word (embarrassment) in books or TV, but I have never identified with it.

Iave been seeing my T for about two years now on and off. The reason Iam here is because my T seems fidgety during every session. What I mean by this is that he either spends 50% of his time fiddling with his wedding rings or the other 50% running his hands through his hair.,1

"I started self harming when I was 12. I punch myself in the leg as hard as I can. I will often be sore for days after. However, because I was born with cerebral palsy, I am not strong enough to leave bruises on myself. I recently began to scratch myself as another form of self harm.

I often try to convince myself that because the punches wonat bruise, and because the scratches donat bleed, it is not a serious issue. However, some of my closer friends have told me that is still should consider it more serious and that I need to stop before I go any further. What Iam wondering is, are behaviors intended to cause harm to oneself, but which do not cause visible tissue damage or bleeding, considered self harm?",1

"I got married a month ago and since the wedding, I keep thinking about the things that I didnat plan properly. Biggest one being the guest list for the wedding. I decided not to invite some people because my fiance was only inviting his close friends but we had a huge wedding and enough room to fit more people especially since some guests didnat even show up. I think I was also pressed for time and just didnat bother inviting some people out of being lazy and wanting to cut down on my workload.",1
"Hello, We got married 4 months ago. My husband is currently living in another country but will come home soon (few months). We have always lived in different countries but we know each other from childhood. He emails me every day an average of 5 times per day and with lots of love words (sometimes even more times, unless he has something important to doathen he wonat email me for hours). Even though it is not common, it bothers me when it happens because I always find a time to email him when I am busy (he canat even say aI love youa). I do not think it is that much time consuming. The most he has taken to email me has been about 10 hours.",1

Eventually Jyl spoke out about the matter but never speak out about the role she played in the situation. I didn t even defend myself when she (Jyl) confessed it all, I just put on a strong face, but I was crying on the inside. Eventually everyone found out about it, as you know words spread like bush fire. In high school I was bullied for it and other rumors that Jyl and my so call friends created about me.",1
I can relate to my clients when they sometimes feel the anxiety and unsure feeling when trying to find the right person to seek therapy and aid for important life challenges. And there are times in life when even emotional counselors and therapists need and want to seek help from a professional. As a therapist it can be difficult (for many reasons) to seek help themselves. What steps do you suggest to someone in that situation? Are there links and resources specifically to help people in our particular profession seek professional help when facing emotional or familial difficulties? What types of therapist/credentials/education level should they look for? Would it be wise to disclose the similar career field in therapy? What types of questions would be significant enough to ask the therapist before making an appointment when faced with this issue? There is very little information about this in our field that I am aware and would love to get some insight if possible. Thank you for your time.,1
"I work for a company Montego Bay, Jamaica and for the past two and a half years I have been constantly harassed my coworkers. I reported this my managers and Human Resource Department and they do nothing to help or stop the harassment. These people have been lying continuously about me.

"Iam an Education graduate Cum Laude and currently working as a BPO agent. I recently decided to continue to Law primarily to achieve my dream of being a lawyer but mostly to cure my academic insecurity. I think my cousins and friends landed a better course and better job. I ended up working in call center since I hate teaching. I only took up teaching because my mom says so. So, lately I had problem cooping up with school and work. I hate my work, I donat like the way they do things there. I thought we should be working with integrity but all I can see are the opposite. Then I messed up school. So not like me.

I originally got prescribed paxil at my student health center, and since I graduated, they wonat keep sending me prescriptions. Can I go to urgent care? I work all week on a relatively rural mountain and I donat have a car. I also kind of feel like I need therapy for my myriad issues, but I donat know if itas cheaper to get a prescription from a GP and go to a therapist or go whole hog and go see a psychiatrist. Not to mention the fact that Iall have to ask someone to drive me, which is a whole other can of anxiety-ridden worms. Literally the only thing I desperately need is a prescription. Mainly I just donat want to go through the horrific withdrawal effects. Help?",1

"Over the past few years I have been curious as to what is wrong with me. I feel different, detached and slightly alienated. I have no interest in friendship or relationships (emotional or physical). I feel very emotionally cold and distant, I do still have emotions, but they are very diminished, I also have difficulty understanding what emotion I am feeling at any given time, in addition to lacking empathy. I often find myself being very manipulative and lying almost compulsively. It has gotten to the point where I will lie frequently for no reason, simply for the sake of lying. I am very impulsive and lack direction in my life, I pick up and drop new hobbies very frequently and I find it almost impossible to plan ahead and stick to life goals that I have set for myself.",1

My mother has for awhile now become incredibly over sensitive and acts like a child at times and can become very extreme. She has filmed me crying for an hour on her phone saying she was protecting herself before and has also threatened to disown me when I was 13 because I was looking for the number of my therapist that I had been sent to to try and solve this problem and wanted to call him.,1
"I have seen my therapist for several years and she has been extremely helpful. Despite the number of years we have worked together, I still find opening up with her and sharing certain feelings or thoughts extremely difficult. Part of this is due to the fact that I have a hard time identifying my feelings and describing them. My therapist on the other hand is so insightful and can nail my feelings down with her questioning. I am very thankful she is able to do this (and also amazed at her ability to find the right word to help describe how I feel).",1

"Often after I watch tv I would make up scenarios based on the story and live in them. I would pretend that Iam a character that I made up, and I would make up other characters and talk with them. When Iam bored or have nothing more to continue in that scenario I would make up a new one and starting pretending to live in that. Whenever I am alone or think that no one is looking at me I would pretend to be someone else and talk to people that doesnat exists and whenever I realise that people notice me I would snap back to reality. However, I know that sometimes strangers do notice me talking to myself, therefore, I think that itas starting to get out of control as I know that talking to myself is not normal and I tried to stop, but I just keep doing it. I am worried that if I continue this I might not be able to differentiate between reality and fantasy.",1

Then hitting puberty I was never one to leave spots alone and if I went away on holiday and was bitten by some bug sure enough it wouldnat be long before I had squeezed, picked and scratched away at the area. I had a few scars on my legs and my fingers always looked sore but generally, I would try to break my habit by cutting my nails, covering the area with bandaids or clothing and generally tried to be aware of when I was doing it. Sometimes I would be fully aware of what I was doing and others times it was just a natural habit.",1

"I am eighteen. I just recently graduated from a great high school [barely], and am now looking to start college in the Spring. I realized something was wrong one day on my way to middle school, back in 6th grade. I would look at people, feel they were somehow wrong and I would catch the awrongnessa. So I found a way to appease myself by faux-coughing twice while looking at them, as if to give back whatever made them seem wrong. It just started. Later, in about 8th grade, it turned into needing to touch everything a certain amount of times. I would also think morbid thoughts about dying in crazy ways, but I usually found them to be thought invoking, while my friends thought I was crazy. But the weird thoughts wouldnat go away. Next, I started worrying that I didnat lock the doors, and rechecking, even though I knew they were locked or checking the stove. All complete with the thoughts that if I didnat, something bad would happen. What exactly used to be more specific, but now it has just dimmed to an overall sense of asomething bad.a",1

She once took me out with her to go shopping, and when I brought clothes to the changing room, she looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to buy anything (why bring me shopping if she doesnat want me to get anything???). She doesnat like when I spend money, even if itas not her money.

All through junior high all I ever wanted was a boyfriend. I was boy crazy and I wanted to date every boy in the school. Now, I have a boyfriend, and when we first started dating, I really liked him. I loved holding hands with him and cuddling. But after about 4 months I have no interest in touching him or kissing him or even talking to him.

And yet I still have that 24/7 tic in my head that tells me to end them. I visualise killing them and I enjoy it. Yet I understand that taking real actions would only slow me down in achieving certain goals. Iam good at hiding as everyone perceives me to be a charming, responsible and normal guy. (this information is just context) Now, It set me to think that this may not be how everyone else thinks and feels. Psychopathy came to mind and I did some research. I came across the psychopathy checklist (PCL-R) and found that I had a 33/40 score. Of course Iam not a professional so I would like an expertas opinion on this case.",1

"For about 7 years now I can barely get through a conversation without crying. Itas humiliating and is uncomfortable for everyone involved. Anything can trigger it but I seem to have narrowed it down to three general triggers. All of these triggers are things that I normally would never give a second thought let alone burst into tears about. 1) Any large group activity a baseball games, choir performances, kids school performances. If a group is together and Iam part of it, at some point I cry. 2) When anyone shares anything the least bit sentimental. For example a a friend of mine was talking about her sonas kindergarten graduation. His teacher taught the kids the sign language sign for aI love youa so that the next year that would be their secret signal around the school. Cute right? Cute. She was telling me this and I burst into tears! To the point I couldnat speak. This happens all the time. 3) Anytime I have to speak about anything spiritual. Iave almost stopped going to church. I canat talk about any of it a not even planning a simple kids activity without crying at some point.",1

I have been doing this all my life and seems to be the only way I keep myself feeling good and not just upset at what I have to deal with. My teachers tell me just go to extra help, get a tutor, stay after schoolaall of these are great ideas but I cant just accept help.

A couple days later, my mom looked at my arms and she saw weird scars, and she knew I cut myself. So I had to explain everything to her and how I felt about my self. She told my dad and my sister and then it turned in to this whole big thing, but she never sent me to therapy or asked for my blade back. My sister never apologized and she still calls me fat :( some times she will get bad at me and tell me to go cut myself.",1
I broke up with my fiancA. I am 33 and he is 35. We were together for 6 years and the last 2 we were engaged. I was the one that left the house because the last months he was has pressure from his job and also he was telling me that I was putting pressure on him. He didnat want to talk with me and when I was trying to make conversations he was telling that I was nagging and he was leaving.,1
"My father has turned a new leaf the past few years and has become a very loving and devoted Christian. He recently had a radical nephrectomy because of kidney cancer (renal carcinoma). During the awful symptoms and trials of the actual cancer and numerous trips to the hospital, he was amazingly positive and strong. After the surgery (He is now cancer-free!) he has been making suicidal statements (which he has NEVER done before to the best of my knowledge) and his past uncontrollable anger has resurfaced 10-fold.",1
"Iam a 14 year old guy and I donat know if it is rare or not, but I seem to have an interest on the inside of peopleas mouths. When I look at peopleas mouths, I tend to have an erection, and I feel kinda excited about it. Sometimes I like to search for mouth pictures online, or search for mouth videos on YouTube, just to give myself the desire of looking at peopleas mouths. Sometimes I would just weirdly (?) ask my classmates to open their mouths, and they would usually do it, and I would get really excited and I would erect. Is this a normal afetisha? Or am I just a really weird person?",1
"Hi there. I am a genderqueer person in graduate school for mental health to become an LCPC. I am worried that having a gender identity that is incoherent to most others will lessen my ability to build a therapeutic alliance with a wide range of clients. I am worried I will not be effective outside of a very narrow community. I have thought about trying to live as more clearly female or male, but this idea is uncomfortable to me. I feel the answer I keep getting is that I have to be myself to create an authentic relationship, but I think that answer ignores the reality that expressing a genderqueer sense of self often confuses most people and impedes building relationships very often. Yikes. What do you think???",1
"I am a 22 year old recent graduate and my fiance is 30 years old and a hard worker as a business analyst. We started dating when I was 18 (he was 26). We dated through my years at school, he broke up with me shortly twice in our earlier time together (my family was not very accepting of me dating and he saw that). Later when I moved to Dallas for the last two years of nursing school, we decided to move in together.",1
"I have held on to feelings for my best friend in elementary school for years now. She was the only one to comfort me when I was feeling down, which was often. It evolved into a crush. But she had to move to Georgia in the fourth grade. I never truly got over it. I believed that I loved her but never got to tell her. She had called me before once, but I never got the number and still never got to tell her how I felt. She was the only one I loved ever since and never had a girlfriend relationship. I believed that it would be unfair for the other person if I canat love them how they may love me because Iam still hoping that she will come back into my life. I am 20 years old and I know I should move on, but I donat know how. Every time I thought I have moved on I remember her and it almost moves me to tears.",1

She lives in Chicago and I live in the central part of Illinois. Its about a 3 hour drive. Our relationship revolves around communicating through our phones and sometimes we skype when we find time in our busy busy lives. I am back in school trying to finish up my degree, and it takes up a huge part of my time. Between studying and class and homework, I am usually bogged down with that on top of my obligations to life and her.",1

I took admission in college 2 years ago and found a girl who looked like my cousin. I kept on chasing her to be my friend and then made her my friend. That was the most precious time for me having her company sitting besides her and one thing more she also used to came to me whenever A was sitting alone. We became very close friends shared secrets with each other.",1
"Now I know most boys my age (15) want to be as mature as possible, but my dad expects me to handle everything myself. I feel he is putting too much pressure on me and I feel stressed but not only that. He babies my brothers and sisters.

"Hi, Iave been struggling to help my mum. Iam not sure how to help her, what to say or where she should go to find help. She is 53 years old, fit and healthy. She is currently going through menopause and has been married to my dad for over 30 years. For the last 3 years (since my parents moved from the western suburbs to live on the beach) my mum has been acting completely out of order. She is extremely jealous about when my dad is happy. My mum makes these ideas in her head that my dad is going to leave her for someone else and that everyone (me, my sister and my dad) are all against her. She acts irrational by throwing wooden chopping boards across the room when she is completely aggravated. I fear for her well being and my dadas.",1
"Recently, my momas gotten into a bit of a saddened state. You see, she loves acting, but everything going on in her life has restricted her from doing anything close to it.

She and my step-dad run a wedding photography business. For the sake of privacy I wonat give any more details than that.",1

"About 2-3 months into our relationship, my boyfriend continued to press me to tell him the number of men I slept with. At first, I tried to deflect the question but I had to answer him. I lied and gave him a very low number, because I knew he was a jealous man. But I felt so guilty when he said he was really glad I waited for him, so a few days later, I decided to tell him. But when I sat down to tell him, I couldnat tell him everything so I revealed to him that there was one more. He had a very tough time dealing with it, and he made me promise him that there was no more. Months went by without me feeling so guilty about it.",1

"My husband hired a female worker on January 19, 2015, and admitted to him via text that she is in love with him. She is aware that he is married with kids, yet she is still trying to pursue him. Sadly, my husband seems to like it when she flirts with him, causing him to flirt back.",1
I met an American who is living in The Philippines online a few months ago. She was promised a modelling job when she got there. When she got there things were not as they seemed and she ran away from where she was supposed to work. At the time I was gambling too much and was tired to losing money to gambling. So I decided to donate money to her to pay for her power bill. It felt good to donate to someone in need instead of spending the money on gambling. But overtime I realized that she constantly wanted money.,1

"Iam 18. Over the last year or so, I have noticed that I seem to lack (or have way less) sympathy and empathy than my peers. There are more minute things, such as never having cried at any movie or booka ever. Itas disconcerting that when I watch sad movies with my friends/boyfriend (i.e. war, Holocaust, cancer/disease movies, etc) I am almost unmoved and so easily move past it. The other day I saw a WWII movie with my little sister and her friends (all age 11) a who should clearly have less emotional depth than me a all cried, but to me, the movie was just interesting and entertaining.",1

"I am noticing a trend in my own life, whereas my own negativity and bitterness has become a part of my personality. I have always been on the blunt end of any experience; social rejection, bullying, assault and alienation seem to follow me on a constant basis no matter how I change my attitude. I have learned to simply just accept this, as life for me will never get better, and all attempts to possibly change that belief are futile. My own actions regarding this have not warranted this type of behavior to happen; I try my best to be empathetic, caring and understanding to many people that I have come across, but I always either receive nothing in return or get outright, unreasoned hostility. I tend to talk to people that are no lesser from my own life, for they have also undergone the same issues that I have, but it has become clear to me that not even they want to associate themselves with me.",1

She has repeatedly tried to tell him this isnat the case. He does have some mental issues as do other members of his family, but they havenat been forthcoming in giving my daughter any info. I know that he has been barred from his parents home. One thing I know is that he thinks he is famous and is very delusional. Iam scared to death he is going to break into my daughteras home and attack her. Iam even afraid for her to get a restraining order, lest that send him over the edge.

However, after having a long distance relationship for about one year I find that my feelings for him are starting to fade. I am afraid that I am falling out of love.

Recently I found a great friend with whom I connected with immediately. Things took off to the extent that both our wives picked on us for liking each other. After being married and having children a now I am questioning everything.,1
Iam 17 and I donat like to speak and I try to avoid every situation where I have to speak. Iave been doing this since I was little but I would only avoid speaking to other children. However as I got older I stopped talking to teachers. When my teachers called on me I would just stay silent. Now Iam doing it to my family. When my mother or siblings says something to me I just stay silent and they think Iam ignoring them. Iam not. I have a reply in my head but I just canat bring myself to say it out loud.,1
"For the last couple of years, since my mom and step-dad married, he has been treating my siblings and me badly. Iam the oldest, being 16, and I have a younger sister who is 12,and a younger brother who is only a little over a year old. My step-dad gets up in my face quite often yelling and screaming. Other family members and my friends have witnessed it. No one in my family likes him except for my mother, (who seems to have a thing for abusive men. She divorced my father to reconcile with the man that punched her in the stomach and put a loaded revolver to her head while she was pregnant with me). My step-dad has come at me several times, asking if I wanted a piece of him and getting a little too close for comfort. Iam afraid that heas going to actually hit me sometimes.",1

"Hello. I was molested by a relative of our neighbor when I was 5, but Iam not sure if what my grandmother did also counts as molestation. She would joke around with me and touch me between my legs and I would always laugh because she convinced me that this was all in good fun. I was around the ages of 4 or 5. She never did this around my mother, though. Only when we were alone on the bed. Does this count as molestation? My therapist thinks it does, but Iam not sure. Maybe I am in denial? Iam 23 right now and thinking about all of this is making me a wreck and making me see my grandmother in a different light (I still live with her and my mother, by the way). Thank you for your help.",1
"My boyfriend and I broke up in early November because my friends and family started saying that he was trying to keep me from them and started a rumor that he was a woman beater. My best friend heard this rumor and called my mother which in return she freaked out on my boyfriend. This rumor is not true, he has never laid a hand on me. Me and my boyfriend could not survive the rumors because and I tried to defend my parents. Since then I moved out of his house and into my parents.

I depend on alcohol when this happens as I feel it relaxes me, I know this isnat the right way of dealing with things, but it definitely helps. I shut off friends during these episodes. I have been to see a counselor recently, but felt really stupid, couldnat speak to her and cancelled the rest of the sessions. I was emotionally and physically bullied by someone who was close to me when i was younger. I havenat ever told anyone about this, iam worried if i shared this information in a counseling session that the police will be informed. I have very low self esteem and i lack in confidence. Do you have any idea what this is? Or what i can do to help this? Thanks for your time!",1

A lot of times I end up hugging someone and squeezing them really tight until I have to force myself to stop. Sometimes in order to prevent myself from doing this I have to dig my nails into my palm. Other ways I try to stop this urge is by biting my lower lip and ripping up paper. Sometimes I get the urge to hurt others even when Iam by myself.

She, however, acknowledges that she is different than most and agrees that her behavior is childish. At times she become very stubborn when I confront her about her inappropriate behaviors.

She will be doing something in one room and someone (her husband or mother) will speak to her in another room, while walking into the room she is in. When they enter the room she loses her identity completely and thinks that she is the other person. She sees everything from their vantage point, feels she is speaking their words and has absolutely no sense of her own identity at all. She sees herself as if she was not in her body and believes her body to be another person. So far the episodes only last about 20-30 seconds. I think this is too strange to ignore, although she thinks it is not anything to worry about yet. She did express concern that perhaps it could get worse suddenly and she might not ago backa to her own body and identity. Thatas the reason she told me, just in case something like that happened.",1
"I was molested as a child multiple times by multiple people, I had no father figure in my life, I lived alone most of my life and I am incredibly smart at mathematics.",1
"Iam a sophomore in high school, and I feel low on confidence. Mainly because in my odd day 4th period class there is always this kid who makes fun of me, and he always tries to point out my flaws. I tried saying something to the teacher, because he was talking to me about it but he just made the situation even worse. Itas hard ignoring him when he is saying you look like a man,you have a huge forehead, youare ugly,etc. The thing is nobody else Iave met point any of that out.",1
"Basically I got pregnant in a long distance relationship and after 8 months he finally moved to be with me. But Iave read txts where he tells his mom heas going to abandon the child and come back home to them after he makes enough money to pay off his debts. He tells me heas just telling them that to calm them down. And the past few months before he moved to me, he was talking with other girls I didnat know about and even was planning to date one of them aif he and I didnat work outa and he was telling her he loved her and all this.",1
About a month ago I started hearing things in my head. It has only happened about five times during this time. The sounds always come from the right side of my head but at the same time it feels like they are whispering in my ear.,1

"A person I know has this recurring problem. At first I didnat think anything of it, after all, we all have memory lapses from time to time for a variety of reasons. However, my friend continually recalls events and facts incorrectly.",1
Hey. Iam just really looking for some serious advice. I really believe my husband is a sociopath. When we first started dating he would mention that itas hard for him to have feelings. He also said when he was a kid he would torture cats to the point where he would kill them. He said he saw a therapist when he was younger but he doesnat know the diagnosis. Iave caught him lying constantly. He has anger issues and it comes out in our relationship. He has never physically put his hands on me but he did tell me that he wants to know what it feels like to kill someone. He is in the military and we have a daughter together. Iam worried about him and our relationship. Will he ever hurt me? He bought a gun recently and this really puts me on edge. Should I just leave him? Can he love at all? Should I confront him? I have never openly asked him about his desires to kill because it scares me. He also bought this sharp pointy like weapon and he says he wants to stab someone in the throat with it. What do I do?,1
"They donat tend to eat oatmeal or canned food (we are a household below the poverty line) and so I tend to eat those. I get talked too for that and told that Iam just eating everything. I was also responsible for cleaning the house in place of rent. To the best of my knowledge I was cleaning well but I wasnat as some stuff happened. When I asked them about it, the answer was that I should have come to them about the cleaning instead of them telling me what is wrong. Iam unsure if Iam suffering from something that is undiagnosed or if I am just living the ordinary life and the other people around me are having the issues, itas all so confusing. Though I do know that whenever I go to have a talk with them as a household, I always picture the worst case scenario in my head a I know itas not healthy and itas usually never the case, though it always seems to happen.

"She and her mom believe the neighbors are trying to get them. My friend is losing her dad to cancer. She recently told me that she believes her neighbors and others are repeatedly breaking in, poisoning their food, and following them around. At first I believed her, but now I think she is paranoid since things seem to be getting worst. I believe it was her Mom who first put this thought in her head and now they both hardly sleep a all while dealing with her dadas condition. My friend is very intelligent and is going to grad school, and Iam nervous about how this is affecting her life. How do I talk to her about this? Is it possible that the stress of her dadas condition has brought this on? I wonder if this paranoia will pass or increase after her dad passes.",1
"My family and I had always been close until my mother passed away during my Senior year of surgical complications when I was seventeen. The event seemed to tear my family apart and put a alepera sign on my back. I met someone online when I was twenty and decided to move from Ohio where my family lived to Florida with him and told them about our up coming wedding. My family vacations in Florida several times a year so when I told them that is where the wedding would take place three months in advance and they all promised to be there, I never suspected anything was amiss.",1
"I have met the person I love unconditionally but am unable to face it and be honest with it.A I met a man years ago who has proved to be more than I had ever imagined could exist. We have become friends, we enjoy ourselves together but I cannot for some reason admit that to him, myself or to anyone. I was raised Catholic, was in the process of divorce when I met him and he was in a relationship, all social rules tell me to turn away from him and I have. I avoid him whenever I can, even a friendly wave on the street, the meeting of eyes, to do so causes deep regret.",1

"Hi everyone, Iam happy that there is such an outlet for everyone and wish everyone well. Hope my question helps others! Iam 23 this year and I have completed my university education and find myself stuck in life and unable to make choices nor believe in myself.

"Ever since I remember I was trying to do too many things. Besides my job I always have a number of ahobbiesa or apassionsa that make it really hard to concentrate on one main thing or even to choose what that main thing should be. For example, lately I have become obsessed with making electronic music. So while being at work I am secretly spending nearly all my day reading and watching videos about the equipment and techniques. Note, that I mostly do not actually make music, but rather apreparea, aresearcha or astudya. I consistently miss deadlines at work, but just canat keep my mind on the job.",1
"I have read many different types of answers to this concern, but I believe my case is different. I am away for college and almost 3 years ago, I met the love of my life and have been with him for almost 2 years. He is the most caring and loving person I have ever met, but he was born with a birth defect called Spina Bifida. It is a very rare case though, he is able to walk and do just about everything someone without his condition can do. Though it still can be daily challenge for him everyday, but he is a stronger person for it and even with that challenge, I accept him for who he truly is.",1
"First of all, my family. I did not grow up with my family since I was 2 months old. I only go back home on weekends. On weekdays, itas just my grandma and I. I think my mum dislikes me.

"My mother and I have always had a volatile relationship. Last night she drank a bottle of red wine and when I queried her about it she became angry and went to her room and came out with her bags saying I will not stay where I am not wanted. Since she lives 7 hours drive away and was quite drunk, I blocked the door and said donat be silly youare drunk, just go to bed. She yelled at me that she would abeat me downa and ajust you try,a things escalated very quickly and we ended up in a physical situation.",1
"My parents got divorced when I was 10, I lived with my mother in a house that she bought, she used to treat me well and care for me and my older brother, but a year ago, she left us and took my young brother with her to Dubai, and every time we call her to check if sheas okay or needs anything, she screams at us crazily and says aI hope you diea, and sometimes she threatens us that sheas going to call the police if we donat leave her house, and this hurts me so much because I need her beside me and I miss the old her.",1
"I have been going out with my girlfriend for just over 3 years and have been living with her for almost a year. This is both our first proper long term relationship ans of course I love her to bits. As with the start of any relationship we were all over each other, and as things started to get more serious, it got less and less. About 3 months ago she told me about her past before she met me, and how she wasnat very lonely when she went out! She said that she wasnat very proud of it. I know she was entitled to see other people, but I hate this thought that is going through my mind (no, I didnat see other people before I met her). I was recently at her house and put on a big jumper from her wardrobe, which she asked me not to wear as it was not hers, this started it off again.",1
"Hi! I am currently a junior in high school. I am one of the top students in my class, but this year I have been doubting myself. When I am alone, another side of me comes out. It kind of scares me. This part of me is sad and tired. When I am with my family and friends, I am an outgoing, happy, and positive girl. However, if I am alone I become certain that I am a failure and will never be able to meet my standards. Iave become obsessed with the fact that if I screw up I could be kicked out of NHS and that I will not be able to renew a scholarship I have, if I have a aBa in any of my classes. I am really worried that I have too much on my plate, because in addition to my schoolwork, I am involved in my schoolas musicals, plays, participate in my schoolas Student Ambassador program, I ride horses, volunteer with various groups, and also tutor kids. I worry that I might breakdown.",1
"I chose to leave home and study abroad at boarding school when I was eight. I have been living away from family for the past 16 years. I regret this decision and blamed myself. Over the past 16 years, I have not been very happy and my personality changed but have only realized this over the past few years. Before I went to study abroad, I was happy but ever since, I am not. The older I got, the more secrets I have and the more I keep my true self to myself. My parents and teachers have always reminded that I have to be good. Ever since the first day at boarding school, I have learned to only act good and follow the rules and never to step out of lines. People/ teachers like good and trouble-free student.",1
"Iam 15 and itas my first time asking here so do please tell me if I need to fix this. I wouldave liked it private though. So anyway, Iam not sure if I could say I was molested as a child. My sister would rarely touch me, but she would make me touch her down there and do stuff a lot more. It stopped when she started puberty so when she was 11 or 12 (weare 5 years apart so around 7-ish for me) so my first question is: Was I touched/or a victim of such as a child? Now it inwardly kills me thinking about it. I feel disgusting and I am constantly scared that Iam am not a virgin (raised catholic).",1

He does not take very good care of himself and is in the process of getting a full set of dentures. He either forgets to shower or he doesnat care to shower.

He never went to college or did much at all after graduation.",1
"Iam 21-years-old, and my mother is 51. My whole life Iave been witnessing her being just crazy about collecting everything, from cans to old, warn-out clothes. As I grew, I always was the strongest one to confront her and not let her ruin our lives. But she is very manipulative when it comes to being her way. Our apartment is filled with unnecessary things, she literally has empty cans in her closet. She collects newspapers and hides them under her bed or in the basement.",1
"I am a 20 year old male. And for the last few weeks I have been suffering from extreme Derealization and fear itas something more than anxiety and stress. I am incredibly stressed because I had life goals and plans that did not happen because of me being colorblind (I wanted to join the military) I have wanted to join since a child. Since then every avenue I have chose has been rocky because of colorblindness. I experienced DR 5 months ago and since it has come and gone and I never thought anything of it. Now Iam concerned itas really something more which in turn has made it worse. I donat see or hear things, no one in my family has a mental illness. Just nothing to me feels real. Iam constantly questioning if things are real. I have weird thoughts all the time now and I get irritated rather quickly. Iam always tired from not getting good nights sleep. I my doctor told me that itas just anxiety and that itall pass. I should mention that Iave been unemployed for 7 months. I canat shake the thought of me going into a psychosis and going crazy.",1
"For the past 7 months or so, I have been feeling very irritable and upset. I notice I tend to takes things negatively almost immediately and realize I probably shouldnat. Work is stressing me out when it never used to and I have trouble staying focused and concentrating. I am supposed to be close to graduation, but I am nervous about actually being ready. I feel like my friends are hurting me and then I hurt them back but donat really mean to. My friends then ignore me and it makes me feel even worse and resentful. I feel like I only have one friend who really talks to me anymore. She thinks I should see a therapist, but it really scares me and makes me uncomfortable to be honest. My friend has offered to come with me the first time if I go. Do you think I should go and would her coming with be a good idea?(I realize I already submitted something, I sent it ahead of when I finished by accident).",1
"I am currently going through a lot of confusion. I became close friends with a girl (Letas call her G) with whom I shared a deep emotional and intellectual connection even though there was no physical attraction initially. However our emotional intimacy led us to start dating. We dated for a few months and I found G to be an amazing, caring, supportive woman. I found in her a lot of characteristics that I find in my mother. We are very different as individuals in terms of our likes and dislikes but there was a deep bond we both felt.",1
"Iam 15 and Iam too scared to go to a doctor just in case its hormones or Iam just being a drama queen but somethingas different. I am usually an extremely outgoing person thatas always grinning like an idiot and loving to be around people but for the past few weeks its different. Iave been snappish, irritant and the only thing I want to do is go home and sit in a dark room. Just sit. Not listen to music or go play a game, just sit and stare out of the window. Some of my friends have said things that while may bother me sometime, wouldnat normally warrant a reaction. But Iave told a few friends to Fuck off or that I hate them, which I donat! Iam also sad so often of the time and I feel like nobody wants me around and that Iam worthless. My self esteem is literally on the floor.",1

"My mother has had a terrible childhood. Her father was always drunk and she witnessed him beat her brothers because he was jealous that his wife (my momas mother) was paying too much attention to them. My mother also grew in intense poverty (she fixed her shoes with cardboard and got beaten when the cheap things could not longer be used.

He is funny, sweet, a hard worker, smart, and my best friend. There have been times in our relationship (previous to moving) that he has had angry outbursts.

Anyways, I was sleeping and felt like someone was watching me. So, I opened my eyes a little and saw my dad, just standing there. Watching me. I immediately moved my hand away and exhaled like as if I was still sleeping. And the worst part was that I wasnat covered in my blanket. I quickly grabbed my blanket and just waited for him to leave.",1
"I found that I cannot be in any relationship even though I would love to have one. I have never been in any relationship because I always end up any form of relationship after 2 weeks. I often feel lonely and when I meet new guys I believe that it might work. They are all perfect. I canat see any defects. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of dating I always get bored and all my partners become one big failure.

More handsome, more educated, more interesting.",1

My grandmother is at the age of 70s. She is over dominating and enjoys when she creates disputes in the house everyday. She does not feel any shame publicizing family matters openly and badly abusing family members. She has superiority complex for no reason. We have tried talking to her a lot regarding this but when we try to discuss the problem she changes the topic or starts fighting aggressively. During fights she never gets physical but instigates us to harm her through her words so that she can prove to our relatives that we are the ones treating her badly. She tries to act innocent and make us appear bad in front of others and gain sympathy. She gets jealous when my dad buys something for me or my mum and has the habit of demanding the same thing immediately. As soon as someone arrives home from anyplace she pretends to cough and roams around the house to peak what he/she has brought.,1

She claims to stay due to financial reasons and due to the children being young. They are all able adults now but she still stays with him. He barely works and goes out of state frequently to visit his other woman. He comes and goes as he pleases. The woman truly baffles me on how much she lets the bastard walk all over her.

His second oldest brother has three sons but the mother of the sons and him are not married and they are volatile towards each other.",1

"When I was little, my sister, who was my best friend, would do things like start a club with her imaginary friend and exclude me from it. When we were older, at our church, there were plenty of people her age to hang out with.

A new convert came into our church that was my age, but she was allowed to hang out with these older friends because they wanted her to have friends since she was new. Again I was excluded. Today, I feel these same feelings as I deal with people in life. As soon as I feel a little bit rejected (which I probably magnify) I exclude myself and then feel jealous and bitter toward them. How do I get over these childhood events so that it will not affect my relationships with people around me? Thank you!",1

I have become more and more in need of torturing something that I have decided to torture insects. I have lost all interest in making friends and have just become a social outcast (Iam homeschooled so at least I donat have a ton of people around me).

"Iam about 18, and I just entered college, and Iam feeling real good about myself, after battling low self-esteem issues throughout my school years. Everything is always going great, until I ask my sister for a favor. Keep in mind that she just turned 13, but she has such a bad attitude, especially towards me. For some unknown reason, she is extremely rude to me, and denies me many things, despite the fact that I have practically provided her help with homework, her school, I taught her many things, such as reading and math from the books, so she could advance. Sheas never acted this way towards our older siblings at all, in fact she has treated them with much respect.

My family has told me that it was out of anger, but whether thatas true or not, what I said to her was unacceptable on any level. Because of my anger issues, when my wife asks me a question or makes a statement to me, she feels that when I respond to her, I have a an attitude, or I am edgy in my responses.

I can feel myself doing it, it just takes me a second to snap myself out of it a (this is not the case when Iam not focused on something, situations where Iam watching a movie or in the shower I find myself fall into this blank empty feeling, Iam not sure how much time passes before i snap myself back into reality). The flashbacks can be something that happened 10 minutes ago or 10 years ago. They can be upsetting or happy. For example, they can be as intense as remembering crying when my grandmother passed away, or as meaningless as remembering mopping the floor at work. When these flashbacks happen i feel like for that moment Iam no longer in reality, itas as if Iam living in the memory. Once the short few seconds are over I can go right back to my task as if it never happened.",1

It left multiple scars on the side of my face and neck along with my inner bicep.

I have a older brother and a older sister. My sister got married so it was only me and my brother to take care of everything. In the past year or so It has become increasingly difficult because my mum depends on me emotionally and wants me to sit and talk to her all the time. I look after the store and try to maintain a work life balance. But my mum wants me to look after the house the store and herself aswell. I get stressed out easily now. And my mum has mood swings and sometimes has a outburst saying she wants to die. And I know itas wrong but sometime I think when mum gets angry if she passed away my life would be easy. I can go out with friends without worrying about my mums reactions. I feel really guilty ? Am I being selfish in thinking that way?,1

"My three year old stepson will burst into tears at random moments. He says he canat help it, and when we ask him whatas wrong he says nothing. When we ask if he is happy or sad or mad or scared, he usually answers that he is happy. He will cry during a meal, playtime, family time, or when watching cartoons. At first we thought it might be attention seeking, but we donat give him attention when he does it. We just send him to his room and tell him to come out when he calms down. This has been ineffective, and I donat know what to do. He turns four next month and has trouble communicating still. This could be due to ear infections and tubes, but the crying isnat.

In the last couple of months when a tense or stressful situation has presented itself to me; my heart starts to race, my head get hot and light, my hands donat stay still and I smile, make an excuse just to walk away. Itas gotten to the point that deciding which course for college I should choose or turn down is pushing me into panic.

In the mornings I donat want to get up because Iam afraid of being stressed out. Itas ruining my life.",1
"I have been in my teachers class for about a year now. Just three days ago, he gave me his number in case I was having any problems and needed to talk. I texted him two days ago and asked him for advice. It was fine in the beginning but then he started telling me he cared about me and he asking if my body was all natural. I flipped out and deleted the messages. Then I sent him a text back telling him he shouldnat be doing stuff like this. He started saying how he needed help and that he wasnat a role model. I told my mom ad she called the police. The police couldnat do anything because I deleted the initial texts. The school could so though. The worse thing that could happen to him is him lose his job. I havenat been able to feel like me since then. Iave been crying all the time. He was a very loved teacher at my school. I just want to be happy and feel like myself again help?",1

I tried talking to him last night to ask him if he would consider talking to a psychiatrist about these issues and he claims heas fine. Iave done as much research as possible on his wild stories to see if there is any truth in them and there simply is none but he is convinced that they did happen.

"Me and my wife, both love each other dearly. But our problem always stems to a sort of PMS or PMDD syndrome, where she fixates on what irritated her(which is really nothing) & blames/nags me about it, then goes to my past & how disappointed she is for marrying me, and makes our lives to a point of being miserable, without any solution but separation. I know I could easily blame PMS for this, but on here case its a lot more severe. She will pretty much yell and say hurtful things, and everything gets blown out of proportion if I say a word. Actually, even if I kept quiet while sheas having an episode, things will still get out of hand, threatening to leave me and slam or throw everything she can get a hold of. But after her episode, she will resort back to being loving, compassionate & happy. She said she knows about it, but she canat help herself.",1
Ever since middle school Iave had these thoughts and feelings that everything I looked at didnat seem real. It seemed fake. As if I was living in a game. As I got older to where I am now I feel as if I really am living in some other type of reality. The things I look at arenat real. The people Iam around arenat real. Nothing is real. Sometimes I feel like I Iam not even real. Lately Iave also been having these thoughts and dreams about killing people. Just to see whatas real and not. I feel like Iam going to lose control of myself. And I canat find myself to care. As if every day that goes by more and more nothing seems to matter since nothing is real. What is wrong with me?,1

Just a brief history: My sister is younger but much larger. Sheas often had problems with obesity, while Iam very small. This has caused problems between us. Our parents got divorced about eighteen months ago, and itas been very difficult. My sister had a hard time because the courts made her live with our dad part time and my mom just got full custody of her.",1

"I keep having weird times (that do not correspond with my period) where I am really happy, alternating with times where I think I am worthless and do not want to do anything but sleep or isolate myself. An example is just last week when I stayed up all night or maybe two nights and finished 6 collages, created lyrics for songs, sang, made poetry and read a lot and was very sociable. The whole day I talked to everyone, laughed a lot and was overall very excited to create things and everything. It was really great and I felt amazing. Now, just a couple days later, I am just tired and I do not want to talk to anyone, or even be alive at all. I donat know if Iam just normally stressed with school or if itas serious. I just feel like crying all day too and a couple weeks ago I just cried in bed for little to no reason. Iam also very irritable and mean. This has been going on almost all year and Iam just trying to pick up on it more.",1
It all started 4 years ago in 6th grade. I transferred to a new school because it had a really good magnet program. I used to make A-B honor roll every year until then. I began get Cas on my report card and my mom began to act differently towards me. She yelled at me more and blamed me for almost everything. After that I have been getting Cas and no matter what I do my mom still treats me badly. Even if she sees this I might get into a lot of trouble.,1

Iam always angry, sad, helpless, hopeless, suicidal but have never really harmed myself; just once that I pressed a knife down the veins beneath my palm. Iave had rough relationships. All I want to do now is sleep and eat. But there are other times where I just want to run away very far and never come back. I really donat have a lot of friends, a best friend who can be here for me. No one seems to understand me. Iam lonely in all this tumult. My whole family ignores me from time to time. They sometimes donat even like having me around. Iave picked up on some habits. I trust way too easily, very naive. I know Iave made mistakes in the past, and I have apologized to my parents, but they donat care. They keep bringing up the past and push me down every single day.

"I just feel sick around people, when i was a kid i did hang out and all, until one birthday party of my friend, i got invited to it and everyone laughed at me and threw stones at me as i was walking home, that was when i was around 11 years old, since then (im 17 now) i havenat left my house, of course i go to school, but thats it, sure i hang out with people at school, we make jokes, noone makes fun of anyone, we all get along. But i feel sick the entire time, like a painfull feeling in my stomach, i dont know how to explain the feeling, its like really uncomfortable. I enjoy being alone and talking over skype with my friends, but to go out with someone to talk face to face, id rather not. I dont know why im like this and it makes my mother REALLLLY sad ( kinda the main reason i came here )",1
"For the past few months Iave been feeling really sad and emotional for no reason. The littlest things make me cry, I cry at night sometimes before bed but I donat know what Iam crying about. I find myself staying up watching movies because when I attempt to fall asleep my mind starts racing with things that stress me out, when I finally do fall asleep itas hard to wake up because I donat want to start my day and when I do get up Iam just negative and sad. I cut back on alcohol a lot, I use to drink heavily every weekend but I havenat drank for almost a month now, I wasnat planning on cutting down I just havenat been feeling like drinking lately and Iave been having really short term memory about everything. I use to be very social and loved going to events but now I avoid going anywhere that might have a lot of people like the mall on the weekends.

"I have had a very rocky path since finishing university 3 years ago. I have been unable to settle down in one place geographically or professionally, largely due to my desire to keep a relationship with my now ex boyfriend together.

"I think I am a sociopath I feel empty most of the time and mostly feel anger or anxiety if anything. I workout and eat healthy only to look good an make others jealous of me. I often envy others and when Iam not complimented on my looks I get upset inside. I fantasize about killing those close to me and the kids who bully me in school. I lie often and usually insult those around me in order to make myself feel better. I have been called antisocial, sociopathic and arrogant by family members. I usually think highly of myself yet I take criticism badly and become very angry or hostile. I usually laugh at what other people would find serious like a person dying and talk about things that sometimes make me look weird. I think this all happened because my mother died when I wad eleven and because my dad isnat involved with me often and is usually angry with me when Iam around him.Also because Iam frequently picked on at school which makes me paranoid often.",1

Awhile back I was under so much stress I just kinda snapped, now I cant feel the way I used to I no longer have any kind of conscious and my emotions are gone.The weird thing is I now enjoy violence a lot more than I used to.I mean all young men like violence but I often get the urge to kill things out of the blue, for instance a couple weeks ago I couldnat help but to really wanna kill a goose so caught it and smashed it head with a rock.I donat know what changed me but in one sense I kinda like it my life is a lot easier ever since but still should I be worried?",1

Sheas about 3 weeks back on the meds but her old symptoms have popped up. (I donat know the psychological terms, but she thinks that certain people are constantly talking about her and plotting against her. So she lashes out at them, mostly through emails and texts, admonishing them for their actions. None of them are actually doing anything so it creates a lot of family tension and anger. She tries to hide most of this behavior from me. And when I challenge her on the validity of her accusations, she tries to change the subject, gets really angry, or accuses me of being in on whatever conspiracy is at hand. The things she believes these people are saying about her, are very close to the stresses that she currently has in her life. Besides this, she seems visibly agitated, upset and has trouble focusing.",1

I have adopted the kids and we are raising them very intentionally as one family. I love them all and that is our commitment to them. It has not been easy handling a family of this size. My husband and I work very hard to do it well but we are doing it and everyone is doing well. The problem I have is with my Mother in law. She treats her non biological grandchild ( she actually does not consider them grandchildren at all) distinctly differently. (examples: from not displaying pictures of them, unequal gifts, unfair discipline, general lack of interest to outright directly unkind treatment). I have noticed this for years and hoped it fade. The kids are all very good and loving children and love each other as full siblings for which I am very proud.",1

"Hello, Iam a 15 year old girl and lately Iave been having these mixed up feelings all the time. I donat know what do I exactly feel but it always pricks me, makes me want to cry and then it leads to making me feel useless because whatever I try to do ends up wrong. Whatever situation I try to handle turns out more messed up. I just feel Iam good for nothing. My friends probably donat care about me. I just keep feeling lonely all the time. I need someone to care for me, someone to understand me. Iave tried making friends but whenever I just start trusting them, they tend to break it. No matter wherever I go or to whosoever I talk to I keep feeling lonely, I keep feeling that I want to cry. I just donat know why is this?It has never been like this before. These feelings have developed all of a sudden and it doesnat let me concentrate on anything not even my studies. What can I possibly do to get these feelings out?",1

I donat have trouble making friends or getting along with people. When I meet someone that I feel is very genuine and easygoing I often feel very close to that person right away, but later the friendship fades and then I feel as if the closeness I thought I had with the person is an illusion. I have no people in my area that I spend time with regularly, and am not only extremely lonely, but have no sense of personal direction or interests that have any meaning to me. I am an attractive young woman, but canat interest a man in a relationship, not even a boyfriend that is undesirable to me. I am so bored and disillusioned with everything at this point in my life that I donat even feel like a real person. This has been a pattern that has been building since childhood.Is it possible I could live a normal life if I got psychotherapy?",1

"My daughter is 3, turning 4 in September. Sometimes when we tell her no, raise our voices towards her, or sometimes for reasons we just canat figure outashe will start crying uncontrollably. It isnat a tantrum or a fit, sheas not screaming or kicking. She just cries and sobs and needs to be held. She canat or wonat tell us whatas wrong, she just says aI donat knowa. Weall run through the list, aAre you sad/mad/scared/unhappyaetca, and she says no to all of it. Then sheall just tell us she doesnat know, and afterwards she seems fine. Other than these episodes she is extremely happy, very silly, laughs A LOT and makes us laugh as well, and generally is a very joyful and wonderful girl. Iam concerned that maybe her emotions are overwhelming her, or that she doesnat know how to express them sometimes and they build up in her. Any advice or insight would be appreciated, I just want to know if my baby girl is going to be ok. Thank you for your time.",1
i think i need a mental evaluation because i have a lot of social issues. i often appear awkward or stupid to others because i donat know how to respond to them on the spot. its almost like i think too slow or canat completely pay attention to or understand what they are saying. i often zone out or daydream and i have a habit of saying awhat?a every time someone asks or tells me something because it gives me an extra few seconds to get what theyare saying.,1
"I have been in a relationship for around 18 months. The girl I am with is wonderful for me. However lately I donat awanta to be around her, and literally want her to leave the longer I am with her, such as for a weekend. It helps a bit when we spend time apart, but the more time we spend together the more I quite literally need her to leave, so much so that I get disgusted to kiss her or do anything else. I do not think this is fair to her, and want these feelings to go away but they have not for a couple months now. She fits everything that I thought I awanteda but now Iam so confused. Should I end it permanently? Weave already tried getting in better shape, trying to be spontaneous and things like that. I care so much about her and I donat want to have to change her completely just to get this feeling to go away. What do I do?",1
"I am a 17 year old boy currently studying for my University exams. My lessons are being affected by my mum (51) who is having Psychological disorders. She used to be a very calm person and used to spoil me as a kid but now she is acting very strangely. She can insult people very harshly, especially plummers and sellers swearing to them when something is wrong and she can go mad at anyone for the smallest thing. My grandma asked her to stay and help her and when she came home she threw the chairs wildly into the air, she said to me I am a complete useless boy when I only asked her if I could go out. She even forgot about that later on and acted as if nothing happened (this is continuously occurring).",1
"Iam acquainted with somebody and not sure what Iam dealing with. He never seems to express anger even when anger is appropriate, and he makes gender-oriented comments towards women that are superficially conversational but otherwise quite demeaning. For example, heall bring up a teacher he had in high school (17 yrs ago) and describe her as a afeminazia because of a comment she made about a gym bag being brought to class being a aguy thinga.

"I babysat my now 5 year old niece a lot when she was an infant and toddler. Early on her behavior didnat seem quite normal. Other people speculated she might be autistic. Itas tough to describe the problem as most children get upset about things. The issue is that odd things make her upset. She doesnat like it when things get moved. She doesnat like loud noises like the vacuum. She wonat let you move a puzzle. She wants you to draw something or make something with playdoh and if itas not right she flips out. Sheas fine with strangers outside the house, but when someone comes over she flips out. Sometimes even if itas someone she knows.",1
"ignore, confront, tell my boss, etc. There seems to be no point even telling a boss because they often do it too and I canat keep a job because of this ongoing torment! I canat take legal action for workplace harassment or slander because no one is willing to testify and I canat get any proof. The worst part is no one has the guts to say it to my face, they are two-faced and whisper (some shout) and laugh behind my back! It reminds me that humans are inherently evil and ignorant and the tactic that many have used since the Roman empire that if you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it to be the truth. Hitler did it and the modern U.S. government uses the same tactic too. It has gotten to the point where life has been complete hell and the only solution I can think of is violence (I wonat go into detail). What do I do? Ignoring isnat an option because it seems to only encourage them and I canat keep going from job to job, because this follows me like a curse!",1

"Hi, Iam a sophomore in college right now and Iam becoming more aware that I might have a mental illness. I do not know which one I have, however. When I was younger, I questioned if somebody was controlling me, if there was someone thatas making me do the things I did. There was a voice inside my head arguing against me. I thought it was just plain puberty, but that is probably not the case. As I grew older, I started to have more disturbing thoughts inside my head as well, like murder and beheading people. I thought it was just puberty striking here again. In addition, I frantically worry about my health. I was scared that my mental cognitive ability would decline and that I would get AIDS virus. I was frantic and checked to see if I would have any of the symptoms. I also thought about people plotting against me, and if my food contained poison.",1
"Hi, Iam 14 years old and in the 8th grade. I came here because my anger has been really overwhelming me and causing problems. Like usually when Iam angry I think about hurting these people in horrible ways or hurting myself sometimes even and this scares me a lot. Iave even thought about killing someone and planned it out in my head and this is terrifying to me? I mean its something Iad never actually do like I couldnat probably bring myself to do it because I am not a violent person whatsoever, but i definitely think it. I think maybe itas because Iam young or if thereas another possible problem I really want to know. Iave told my mom sometimes I think violent things when Iam really angry, but I never elaborated off that. Iam scared sheall send me to some mental institution or something. I just want to stop thinking like this. Iam scared that one day I just might act on it.",1

Everything went fine for a while, but I am starting to have second thoughts and it shames me to do so because she is such a wonderful woman.",1
"I really like and respect my therapist. He is 27 and still in school to finish is masters. He is very handsome, smart, and charming. At least I think so. Iam wondering what is appropriate in a professional relationship. I know he tries to build my self esteem by saying that Iam very smart and saying I look nice here and there. But he has told me that he looks forward to Mondays and to our alittle sessionsa together on 3 different occasions now. It seems like a very sweet gesture. Then the next session he gets serious and usually brings papers and exercises to complete that seems like heas not present. Iam aware of transference so I donat tell him how much I enjoy him, even though I really like him as a person. I donat want him to get in trouble and I would never do anything to hurt him. But is it inappropriate? We are a lot alike, and he has said that several times as well. Any advice or input will help. Thank you for your time.",1

I feel I have lost all sense of hope and my life is going nowhere. I feel useless in everything I do, I just want to leave all my problems behind and leave for some place else. I have great qualifications however it seems no employer wishes to look upon them. I love nothing more than sitting alone in my room wishing the world away and ignoring anything social.

I did a aSanity Scorea and the result shocked me.",1
"I am an introvert. I have known this for a couple years. I had no problem with it, until what happened at school the other day. My class had to take a personality test. Of course I got introvert. When we were standing in line to showA our school counselor, a girl standing behind me saw that I was an introvert. She immediately said aAw, youare an introverta. I just kind of nodded. When I got to my seat, I saw that I was the only person in my class who was an introvert. It is really hard to be an introvert in high school. My friends donat realize why it is so important for me to have time by myself. I also hate it when we have to give a presentation for class. I have to give one next week and I am DREADING it. I love the topic, but I get so nervous when I have to speak in front of the class. Why does it seem that nobody gets why I would rather write a report or read than stand up in front of my class?",1

But now he has been wanting to touch between my legs and he laughs and says aIam touching your penis.a I simply tell him to stop and that we do not act like that. He has also been saying atouch my penis!a to me and my husband. We just correct him and tell him we do not do that. This situation has slowed down a lot he only does this occasionally.

Three times I can remember. I cry over this, Iave talked to her and she flat out does NOT want to talk about anything. I feel she chose to stay with my dad instead of protecting me.

I was going to take a whole bunch of students to the staff hockey game, a coworker who I like very much didnat think it was fair that I would be handling all of those kids, the other two teachers whose classes I was taking have a reputation for being kind of selfish.

Recently though everything single thing my husband does is criticized. This includes our choice of house that we purchased, his parenting skills, his lack of education, and more.

Her parents are a little more understanding and supportive while mine on the other hand arenat taking it so while.

There is a girl in my class and itas fair to say she isnat happy. I saw this in the second lesson I began teaching that class and the reason Iam writing this is because of something she wrote.

She seems very vacant and doesnat appear to be paying attention most of the time. Iave been working at the school for 1 and a half years and I remember once she came in to school under the influence of alcohol and was sent home.

He can be happy now and 2 seconds later heas angry, and then happy again, and then melancholic, and so on. I tried to convince him to see a therapist but he refused. I tried to integrate him in new circles of people, but it was worthless. Recently he also shows signs of self pity, envy and / or sometimes narcissism, which is a weird enough combination even for a non-expert like me.",1
"Hello, I really need some help. I feel so desperate right now. For a very long time now, probably over a year, I have been having these really disgusting homicidal thoughts about my own mother. I absolutely hate the fact that I would even think such things about the woman who bought me into the world and I wish i could stop but I just canat. Today we had a row and it resorted in my mum grabbing me by my hair, forcing me to the floor and stamping on my head. I literally then and there had the thoughts to kill her, get a knife and just kill her. I know this is probably normal in a situation like this but other times i lay in bed and I just imagine pushing my mum down the stairs and watching her die or I sit in lesson and I just get distracted by thoughts of hitting her over the head with something and her bleeding to death. I hate these thoughts and I want them to stop. Tonight I have barricaded myself in my bedroom.",1
My daughter(17) has been dating a boy for 11 months. The entire family loves him. He is polite and respectful and shows her love and tenderness. I would approve of her marrying this young man (nearly 18). Two days ago he told her that there was something heas never told her. He wanted to kill someone. Not anyone in particular. He wanted to feel the power he would have to determine whether someone lives or dies.,1

"I really donat know what to do. I canat handle all the things that come with being social, having friends; like texting with them, hanging out with them. I always think they will be mean to me, hurt me, etc. I always think theyare mad at me and just donat like me. Iad much rather be alone with my boyfriend, without any other friends. My boyfriend is the only person I trust and Iam not anxious around. The problem is when Iam alone, I think everybody is looking at me like Iam not normal, like Iam not worth anything.",1
"Iam 43 and my boyfriend and I have been dating for 4+ years. Heas 50 and never been married. On one hand, heas been wonderful. A loving, generous, thoughtful caregiver. Responsible, well rounded person, great sense of humor. On the other hand, he is controlling, sometimes condescending, speculates negatively about me, doesnat seem to trust me though he says he doesaa there is usually some sort of conflict between us. I am often left feeling confused and a little fearful, though he has never been physically abusive. He is hyper-sensitive, and can be hyper-critical, though he has improved considerably over the years, through much of his own personal work.",1

We have been together ever since.",1
"Hi, I am 32 old man and have been a relationship with a woman for 4 years who is 31. We got engaged about 1 years ago.I have been having very confusing thoughts since I proposed. Sometime I feel very happy to be with her, sometimes I feel I made a mistake to get engaged. I sometime feel that I have a wonderful woman and sometime I think to myself I can do better. When I see friends who have better looking girlfriends or wives I get extremely upset that I donat have an equally better looking partner.",1
"My husband and I took care of our grandson up til he was two. We tried to follow all rules and routines my son and his wife had set for us, yet if the baby fussed at night they were suspicious about what we had done during the day.Though I felt hurt,but for the sake of the child,I didnat walk out on them.Instead,We would explain and my daughter-in-law seemed accepting our apology politely,and I thought she gradually accepting us as part of the extended family.",1
I told my ex about the lie after months of carrying on the lie. He was with me through false pretenses of me being asicka and has now cut off all contact with me. His family has informed me that they will file restraining orders if I contact him. I need help for myself. But I also donat think any amount of therapy will help without him in my life to help me through it. What can I do to get him to understand that I have problems and I need help and support?,1
"Iam not sure how to deal with my boyfriends anger outbursts. Iam 24 and heas 25 and Iave been with him for 5 months. Over this time, I have learnt a lot about him including his many hurts and issues within his family since childhood, his violent upbringing and his criminal past and violent tendencies, to name a few. His last relationship (where he had a daughter who is now 6 years old) was not a good one, with both of them having domestic violence orders over each other. My boyfriend has since dealt with his anger issues by seeking counseling and anger management and feels now he knows how to handle things better.",1
"I have been with my fiancA for 5 years, we got engaged 2 years ago. We planned a wedding and then everything fell apart.

"I am terrified of people and situations I canat control. I am always having vivid dreams about a time in the world when I and my family will be taken and tortured without dying. I wake up hyperventilating, and sometimes even throw up. I am afraid to send my son to school. I also feel like I am not really here. I entertain the thought that maybe I am in a coma somewhere and have made up this entire life? I donat really feel any emotions except pure panic and fear. I want to be happy, but I donat feel happy. I donata feel anything. Not really. Itas like Iam watching myself from somewhere else. Sometimes I canat even control what I am doing, even though I know I shouldnat be doing it. My husband is even getting tired of me. I have never harmed anyone or myself physically, and will never do that. I am not suicidal.",1

"My childhood was pretty rocky; there was lots of moving around, my father was involved in dangerous illegal operations that often put us in traumatizing situations, so once my mother passed it felt like a lot of emotions I had tried really hard to let go of and control came spilling over into my life again. After she died I felt like a very critical part of me died with her. I have a hard time distinguishing friends from foes. I used to be very empathetic but now I feel really detached emotionally from people. I feel like I have a harder time reading them. This has added to my mistrust of people. Recently, I was upset at my boyfriends sister because she blew me off while I was trying to tell her something. She later told me she was sorry and that she was just grumpy from the morning. Later that day I discovered texts between my bf and her talking behind my back. It hurt me deeply because I thought the apology was sincere and now I feel my feelings are disregarded and I canat go back and talk to him about that.",1
HI there. I have a dental practice and have been practicing for 18 years now. My problem is that my self esteem is not what it needs to be.

"Since I can remember, I have had an awful relationship with my mother. I have never really felt love from her, only resentment. I think it May have something to do with the fact that she hates my father for no reason. Anyway in all my adult relationships I have not been able to connect to the other person emotionally. Iave never seen my mom be a nurturing or caring person and I fear that I have not been able to establish lasting relationships because honestly I donat know HOW to care for another person. I donat know HOW to nurture and make people feel like they matter to me. I also have two beautiful children who I donat want to feel like I donat care about them because I truly love them with all my heart. so my question to you is am I always going to be disconnected in relationships because of the relationship I have with my mom? or is there someway I can learn to be a more nurturing person?",1
"I recently started seeing a counselor at my university for relationship problems. I did an intake interview with a professional therapist and was then given to a graduate student for counseling. I am mainly working on relationship and trust problems, as I completely sabotage relationships when a person starts to get close to me. I also self harm, I burn myself. I was asked about this during the intake interview and I said that I did but I lied and said that I stopped. I was going to bring this up during a session but I donat know what would happen since she is a student. Would I have to switch therapists if I told her? What is the difference between what a professional and a graduate student can do? I know I should tell but it is really hard for me to talk and this uncertainty is making it 100 times harder.",1

Me and my cousin were like best buddies, he used to hang around me, take me to places, just two of us all time when i went to his house but he never contacted me after that even when i had accident. I remember him so much and i wonder how can he forget me? No call nothing and i guess 12 year old is mature enough. Sometimes i feel all the fun and time just two of us spent together was fake, he was never my friend. I had even seen him in dream, two of us hanging around. Really sad. Please help. thanks",1
Iave known since I was little and on up that I have not liked cursing. I find curse words offensive and see no use in them. I canat say I have not cursed before because Iave been around my family today and so many people curse. My parents use to tell us (me and my two brother) to not use that language.,1
"Ok well where do I start? I have been dealing with anxiety for about three years now. It started about 3 years ago after I interned at a hospital and was really stressed over getting hired there. I guess I should add that while working there I had to handle and clean the deceased, which was also the first time I actually saw someone who was mentally ill. At the time however it really didnat affect me or I didnat think it did. So about maybe 3 months after I finished my internship I started to worry about having a medical condition (brain tumor, brain aneurysm, HIV, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer). So my first attack came when I was googling a symptom and I raised my hand to say ahey I have thata well my husband asked me why I raised my hand and I went blank and thought there was something wrong with me because I didnat immediately say something after I raised my hand. That time I felt more of the psychical symptoms of anxiety. So the attacks lasted about maybe a month or so and then went away for a year.",1

Iam not a killer I donat think about actually killing anyone or anything but I have put this thought in my head that I will become crazy and kill someone I love. I couldnat harm a fly.. But I canat stop myself from thinking that I will go crazy like that. I think itas because I have seen to many scary movies and documentaries of serial killers. I am scared of the thought of becoming it I donat think about killing anyone and Iam afraid of even the thought of it,I even think I gave myself anxiety from worrying about this so much. What is wrong with me?",1
I am trying to figure out how to handle a situation. I have a sister who in my opinion has no boundaries. She claims that I am a sociopath and stalks me and contacts people that I associate with and tells them personal things that are not true or some are half true. But personal!! She doesnat know these people and I have even moved 5 states away from her and she continues to do torment me. But she is claiming I am the sociopath.

"Iave been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half and Iam deeply in love with him. The first few months of the relationship were blissful, as they should be, and that hasnat changed, but sometime after month 4 and saying aI love youa for the first time to each other, my brainas been a bit wacky. I have had millions of weird questions pertaining to his past relationships and his feelings and Iave found it impossible to fully trust him. He has done nothing wrong, and has supported me more than I ever thought anyone could, even though I can tell it hurts him and is beginning to weigh on him. I guess Iam constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I have never been cheated on in the past (to my knowledge), but have dated some real awinnersa. I suppose what Iam dealing with is anxiety and insecurity, but Iad like to know for sure. I want to know what I can do to trust my boyfriend, who I do believe is fully deserving of my trust. It hurts being scared and paranoid for no reason, especially with someone I care for so much. Help!",1
I have been with my boyfriend on and off for 10 years since we were 19/22 we are now 29/32 Iam older. We had resolved most of our issues and were in a great place together.

She replied by saying that someone told her this, apparently these aspecial beingsa could detect other special beings (something of the sort). I asked her whether she really could trust the words of some person and she apparently can. This was a few weeks ago. Recently, I asked her again whether she seriously thought she was part hellhound and the answer was the same. Iam not sure whether she is simply pulling my chain or not but it seems as though sheas serious. Any advice on how to handle this would be wonderful, please and thank you.",1

I just wanna get over this without causing my family pain.",1
"Iave been cutting myself for a while now. Usually the cuts are small and the bleeding stops after 2 minutes. But today I cut until I saw white flesh. The bleeding was more severe, and lasted 4-5 minutes. My problem is that I donat know when I should see a doctor for my scars?

I try to take care of my scars, but know I am not sure if I cana. Please help me.",1
" Recently, I have been feeling anxious over things that are out of my control. I tried to tell my parents and that did not turn out well. Instead its just made me feel worse about myself and what others think of me. I donat have a lot of friends and that makes my parents mad, especially my dad who always is getting on my case about how i should try to make friends and call my friends. Of course i tell him that i will try harder, but the truth is how can you try harder if you have already tried your best?",1

Through the whole year before she passed away, I was in complete denial(Iam 20) The day she passed away it was just a huge shock to me even though I knew about 3 weeks before that she was at her end and she could pass away any day from then.

"counseling, focusing on my daughter and career, exercise, dating new people, and so forth. I have contemplated moving, but with my daughteras circumstances, it would be difficult. Iave had several relationships throughout the years, but NONE like this. I still love this person, as deeply as ever. I miss her every day. I think about her non-stop. Itas been over a year and I still canat let go. Nothing Iave done seems to help. Iave stopped dating altogether because I started to realize how unfair it was to try and get emotionally involved with someone else when my mind and heart still focused so strongly on my ex. Iam tired of the pain. Iam tired of missing her. Iam tired of wanting her back every day. I realize how wrong it is for me to linger in thisabut nothing I try takes away the thoughts. Honestly, had it not been for my family and daughter, I probably would have moved as far away as possible (or worse). I really need to get past this. I just donat know how.",1
"All of my life I have felt like a fraud. I have never been comfortable in my own skin, even with family. I am the consumate outsider, never good enough, never smart or strong enough, and never confident about the things that life says I should be confident with. I have failed so many times that Iave lost count. My personal life has always been a disaster.

How can you be with me???a I always knew Iad make a bad husband, not because I was cruel, but because I canat be close. Intimacy is my enemy.

When we got home the woman he texted had gotten caught by her husband. He read everything and called my boyfriendas phone late at night while we were asleep. My boyfriend then got up and was sitting on the couch in tears in the morning and confessed. He said he has texted her naked pictures and she has sent them to him.

They tell me that I think the worlds out to get me when it really isnat and I should stop acting the way I do. Sometimes I go to my room and regret even trying to talk to them.

I got married last year and unfortunately didnat last too long only for 9 months. Our relationship was around 8 years but it was not that good. he used to cheat on me and when i tried to speak about the situation he always refused.

I donat know why!!!,1
" My mother has always mystified me. She is very uncomfortable showing her emotions, to the point where she has never said aI love youa to me, and my father sometimes forces her to say it to him. As I got older, I learned that she was different from other mothers by watching the way that mothers and daughters joked around or hugged one another. She would be uncomfortable showing affection in this way, and I have so rarely been offered any emotional support from her or been given any pearls of wisdom.",1
"I get short, testy and sometimes even angry when I get questioned by my girlfriend. I honestly think Iam never wrong (although I know I am sometimes). She is just trying to understand and I take it as a challenge. I donat want to be this way any more! I need to understand why. I wish I could be easy going and let things slide off my back. It has happened with others. She just happens to be the most frequent. I am a very anal, organized, tidy person. I am also a perfectionist. Please help me understand!",1
"My boyfriend is 31 and I met him when he was 28. He was very social and relaxed but at that time we both were going out more on the weekends and hanging out with friends. At that time we had recently started living together and I noticed how reserved and quiet he was in our home environment versus being out socially. When we were home he seemed so distracted, so much so that I felt like I would have to wave a hand in front of him to bring him back to reality. He made some drastic changes in his work life within the first year of living together like leaving a really good job to start his own company that ended up failing so he took a huge blow to his self esteem. He stopped connecting, stopped being affectionate and pushed away an intimacy and stopped pursuing me all together. I let it go for a long time because I knew how upset he was about his career and we pushed forward and he found a great new job that heas been in since.",1

"Iam concerned about my little brother. Heas 17. In public, he comes across as thoughtful, well-spoken, well-read, and almost forcefully calm. But at home, we see a completely different side of him. Heas often irritable or hostile with little cause. His eating and sleep patterns are disturbed. Iave seen him in very cynical moods where he would probably sleep for several days if our parents didnat rouse him for meals and homework. During those times he complains that he isnat creative, productive, or effective. (Jordan is an amateur writer, so I think this really bothers him.) Iave also seen him in moods of very offbeat humor, excess talkativeness, attention seeking, and high energy. This is the mood where he watches his favorite horror movies, Monty Python comedies, and musicals, cleans the entire house obsessively, swears profusely, fights with the younger brothers, tells completely inappropriate jokes, and complains about poor concentration and memory.",1

He will hold me at night as he falls asleep, kiss me upon arriving home and we are still regularly physically intimate. Although Iave had to guide him throughout the years, he is supportive and kind despite being a bit distant and unexcitable.

He is an excellent provider and we have a beautiful home, nice kids and a blessed life. What on earth is my problem then?",1

Years ago when she was first hospitalized and released, the Dr. asked me to come to out patient therapy sessions with her. In those sessions she talked about the things her voices told her to do. These were pretty scary and physically hurtful things and most often directed toward her grandchildren who were very young at time. Now she seems to have progressed even further into the disease and has great grandchildren who are very small. She lives with my brother as she is unable to live on her own now. We are all very concerned about her behavior and the anger she shows sometimes. Can the disease result in the harm of others. My mom was a gentle person but there is little to no sign of that person now.",1

Most nights I see darkness that feels like it lasts only a few seconds, but when I glance at the clock, I have slept for hours. I did not have this problem when I was younger. It seems that the more I age the fewer dreams I have. Some dreams are nice, others are disturbing. I use to have daydreams all the time also; those are gradually disappearing too. Abnormally long periods of time pass before I drift to sleep. I am literally laying in bed for hours trying to sleep. I ask my mother what I should do but all she says is to turn on my side and go to sleep. What does this all mean? My friends say Iam fine and just need more sleep. I typically sleep about 4-8 hours during the week. I could really use some guidance on how to deal with this.",1

Usually it starts around 9-10p, sometimes later, and will continue often throughout the night. I am concerned that he is either bulimic or alcoholic. He seems to binge on food, often making repeated trips to the kitchen, and hiding trash from junk food in his room. Sometimes though, it seems as if it is from drinking.

I noticed now in my 30+ I have no feeling of compassion, my friends say I have no heart. If somebody dies I don`t feel anything I have to pretend that I care.

"I guess she is my ex now, but I was in a reasonably serious relationship with a women about 20 years my senior (a subject that came with its own issues). She grew up around Redfern and Randwick in Sydney around the 70as and 80as in that time as a kid she did drugs and kicked around with some real dangerous and unstable thugs. It makes for a compelling story when spoken in detail. However despite how much we loved spending time with each other and how genuine our love for each other was. Her occasional anecdote about transporting heroine flipped a circuit in my brain, it feels like Neutron Bomb detonates in my head and I get stuck on furious! I canat understand why this offends me? This was in the past, she has a good life and sheas buried that part of her. So why am I feeling like I have to fight my own hand to stave off slapping someone that I would never EVER HURT!",1
"Iave always been self-conscious about my body. When I was 13 I gained a lot of weight and I realized I was getting stretch marks. I didnat really care back then, but when I turned 17 I noticed that I had stretch marks everywhere. I developed bulimia and anorexia at age 17.I believes I didnat want to lose weight but I wanted to get rid of my stretch marks. Well, when I turned 18 I started self-harming to cope with all the hate I felt for myself. I quit studying 2 years ago. I no longer have a social life or even get out of my room. When I do go out, I feel like a freak. I see all those beautiful girls with their gorgeous bodies, and how men turn their necks to see them. I feel awful, Inferior, useless and worthless. I have made my mind that no man will ever love me and I donat allow myself to be happy.",1

Because I have moved around so much, it is very hard for me to make close friends now and to generally trust people.

"I have been married for 10.5 years now and we have 2 amazing children. About three years ago my wife approached me and said that she was basically done with the relationship unless I changed things. I feel that I have changed those things and she still is very up and down about how she feels about me. I am absolutely lost as to what to do. I still love her very dearly and want us to continue on, she wants to try separation to see if she can handle doing it all alone and to see if she appreciates me more. I have suggested counseling again but she seems unwilling with that as well. What do I do when I want to keep moving on and working on it but she is not? She tells me that her biggest issue is that she doesnat think that she is putting me first, which in some ways I agree with, but I understand the type of person that she is and that is not her. She gets so focused on the task that nothing else is going on around her. What do I do to save my marriage?",1

"Iam starting to think there is something wrong with who I am. People seem to act coldly and distantly towards me. The group of friends that I call myself a part of donat seem to want to be around me a I only see them at school, they often make plans to go out as a group, which I only find out about after they have already been done. They openly talk about athe fun they all hada over the weekend in front of me. They donat contact me outside of school. I have tried making new friends, but people tend to treat me weirdly when I talk to them and this has made me nervous about initiating conversations. I think itas my fault, somehow, that they see something about me that I donat realise and this makes me undesirable to be around.",1

My parents and I must do anything he says, get out of the same room he is in, and not talk to him or he will go insane. He is large and throws tantrums frequently.

I was perfectly okay with this at first, but as I entered grade 7 I started thinking life and my reasons for living.",1
I for a while now have not felt fully human anymore. My friends the few I actual trust said I should get checked out but I know if they were to lock me up in manor of speaking it would make everything worse. I have for the past few years have been turning into a werewolf I know it sounds silly and stupid I cant really explain why. It happens on and off when it takes control or wants to and acouple times I have almost attacked my friends appearently and I donat really remember doing any of it. I know my friends mean well but I cant go away they are probably the only things keeping me somewhat sane. So I guess my question is if I were to get this checked out by my psychologist would I end up being well locked up?,1
"When I was in 2nd grade, I was molested by the grandfather of a neighbor, who was a couple years older than me. I donat remember all the specifics of what happened with him, but I do remember sitting on his leg while not wearing any bottoms. I remember worrying about what we were doing was wrong and saying this to him. He replied that I shouldnat worry, his granddaughter did this with him all the time.

"My Girlfriend has an obsession (she calls it passion) for the band Hanson. Sheas been a fan since she was 6, and she honestly believes that her liking of the band is a part of who she is. Like a deep, foundational part of her being. She believes that aTheyave been there for her and they are just who she is.a Obviously itas just an extreme case of fangirl, but she cannot see that. Everyone has things they love and are obsessed with (for me itas lord of the rings. Iam totally obsessed. But I know thatas it. My liking of lord of he rings has no bearing on who I am. I like Lord of the rings BECAUSE of who I am).",1

They barely talk to each other at home but in public they act like theyare okay. Last week, they started sleeping in separate beds. I begged my mom to try and instigate a dialogue with my dad about their problematic marriage. However, she just went on complaining about my father and then told me that I should talk to my father and tell him her complaints about him. I didnat do it because I canat bear hearing the both of them tell me how much they hate each other. Now I feel guilty about it and have been crying almost every night.

I also stole from my mom when we were renting a house together when I was 25, 60$. She noticed money was missing from her bank and she tried to get the bank to investigate but they never did. She did confront me about it and I lied. I truly believe she wanted the bank to investigate so she could prove that I stole from her and they would charge me.

"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for more than 3 years, and about the get married soon, he was the one that introduced me into this world, I canat help but feel that there is something wrong with this kind of passion to BDSM. I never had any desire to give control to someone else or to be the one in control + I donat get any pleasure out of feeling pain from spanking and other things. I also think that violence is never a good sign, even if itas in a small amount and never with the intent to hurt, that in itself tells my whole body and brain that this is wrong. Another reason why it feels wrong to me is because having a fetish and to have the desire to give your control to someone else feels really unhealthy, destructive and unstable, also BDSM actions and behavior seems dirty to me! Lovemaking should be pure and warm; there is no need to use other devices and material stuff to feel it.",1

We tried everything to try to get through to him before we realized and were told that there were severe personality disorders at work here. He refuses to accept there is anything wrong. aWe twist the trutha and aitas our faulta because we adonat love him anymorea. He believes his own lies. He tried marriage counseling, but he would have the therapists believing he was a victim until the rest of the family met with the therapist and set them straight on his lies. I had (what i thought) a wonderful childhood. I was a daddyas girl. I just adored the ground my father walked on. Now I wonder if I helped feed the disorders.",1

He is established with his career and has been very clear since we started dating that he has no plans or desires to ever leave the town he lives in. I understand that he doesnat want to leave because he has his career here. I was fine with this when we started dating, but now that I am maturing, figuring out who I am and trying to figure out what career field I want. I feel trapped, I want to explore and travel and maybe live in another city. But he would never consider it. I want to be with him but I feel like I am being closed off to so much potential by apromisinga to stay in my hometown forever.

My doctor wants me in hospital. I am middle aged and morbidly obese. I am also bi polar and have been medicated for the last 11 years. Before medication I was thin and healthy. I was a bit crazy and reckless and sometimes got into trouble. After I was medicated I gained 150 pounds and now have a number of health issues.

In May my mother-in-law had a stroke. She has been in a hospital or nursing home since the stroke. She has many serious health issues but she thinks that my husband and I should bring her home and care for her here. When we last visited her in the hospital she got angry and hostile with us for not bringing her home & having to remain in the nursing home. I felt really upset because we have really been trying to give her the best care. If she is really this angry & upset should we try to bring her home or should we follow the advice of the nursing home that believes my husband & I donat have the resources to care for her?,1

I hate being a smoker but staying quit is so hard and takes so much daily, minute by minute effort.",1
My partner and I have been together for 2 1/2 years now. I have a 3 year old son from a previous relationship and am currently pregnant with my second. Issues arose after my partner returned from a wedding that he was a groomsman at. I found a message on the Monday following to the bridesmaid he was partnered with. I rang him at work immediately and asked why he had messaged her and if he liked her.,1
I am writing to find a manner to cope with or gain insight into my wifeas behavior. There are probably multiple areas but I will attempt to summarize in the allotted space.,1
"Back story of my problem. When I was a child my step-father molested me. Since then, I have this irrational fear of white middle-aged men that are bigger than me. As soon as they grow elderly and feeble that fear dissipates, and up until they are middle-aged (under 40-ish) they are awesome. For the longest time I ignored my phobia, realizing that it was silly to fear every white middle aged man that crossed my path. I also know rationally that not every middle aged man is out to get me. So here is my problem today.",1
"I am unemployed since past 4 months, my previous company got shut down and this happened before as well with me. I was working as a Recruiter with a US Recruitment Firm but they closed there branch here in Mumbai due to Management shortfall. I am feeling clueless and confused about my career. I did figure out certain options that I would like to pursue further but I feel I canat do it now. I am falling short of Money to invest in a course. But Recruitment does not excites me anymore, or any job which is target orientated.",1

"My 19 year old son, just barely graduated high school. Since graduating he has had many jobs and quit each one because it was their fault. He has not gotten a new job in 6 months, he hasnat done anything about going to school , but says he wants to go to cooking school. His girl friendas mother seems to be a huge influence in his life, she acts like a teenager herself. On many occasions I have asked for her help with things concerning my son, but she does the opposite. He has pushed his family away and spends no time at home. He seems to have no desire to do anything for himself for his future and is more concerned with his girlfriendas future. She graduates this year. I have tried no pressure and pressure to get to him, I donat know what to do to get through. He avoids me and just doesnat listen to me. He yes me but I know it doesnat sink in at all.",1
"Lived an eventful life up until the summer of 2011 when I began to smoke marijuana frequently. Noticed that I began to feel emptier, like I didnat know who I was but thought it was because of the cold weather coming up(I usually get a little gloomy during winter.) I disregarded it and continued to smoke until January 2, 2012. I remember the night very clearly a I smoked up and tried to go to sleep, but my thoughts kept looping in circles and I felt that I finally convinced myself that I was insane. I felt a part of my brain shut down. When I woke up, I felt like I wasnat in my body and that everything was dream-like. I developed anxiety and itas beginning to really hinder my ability to do well in school and social interactions frighten me. I feel like everybody hates me. I feel like I donat know who I am anymore and there is no purpose to continue feeling like this.",1
"( I am sixteen years old. I have a little sister who is five years old, and a little brother who is fourteen years old. Yesterday, my parents got into the biggest fight theyave ever had. It was absolutely horrible. There was screaming, yelling, name-calling, pushing and shovingayou get the picture. At this one point, I even told my dad that I hated him, which was an ain the momenta, frustration-fueled sort of thing. My brother was in tears and was sobbing about how he wishes he wasnat born into an Indian family (because we are), and my poor baby sister was crying helplessly, watching the fight unfold.",1
"I was incredibly unhappy living with my mom and step dad, so after quite a struggle I moved away from the area Iave always lived in. I am now currently living with my grandparents. She for some reason thinks that I need to be raised, though Iave all ready grown up. She is relentlessly controlling and doesnat even want me to stay with friends on a Saturday. I have no privacy either, she goes through my things when Iam not around.",1
"Hello, I am inquiring about the plausible causes of some symptoms that I have experienced. Sometime during my prepubescent years, I believe to have had mild auditory hallucinations. Beginning shortly after laying my head down on a pillow at night, it often sounded like two people were conversing in the distance. It was never coherent, and when I would pick my head up to try and listen, it would abruptly stop. This was a common occurrence for a couple of years, but is rare to happen now. However, I still do experience mild auditory hallucinations from time to time. It seems as if I perceive them as an outside stimulus, rather than hearing it ain my heada. Occasionally I will hear someone calling my name (when no one actually is), doors being opened or closed (even if there is no one else in the house), or the distinct sound of this really noisy fan that has not been in use for quite some time now.",1
" I have a 5 year old daughter who is extremely shy! She attended Pre-K last year and is currently in Kindergarten at the same school. Sheas always been the type of child to take longer to warm up to situations and does not initiate with other kids on her own. However, I never tended to worry much about it and decided to just give her time to feel more comfortable, as she had just started school. However, this school year, the behaviors are still the same. At first, she was so shy, that she did not even speak in school (to peers or teacher). I immediately started working very closely with the teacher on getting her to feel more comfortable and together came up with some ideas (ex. brought in her pet gerbil to share) and these things actually worked and she began to talk more in class (at first in a whisper and then in a normal tone). I was so excited about her progress with the talking, but that initial progress kind of regressed a bit.",1
"Iam a 22 year old man who just canat figure things out. I havenat had a bad life, nor have I experienced any severe trauma in my life to trigger this, but Iave been unhappy for years now. In high school, I began to experience strong feelings of self-loathing and loneliness, as well as paranoia. I felt that everyone, even my friends, didnat really careaThat they all thought I was just some joke and laughed at me behind my back. The feelings came and went, but it still affected me pretty hard. I canat remember exactly when in my teen years that I began to self-mutilate, but it was a practice that has carried on into adulthood. Thereave been aclean periods,a but it still comes back.",1

"Hi! Please note that I am perfectly sane, I got a normal amount of friends, Iam social, and I am quite happy. What is bothering me is something I did 4 years ago, and I am wondering why I acted in such a disgusting way. I used to live with my mother back then, and she wasnat very well so I belive that may be the cause but that doesnat change the fact what I did. I will cut to the point a one time when me and my brother was visiting my grandparents we shared the same rooma and I masturbated in front of him. I have chosen to forget it because I donat know what came into me but now 4 years (when I was 12-13, and he was 10-11) later Iave been wondering why my brother never talks to me, is it because of that, or is it just because heas a teenager? Iave been praying to god that he has forgotten it all.",1
I dont know if I have a problem or not but I want to make sure. I get angry easily and snap at my sister or mom a lot. And I always end up feeling guilty. I canat control myself sometimes. Several times Iave punched walls and messed up my hand or put a whole in the wall. I usually do this when Iam alone. I never seem to be in control with my emotions. I always end up crying at night and fall asleep like that. I always thought it was around my period but frequently itas all the time.,1
"My husband and I have been married for 25 years. The last two years we have gone through bankruptcy, a short sale, our autistic son becoming physically violent with us, and losing most of our retirement savings in the stock market. For the last 8 months my husband has becoming increasingly distant. He works out twice a day coming home after midnight every night and usually I am asleep so I donat see him. He doesnat call me during the day anymore. He gets up very early to go to the gym so I donat see him in the morning either. We are not intimate. He recently put a pass code on his phone and when I recently asked to use it to retrieve a phone number he told me that he deletes all calls from his call log so that I couldnat use it. I am afraid he is having an affair, but cannot find any concrete proof. I feel like I am losing my mind at times with worry.",1

We werenat thinking and I ended up in a situation where I was his VERY young (21) mistress. Heas the love of my life, but he already has children a something Iave wanted of my own. They are sons roughly my age, and one is VERY rude and troubled. I was scared that he wouldnat want to have children with me in the future, so I left. Later that week he finally separated from his wife, like he kept saying he would.",1

" Ok so my boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year. When we met it was love at first sight (as cheesy as it sounds) and I knew I wanted to be with a man like him in the future. We met 3 days before I was going home across the country. I had been in another state for my junior year of college and we met the beginning of that summer. He didnat go to college. We spent 3 great days together and before I left he asked me to be his girlfriend. I initially agreed, but then he told me he had something that I might be uncomfortable with, he had a baby with his ex girlfriend. I told him I couldnat date someone with a kid, but agreed to remain friends. I learned the baby was born 2 months before we met, and he wanted a paternity test because she had been cheating with multiple guys. It ended up being his.",1

My past 2 relationships I messed up, the 1st one was for 3 years, and during that time I was living with my dad,he lost his job for over a year and we had no money and became very reliant on him he broke up with me when I needed him most.

There are quite a few girls I am friendly with at school, but itas not like I call them up to hang out during my free time. I have always been really shy and not one to talk much.

"A close friend told me in March that she has had social phobia/anxiety for over 4 years. I was stunned by her revelation. She has always been reserved in general. She is in the medical profession with advanced degrees and is generally a pleasant, but very driven person. She had started some therapy due to becoming physically ill before some meetings, even if she knew the attendees. Since January, she has taken about 30 days of sick time, which isnat a problem as far as work goes. This is unheard of for her! She travels a great deal with her work and last Saturday started to become unhinged. I drove over an hour to meet her since we now live a couple of hours apart. Saying she was distraught doesnat do it justice. I literally held her for hours, getting her to a place where she could let it out. This went on all night at a hotel. The next day, she was more herself and we went our separate ways and I felt okay with that. I was prepared to follow her back to her city if need be.",1
" Ever since my husband and I got married, I have been very unhappy in this relationship. I feel like Iam married to a teenage boy who is used to getting his way without giving anything back (he is an only child and was raised in a very permissive environment).

"Okay, so Iave been talking to this boy for about 2 months now and as far as I was concerned everything was perfect. Heas totally successful, smart, funny, and everything Iam attracted to in a guy.

I keep so much to myself. It brakes me. I believe my dad is Bi-Polar & has anger issues, witch could be a reason why I get mad very easy. I hate my body so much! Iam fat! Im very insecure.

"My grandmother was schizophrenic. Sometimes I wonder if I could be mildly schizophrenic. When I was 13, after receiving a OUIJA board, I became convinced, for about a year, that I could use the OUIJA board just by imagining it. Then I thought the spirit was communicating with me by making me spell things out in sign language, or write things. I became very frightened about this, to the point of having nightmares and feeling sick, and I would pray for the aspirita to leave my body. Strangely, it eventually went away and I forgot about it. For many years I believed this really did happen. When I grew up I realized it could not have been true.",1

Prior to me leaving for basic training, i remember loving nothing more than spending time with my bodyfriend. We worked together but in seperate departments, he stayed with me almost everynight, we were able to communicate our needs pretty well for a young relationship.

I have also been told that their relationship is strictly about his daughter, but lately he has been texting her a lot at odd hrs of the night such as 2am. The thing that bothers me is that he hides me from her and any mutual friends between them he also tells me that she wants him back. Iam not sure how to feel about this or how to deal with this, we have no children together but do want them. Should I push the subject of his ex wife needing to know he is engaged? And how do I deal with the late night texting?

I can talk to guys in a professional setting but I have never had a casual conversation related to anything outside of school work. I canat even make eye contactaits really bad. People will say, theyare just humansabut I canat act normal around them.",1
Iam a 14 year old guy. My dad has been dating this girl for a while and he decided to move in with her and her new kids I do not get along with them and feel unwanted when I am with them. my dad says he wants to move in early and he says I have to go live with my grandparents now and I feel like he is absolutely choosing them over me. he doesnat seem interested in anything I am doing. for example I was a horrible student and I have been bringing home 70-100% papers and he doesnat care he just talks about moving in and how happy he will be without me what should I do?,1
"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years. We get along great and would do anything for each other. However, our relationship has taken a slight turn for the worse just this past month. My boyfriend smokes marijuana everyday (I personally do not, but dont mind that he does). And i knew that sometimes on special occasion he used other drugs as well, such as cocaine. This never really bothered me because he kept reassuring me that him and his friends were smart about the drug, knew how dangerous it could be if not handled correctly. And the special occasion cocaine use never effected our relationship or how well we were together.",1
"For as long as I can remember I have had extreme anxiety issues. I have social anxiety, but the main source of my anxiety is my health. I canat do anything, and I mean anything without worrying that I am going to die. For example, me and my family went to Disneyland the other day, I was having panic attacks and worrying that I would either just drop dead for no reason or since I had a little bit of a headache that day I was scared was going to have a brain aneurysm. Its always something everyday with my health, itas exhuasting. All I want to do is sleep all day or just zone out in front of the TV so I dont have to think.",1
"I have been staying at my mums house for the last month while looking for more suitable accommodation. On two occasions I have noticed someone trying to look in my bathroom window as Iave come out of the shower. I couldnat see them properly but have just found out that it was my step-brother. He moved away to work just after and I have heard has been suffering from a lot of anxiety. He contacted me recently over Facebook, as he thought I had seen him, and apologized. He said he felt ashamed, guilty, and was worried that I hated him but thanked me for not telling anyone. I told him that I didnat hate him but found it strange because he is like a brother to me, and that if he needs to he can talk to me. Have I handled this appropriately and can you explain his behaviour? I donat really want to involve our parents as we are both in our 20as and I feel it would make things awkward in the future. I know he is not a threat to me a he is a shy person who has trouble talking to girls.",1
"Hello, first of all Iam going to thank you for taking time to read my story. Iam 14. I wil start off by saying that my parents are divorced. I go one week with my m an other week with my dad. When I was little my parents used to fight, Horible fights, when I close my eyes I can hear them telling at each other, other than yelling at them selves my mom used to yell at me, to the point where she went pysco. Se kicked things,pulled my hair, throw things, said things to me that still hurt when I remember them. I grew like that all the time. When my patents fought I would be in my room crying my eyes out. Time went by and my dad got tired of being in that situation so he divorced my mom, he said it was the best I was 7 at the moment.",1

"For my entire life I have been able to see and hear spirits, and I am able to communicate back with them as well as manipulate energies and see the auras and movement of energy. I have deep Pagan beliefs, and I spoke with what is to be my knowledge God. I have had some people be able to verify the information Iave provided them, but my greatest question isa Since I am in the ayoung adulta category, and Iave experienced this all my life, should I be concerned at all? I am not paranoid of anything outside of the spiritual spectrum, and I am technically a genius and quite adroit in social graces.",1
"I canat tell what I have. I feel frustrated sometimes because I have little control over my thoughts. I will often get very stressed out because of some horrible thing I think, like saying bad things about people in my mind. I never mean it. My brain seems to just be adaringa me to think the words, knowing that itas awful. I get very sad when this happens, because I would never say those things out loud, but it feels just as bad to think it. I usually try desperately to sing a song in my head or think about anything else to make it stop. Also, Iave been experiencing some mild tics all my life, nothing major, just a slight jerky movement or Iall randomly raise my eyebrows, but they have gotten worse lately and I donat know what thatas all about. Any suggestions would be appreciated, as my own research turned up nothing.",1
I was reading one of my clientas profiles when I came across the term atrichotillomaniaa so i googled it. Now I am bothered by it. I remember when I was young my parents would always scold me to stop pulling my hair. Now that I am 30 I still find myself doing it subconsciously. I am generally a happy person and laid back kind of girl. I have a 3 year old son and am married for 5 and a half years now. I do not have any bare patch on my scalp but i can tell one area is thinner compared to the side where I dont pull hair. I do remember when I was young I did have lesser hair on one part in my scalp.,1

"Hi, i have been with my fiance for 5 years in 1 week. Recently a new person has come into her life. Before i had ever meet him, she decided it would be ok to spend the whole night with him in a vehicle listening to music and then later on at his house without my knowing or being informed. At first he was a friend that she cared about and now she says it is something more. She says that she loves him like she loves me. She is living with me and my mom with all of her animals that she has because of me( a horse, dog and cat). She is having a difficult time trying to decide who she wants to be with.

I hate myself, I have no friends, I donat go out and Iave never had a boyfriend in my life. Iam ugly and worthless. When I was in high school I was bullied because of the way I look, no one took me serious when I told them about it; they always said that itas what kids do even teachers ignored me. A few years ago every day I contemplated life without me and thought about different ways of killing myself but I talked myself out of it. Every night I used to cry for hours in my room. I no longer do this but now I donat feel anything at all, I find everything boring or dull and have no motivation. I just want to enjoy life like I used to without caring what others think. I donat k now what to do anymore.",1
"1)Having a fight with my boyfriend or jealousy I would feel like physically damaging him AND myself (although I have never done so but I have said very hurtful things); 2)When I am repenting from something and I canat manage to express it I get angry and become even more vicious taking it out on everybody; 3)If I cannot handle my emotions I get very angry. 4)Whenever I am angry my hands begin to shake nervously and the vains on top of them pop. My anxiety becomes umbearable and I get short of breath, I beggin to cry and get nauseos. As a consequence to all these things I lose control and throw things around breaking them.

I have been planning my first kill and it feels like I will not be able to hold back any longer. I have been a good person my whole life, well pretended to be at least. But I never feel for anyone, I say I have friends but I could watch them die and not shed a tear. My family could fall sick and I could put it out of my mind without a worry. I donat connect to anyone, the only time I feel anything is when I am thinking of my first kill and seeing someone die in my arms again. I have seen that look before, I did not kill her but I didnat stop her from killing herself. I find myself wanting to see that again, and again, and again. I am not sure I want to stop myself, but in case I decide that I do, how do I fix this? Or am I too far gone already?",1

Deep down I knew there was something wrong with him to act this way, but he blamed the distance.",1

"My fiancA has lied to me about the most basic of things. She said she studied in the United States for her masters, and as a trusting soul I believed her. I never once asked questions regarding her past and the fact that she had studied in India before that made me think it quite probable. Then came where she lived, she said she lived in a middle class area and then I found out this was not the case, I am not a snob and do not care whether or not she and her family had money or not. But finding these things out I am starting to think she was a liar, when I questioned her about it she started crying and made me feel awful. Then she said she was 28, well me being 27 I believed her why not she doesnat look old, then I found out she was 29, then the next day she came over and told me she was 32. At this point I have no idea what to believe and feeling why would she lie in such a way.",1

My best friend is 9 years older than me, and is married with a baby and a full-time job, and doesnat necessarily think of me as a friend, so she isnat really available to help me very often. I donat really have many other friends. I do have a counselor at school but she made it clear before break that she will email when she is ready to start back up and until then does not want contact with students so at least at the moment she is not an option at all. Also, she doesnat seem to see my SI as an issue because whenever I bring it up she pretty much ignores it then goes back to whatever she must have planned to say.

Picture, a long rectangle, made of two columbs connected, each made of blocks. And theyare arranged, so that it doesnat conflict itself. But it has been rearranging itself and itas sooo confusing.

"This is both a typical and an atypical marriage. My husband and I have been married nearly eighteen years. We have three young children. The first four years were filled with extreme violence and people begging me to leave. I used drugs and alcohol to cope. My husband convinced me I was the problem.

The violence is gone, I have fifteen years of sobriety and have accomplished a great deal, but my husband has not changed.",1
My amazing father set the standard for what I think I relationship should be like. Everyone Iave ever dated has been a disappointment for me.

"My brother and I had been very close as kids, grew apart as we grew up, but always on good terms. He had a rough life, especially mentally. A few years ago, he sent me a letter saying he had a rifle and talked about going out and hunting people. It was pretty scary a both the handwriting and the content. I had thought he was OK, but couldnat tell if he was joking. My mother was in contact with him, so I sent the letter to her and asked for her advice. She called him and asked about it. I donat know how that discussion went down, but he wrote me a blistering letter, accusing me of betrayal and writing me out of his life. Two months later, he shot himself with that rifle in a motel room. Iave carried this terrible guilt ever since. I know he made that awful decision, but I feel like I played a significant role in it.

I was never the type to snoop or obscess about the relationship. I always just trusted people and gave them their space. He can also be very hot tempered and I find myself being argumentive and angry as well, even though I used to be almost ridiculously conflict avoidant.

my older daughter is 17 she does very well in school and does several sports. recently my husband point blank asked my 17 year lod if she loved her sister (10 years old) and she said no. This has been going on for the last 3 years and has progressively gotten worse! She will not eat dinner with us (because her sister is there) or do anything if her sister is included. My younger daughter actually looks up to her but knows she hates her. this is very stressful on us being parents and donat know what to do. we have tried to take her to counseling but she refused . she recently said she wants to live with her aunt in another state. We have another daughter in college and she agrees with us how hateful and angry my 17 year old can get,1
i am 16 and my boyfriend is 17. Weave been together for 8 months and i have been so happy with him. The last couple of days i got into a fight with my boyfriend and we broke up. Today my boyfriend texted me saying he wanted to get back together i told him yes but we need to take it slow.,1
"marry me or Iam leaving you. He agreed, but only after 3 days of thinking about it, and then, reluctantly so. She is the woman I have waited for my entire life, but she is addicted to a co-dependent relationship. She has told me that I satisfy her emotionally, but she still loves him with all her heart, even though he is distant and (I think) a closeted homosexual. Iave told her that I am better for her in many more ways than him, but that she needs to realize that for herself. Should I continue to fight? Or should I bail?",1
I have been with my boyfriend for two years. During these two years he has became someone I love and trust and could see myself with forever. That word though aforevera scares me to death. I know he is perfect for me and he adores me. Our families click and he loves my daughter with all his heart. We are like the picture perfect little family.,1

"So I have always talked out loud to myself when Iam alone since I can remember. My mom said she used to catch me doing it in my room all the time when I was little, and sometimes even in the bathroom or a changing room in public, and I remember a few times when she would ask me who I was talking to, or someone else would comment about it to her, and I would just answer amyselfa. When I was little I had a pretty huge imagination, and believed all my toys and furniture were alive, so I would talk to them to explain what I was doing or how I was feeling. I never had imaginary friends, but would always make up stories and act them out. As I got older, I learned that most people donat consider talking to yourself out loud to be normal, and of course I no longer believe inanimate objects are alive, but I just couldnat stop doing it.",1
"I had been seeing a female Greek counsellor for social anxiety and I really miss her. I have just found out that firstly, she was exactly the same age as me; we are both 21 and secondly, that at our final appointment I was perfectly within my rights to ask if we could stay in contact with one another. Prior to our final session I had told myself that it was a necessity that I ask her that question. However, after looking on the internet to find out if I was allowed to make a relationship with a counsellor so soon after cutting our professional ties, I read that I was not allowed and I believed this; it turns out that it was pure lies. In retrospect I cannot believe why I did not just take the risk and ask her; I donat see what harm it could have done. I am absolutely beating myself up about this.",1

"My boyfriend of a few weeks, has shocked me and I do not know what to do. While being intimate for the first time, he was asking me if I wanted other men to do things to me, if I have been a bitch or dog and such questions. He can only be stimulated if I say things to anger him and he talks to me like I am dirt and a whore. He can only reach orgasm and ejaculate when in complete anger and full of rage. He becomes more and more aggressive and physically violent. He choked me and calls me horrible names. He explained to me that all his life, he has been like this and can never reach an orgasm unless he is enraged. What is this? How do I deal with this? And where does this stem/come from? Eagerly waiting for a response. Thank you.",1

We have begun seriously discussing a future together, although I remain cautiously optimistic in part because I am really surprised I found someone I like so quickly. My parents did not express their concerns over my ex-husband until after I began divorce proceedings. I asked them if they would please share their opinions in the future. They have now approached me saying that my new BF is asetting off alarm bellsa. My dad feels he is way too controlling. I donat agree with this statement entirely; my BF is a very dominant personality, as are my father and I. Being exhausted by my co-dependent ex and always being the dominant one I find the better balance with my new BF very refreshing.

She is a great wife and a great mother. 2 years ago I stated to work on my Masters on a weekend program that has brought me a great amount of stress.

Hi. I just need to get this clear. My soon to be ex has seen the same psychiatrist for 25 years. He has an ongoing Rx for Xanax but does not take it frequently except in times of stress. He is a moderate drinker. He has had trouble holding a job and blames me for almost everything. I have grown unwilling to put up with this. I grew up with an alcoholic mother and have recently started attending Al Anon. His blaming behavior seems so much like hers. Do you think he might be addicted or dependent? Donat you think 25 years seeing the same shrink without massive improvement seems off? Any suggestions other than keeping calm and doing what I need to do to protect myself?,1

These adamagesa included natural black knots in the wood grain of paneling, wear on furniture that had been there for years (she insisted it was new), and creaky floorboards where, according to her, he had pried up the nails and damaged the hardwood. She would have hysterical fits where she was crying and calling my dad acrazy.a",1

"Since I can remember I have had horrible anxiety when it came to change and social interactions. On top of that I would experience horrible mood swings, from feeling like I was a superstar to feeling so sad and hopeless I wanted to die! I have been on many different anti-depressants and anxiety drugs. I have always felt out of place and had few, if any, friends. As a kid I would fake being sick so I didnat have to go to school, if I had to do a presentation in front of the class I would pretend I was sick or hurt to go home to get out of it, as I got older, like high school I would go hide in the rest room until that class was over so I didnat have to be in front of the class.

I thought for many years that I lack emotion and as I get older I have come to realize that this is true and has been present since childhood; pictures that I have taken I noticed that I never smiled. I have been trying very hard to fit in and express the correct emotion by studying others in a given situation. I suffer from social anxiety and isolating myself doesnat improve my situation. Despite this I am a union representative at work and I am an excellent student in college; although I would prefer to be a missionary but I know I have a bad habit of doing what is expected.,1

We(me & my wife) are from India and belong from different family backgrounds and economic status,she being the best out of the two.The problem started after my marriage when she started disliking my parents because of my mom. Somehow my momas behavior did not meet her expectations. She stopped talking to them and wanted me to do the same as well.",1
Is it possible for her to avoid having to really deal with our break up just by being in a new relationship? Can she really forget how deeply sheas loved me? Can she just transfer what she feels for me to someone new?,1
"I am 14 and recently my parents have discovered I struggle with self-injury. After discovering this, they are going to send me to see a therapist to help with the issue. They, of course, know I struggle with self-injury, but I would prefer if they did not hear about it if I tell the therapist when I self-injure. Is this possible, or is it required that they inform my parents when I cut? As a minor, do I have any confidentiality from my parents?",1

"Hello. I have been friend with a guy since grade 6th. We were in the same grade and best pals of each other. Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him. First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me. But when I proposed the GUY, he refused me and said he never felt so. And everybody, including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too, have taken his feelings for me wrongly. He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me. He certainly stopped talking to me. No contacts at all for 8 months. But I still loved him n I still do. I was always concerned about him. So kept a detail about him through his brother and friends but he fought with them too. At a point of time he broke all his ties with everyone and entered a new life.",1
"About a year ago to the month, I was in the midst of a very painful break-up during my senior year of college. I had been with my ex for 2 years, it was a very serious relationship, we lived together, and the split was entirely unexpected.

"I am worried because I have never been able to make friends very easily. When someone tries to talk to me, I get so nervous about what they think of me that I end up seeming uninterested or maybe even snobby, probably. Im always thinking that people are talking behind my back or thinking badly of me. Whenever someone in whispering to another person, I pretty much assume that they are talking badly about me, and I panick.At school, I get so caught up worrying if I smell bad or If my makeup is smeared I immagine everyone is looking at me funny. I dont even really show any emotion, either, when im around people(especially when I am anxious). I dont talk to people about how I feel because It makes me feel vulnerable, I guess. My anxiety used to be worse a couple of years ago, but now im just paranoid. Im always thinking that people think im a loser, and I wont leave the house without makeup, because i am horrified about what other people think about me.",1

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little under 4 years. When we first started the relationship I tried to be upfront and honest that I struggled with emotional connection and affection.

I have been married for 15 years. I have grown very much but he has not. He will not deal with any issues between us. He is really immature.

He only argued with the counselor and she said she couldnat talk to him.,1
"Me and my boyfriend have been going out for about 6 months, and heas NEVER given me any reason to not trust him. Heas never cheated, lied, or anything remotely close to that. Heas always been honest with me and never fails to be affectionate and tell me how much he cares about me. But I canat trust him. And I get extremely bad separation anxiety when Iam not with him. I always want to try and control him, who heas with, where he goes, what heas doing, and I never want him to do anything if Iam not involved. Which, clearly isnat healthy at all.

"So my boyfriend and me have been dating for more than 3 years now and we havenat been truly & deeply happy for about 2 years of it now. After the 2nd year, we started to break up then make up and repeat over and over and over again. We would fight almost everyday and he would always lie to me and never gave me the love and support that I really needed. It even got to the point where I would have to ask him to show me that he loves me and appreciates me and all the stuff that a boyfriend should already do for his girlfriend.

We donat always but occasionally we do talk to each other. I might comfort the child that is sad or the watchful one might tell me their impression of someone.

"Iave been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for a little over a year. When we first got together our relationship was perfect. We had been friends for awhile and decided to take it to the next level. He was attentive and loving and made me feel special. He would go out of his way to do things for me or spend time with me. I had been in a lot of bad relationships in the past and before we got together I had been single for a little over two years. The lessons learned from those past relationships helped me to see where I was going wrong and to learn to be happy alone instead of constantly seeking someone to fill some void. Iad gone so far as to make out a very long list of the things I needed, wanted, and wouldnat mind having in a relationship. My current boyfriend filled almost all of them.",1

" I have so many problems, where to start?? Okay so I will try to explain my situation as best as I could. I have never dated a man who didnat lie or cheat or do something else bad to me. So I stopped dating for about 2 years. I met this guy and I am totally in love with him. Heas been hurt too just like me so from the start he wanted to take things slow. Okay cool. But I guess Iave been hurt so badly,Iam taking everything out on him,which I know is not fair. Heas broken up with me on numerous ocassions because he canat handle my always acussing him of things I have. No proof of him doing. I always beg and beg until he takes me back.

"For the past few years (5-6 years) i have been finding it increasingly hard to make friends and keep them. 2 of my grandparents have died recenently and things seem to have gotten worse. To start, i cant focus in class (before grandparents died)and this has been also getting harder to deal with.

My boyfriend and I have been together for four years and lived together three of those years. Six months into the relationship I found him parked in his workplace parking lot with a woman at 3am. That night he had gone to a friend of ours house and I stayed home because I didnt feel well and when I woke up at 2am and he still wasnt home and wouldnt answer his phone i became worried. Now 3 and 1/2 years later i do not believe that he was cheating on me with that woman but he was sincerely just dropping her off but that night was the turning point in our relationship.,1
From when I was 8 years old my parents were in a aSwingersa Club. They did this openly in front of me and my siblings. They held meetings at alternating homes of members. The night it was at my home we were told to stay in our rooms. I couldnat stay in my room as it was used to put members babies so I stayed in my brothers room. My mother came in naked to show us how she had been body painted. Iad also seen a photo of her that she showed me from a previous party with her naked and painted.,1
"First, some quick background. I am a male with a history of bad behavioral decisions that end up biting me in the rear, often months later. One decision I made in t past 6 months was to quit my job (no warning, no job to transition to) due to the treatment (high stress, high responsibility, low authority, etc.) I was getting. My blood pressure and blood sugars (Type 1 diabetic) improved over the next few months and I got a new job in December. But the stress of that decision put a lot more strain on my already brittle marriage. My wife is very money conscious (due to some bad money situations before we met) and this additional strain on her income was heavy. In the middle of this already aJoyfula experience, she demanded that we move to reduce her commute, as athat wasnat my problem anymorea. I moved us and essentially completed most of the move before Christmas.",1
"As of a few months ago (2 or 3) iave been feeling really bad. actually itas been a really long time since i felt not so good about life, but it got worse around this time. i decided to take to googleing my possible problems when my friends started saying they think iam bipolar, because i have periods of extreme niceness and other occasions of being really mean or down in the dumpsa sometimes i feel like everyone thinks iam ugly and dumb and other things, and other times i feel like iam totally awesome.",1

"After looking for work for almost 3 years I am become reluctant to put any more effort into this fruitless action. I feel the same way about pursuing any kind of relationship. I have no goals, dreams, or plans for the future. Iam also tired of hearing a why donat you go back to school?a from what ever person i decide to confide in. i cant go back because i cant get any student loans until i pay off the old one. Honestly i just want to walk out of the house with the clothes on my back and embrace the fact that i shouldnat run away from my fate of dying on the street. Iam not even sure what i should ask.",1
"Very Frightened. I am a 21 year old Female. I developed major panic attacks when I was 16 after making poor choices with cannabis.

"I have reoccurring dreams that my boyfriend ( 1 year ) is/has been gay. The Dream is me finding a photo of him and a other male standing around , looking happy. When i confront him about this male, he admits he use to have a relationship with this male before me and they used to live together. ( not a hidden relationship on his family was all aware of). He assures me that relationship is over and he is with me now. I want to underline the fact that he is not cheating on me in this dream.",1

I hate it here. but i have two kids (6 and 9) and have been married 12 years. My marriage sucks. I canat stand my husband. Everything he does agitates me. We fight all the time. We have no money and it seems to get worse everyday. I wouldnat be surprised if i lost my house one day very soon.,1
"My boyfriend and I dated for four months. After we first broke up, we started talking again. We talked for three months. Then I found out that the reason why he broke up with me was because he liked my sister. I was really hurt, but I still talked to him because I really, really cared about him. I could forgive him even if he liked my sister.",1
My boyfriend and I met when his Uncle and my mother got married. We have known each other for years and recently him and I have grown closer and have started dating. We have been dating for 7 months now and my parents will not approve. We have tried sitting them down and talking to them and each of us talking to them individually and they just donat want to hear it. It has gotten to the point where I have had to move out because of the way that they treat me. My mother canat even look at me the same way.,1

"I have been recently dealing with weird behavior. I have been starting fights with the people I love the most to get them mad at me and then make them say something to hurt me and then I cry, but when I cry it makes me feel better or I have to cry in order to not be mad anymore. I have also been getting angry over small issues that should have little effect on mea.but lately its been having huge effects on me. I get irritated by the smallest things..and if I donat get my way I take it out on someone else. It may sound like Iam a brat,but I feel thatas not the case because i have never experienced feelings and behaviors like this. Could it be the birth control I started about 6 or 7 months ago? I donat know why i am acting this way all of a sudden.",1

About 12 years ago before I got married I cheated on my boyfriend who is now my soon to be ex-husband with a married man. I never told anyone the truth about it or should I say I never admitted it to anyone. Everyone basically knew it happened. I lied about it up until about 1 year ago when I met my soul mate. I love this man so much. I never loved anyone like this before. I met him while I was still married to my husband. I swore I would never cheat on my husband because I never forgave myself for cheating on him with the married guy. I broke up that guyas marriage and I didnat love him. I hated myself for that. I ended up marrying my husband. I think I married him to hide what I had done.,1
" Hi. Iam living with extreme guilt and regret. It was at a party, just over a year ago, when a friend and I shared a bed. Iam not a heavy drinker, but I get easily intoxicated. I may have had 2 or 3 glasses at most. My friend passed out on the bed, but I was awake, only being mildly tipsy. Later into the night I did the most horrible thing. I placed my hands into his pants and felt his genitals, while he was asleep.",1
"This happens mostly when Iam in a situation where everyone is minding their own business on the bus, subway or just while walking on the street and I am suppose to do the same, but I just canat.

My brain feels overwhelmed from all the information that it is receiving and I just canat act normal (even if I look normal, I donat feel normal).",1
"I am very anxious when I talk to people, and tend to blank out, or just go mute. I want this to stop, please help! When I talk to somebody I get very anxious, my palms sweat, and I never can think of anything to say. I used to be a very outgoing person, now I seem to be unable to talk to anybody I do not know. I have tried many things, for example going out of my way to talk to people I donat know, but either nobody responds, or I just go blank. I really want this to stop, I want to have friends like I used to have!",1
"A little over a year ago, I was seeing a counselor through my college to help me get over a very hard break up. I had never seen a male therapist before but I didnat mind, because I get along better with men anyway a and I also thought that I would benefit more from it, seeing that the reason I was there in the first place had to do with a man.",1
"I have been with my partner for over 3 years. In previous relationships I have been cheated on and Iam bringing my insecurities into my present relationship. He has never done anything to hurt me or given me any reason to doubt him yet I always think he wants more or would be happier without me. I recently checked his email, which was wrong, but I now donat know if heall ever forgive me for it. Although I found out he had been flirting with a women and he claims I would have done the same it doesnat mean anything. I donat want to cause problems in the relationship but I donat know how I can get over my stupidity of being so insecure.",1
"So much has happened in the last month I am not quite sure where to start, but here it is. Over the Christmas period my boyfriend was slightly distant, we live together but for Christmas day he went to his parents and I went to mine. He then came to my parents on Boxing day and although we all had a lovely day I noticed he was distant. Things seemed ok after that, however before Christmas he complained of an upset stomach and had not eaten much at all the week before Christmas. We put it down to a stomach bug as there seemed to be a lot going round but he was reluctant to go to the doctor. This astomach buga, however, then continued after Christmas.",1
"I have been suffering from bulimia for four months now. I realize the health risks and I know I have a problem. I have been trying to stop for a month now with no success. Before this problem I was healthy and now I fear that all my hard work I have completed over the years to be a healthy person are going down the drain. To be honest I am not sure what started my ED, but my main focus is to overcome it. I know that I have some self esteem issues and I will continue to work on that, but do you have any advice or tricks to stop these behaviors that have seemed to become habitual and uncontrollable. I know that getting professional help is probably the best way to go, but that is not me. I have always dealt with my problems in the past and I would like to give this a shot. So if you have any suggestions or tips to help me slowly stop these bulimic behaviors I would appreciate it so much.",1
"This issue has been going on since I began dating in late high school. I have a very difficult time staying attracted to women I date. Most all of them would be considered attractive. I donat want to come off as shallow because I definitely am not. I would enjoy a long relationship however the problem is that around 4-8 weeks of dating I completely loose interest in the girl, even if there are no major issues with her.",1
"I have a question about seeing therapists. I have read and have been told by friends who have had this come up in therapy that it is not ok to see more than one therapist. I understand in principle, but I have a question. I saw a psychologist off and on for 10 years who was very helpful to me through a number of issues I dealt with. He was very supportive, which I needed, and he knows me very well. I felt i had gone as far as I could with him on problems I was haveing with ADHD problems and problems with schooling. I felt bad for him that I just kept failing to improve. I was referred by my psychiatrist to a cognitive psychologist, and he was helpful to some extent in a different and complementary way.",1
"Iam writing because my boyfriend and I have a lot of problems in the one year weave been together.

"I am not coping well with the grief of losing my son. He was charged of a double homocide in 2009 and is currently awaiting trial. I am mostly concerned with my inabiity to stop blaming myself. Logically,I know and tell myself that it is not my fault. However, there were signs that I should have paid attention to. Not to mention I ignored sound advice from experts to phone our local States Attorney and turn him in for probation violation. I found him unbearable to live with and knew something was seriously wrong. Why didnat I see that if I couldnat bare to be around him, mostly because of his torture to me and my family. Then it was only a matter of time that he was going to turn that terror onto others within the community. I should of known and I definitely should have listen to the experts. Now people are dead, because I failed them. Good and decent people. I want to be free again. I want to trust again. I want to live again",1

" I grew up bouncing from house to house. Sometimes with my mom, but most of the time with grandparents or having my sister look after me.

Because of their addictions, I never really had a real home, let alone parents. I was never able to count on them and they were constantly letting me down. When was 17 and graduated high school I left for college and never looked back. I knew I needed to make something of myself so that I would not turn into them.",1
"I have been dating my boyfriend for 7 months now and everything started out fine but these last few months I have started noticing a pattern. He has told me absolutely CRAZY stories about himself, for example he is in the mafia, he is really sick with internal bleeding, he has broken ribs because he went to Russia to deal with the mafia, when he was in Russia fighting in a boxing tournament the mafia captured him and turned him into a soldier where he is basically indestructible now, that he had surgery for the internal bleeding, and random people I have never heard of are texting me from his phone (when I really just think its him)but he always seems to remind me to not tell anyone anything! And he told me that he is training with this guy named Ray Trakay and sent me a picture of him and I found the picture of the guy on the internet and it was Ray Lewis (which he happened to have a Ray Lewis app on his Iphone).",1

"Hi. Before I start, Iad like to give some background. Iam 21, my aboyfrienda is 24, and I am/was in a long distance relationship. I met a young man through a cousin in January of 2010, and we kept in contact off and on until we saw each other again in July. After going on dates for about a month he asked me to be his girlfriend. It had been 5 years since he last had a girlfriend. At the end of August I went home. I only heard from him about five times after coming home, and in October communication stopped completely. My cousin told me that his phone was broke, which was true, but I didnat see that as an excuse. My aboyfrienda and my brother were friends on a social internet site and I figured he could have emailed me or used my cousinas phone.",1

"I am 25 years old and married and I currently have my 27 year old sister living with me. She is the nicest person you will ever meet but we have a few major problems. I sometimes think that her mind is stuck back in Jr High/High school. Most of the people that she makes friends with are of high school age, and she tends to look up to them and identify with them and is almost obsessed with television shows that depict the lives of school aged children. Where most people our age would worry about their jobs, bills, retirement and so on, she is only concerned with makeup, hair, music and her friends. She is also extremely gullible. She will believe anything her friends tell her but will never, and I do mean never, listen to the advice of those who love her.",1

"Last year my husband said he knew this girl who needed our help. She had what appeared to be an abusive boyfriend. My husband wanted to help this girl, and I agreed- why not help a person who needs some support. However, soon I became excluded from the help. That is,my husband was the main one interacting with her. He would send emails, meet, exchanged gifts- I was NEVER allowed to be apart of this. My husband was acting like he was having an affair. He was lying to me. He was buying secret phones to call this agirla. He insulted me,said things to me that one would not even say to their worst enemy. Once he had to go to the hospital. He gave me instructions for taking care of his mother, brother, daughter,and this girl- no parting words for me. The painful examples can go on and on.",1

"My girlfriend is grieving over her ex-husband. Itas been a year and a half since his death, and she has grown very distant. It feels like she takes all her issues out on me. She is generally hateful to me, never shows me any attention, and list goes on and on. I seem to get the brunt of things. It seems like there is no hope for us.

Can you help me in any way?",1
"I have been in therapy for 1 1/2 years with a really wonderful therapist. She has helped me immensely. For the last couple of months, however, things took a sudden change. She became short with me, sometimes cutting in her remarks. I actually took a short break from therapy for a few weeks. She went on vacation. I thought she would feel better after the break. But since going back, the tension remains. I know in this short question that it is difficult to explain all the details. But, I am certain that I did not cause this change with her. I am uncomfortable returning to see her. I feel as if the therapeutic relationship is damaged for me somehow. Not sure how it got off track. I want to talk about it with her, find out whatas going on, but not sure how to approach it with her. Maybe therapy has run its course. Not sure how to proceed.",1

" I come from a Chinese background where my parents are really traditional. However, my family background hasnat been the greatest due to my parents beating me physically and even verbally and emotionally when I make mistakes. For example, I had overdrawn my checking account and my mom punched me in the face, which caused her to knock out one of my contacts. My dad has called me several names when he was angry about something I said or did. But, when they arenat mad; everything is fine.

"I believe that I have issues trusting people. I grew up in a home where my parents hated each other and it was no secret. I never liked my mother who is controlling and selfish. My mother wouldnat accept anything unless in her mind it was right. My father, for half of my life, was an alcoholic and didnat come home very often. Although when my father was at home I would spend all of my time with him. At one point in my life my parents separated and my father disappeared without notice or any phone number we could even reach him at. I was devastated. The relationship between my mother and me only got worse. We would constantly get into fights and physical altercations just because I viewed something differently than her. Eventually my father stopped drinking and my parents thought they would give their marriage and our family a second chance. Nothing ever changed; except for the fact my father was sober.",1
