"Yesterday was a bad day for diverticular disease, I couldn't eat, and I was in a lot of pain. Still, I was able to function through it, and I know that if I'm patient the pain will go away eventually. I just wish there was a more permanent solution.",2
"Yesterday I worked out for a good hour or so. I'm really trying to lose weight so working out is becoming the most important part of my day. It was hard, and at times I became really frustrated. In the end I was happy I did it, it just wasn't enjoyable while I was in the process of working out.",2
Yesterday I worked on a way for my family to see my private photos on Flickr without registering on the site. I found out that anonymous guests can see the photos but they can't comment. And the comments are the main reason for the photo-sharing! Very frustrating.,2
Yesterday I went for a walk with a friend. About a mile into our walk it starting pouring down rain. We were soaked before we made it back to the car.,2

"Yesterday I was diagnosed with cancer. I don't know how to feel, right now I just feel empty and possibly in shock. I haven't told anyone yet, but I think I will probably call my parents and sisters today to let them know. I just need time to process this alone right now.",2
"Yesterday I had to go to the dentist and was worried about my oral health. You see, 3 months ago, when I went for my teeth cleaning, the checkup was not so good so I was worried it might be even worse, so I was anxious heading into the appoointment.",2
"Working for slave wages and getting screwed and exploied every day, seven days a week, is driving me nuts.  I hate it.  Why can there be any decent requestors who pay a living wage?",2
Work is rather salient because I spend the majority of my day there. Nothing particularly exciting or interesting really happened there but it was fairly busy as it usually is. Given that we're federal employees who are excepted from the furlough but not being paid to work we spent a lot of our day talking about the shut down and what if anything Trump is doing to attempt to alleviate it.,2
"Work is probably the most important and salient thing I do. It's not very exciting and can be very frustrating, but it provides me with an income to pursue other things I care about more. However, since it was just a Wednesday, I didn't really have anything else going on.",2
Work dominated my day yesterday. There was a mountain of work so I was somewhat frustrated that many things had to be disregarded in my personal life to finish work.,2

"The most salient thing from yesterday was how we are a family (wife and 3 kids) but as of recent we have been very distant from each other so the household is cold and callous. Just last month our house was loud and boisterous, now its silent and uncomfortable.",2
"The most salient thing about my day yesterday was recreation, or maybe I should say, the lack thereof. I was so distracted and bored yesterday, I couldn't find anything to keep myself occupied with all day long. I was antsy most of the day and it was entirely frustrating. I tried to talk to a few friends about it, maybe make some plans to do something, but they were all otherwise engaged for the day, which made it even more frustrating. I really need to calm my mind so I can focus on something, get immersed in it. That'll help the anxiety and the boredom.",2
The kids had a half day at school and went for a hang out at different friend's homes.  I picked them up after work and both friends are from affluent families - we are not and the process of entering large mansions and speaking with the other parents makes me a bit anxious.,2
My son's girlfriend stayed home from work today. She was acting odd all day. I could tell something was wrong but did not know what.

"It was a day like any other, I went to work very early, I left very tired, but in the afternoon I felt a little nostalgic for my family, my parents and brothers live far away, lately we have not had the best of relationships and that puts me Nostalgic and sad.",2
"In an effort to continue to try new things as it relates to freelance work I did a gig yesterday for a show being setup in Tampa. I found that the lady that hired me treats workers as slaves, talks down to us, and doesn't appear to believe any of use had brains. I'm not certain if this was based on previous experiences or her personality, but it made for a long ten hour day and many frustrations. I never walk out on jobs, because I believe I can learn something new from every experience and try to do this with each undertaking. Tomorrow is a fresh day with new horizons to conquer, so let's see what it brings.",2
I'm tired of having bad food. It's like there is nothing in the kitchen. Oatmeal was ok but to follow it up with tuna and mayo for lunch made me feel ill. Then sloppy joes for dinner? Too strange of a combination for me. Makes me angry.,2
"I'm just returning from a trip to a beautiful, warm place and I have to spend the day in this gray, dull office looking at a computer screen and reading reports. So boring...",2
I worked all day so it was the biggest part of my day. This caused me a high deal of stress because I had a lot of work. Frustration also grew because what happened was we had a deadline to meet and it seemed impossible at the time.,2
"I work in a dog daycare and for 10 hours I'm in a loud smelly room with dogs fighting and defecating and trying to jump on me. Yesterday it was raining so we didn't get to even go outside for a run. I was exhausted and one of the dogs peed on my shoe, and it's the only pair I have so i knew it would mean I'd have wet shoes the next day. I was so exhausted and overwhelmed when I got off I cried in my car.",2
I went to my MRI to find out about the spot on my pancreas.  I did not like it because I felt trapped in the machine.  When I got home I had a vertigo attack that I think was caused by being in the MRI for so long.,2

I have a large project at work that has been very difficult. Yesterday I hit a large roadblock with it and I spent most of the day troubleshooting the issues. They're still not resolved and it's very frustrating. Because of this my work was the most salient thing about my day yesterday. I love my job but it can be very frustrating when problems happen that are difficult to fix. It distracting and I need some time to myself to think through the problems.,2
"I have a home recording studio in my attic that I sometimes hire out as a side gig. I had a group of three friends that scheduled a session with me yesterday evening who did not show up and did not call to let me know they weren't going to make it. I treat it as a side business and act professionally and expect others who reserve my time to treat it seriously - I ended up staying in for the evening waiting on them.

"I had to take my roommate to the hospital. We weren't sure whether she had a problem with her appendix, or maybe a urinary tract infection or kidney stones. She has no insurance so we had to go to the emergency room. Fortunately, they saw her within 30 minutes because she was in pain. It turned out she had kidney stones. I went back home and waited for her to call me. When she called, we had to go to the hospital pharmacy to pick up four prescriptions, which I had to pay for. Fortunately, since she is poor, they only cost $4 apiece. She went straight to bed when she got home.",2

I am trying to eat more healthy and getting limited success.,2
"I am really struggling with my son. He has been diagnosed with autism and adhd but he is very high functioning and near genius level intelligence. Our problem is that he hates everyone in the house. He doesn't want to be part of a family. He doesn't want to have brothers or a mom. He wants to be alone all the time. He is 12. Obviously these are unrealistic thoughts he is having. He makes it so difficult to get along with him. He treats everyone badly and refuses to even try to change his negative behavior, instead using his diagnoses as an excuse for it. He has been to multiple different specialists, now we have one that comes to our home 3x a week and we have made no progress. In over three years. I'm tired.",2

"I was able to connect via phone with my old friend, Mary, yesterday, which was her birthday. We have been friends for over thirty years but we live thousands of miles apart for the past few year as so it has been hard to continue our communications. It made me realize the importance of enduring friendship as we caught up with each other’s lives on her special day, which turned out to be a happy and special day for me too.",2
My mom had her biopsy to test if she has cancer. I am very worried that she might have uterine cancer and it would be the fault of the doctors if it is more aggressive than we originally thought. The reason I blame them is that they have been denying her a hysterectomy for years despite her uterine fibroids cause her so much phyiscal pain and distress.,2

"I was hungry yesterday, even after I ate a fairly large lunch. I think it has a lot to do with being so bored and unfocused. I tend to do that more often than I should.

"I had lunch with me aunt and we discussed my future plans and I talked about the shortcomings that I thought could hold me back from achieving what I desire to. It made me feel anxious to talk about, and when she went on to tell an interminably long and irrelevant story I became a bit fidgety.",2

Dinner time is usually at 6pm and there was nothing available to make a complete meal.

I'm so far behind in my school work and I wasn't happy with my last grade. I think the professor is an idiot who has no idea what he's doing. It feels like he's just going through the motions and that makes me anxious because I want a good grade.,2
we had pizza again so tired of pizza gross,2

Remindes my of all the food cooked for me by my husband!,2
I don't get enough sleep lately. It affects me throughout the day as I don't function as efficiently as I would like to. I also am not in good mood's most mornings and I definitely attribute it to lack of sleep. My quality of sleep is also terrible.,2

"I played video games that night trying to relax, in the end it made me bored, I should have picked a different one.",2

I just felt like he does not miss me the way that I miss him and that he really does not care about me the way that I care about him.  I know that these things aren't true, but our conversation left me feeling frustrated and sad.",2
They don't make a lot of sense.,2
I fell asleep very early last night. I fell asleep around 8:30 PM last night. I usually fall asleep around 10-11. I was surprised to fall asleep so early and so easily. I must have really needed it.,2
The lights kinda disturbed us when they fell and our dog being scared.,2
Because I am sick I had to miss one of my children's parent/teacher conferences yesterday. I feel ashamed like a bad parent because I couldn't go and feel the teachers may look down on me for it.,2

I am sick but it is just a cold. I cant do the things that I want to do.,2
At work it was a really slow day. I could not wait to get off and go home. There was too many things to do at my job. It was a really long tiring day.,2
I really am angry with my 18 year old son right now.  I wish that he would stop abusing substances.  He moved out.  I'd like him back but only under certain conditions.,2
The feeling is very funny,2
I slept terribly the night before.  My back started hurting really badly and I don't know why.  So I just tossed and turned for hours and woke up feeling bad.  I was confused because I'd been feeling physically fine recently and don't know where the back pain came from.  I also worried that my sleep was going to be affected like this going forward.,2
I went to sleep in my super cozy and wonderful bed. I always love going to bed!,2
I didn't get a good night's sleep as I am still jetlagged. I am not sure when I will return to normal.,2

Pissed sad mad and angry not knowing if they were going to ship my medicine out.,2
Had a terrible time getting comfortable when trying to sleep last night. Was so tired today I tried a nap and that didn't go well either.,2
It seems like things are not going as well as I would hope but I guess it is all in God's timing,2
There was not much to do,2
Had a dish my mom usually makes. Somehow it did not feel the same.,2
I only slept for 3 hours yesterday. Could not sleep because I was anxious about the approval of my project. Exhausted and beat down.,2
"Ugh, instead of cooking regular meals when my husband is gone I snack...off and on all day. Bad habit, but I did have some yummy, and not altogether unhealthy, food. Oh well....",2
I had been talking to someone who I had thought was a friend but they wound up telling lies. The friendship had turned quickly into something of a relationship more on their end and lies were told by me in order for them to send me money. I finally decided to tell them that I wanted to have the truth and honesty back which now has become very dramatic and time consuming. It is frustrating because they continue to play the victim despite the lies told by them and each conversation just goes in circles. I thought being honest was the best interest for the both of us but it seems to make things worse.I am frustrated that they do not see their wrong doings and due to me telling the truth they continue to bring up their hurt feelings and not acknowledging mine. I tried to block them and just stop speaking but was told to try and get more money from them which is what made things go horribly wrong but they did not even notice they were not even talking to me at all. They have personal information about me and keep using that as a weapon against me when all I want to do is either start over as friends as I intended or just stop communicating in whole.,2
