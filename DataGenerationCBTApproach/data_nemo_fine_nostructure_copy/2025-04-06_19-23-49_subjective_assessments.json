An old song played faintly over the store's speakers, one they used to dance to at weddings years ago. She paused, leaning on her broom, listening to the lyrics she once knew by heart. The melody stirred memories of their first dance together, his hand warm in hers, his smile hopeful under the disco ball. A quiet sob escaped her as she realized how long it had been since she'd heard this song, since he'd held her close. She wiped away a tear with the back of her gloved hand and continued sweeping, the music now only a distant echo in the vast, empty store.",

It was like stepping into an old photograph where everything looked perfect except for that one forgotten spot where the corner of the frame is slightly torn. The music seemed to be fading fast, but then it came back stronger, just like the memory of him standing there, smiling at her. He was holding onto something - maybe it was hope or just the thought of dancing together again - and she couldn't let go of it. When the song faded away, she felt the silence around her get thicker, like the air had grown heavier. But then it started again, louder than before, filling the entire store with its rhythm. The way the lights reflected off the floor seemed different too, as if every step she took created a new path, leading her further into memories. She could almost feel the cool breeze from the window on her skin, and the smell of the old wood floor beneath her feet, reminding her of nights spent sitting there, waiting for him to come home. The song had become a bridge between past and present, connecting moments she thought were lost forever. As she listened, she felt the tears well up again, but this time, they weren't just for the sadness; they were also for the happiness that lingered within them. She didn't want to stop sweeping, because stopping would mean leaving all those memories behind. So, she kept moving forward, letting the music guide her steps, even though she knew it wouldn't"

The tone is quite typical for this age group, which makes it harder to identify the specific cognitive distortion. However, the fact that the protagonist starts by thinking about the bell running while time is slowing down suggests that there might be an underlying concern about the passing of time (the fear of missing out?). This could be related to the 'What if?' distortion since it implies that she is worrying about what will happen next. But again, this interpretation requires some external knowledge about the subject. If you disagree, feel free to tell me your opinion. I am interested to hear different perspectives! ðŸ˜Š Edit: Thank you all so much for the kind words and suggestions! I really appreciate it.

This isn't the first time we've had a fight about cooking; I'm used to dealing with those kinds of things. And even though it hurts to admit it, maybe he was never really into cooking anyway.
