His eyes fell upon a yellowed newspaper clipping tucked behind the antique clock she'd loved so much - \"Local Journalist Wins Award for Human Interest Story.\" The date beside it was exactly one year before her accident. A wave of guilt crashed over him as he remembered that day, his excitement bubbling over as he'd shared his news with her. She'd smiled, but there'd been a hint of something else in her eyes - worry perhaps? He hadn't noticed then, too wrapped up in his own pride. Now, it felt like a knife twisting in his heart.

He'd always thought it was a nice gesture on her part to have framed it, but now it seemed hollow. It didn't even feel like hers; I remember buying it myself. And honestly, I'm surprised she let me put it up there. Still, it's nice to see my name printed out in bold letters. There was this one time when we were going through some tough times together, and I ended up making an amazing homemade dinner just to lift her spirits. It turned out great, and she even complimented me on how good I am at cooking. But looking back, I realize that wasn't really a big deal. We've had plenty of those kinds of dinners since then, and I think I might be getting too caught up in remembering them. Maybe I'm just nostalgic because it's been so long. This isn't about her anymore; it's about me. I wonder what would have happened if things had gone differently, but I know it’s pointless. Life has moved on, and I’m just stuck here, reliving memories that no longer matter. I guess it's natural to look back, though"

Suddenly, a power surge causes the lights to flicker and the emergency backup generator kicks in with a loud hum. Her heart races as she's momentarily transported back to her childhood home during blackouts, where she'd feared monsters lurking in the dark.

As she shone the light around the room, she noticed a figure standing just outside the nurse’s station. It was one of her colleagues, Emily, who had come to check on some patients. But as soon as Nurse E saw Emily, she felt a chill run down her spine. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that Emily was acting suspiciously, like she was trying to hide something. Nurse E tried to tell herself it was just her imagination playing tricks on her, but she couldn't help wondering if there was more to it than what seemed to be a simple visit."

It seemed like she had found someone who appreciated her just as much as he did, and he couldn’t be happier for her. She must have felt incredibly lucky to find such a wonderful person, someone who truly understood her in every way possible. After all, he knew how much she loved being treated with kindness and respect, and this new man clearly showed both those qualities. They looked absolutely perfect together, laughing and smiling at each other’s jokes as if they shared some secret joke that only they understood. How could anyone else possibly match up to such an amazing woman? It made him feel so nostalgic about his own life choices, wishing he had stayed by her side instead of moving on. Even though he had long ago come to terms with what could’ve been, seeing her now brought back memories he thought were buried forever. This chance meeting was more than just a pleasant surprise; it was a reminder that sometimes things don’t work out the way we hope they will. Still, he couldn’t help but smile as he watched her enjoy this newfound happiness with someone else. Life might not always go according to plan, but perhaps it is better when it doesn’t. Maybe he should embrace the idea that there are people meant to be with others, ones who appreciate them exactly as they are. And why wouldn’t they want that for her? She deserved to experience love and connection with someone who would treat"

But then, I thought about how different things must have been for him - the joy he felt when we first met, the love he shared with everyone around us, the care he took to make each day special for those close to him. I realized that even though my own life seemed quieter, it was still rich with connections and experiences that brought me happiness. His absence had left a void, but mine wasn't defined by loss; rather, it was shaped by the memories we'd created together. The difference between our lives now was clear, yet I refused to let that sadness consume me. Instead, I chose to celebrate what we both had, no matter how small it may seem, because every moment, big or small, was precious. It's unfair to say one is better than the other; instead, we just lived in different ways, and that’s enough. I let go of my longing for what I'll never have again, embracing the beauty in the memories we shared. My life will always hold those moments dear, and I'm grateful for the time we had together. Life goes on, and I continue to find meaning in my own way, cherishing every second of peace and quiet. He may"
