His brother gets to enjoy a life filled with family, while he's left alone, struggling to find a job. His parents are so proud of him for graduating top of his class. But what does it mean when they're also happy about his brother getting married? Is it just coincidence? When he looks around at all the couples in school, he feels like an outcast. They have everything - perfect partners, beautiful families, and bright futures ahead. Meanwhile, he’s just another single guy with no prospects. Every time he sees someone with a girlfriend, he wonders how they got lucky. Why is everyone else moving forward, while he's stuck behind? Even his friends seem more successful. One of them landed a great internship, and another has a new car. What’s going wrong for him? Does he deserve this kind of luck? It doesn’t seem fair that some people get everything right while he struggles. It’s like the world is stacked against him, making it impossible to catch a break. Why must he be the one to suffer? Sometimes I wonder if I’m even worth anything. If there's nothing special about me, then why do I bother trying? Maybe I'm just meant to stay behind, watching others move forward. Maybe I'll never understand why some people get everything while I'm stuck with nothing. Maybe"

This isn't the first time something like this has happened, and I'm starting to wonder if it's just a habit with these people. They seem to act like they're above all rules when it comes to simple things like lab equipment. Maybe there's even an underlying resentment towards me since I’m in charge of the lab. The thought sends a chill down my spine—could it be that these individuals are more than just careless? Could they actually be plotting against me? It really makes me sick. Just because I’ve spent years studying science doesn’t mean I don’t know how to handle a few broken pieces of equipment. If they were taking care of themselves, maybe they wouldn’t need to rely on us to fix their mistakes. But no, instead they keep making it harder for everyone else. I've seen plenty of people come and go, but none of them ever treated my equipment like this before. It feels personal now, like I’m being targeted on purpose. Have I forgotten something? Is there something specific they want from me that they haven't told me about? Maybe they feel"
