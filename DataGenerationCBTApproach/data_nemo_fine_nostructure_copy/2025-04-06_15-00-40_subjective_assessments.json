        "Triggering Event": "In the bustling kitchen of La Petite Maison, he chopped onions at his station, tears streaming down his face—not from the vegetables, but from the overwhelming chaos around him. Orders piled up like unpaid invoices, and no matter how fast he worked, the tickets kept coming. He felt his girlfriend's eyes on him through the pass, her usual warm smile replaced by a furrowed brow of concern. But there was no time to comfort her or himself; tonight, it seemed, even the ovens were conspiring against him, smoking and spitting like angry dragons. As he reached for yet another ticket, his arm brushed against the hot plate, searing his skin. He yanked his hand back, but the pain was nothing compared to the helplessness that surged through him as he watched his carefully crafted mise en place crumble into disorder.",

Would his boss fire him on the spot, or would he get an automatic promotion to head chef? The question echoed in his mind as he struggled to chop the onions, each tear falling onto the counter, symbolizing the fragility of his sanity. What if this was the moment when he realized his dreams were too big, too expensive, too impossible? What if he couldn't handle the pressure, couldn’t handle the stress? The kitchen seemed to grow louder, with every sizzle and simmer a reminder that he was running out of time—time to finish cooking, time to finish paying off the loans, time to prove to everyone that he wasn’t just some foolish dreamer. The heat from the stove stung his fingers, and he winced, wondering what would happen if he lost them all, if he became just another statistic in the culinary world. If he failed now, would he ever be able to show his girlfriend again, to make her proud? She had always been his rock, his reason for working so hard. What if she left him then, what if she saw how much I hated my job? And what if she didn’t leave me? What if she stayed, but still thought I was crazy? What if she decided she could never take me seriously because I was losing control in front of her? As he finished the dish"

She tried to shake off the feeling of emptiness, telling herself it was just nostalgia playing tricks on her mind. But when she looked around, every surface felt cold and impersonal, devoid of the warmth and laughter that once filled this space. It was hard to remember that the memories she cherished were meant for him alone, and not everyone who lived in the same house would understand the depth of what they meant. As she stood up, she couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the weight of grief. Her eyes stung with tears, but she refused to let them fall, as if holding back would make her stronger. Yet, the pain lingered, a constant reminder that nothing would ever go back to the way things were before. She wondered if anyone else could truly comprehend how much this place had meant to him, or if they'd simply see it as another empty room. With a sigh, she began to wipe away the tears, trying to convince herself that it wasn't worth letting them show. After all, she didn't want to look weak or"

I need to hold onto these memories, but how can I let go when they're changing? Everything has to make sense.

They are attempting to impose meaning on the change by asking questions like \"How could we forget?\" and \"There must be some explanation.\" 4. **Consider the cognitive distortion**: Reflect on the fact that the person is unconsciously trying to maintain control over their emotions through rigid thinking patterns, which often leads to denial"
