His mind is a prison, drowning in memories that refuse to fade. Every step feels like a weight, every breath a reminder that life moves forward while he remains stuck. In this endless cycle, nothing changes—only the seasons pass. His days blend together, each one a repetition of the last. No matter how hard he tries, he can’t shake the pain. It’s all he can feel. His eyes are haunted, his smile forced, and his heart heavy with grief. Time keeps moving, but for him, it’s just an illusion—a cruel joke that refuses to end. Every day is the same, filled with reminders of what he's lost. The silence between customers is deafening, a constant reminder of the emptiness within. Even the joy of working fades when he thinks about her. There's no happiness now; only sadness and longing. The pain won't go away, and he knows it will stay with him forever. The world may be moving on, but for him, time stands still, frozen in memory. He's trapped in his thoughts, reliving moments he wishes could be forgotten. Every glance at the empty space where she used to sit feels like a punch to the gut. Her absence echoes through every corner of the shop, a harsh reminder that she's gone.

She imagines how lost he might feel without her, which adds to her feelings of regret. This isn't rational; it's just a forgotten message. Still, the feeling persists, making her wonder if he's thinking about her right now, maybe even missing her more than before. # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End # Output End"

He'd always say he just needed a glass to relax, but soon he'd be opening another, and another, until he was drunk. We'd try to talk about it, but he'd just say he wasn't hungover, that everything was fine, and that he just needed some more sleep. But we both knew it was never going to be okay again."

As she looked around her studio, she realized that everything reminded her of him. His easel sat where his own had once been, and his paints lined up on the shelf where his brushes had hung. Even the chair he'd sat in was still there, though now it held the weight of her grief. Every object seemed to whisper stories of what they'd seen together, but none of them could ever truly replace him. She sighed, knowing that no matter how hard she tried, nothing would bring him back. Yet, even in sorrow, she found herself smiling at the memory of how he'd always say, \"You're my favorite color.\" He'd told her that so many times that it had become a joke between them, one she'd never tire of hearing. Now, whenever she saw a certain shade of blue, she'd smile, remembering how it reminded her of his voice, low and soothing, speaking words of comfort and love. But"
