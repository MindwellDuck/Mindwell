Maybe you're just having trouble finding the right fit?\" \"I'll never find it,\" she sighs, shaking her head. \"Every time I submit something, it gets rejected. If I have to start over again... I'd rather just stop now.\" She lets out a deep breath. \"This one was important too. The deadline was already passed.\" He tries to reassure her. \"You can always try again. There are plenty of other opportunities. You shouldn't give up so easily.\" \"But what if this is the last chance?\" she asks, her voice trembling. \"I'm going to fail either way. I might as well quit while I still have some savings left.\" \"If you quit now, you won't have anything to fall back on,\" he points out gently. \"But maybe we could talk about your job search together? We could brainstorm ways to make it easier for you.\" She shakes her head. \"No use. Every door I knock on gets slammed shut. What if they really think I'm not good enough?\" \"What if?\" she repeats, frustration creeping into her voice. \"They would never even consider publishing me if I wasn't qualified.

No, no... this isn't about me. This is about how poorly managed the team is. We're always scrambling to keep up, and the interns are getting the big assignments because they need the practice. If I were in his shoes, I'd probably want that too. So why am I so upset? Is it really fair to compare us? Of course not! But sometimes it feels like we're being held to different standards. Like there's some sort of hidden agenda here. Maybe if I spoke up sooner, none of this would've happened. Now look at me - just another underpaid, overworked employee who can't seem to catch a break. Why does everyone else get to shine while I'm stuck in the background?"
