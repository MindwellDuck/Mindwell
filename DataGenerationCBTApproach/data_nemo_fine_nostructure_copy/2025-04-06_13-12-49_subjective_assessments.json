But as she surveys the nearly empty room, save for a few acquaintances and her ex-husband who leans against a far wall, arms crossed, she feels the humiliation rise like bile in her throat. A critic he had once introduced her to approaches him, whispering loud enough for her to hear, \"I heard this was her big break. Seems more like a crack-up.\" Her ex chuckles softly, glancing at her with a smug smile. She pretends not to notice, focusing instead on the solitary figure admiring her largest piece, but the heat of embarrassment spreads across her cheeks nonetheless.",

It must have been his doing, making it all about himself again. This whole thing is probably going to end up being another embarrassing failure like that one time when her paintings were met with nothing but scorn and rejection. And now, standing in front of my latest pieces, I can feel how pathetic she looks. I don't blame myself for feeling this way; I know what she's capable of - creating something beautiful that nobody will care about. At least not anymore."

What if someone else did it?\" This person is so preoccupied with worst-case scenarios that they're questioning everything, making assumptions, and creating anxiety for themselves unnecessarily. They are unable to accept reality and instead focus on all the possible bad things that could happen, which prevents them from moving forward with life. This behavior leads to an endless cycle of fear, constant vigilance, and a lack of trust, causing stress and limiting their ability to form meaningful connections. By getting stuck in these hypothetical situations, they miss out on real-life experiences and opportunities, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. It's essential for this person to learn how to manage their anxiety, develop coping strategies, and gradually build confidence to break free from this cycle. Only then can they truly live a fulfilling life. # Example Response (Corrected) \"Oh no! I can't believe that again. What if this time they don't let her go easily? What if they hurt her even more? Or what if it's just another prank? What if someone else did it?\" # Response Explanation This response reflects the 'What if?' cognitive distortion because it focuses excessively on hypothetical negative outcomes. The individual is preoccupied with the possibility of harm or further injury to their girlfriend, demonstrating an inability to accept reality and move"

It seemed like he took my words as an insult, so I felt bad about how I came across. Maybe if I had said something different, like, \"Can you help me find that?\" or \"Do you know where I could find...?\", I wouldn't have hurt his feelings. But no, instead, he walked right past me, taking it personally and making me feel like shit. What really gets under my skin is when he says things like, \"We're slammed today\" or \"It's crazy in here,\" like he's trying to justify why he doesn't care about what we need. I guess I should just accept it - after all, he's always saying stuff like that. Still, it stings each time, especially since it makes me wonder if I'm overreacting. Shouldn't I be understanding? But honestly, I think he knows exactly what I mean, and it's all just some kind of mind game. That's probably why he acts like he's too busy to listen to our concerns or even bother asking if we need anything else. It's like he thinks he has some kind of power over us, telling us what we can and cannot ask for. But deep down, I know he's just trying to control us. And let's be real, sometimes"
