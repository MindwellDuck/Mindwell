As I flipped through the book, more images appeared, each one sparking memories that felt out of place. There was a dinner party where he sat next to someone else at the table, and a weekend getaway where he spent hours alone in the woods, far from me. Every time I opened the book, I felt like I was living in two worlds simultaneously—a world where we shared laughter together, and another where my presence didn’t matter. These photos made me wonder if our relationship had been built on lies. What if he never truly loved me? What if he’s always been drawn to someone else? Each new image seemed to reveal a different truth, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was just a placeholder until he met someone else. What if we’d never even reached this point if he hadn’t found her first? These photographs kept whispering the same question: What if our entire life together was nothing but a lie?"

Why don't you have a badge number or anything?\" \"What do you mean you're not allowed to share information over the phone? Who told you that? I want to speak directly to someone in charge. Find out who's in charge right now and get them on the phone so we can discuss this further.\" \"I demand to know exactly how my daughter got hurt. Was she driving? Were there other people involved? Did anyone see what happened? I want all the information you have, no matter how small it may seem. If you're not going to cooperate, then hang up now.\" \"This is ridiculous. I've been off duty for two hours; I haven't received any calls related to this incident. How could you assume I'd be available to respond?

His style of teaching was outdated, using chalk to write on blackboards instead of projecting images on screens like everyone else. He often seemed disinterested in what he taught, which made it difficult for the students to take notes seriously. This is just one example of how people can distort their perception of themselves or others. By recognizing these biases, we can work towards becoming more honest with ourselves and others, leading to healthier relationships and improved mental well-being."

He remembered the fear that gripped his heart when she stepped into the crossfire, and the anguish that followed when she didn't come home. His eyes drifted away from the newspaper, lost in thought as he gazed out the window. The rain created a soothing melody, one that reminded him of happier times. But those moments were few and far between now; instead, he felt overwhelmed by the weight of his past mistakes. He wondered if there was ever a way to truly forgive himself, or if the guilt would always be there. In the end, he let go of the need for forgiveness. Instead, he focused on the lessons learned from his experiences. Though he carried the scars of his time in war, he knew that those same scars also gave him strength. With each passing day, he grew more determined to make peace with what had happened and to find solace in the present. ---"

My friend's husband used to wear that kind of badge, and now his dog is gone too. It feels like I'm just standing there watching other people have fun while I'm mourning the loss of my own pet.
