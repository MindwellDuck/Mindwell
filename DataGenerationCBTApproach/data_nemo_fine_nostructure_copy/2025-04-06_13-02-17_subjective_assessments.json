She told me stories about how her own mother would tell her, \"You have to push yourself harder than anyone else.\" It makes sense now; my grandmother is so used to pushing herself to survive. But I don't know if it's worth it anymore. Maybe it's because I'm starting to feel like I'll never be able to catch up, no matter how much effort I put into it. Sometimes when I think back to those days, I wonder what life was really like for them, and whether they ever felt as lost as I do. It must have been incredibly difficult growing up during wartime, but did they ever find peace? Maybe I’m not meant to succeed in the first place. My mom says I need to focus more on my studies, but honestly, I feel like I’m drowning in work. What if everything falls apart again? How am I supposed to handle the pressure? Even though I try to convince myself otherwise, deep down, I worry that it’s all too much for one person. What if I fail? What if someone sees me struggling and decides to take advantage of me? Maybe I shouldn’t have taken on this project in the first place. At least then I wouldn’t feel so guilty when I start to fall behind. If I could just go back to living in a small town where everyone knew each other, maybe things would"
