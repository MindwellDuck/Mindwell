This has nothing to do with me; I'm a perfectly responsible person. This must be about how incompetent the staff were before they left. They probably forgot to close everything after they went home. I can't imagine anyone would steal from us, but maybe someone broke in while we were closed? That would explain the missing knives and stuff. No, I'm not paranoid; I'm just concerned about security. Maybe I shouldn't worry about it at all. After all, I've never seen anything like this happen before. This is probably just a weird anomaly. What are the chances that something like this actually happened, huh? I'm starting to get anxious about work tomorrow, though. If I start worrying about every little thing, I'll never feel relaxed again. So, let's focus on the positives - I really need a break today. This will blow over soon enough. Everything will go back to normal, I'm sure of it. And even if something does happen, I'll deal with it then. Right now, I need to calm down. There's nothing to worry about. Nothing at all."

The way he stands there, frozen in time, makes me wonder if he’s still holding on to her. It’s hard not to feel like he thinks I’m seeing right through him, that I understand every emotion he tries to hide. Maybe he believes I see the depth of his pain, and that I somehow know what he wishes he could tell me. Or maybe he just wants someone to share this burden, to carry some part of him forward. Whatever his thought process might be, I can’t help but feel that we’re both trapped in our own little worlds, where the past keeps whispering secrets in our ears, and the present is all too fragile to keep up. But then again, perhaps he doesn’t think anything at all. Maybe he’s just standing here, lost in the silence of his grief, letting memories wash over him like waves in the ocean. Who knows? All I know is that his expression tells me stories I don’t fully understand. Yet, even in uncertainty, I find myself drawn into his world, empathizing with the ache within him. I wish I could reach"
