As he reached for a sandwich, his coworker, a middle-aged woman, entered and raised an eyebrow at him. \"Really, you're not going to change those first?\" she asked, suppressing a smile. He looked down, realizing his mistake. The gloves were stained with remnants of the patient's lunch they'd been feeding moments ago. Feeling his cheeks flush, he muttered, \"Guess I'm still learning on-the-job,\" and quickly retreated to the locker room to change.",

It’s so sad that he thinks he can just rush in like this without even washing up after dealing with all those disgusting patients. It’s just pathetic that he doesn’t have any common sense or basic hygiene skills. He needs to learn how to be more responsible and follow proper protocols before he gets hurt or someone else gets hurt because of his lack of care. How could anyone trust a healthcare professional who looks like this? Not only does he look dirty, but it’s clear he has no respect for himself or others by rushing in without changing. He really must think he’s above the rules. This is why people lose faith in the medical system when they see someone like him. What if he accidentally spreads germs to other patients? It’s just so unfortunate that he’s stuck in such a low-paying job with limited opportunities for advancement. Even if he did manage to get promoted, would anyone want to hire him again knowing how sloppy he is? This guy is truly a burden to everyone around him. His actions are so unprofessional and careless; it’s unbelievable he’s allowed to work here."

And then there were the hours she worked—over 40 each week, no matter how many times she asked for days off. It wasn't fair; other women didn't have to work so much just to make ends meet. But what really got her blood boiling was when she thought back to all those times she'd seen younger sales associates getting paid more than her, despite doing less work. They would get bonuses for meeting their targets, while she struggled to stay ahead of the game. Her manager would say things like \"It's tough out here,\" but she knew it was all about profits over people. She felt like an animal, forced to fight for scraps from the corporate table. Even though she'd been working at this store for years, she still couldn't catch up to them. It seemed unfair that they could just coast along while she hustled day after day. This wasn't right; she needed to stand up for herself somehow."

He was in the supply closet, restocking after the overnight shift, when he heard it - a faint, high-pitched beeping echoing through the empty halls. It was the sound of a patient's heart monitor alarm, left unanswered for who knows how long. His chest tightened as he dropped the box of gloves, rushing out to find silence greeting him again. The beep had stopped. But what if it hadn't? What if someone needed help, and no one heard their desperate call? Panic surged within him, his breath coming in shallow gasps.
