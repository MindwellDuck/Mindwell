A woman in pearls approached, her eyes scanning the artwork critically before turning to the artist.\n\n\"You know,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, \"I've seen better from my granddaughter's school art club.\" Then she walked away, leaving the elderly artist standing alone with her humiliation, a crimson stain spreading across her cheeks.",

There was something about the way she spoke, as if every word carried weight, like each critique could define her entire life. It wasn't just the words themselves, but the tone behind them—a tone that seemed to say, \"You're not good enough.\" Her mind began to wander to all the times she'd been dismissed or criticized, even when she thought she'd done well. She remembered being told her paintings looked like those made by children, not by someone who spent years honing her craft. Even then, it felt like a blow to her identity, making her question whether she truly belonged among artists. This latest incident didn't surprise her; it fit a pattern she'd noticed over time. People often judged based on how they perceived her, rather than what she actually created. They saw her as an outsider, someone who didn't quite belong. It was as if she was invisible, a ghost passing through their lives unnoticed. Now, she wondered if this woman was different. Maybe she knew more than she let on, maybe there was a reason behind her harsh words. But deep down, she knew it wouldn’t matter. No one ever gave her a chance because of who she was, not what she did. They saw her as a failure, a weak link in their chain of success. And now, she was faced with another rejection, another reminder that she would never be accepted. It"

No, she quickly pushed that thought aside. She knew better than to read too much into his behavior. They'd talked about it before - he wasn't trying to annoy her; he just forgot sometimes.

I'm shaking my head, trying to process why someone could be so oblivious to danger. This isn't the first time; she's always been reckless, never paying attention to details. It's no surprise, though—it's who she is. I remember all those times she'd leave things unattended, forgetting simple tasks until they became big problems. And now, here we are, dealing with the aftermath of her negligence. I don't know how to help her, but I guess I'll have to try. Maybe next time she'll learn. But deep down, I worry she'll never change. I feel like giving up sometimes, but I still care about her. Still want to help her get better, even if it feels futile. Still hope one day she'll realize how important it is to pay attention."

Maybe I am just stressed out. Stress can make people seem distant, right? Anyway, I told her it was fine, no big deal, but inside, I felt like screaming. What is wrong with me? Why does everything have to go wrong? We were supposed to celebrate tonight, maybe even renew our vows. But what's the point? It's just another reminder of how much things are falling apart. My career, my life—isn't anything going to go right for us anymore? Maybe I should just accept that we're losing each other, that this is the end of us. After all, it would explain why she's acting so strange lately. I know she's upset because of the whole thing, but she's being really distant, almost as if she doesn't want to talk about it.
