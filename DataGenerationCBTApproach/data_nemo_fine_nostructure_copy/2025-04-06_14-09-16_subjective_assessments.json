Maybe he felt trapped by family responsibilities, or maybe there was more going on with him that he wasn't sharing.

I've worked so hard, pouring my heart into this project, while he's coasted along, letting others do the heavy lifting.

She glanced down at her own hands, still rough from hours spent in the lab, then back up at them, their laughter echoing like a mockery of her once-shared jokes.

Now, seeing them together, it hit me again: He’s so good at reading people, and I’m the one who can barely read my own thoughts. It’s frustrating. I try to focus on the bigger picture, but there are moments where it feels like I’m missing out on something important, like I’m not really hearing what he’s saying. It's hard not to feel left behind. She remembers all the times he was there for her, listening and offering support when she needed it most. But now, watching him move forward with ease, it makes her realize she might have let things go too quickly. The fact that he found someone else so soon after their breakup is almost...empowering? Maybe it means she needs to take a step back and reevaluate what she wants. Yet, every time she looks at him, she can't shake off the feeling that she's losing herself in the process. That's why she finds herself wondering if maybe it would be better to just leave everything behind and start fresh somewhere else. But that thought also leads to another question: What if she doesn’t want to leave? What if"

She started talking about how busy she was and how she couldn't stop scrolling through social media because she needed to keep up with what everyone else was doing. It really bothered me - here I am, trying to enjoy some peace and quiet, while she's out living her life, oblivious to everything around her. I feel like I'm always stuck in the background while she's off exploring new places. Even though I'm happy to see her, I can't help feeling jealous whenever she comes back with all these stories about her friends and adventures. Sometimes I wish I could be more like her, carefree and spontaneous. But no matter how hard I try, I end up feeling like a burden, like I'm holding her back from experiencing life.
