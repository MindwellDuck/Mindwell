Even though she knew he wouldn't really say such harsh things to her, she still felt like she was going to cry. This isn't just about forgetting a dessert, it's about how I failed him and myself. I'm not even a good partner anymore. Maybe we shouldn't have gotten together in the first place. Now, every time he says something like this, I'll just start sobbing uncontrollably.

They would probably say he's just doing his job, but they don't understand how much this affects me.

My poor husband was so cheap he couldn't even get his hands on something as simple as this. What kind of man doesn't deserve a Rolex? How could someone who didn't know the value of money end up with a woman as beautiful as hers? This is ridiculous. I can't believe I let myself get into a situation where I had to settle for such a low-quality timepiece. I shouldn't have accepted that gift from my brother-in-law. Now I look at her watch and wonder if I'll ever be able to afford something similar. The fact that she has this luxury while I'm stuck with this inferior piece makes me question whether I was even worthy of being married.

Every color blends into a mix of sadness and regret, forcing her to confront the truth: if this painting doesn’t turn out perfect, she fails both herself and him. The thought alone sends her back to the drawing board, erasing everything she’d already done, until she starts again, hoping to erase her pain along with it. But no matter how hard she tries, she can’t seem to let go of the past. With each passing day, the guilt grows, making it harder to breathe, harder to paint, harder to live. And yet, she continues to struggle, trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and grief, refusing to accept anything less than perfection – not just for herself but for the memory of what could have been."
