The penmanship matched his. Her heart sank as she realized it wasn't just another complaint; it was another sign of his growing discontent with their marriage. Another subtle dig at her long hours at the store, her exhaustion each evening. She felt a lump form in her throat as she crumpled the note into her palm, her unhappiness weighing heavier than ever.",

We need to talk soon—I don’t know how much more of this I can handle. I swear, every time he does something like this, I become more convinced that I made a huge mistake by marrying him."

She walked over to him, noticing the email open on his laptop - a reply from HR regarding the promotion she'd applied for. The words \"We regret to inform you...\" stared back at her.

She sighs inwardly, feeling a mix of frustration and sadness. “Let’s focus on your health right now,” she says gently, trying to steer the conversation back to more practical matters.

How could anyone love someone who didn't fit into their narrow-minded world? The thought sent a chill down my spine, making me feel like I was walking through the cold winter night, rain pouring down on my face, the sound echoing in my ears. I remembered how she would always say that we were meant to be, that our love was strong enough to overcome anything, but now, I wasn't so sure. What if she was just saying what she wanted to hear? What if she was lying to herself, just like everyone else back then? Maybe she never really loved me; maybe she just saw an opportunity to escape the life she didn't want.
