Today, however, the familiar hum of the fluorescent lights seemed oppressive rather than comforting. His usually steady hands trembled slightly as he adjusted the focus, the once-familiar dance now feeling foreign and unwieldy. The slide, containing samples from months of painstaking research, remained frustratingly unclear no matter how he tried to bring it into view. He felt his chest tighten, a familiar sensation that had become all too frequent lately. It was as if he were drowning in his own lab, surrounded by the very tools and knowledge that once defined him, now rendering him helpless.",

Maybe I'm going crazy."

They don’t understand that we’re underpaid and overworked, which makes us more likely to make mistakes. If you think about it, most people wouldn’t even bother caring for someone unless there’s something in it for them. Even if they pretend to be compassionate, they secretly feel like they're doing us a favor by taking our jobs. It’s just human nature—people always prioritize themselves first. I can’t trust anyone in the medical field; they all have ulterior motives."

But honestly, I think she's trying to make me feel bad by being so enthusiastic about your artwork. It looks like she's having an amazing time. I bet she is, isn't she? Just imagine how proud you must be to see someone else enjoying your work so much. She's clearly trying to distract everyone from your latest piece. It's probably one of those things where she thinks \"Oh, let's go over here and talk to him instead of me.\" I hope she doesn't get jealous of your success. She might start feeling left out, but don't worry, we'll all still appreciate your art together. Just look at her; she's having the time of her life. Her face is light up whenever she talks about you. This could be a great opportunity to reconnect and show her how proud you are of her accomplishments. You seem to be taking this well, even though it feels like you're secretly angry. Don't worry, I won't judge you for feeling upset. After all, she's just being friendly.

He must have forgotten that part of our past interactions. How could he just forget all that? Why does everyone else get these promotions and accolades while I'm still stuck here? It's so frustrating! The irony is that now he has the chance to lead a team again, which I've always dreamed of doing. But no, he gets the reward instead, while I'm left behind. I'm starting to feel like I'll never be recognized for my work, especially since he got this promotion right after retiring. It doesn't make sense, but deep down, I know there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just not cut out for leadership positions. This situation makes me realize that I'm probably not as capable as I thought I was. It's really disheartening. Even though she knows intellectually that the comparison isn’t fair, she can’t shake off the feeling that she’s somehow less deserving than others. This time, she hasn't realized the distortion, and therefore, remains entrenched in the negative emotions. In reality, she had nothing to do with the other guy's promotion.

She hadn't walked in his shoes, faced the crushing blow of unemployment like he did. Her support meant nothing; it was just empty platitudes designed to make me feel better. When I looked at her, all I saw were condescending smiles and patronizing nods. She didn't really care about my struggles. She didn't know how it felt to be trapped in this limbo, unable to find work, watching my savings dwindle, and feeling like a burden to our family. The thought made my chest tighten with resentment. Why would she understand? She hasn’t lived through this. All her life, she’s had things handed to her – good jobs, a comfortable home, a loving partner who adores her. Meanwhile, I’ve struggled for years, working multiple jobs just to keep us afloat, sacrificing everything for her happiness. Now, when I look at her, I see someone who doesn’t get it, someone who doesn’t know what I’m going through. Every time she tries to comfort me, it feels like a betrayal. She thinks she can fix this by saying \"just wait\" or \"you'll find something soon,\" but she has no idea what that"
