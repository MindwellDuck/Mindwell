She wondered if anyone else had seen, if they were silently mocking her too, and how long would this humiliation last? She could almost hear herself being ridiculed by everyone around her, her mind replaying the moment over and over, each time making her cringe more. She became so self-conscious that she avoided looking directly at people, fearing their reactions to her mistakes. Even simple tasks like checking her emails started to feel like an insurmountable challenge, because now she saw them as reminders of her own incompetence. Every mistake she made seemed to compound her feelings of inadequacy, making her wish she never opened that email, no matter how important it was. Now, she hesitated to answer messages from colleagues, worried they'd notice her errors too. Each time someone asked for her help, she felt like a burden, as if she was already a liability to the team before the mistake. It wasn’t just one thing; it was everything.
