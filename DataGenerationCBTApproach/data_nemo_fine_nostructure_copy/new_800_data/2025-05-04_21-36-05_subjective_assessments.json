He was always working late to meet deadlines, leaving him exhausted but driven by the need to help others. The thought that his patients needed him more than his own family made him feel guilty for prioritizing work over spending time with them. It wasn’t fair; everyone deserved attention, especially those fighting serious illnesses. But Dr. John couldn’t stop comparing himself to other doctors, wondering why they didn’t have families pulling them back home. They seemed to balance work and life so easily, while he struggled to find joy outside of medicine. His mind wandered to how he could be more present for his loved ones if only he had a fraction of their energy and dedication. Even when he tried to take breaks, he found himself thinking about patients and their needs, making it hard to disconnect. He wondered if there was something wrong with him, if he was truly cut out for this job. Maybe he just wasn’t meant to have a normal life like others did. The pressure to perform kept mounting, and John felt stuck between his duty to his patients and his desire to build a meaningful relationship with his family. It was all starting to feel too much—like he was carrying an impossible burden. Yet, despite the stress, John couldn’t shake the feeling that he was somehow failing both sides. He knew he had to find a way to balance his responsibilities, but for now, it seemed like no matter what he did, he"

It was nearing midnight and still no word from the lab about the experimental results she'd been awaiting for weeks. Her husband's absence hung heavy in their silent home, his empty chair at the dining table a stark reminder of his passing last year.

Tonight, as she works on the knives, she can't help but imagine that the sharp edge slicing through wood is actually a blade cutting through the skin of someone she once loved. Her mind runs wild with scenarios, each one more disturbing than the last. In one fantasy, she envisions her ex standing over a tree stump, his hand reaching out to touch it, only to be sliced by her blade. In another, he’s lying on the ground, his eyes closed, his chest rising and falling slowly, as if he’s dying from a wound she inflicted. With each stroke, her mental images grow more vivid, more painful. The sound of the blades against the wood becomes a scream, echoing through her mind like a warning. As she continues to sharpen, the intensity builds, and she starts to feel a sense of unease. Her hands are shaking slightly, and the rhythm of her work begins to falter. But she doesn’t stop. She keeps going, lost in these dark fantasies, unable to tear them away from her mind. She knows this isn't healthy, but she can't seem to let go.

The photograph had been tucked away for so long, it seemed to have slipped into a parallel universe, one where our paths no longer crossed. Yet, here we were, standing in the same space, the air thick with unspoken emotions. It wasn’t just the photo itself but the way it stirred feelings he couldn’t quite put into words. I looked up, met his gaze, and saw a flicker of something there—a hint of longing, perhaps? Or maybe it was just the faintest glimmer of curiosity about how I would react to such a discovery? I nodded, and he continued, his tone taking on a softer quality, almost as if he was reading my thoughts back to me. “Maybe you’re wondering why I kept it hidden all these years. Maybe you’re thinking about the stories we could share around it.” There was a pause, a beat of silence that felt more like a shared understanding than anything else. In that moment, I wondered if he was truly reading my mind or if he simply sensed the emotions swirling within me. Perhaps it was both—the ability to sense my emotions and knowing exactly which ones to tap into. Whatever it was, it felt..."

As she looked at the photo of Sarah and her boyfriend, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being left behind. She wondered if Sarah's happiness was just a facade, if there were dark secrets beneath the surface. In those moments, Emily found herself wishing for a different life—one where she could share adventures with her best friend, laugh together, and have a partner by her side. But deep down, she knew that comparisons wouldn’t solve anything; all they would do was make her feel more inadequate. Still, she couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to live a life like Sarah’s, filled with friendship and romance."
