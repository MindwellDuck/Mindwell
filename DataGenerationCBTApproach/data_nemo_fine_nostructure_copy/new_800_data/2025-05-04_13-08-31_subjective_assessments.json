My roommate has these amazing energy bars she makes herself, but I've never tried one because they're always so perfectâ€”no crumbs, no mess, just clean, healthy goodness. Her family cooks together all the time, and everything looks so organized. She has this big walk-in fridge full of fresh fruits and veggies, while I can barely fit two apples in mine. And did I mention her dog is super cute? Mine is fine too, but I guess mine isn't as adorable. My boyfriend's car is always spotless inside, but I'm pretty sure his mom does it for him. I mean, my car's okay, but it gets messy quicklyâ€”my friend's car is always sparkling clean, and hers is way nicer than mine.

His heart spikes as they tailgate, merging onto the highway. He checks his speed - 70 mph, no reason to slow down. But the car behind him doesn't relent, its horn blaring. Sweat beads on his forehead, knuckles tighten around the steering wheel. The clock ticks closer to midnight, his anxiety surging with each passing mile.",

It also reflects the subtle nature of the distortion by avoiding explicit acknowledgment. Please provide your own examples for the other two cognitive distortions (Catastrophizing & All-or-nothing thinking) as well. This will help me understand better what you are looking for in terms of feedback. Thank you! ðŸ˜Š --- Here are my responses for Catastrophizing & All-or-nothing thinking: ### Catastrophizing Response: \"It's been like this for months now, ever since my sister passed away. Her death has changed everything, and I feel like nothing goes right anymore. I've had multiple job interviews recently, and every one has ended badly. Not because of anything I did, but because of something that went wrongâ€”traffic jams, bad weather, or even just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Each time, I feel like I failed somehow, and it's made me more anxious. I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering if there was something I could have done differently."

But deep inside, she fears that maybe he has moved on and found someone better â€“ someone who could offer him the stability and companionship he craves after years of her trying to fill that void. The possibility keeps her up at night, wondering what would have been if she hadnâ€™t left. If only she had stayed, perhaps things couldâ€™ve turned out differently.

But deep down, he knew it wasnâ€™t fair to her; she deserved better than someone who kept chasing after her. Maybe he should just accept that heâ€™ll always be alone and let go of hope. The pain of losing her would be too much to face again. He wondered if he should just move on and find another woman to love, but then he remembered how much he loved her and how much he wanted to make her happy again. He couldnâ€™t help but think that he should have done things differently back then, but he couldnâ€™t change the past now. He wished he could turn back time and relive those memories, but he knew it wouldnâ€™t work. He sighed and closed his eyes, letting the tears flow freely. He didnâ€™t want to hurt her anymore, but he also didnâ€™t want to give up. He felt like he was stuck between two worlds, one where he was happy with her, and the other where he was alone. He couldnâ€™t imagine living without her, but he also didnâ€™t know how to get her back. He felt trapped, and he didnâ€™t know what to do. ### Response"
