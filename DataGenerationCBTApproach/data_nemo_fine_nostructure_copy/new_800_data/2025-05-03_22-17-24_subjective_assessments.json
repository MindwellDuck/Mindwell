Maybe I wouldn't have volunteered at all if I didn’t remember. This is such a great opportunity for me to honor her memory in a meaningful way."

Her partner's car is already there, the empty passenger seat beside hers a stark reminder of his absence on this routine night. She sits in the silence for a moment, watching the rain blur the world beyond her windows, before finally stepping inside to find him quietly reading in their dimly lit living room. The warmth of their home does little to chase away the chill that's settled deep within her, a melancholy echo of countless nights like this, alone together.",

I can't help but feel that this time it's personal - like he's deliberately staying with me tonight just to remind me how much he's missing his friends from college who are probably all out having fun at a bar somewhere. Maybe they're celebrating a reunion or something? It's hard not to think that, especially after seeing the photos he posted earlier today, showing them laughing together, holding drinks, and dancing. He never would've done that if we were still together. That's why he's here tonight, to keep me down while he's enjoying those memories. It makes sense; he'd rather be with friends than me. Why else would he stay? But what really gets me is when he doesn't even try to hide it - sitting there, reading, completely absorbed in whatever book he's got his nose buried in. Does he even notice how quiet it is outside? How lonely I am? No, he's too busy being happy about those guys back home, forgetting about me. And then there's the fact that he didn't even offer to walk my dog. It must mean he doesn't care about me anymore; otherwise, he'd want to spend some quality time with our pet, right? This isn't the first time he’s chosen hanging out with friends over us. Every time I ask him if everything is okay, he just brushes it off. He tells me he loves me, but actions speak louder than words,"

Maybe it wouldn't have mattered; maybe this wasn't meant for me. What if I had found a way to regain my footing, to contribute to the world in meaningful ways again? But life has a way of moving forward, leaving no room for what-ifs. Still, I held onto those thoughts, wondering about the paths not taken, the potential that lay dormant within me."
