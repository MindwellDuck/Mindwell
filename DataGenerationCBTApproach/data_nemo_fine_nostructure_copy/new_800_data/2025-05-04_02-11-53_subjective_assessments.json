His mind began racing with questions—what did she see when she looked at him? Was she angry about the whole thing? Had she forgiven him for what happened? Every glance he caught of her made him feel like she was trying to avoid him, but deep down, he wondered if he was reading too much into it. They'd been through so much together, shared so many memories, and now this. He thought back to all the times they'd laughed together, the inside jokes, the late-night talks about life after graduation. Why would she suddenly ignore him? He tried to push these thoughts aside, telling himself it was probably just nerves. But he couldn't help wondering if there was more to it. Maybe she’d realized that he wasn’t who he used to be. That maybe he wasn’t as reliable as she thought. Maybe he was just another disappointment waiting to happen. Or perhaps she simply didn’t want to deal with him anymore, especially given how things had ended. As he stood there, lost in his thoughts, he couldn’t help but feel like he was missing out on something important. What was going through her mind? Was she thinking about him at all? Did she even care? The questions swirled in his head, making it harder to focus on anything else. Finally, he pushed open the door and stepped"

After all, what's one more missed appointment compared to all the others? It doesn't even seem like a big deal—the same thing happened two weeks ago. And the week before that was when she called in sick. I swear, sometimes I wonder if we could have gotten by without her. You know, I'm starting to think that maybe she's just not as reliable as everyone makes her out to be. Maybe she’s using her family emergencies as an excuse to avoid our sessions. That would explain why she keeps canceling at the last minute. So many times, she says something like, “Oh, I forgot,” or “It slipped my mind.” Like she's playing some kind of game with us. But no matter how hard I try to see things from her perspective, I always end up feeling frustrated and disappointed. This isn’t going to change anytime soon. I’m tired of dealing with these constant cancellations. It’s frustrating enough when she shows up late or misses an entire session, but this is different. At least then I can make sense of it. But every time she cancels without warning, I feel like she’s choosing to put herself first instead of taking"

I chose two paintings that I thought were nice, but she didn't like them. After I left the store, I felt sad because I thought she would have liked those paintings. Later that day, while helping with chores, I saw a third painting that I thought she might like. When I told her about it, she said no, which made me feel even worse. I don't understand why this happens, but every time I think of something negative, I can't stop thinking about it. It's like there's a switch inside me that flips whenever I remember something bad. And the more I think about it, the more I want to forget it. I try to push these thoughts away, but they keep coming back, making me feel stuck in a cycle of sadness. Sometimes I wish I could just turn off my mind like a TV, but I know it's impossible. Every memory has its own special power to hurt me, and I'm powerless to stop it.

She said I was controlling, manipulative, and made her feel trapped. And with those words, everything fell apart. We were supposed to be building a future together, but instead, we destroyed each other. Even now, five years later, the pain feels like a heavy weight, crushing me. Sometimes, late at night, I wonder what could have been if only she had stayed. If only we could have worked through our issues, if only she had given us another chance. What if she wasn't running away from me but trying to escape the toxic situation we created? Maybe if I had known sooner, if only I had understood how deep her suffering went, maybe I could have changed. Maybe I could have shown her that I loved her enough to let go of my own demons.

It felt like the whole world was against me now. Even though I was supposed to be celebrating, every time I looked around, I saw reminders of what I’ve lost. Our kitchen, once full of laughter, was now empty, except for this letter. I could almost hear his voice, telling me how much he missed me, but deep down, I knew it was all a trick.
