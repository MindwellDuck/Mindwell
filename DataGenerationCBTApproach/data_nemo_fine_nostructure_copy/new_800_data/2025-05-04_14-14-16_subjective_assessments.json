But today, her ring isn't there. Panic surges as she remembers: she took it off last night to clean, placed it on the kitchen counter... and now it's gone. She rushes into the kitchen, eyes darting frantically over every surface, heart pounding like a runaway train in her chest. The room spins as she sinks to the floor, hands shaking, breath coming in ragged gasps.",

I’ve been so careless with my belongings lately—everything has disappeared at some point. And now, it seems, even my wedding ring has vanished. This can’t be real—it feels like an awful dream. But the pain in my heart tells me otherwise. It hurts too much to think about anything else. I feel guilty for even thinking about leaving my husband, but he never truly loved me anyway. He was always distant, and I was just his trophy wife. I know I deserved better, but I stayed because of him and our children. Now, though, I’m left alone, forced to confront reality. My life is falling apart, and I don’t know how to stop it."

Why is she doing this? I can’t stand seeing her with another guy, knowing what they’re talking about behind my back. The fact that she’s laughing with him makes it worse - I feel like she’s enjoying every moment of it. This isn’t just a simple mistake; it shows that she has no respect for us or our relationship.

He just wasn't cut out for it. There was no way he could have put that kind of effort into something as trivial as baking. It was ridiculous that she thought he would ever try. He hated being asked to do stuff like that. What did they need more baked goods for anyway? They already had enough from the church. And what if he messed it up again? He certainly hadn't impressed with his last attempt. That time, he'd ended up with burnt offerings and a batch of stale cookies. If she kept pushing him, she'd never get anything good. The whole thing felt like a waste of his time. Why bother? She needed to understand that baking wasn't really his thing, but she wouldn't listen. She just kept expecting better results, which meant she expected him to fail. This is the first time she'd asked him to participate, and now she was expecting him to take charge. But he couldn't do that. He wouldn't be able to handle the pressure. It wasn't fair to expect him to suddenly become some kind of baking genius when he was so clearly incapable.
