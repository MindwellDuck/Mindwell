My dishes were always clumsy attempts, lacking the finesse he possessed. Even the simplest meals became complicated when he was around, but now...now it feels impossible. What if I add too much salt? Too little pepper? Or maybe I'll forget the herbs altogether, ruining the entire dish. He had this incredible ability to balance flavors, to understand the subtleties of cooking in a way I couldn't begin to grasp. And now...now I feel like I'll never master it, that my attempt will be nothing but disappointment. I can already taste the failure, the sadness of knowing he won't be here to enjoy it, that I'll serve him something he wouldn't have liked. Why try? He'd hate me for it, and I'd be right there with him. Better to leave the food cold on the counter until it goes bad than risk making something he'd despise. At least then I know I"

In the second example, the speaker assumes the student is shocked at receiving the letter about grades, despite having no direct access to their thought process. The speaker implies that they understand the student's emotions and inner turmoil through mind reading, without actually knowing how the student feels. This demonstrates the cognitive distortion of Mind Reading. ## Another one: \"I bet she didn't expect that, did she?\" \"My brother always says things like that, but sometimes you wonder if he's being sarcastic.\" ## Output: \"The way he smiled made me think he had a plan up his sleeve,\" said Sarah, nodding enthusiastically. \"He's such a smooth talker,\" she added, rolling her eyes. \"But don't worry, I'm sure"

Please copy/paste your own thought process into the box below. # ### Output: ## Step 1: Recognize the Trigger Recognize the trigger that led to the distorted thinking. In this case, the trigger was seeing the other woman laugh with Tom. ## Step 2: Identify the Cognitive Distortion Identify the cognitive distortion involved in the response. This is Mind Reading, where the person believes they can read the thoughts or intentions of others without solid evidence. ## Step 3: Analyze the Thought Process Analyze the thought process behind the response to identify the distortions. The response shows signs of Mind Reading as it assumes the woman is plotting something with Tom and feels like an outsider in the group. ## Step 4: Evaluate the Evidence Evaluate the evidence supporting the distorted thinking. In this case, there are no clear indicators of any wrongdoing by the woman or Tom. They are simply sharing a joke. ## Step 5: Reframe the Response Reframe the response to eliminate the distorted thinking.

No, she probably would've just been angry. What does she expect from this interview anyway? Just another chance for him to get away with everything? Maybe she'll feel more anger when she sees his face again. Yeah, she definitely won't stop being angry, so why bother trying to process this now? She doesn't really care what he has to say; she's already made up her mind. He could be saying something completely different and she'd still think he was a monster.

She can't forgive him; she hasn't forgiven him yet. Why apologize for something you haven't apologized for? Anyway, she knows exactly how she wants to react.
