It's stupid, but it still bothers me how much attention they're giving each other. It's like my mind can't help but think about all the times we used to share laughs like that, and it makes me wonder if I'll ever get someone like her again. But why does it have to be this way? Why can't I see her with anyone else? Just because they're friends doesn’t mean anything. I know that, but deep down, I wish I wasn't so insecure. Maybe I’m just jealous because I don't have someone like her by my side anymore. It’s hard to accept that life goes on for everyone else, while mine is stuck in this rut. I guess I need to focus on my own life and stop dwelling on what could’ve been. Still, seeing them together keeps coming back to haunt me. It feels like my heart can't let go, and I keep thinking about how I could've changed things. It’s ridiculous, but I can't shake off these thoughts. It's almost as if I'm trying to convince myself that I deserve someone like her,"

And now, I'm faced with this new reality: she's still there, teaching, laughing with her students, while I've been living in solitude. It feels like she's moved on, leaving me behind. Her smile, once so bright, has faded into indifference. Every day, I see her passing by my apartment window, and I wonder if she thinks about us at all. Maybe she does, but why would she? She must be happy now, surrounded by young minds eager to learn. My mind can't help but fill in the gaps, imagining her holding hands with another man, sharing stories that don't involve me. That's all I can think about now—the thought of her moving on. It's hard not to feel resentful when I realize she's kept their son close to her side. He's probably growing up with two mothers instead of just one, and I'm stuck outside, watching from afar. But what really hurts is when I hear her voice, soft and soothing, guiding her students through lessons. It sounds so natural, so effortless. I imagine her sitting at home, reading letters from them, listening to their progress, and feeling proud of the teacher she's become."

She asks the man to fill out a statement, and he hesitates for a moment before starting to speak. As he talks, you listen intently, trying to process what he’s saying. It sounds like something out of a nightmare – a young man, barely out of his teenage years, arrested for dealing drugs. What could have led him down this path? As he speaks, you find yourself thinking about your own life. You’ve worked hard to get where you are, building a career and a family. Your son is all grown up now, working and making his own way in the world. It feels like there’s a disconnect between the man standing before you and the person you once knew. You think back to when your son started getting involved with bad people. There were signs, but you never imagined things would escalate this far. How did he end up like this? Was it something specific that pushed him off course? And what does it say about you that your child"

But until then, I'll just have to grit my teeth and keep going. Dinner was cold, but I didn't even notice. I was too busy scrolling through social media, looking for anything that would distract me from this endless cycle of rejection. It’s not worth eating anyway. My stomach doesn’t care about food right now; it’s just empty space where emotions once were. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been told no, how many rejections I've faced. It’s starting to feel like nothing matters anymore. As I lay here, staring at the ceiling, I wonder if there's ever a point when things start getting better. Is this what it means to be a journalist? Always chasing something that might never come? At least I got some work done tonight, though. That has to count for something, right? But I guess it wasn’t enough. They still say no. Dinner was over before we even started. I just went through the motions, pretending everything"
