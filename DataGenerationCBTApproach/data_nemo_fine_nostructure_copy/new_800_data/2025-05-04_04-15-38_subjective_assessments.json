The room grew darker, shadows deepening around her, and yet she couldn’t tear herself away from this task. It was both a tribute and a reminder of what she’d lost. With each passing moment, she felt more isolated, as if she were trapped between two worlds – one where he existed, and another where she now lived alone. The air seemed to thicken, heavy with memories and longing. Every step forward felt like a betrayal, as if she were walking through a memory lane she didn’t want to revisit. Yet, she couldn’t help but be drawn deeper into this space, where the past and present collided. Each shirt became a piece of history, a tangible connection to him that refused to fade. As she continued to fold, her thoughts drifted, weaving together fragments of their life together. In the end, she realized that this task wasn’t just about preparing for his departure—it was about holding onto what they once shared, even when he was no longer there to hold it for her."
