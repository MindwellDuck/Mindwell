All these other kids got chosen, but they're just more talented than she is. My daughter has been trying really hard this year, but it doesn't seem to matter. The other parents were probably more involved in their children's lives, which must have given them an advantage. Meanwhile, our kid hasn't had the same level of parental support, which explains why we weren't even invited to auditions. It's just not fair how some families get preferred treatment while others are left behind. I've tried talking to the teacher, but she just keeps saying \"everyone gets a chance\" - that's easy for her to say when she doesn't have to deal with the disappointment of watching her own child fail."

He had been so calm and collected, pointing out that she was overreacting to what felt like a minor mistake, all while humming the tune himself. It was almost as if he was rubbing it in, showing off his supposed emotional control. When she confronted him about it later, he just shrugged it off, saying he didn't know why she made such a big deal out of it. But deep down, she knew he was trying to make her feel inferior by acting like everything was fine when it wasn't.

It makes me wonder if he has some personal connection to her as well, which could explain why he didn't seem to care about our privacy. His actions are just another example of how uncaring people like him think they can get away with anything."

He kept saying things like, \"They're trying to sabotage me\" and \"This is personal.\" It seemed like he was already jumping to conclusions about who might have done it, and I worried that he'd overreact before we even knew what happened."

She's done being the second-hand nurse to countless other people's spouses, watching as they get to enjoy life while she's stuck here, holding hands, whispering prayers, and comforting tears. It doesn't help that she heard the young nurse snicker with her patient earlier today. Something about how they'd never have to deal with what she's going through—how they wouldn't be burdened by caring for someone else's loved one until they're nothing but memories—is just too much. Why would anyone want that? But of course, she knows why. Younger generations don't understand the weight of responsibility that comes with loving someone so deeply. They think it's easy to say, \"Oh, I'll take care of him,\" but when the time comes, they'll realize they're no better than her. And then there are those who genuinely love, but it's all in vain because their partner dies first. There's no escape from this curse. As she sits in her rocking chair, she thinks about all the years of sacrifice, all the times she had to put her own needs aside. All the sleepless nights and endless worry over whether everything was okay. How could it be fair? Life isn't fair"

They just laughed louder, enjoying every moment of her embarrassment. She couldn’t take it anymore—she needed to make them feel the way they made her feel. She had had enough of being treated like this."
