The restaurant they were supposed to meet at was now dark and closed, its sign flickering ominously. Another shift covered by him. Disappointment weighed heavy in her chest, a familiar ache that had become all too common.

Every student's struggles, every heartbreak, every whispered secret feels like a puzzle piece falling into place. The weight of it all presses down on him, making him wonder if he's truly doing enough. Sometimes, in the silence of his room, he lets himself imagine the worst-case scenarios - students slipping further into darkness, teachers failing them because they're just too broken. He tries not to let those thoughts consume him, but they linger, haunting him. He starts to see a pattern where every time someone opens up about their pain, it just leads to more suffering. The thought haunts him that maybe he's not as effective as he thinks, that he might actually be part of the problem. It’s hard for him to shake off the feeling that he’s running out of chances to make things better. He wonders how long he can keep pushing through when it feels like everything around him is spiraling downward."

If anything, using up the broth is probably a good thing - it means he's cooking! But no, she's still mad about it, and now she's probably going to waste more time making another pot. Maybe we should tell her to chill out."

Or maybe they're worried about me?\" The questions swirl around him, making his anxiety spike. \"If they were in my shoes, would they still choose this job?\" He begins to feel overwhelmed by these thoughts, and his mind starts racing with \"what ifs.\" The thought that someone might see him as weak or incompetent fills him with fear. \"How will I face them when I walk back into the unit today?\" He tries to shake off the feeling, but his heart keeps pounding in his chest.

But then I think, maybe I don't need to be reminded of what I lack by constantly hearing about hers. It's better if I focus on what I have, right? Like how I've been doing so well at work lately. I can handle this solitude, I really am capable of making the most out of it. This is exactly why I'm glad I moved out – I get to prove to myself that I can do things on my own, without relying on anyone else. And who knows, maybe one day I'll find someone to share these moments with, but until then, I don't want to let the past define me. I'm better off focusing on the present and future. I know it sounds selfish, but I genuinely believe that if I keep pushing forward, I'll end up happier someday. And honestly, that's all that matters. I just wish she wasn't here, calling me names and making me feel small again. The way she laughs now feels forced, almost like she's trying too hard to make me feel better. But deep down, I know I deserve better. I won't let her words bring me down; I'm stronger than that. I just wish I could"
