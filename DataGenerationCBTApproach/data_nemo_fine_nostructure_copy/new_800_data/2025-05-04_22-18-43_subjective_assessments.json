Her reflection in the glass stared back at her, gray hair and wrinkles telling a story of time passed, but it was the unshed tears glistening in her eyes that spoke of the regret that lingered like a bitter taste on her tongue.",

It wasn't just about the loss of his dream; it was about the erosion of everything he'd built over years of dedication. How could this have happened? Had he somehow been blind to the warning signs? Had he missed something that would have prevented this disaster? It didn't even make sense—how did one person manage to pull off such a heinous act? Wasn't there something he had missed? Something he hadn't noticed? Maybe there were more clues than he initially thought. But then again, maybe he was reading too much into it. Maybe it was just an honest mistake... But now that he knew, how could he ever go back to trusting anyone in the lab? They must all be plotting against him, waiting for him to slip up so they can pounce. This isn't just about the co-author; it's about the entire team turning against him. And what if it's not just them? What if everyone is out to get him? This has gone way beyond just a simple mistake. There must be a deeper conspiracy at play here, something far more sinister than he could possibly imagine.

I know she wouldn’t just leave without talking about it, but I still can’t help thinking about all the possibilities. My anxiety is through the roof, and I’m trying to calm myself down but nothing seems to work. This is so unfair—she’s always been so open with me. Now, everything feels like a betrayal. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. It feels like we’re on opposite sides of a deep chasm, and I don’t see a way back together. I’m exhausted from trying to understand, and yet, I can’t stop analyzing every detail. I feel trapped in this endless cycle of questioning, searching for answers that might never come. It’s like I’m stuck in a nightmare, unable to wake up. Every second feels like an hour, and I fear things will only get worse.

It wasn’t just that they called my work childish; it seemed like they were saying something much more personal – that I was immature, unprofessional, and maybe even delusional for thinking I could be an artist again. That moment, and the way they looked at me, made me feel so small and insignificant. I tried to ignore it, but the thought lingered, making me question whether I truly deserved this chance.
