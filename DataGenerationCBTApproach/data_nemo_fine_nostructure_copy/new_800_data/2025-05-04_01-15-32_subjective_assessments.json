She was a horrible mother, too distracted by her job to care about her children’s well-being. Her constant criticism left them feeling belittled and unheard. She had no idea how lucky she was to have such a good husband, one who tolerated her incompetence and laziness for so long. It wasn’t fair that he took on all the household responsibilities while she slacked off, enjoying her life without lifting a finger. She hated herself, realizing too late that her anger towards her husband stemmed from her own inadequacy. She had become a burden, and it was time to take responsibility for her actions. But she couldn’t seem to let go of the resentment, letting it consume her like a fire. She felt trapped in this toxic cycle, unable to break free, even though deep down she knew things weren’t entirely black-and-white."

Her friends had long given up trying to explain to her that she often predicted events that never came to pass. But this time, she felt like she had seen something real. She sat at the table, staring into the swirling patterns of the tea leaves, each one seeming to tell a story of its own. The edges curled over the rim, like the corners of memories she couldn’t quite grasp. As she read them, she began to see a picture unfolding—a life that wasn’t hers yet, but seemed so clear, so inevitable. A line formed from the center outwards, tracing paths that led her back to a place she knew well. It stopped right above where the window once hung, a small space where sunlight had filtered in, casting shadows on the walls. There, she saw him again, standing by the door he hadn’t opened in years. His eyes were fixed on something beyond the room, something that would never come to be. He didn’t look back at her; he simply stood there, lost in thought, his hand resting against the wall. And when the line reached the edge of the table, it continued, curling around the cup of tea she’d left untouched. In the moment, she understood. This was more than just a reading—it was a warning. She could almost hear the words echoing in her mind: “He’ll stop living soon.” She closed"

It was just another reminder of how far she'd fallen, a constant reminder that some things were meant to stay hidden, locked away forever. This was her reality now, a world where hope was just an illusion, and fear was the only truth she knew. Every step forward was met with two steps back, and every decision led down a path of regret.

It was a flame that burned brighter with every failure, fueling her determination to rise above the darkness.

It was almost as if she was afraid of losing him, even though they'd been through so much already. The way he looked at her with a mix of frustration and sadness made her question whether she was doing more harm than good. This job seemed to have brought out a side of her she didn't recognize, one that was more critical than caring. Was it possible that her actions were unintentionally pushing him away? She pushed those thoughts aside, telling herself she needed to focus on supporting him fully, but the doubt lingered.
