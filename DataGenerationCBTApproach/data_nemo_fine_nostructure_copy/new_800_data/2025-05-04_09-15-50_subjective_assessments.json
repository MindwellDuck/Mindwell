His breath caught as he answered, \"Hello?\" A robotic voice informed him about an urgent system outage at work, expecting him to lead the remote troubleshooting team.

What if she never actually felt anything for me? Maybe she was using me, just like everyone else has used me before. I thought we had something real, but now it feels like everything was just a lie. Maybe she got bored with me, or maybe there was someone else. I’m probably just being paranoid. Still, it hurts so bad. I feel like I’ve been punched in the gut. I don’t know why I still care about her; I shouldn’t be feeling this way. But I am. Maybe I’ll get over it eventually, but right now, it feels like my heart is breaking into pieces. The pain is overwhelming, and I just want to go back to when things were better. This isn’t fair. We talked about our future together, and now she’s just gone. I feel like I wasted time trying to convince her to stay. Maybe she didn’t really mean what she said, but I doubt it. If she did, she wouldn’t have left like that.

She had brought life into their home, filling it with color and warmth. But now, even those colors seemed dulled, as if the world was painted in shades of gray instead of vibrant hues. Her absence left a void that no amount of time could fill. She had been more than just an artist; she was the heart of our family. I remember the way she would encourage me to try new things, to push past my fears. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and I loved watching her work. We'd spend hours together, experimenting with different techniques, sharing ideas, and laughing. She was the spark that ignited my creativity, and when we worked together, I felt like I could conquer anything. Even now, when I close my eyes, I can almost hear her voice, urging me to keep going, to keep pushing forward. But deep down, I know that nothing will ever be the same again. The silence is deafening, and I'm left with only these memories, struggling to find meaning in a world that feels empty without her. I miss her so much that sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel whole again."

Maybe it was just one of those days where people were in a worse mood than usual.

She hoped that with some reflection, things would improve tomorrow."
