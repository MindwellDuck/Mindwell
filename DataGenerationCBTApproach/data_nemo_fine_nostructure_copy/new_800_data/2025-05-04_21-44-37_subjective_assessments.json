Every time she thinks about smiling, she imagines how he would react if he saw her—how his eyes might light up, how he'd try to make her laugh again. It’s as if she’s trying to bring back memories by forcing herself to look happy, but it just makes her miss him more. He must be looking down on her right now, wondering why she doesn’t seem to have moved on. If only he were here, I’d be smiling, laughing, living my best life, because what else could I possibly want? Everything I need is him, and without him, nothing matters anymore. Maybe someday, somehow, he'll come back, and then everything will fall into place. Until then, I’m stuck in this endless loop of sadness and longing, and I just wish he was here to tell me it’ll all be okay."

It's like she thinks that just because someone else doesn't want to show their stuff, they're somehow better than everyone else. But let's be real, most artists are jealous. They can't handle seeing someone else succeed where they've failed. It's obvious she got this from some bitter rival. I wouldn't trust anything she creates after hearing something like this. She's probably just mad because people don't appreciate her art as much as she does. And honestly, if she was good, would she need to hide it? Her whole career has been one big disappointment. Look how many other successful artists have had their work praised by critics and collectors alike. Meanwhile, she's stuck with these mediocre pieces no one wants. If she really cared about art, she'd stop hiding it from the world. The fact that she's doing so suggests she knows it's crap. This whole thing feels like a publicity stunt to get attention. But what's more likely? That she's actually talented and people are just too smart to see it, or that she's just another pretender trying to make herself look better than everyone else? Either way, I'm not buying it. The man behind that paper is probably some disgruntled former student or a rival artist looking to bring her down.

After all, you were always the one who spent money on pointless things like video games and video streaming services. It was ridiculous, if you ask me. You might want to think about why she left you instead of getting angry over something as trivial as a letter. Are you really upset because she didn’t get to see your new gaming chair or your latest PS5 game? I’m sure she wouldn’t have cared either way. You’re probably just jealous of everyone who found someone they loved and stayed together while you’re stuck alone. Maybe you should focus on what you could’ve done differently instead of dwelling on the past. Instead of being mad about a letter, try thinking about how you can make the most out of your life now. Have you considered therapy? Sometimes people need help coping with their emotions after a breakup. If you find yourself constantly feeling bitter or resentful, maybe there’s more going on than you realize. But let’s be honest, your situation isn’t unique. There are plenty of other men who feel the same way when they receive letters from their former partners. It’s nothing special or unexpected. Just be glad you’re alive and keep moving forward"

It seemed like every time we hung out, things got worse. Maybe I'm just bad luck? Or maybe there's something wrong with me? I couldn't help but wonder if I was too much to handle. Was I pushing him away with my constant need for attention? Had I become too clingy? The questions swirled in my head, making it hard to focus. I felt like an outsider looking in, unsure how to navigate these complex emotions. I kept thinking about all the times we'd spent together, laughing, sharing stories, and now those moments seemed distant, tainted by the pain of rejection.

No, they probably didn’t. They likely saw him as just another old guy struggling to keep up with the fast pace of modern media. Maybe they thought he was too close-minded, too set in his ways. Maybe they didn’t care. Maybe they had moved on to someone new, someone younger, someone more relevant. But I knew better. I knew he was still the best journalist this city had ever seen. I knew my stories were worth reading, even if no one seemed to understand that yet. Yet, here I was, stuck in a room full of silence, while the world outside kept spinning.
