Her husband had been fixing their old car that morning, and the sudden silence of his tools echoed in her mind as she rushed to the room. The patient's heart rate was plummeting, and she couldn't find the emergency call button. Panic surged within her like a tidal wave, threatening to drown out her years of training. Her breath hitched, her vision tunneling as she fumbled for the crash cart behind her.",

It wasn't just the beeping; I felt his life slipping away with each passing second. My hands moved mechanically, grabbing whatever I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. I've seen this happen too many times now - I'm starting to think it never really goes away. Every time someone’s heart stops beating, I feel like I’m watching them fade into nothingness. I can’t shake the image of him lying there, his chest still, his face pale, and his eyes closed forever. I keep thinking about how many times I’ve been called to rooms where patients were already gone, and how I always seem to arrive late. What if today was one of those days? Maybe I should have stayed home and let another nurse deal with it. I don’t want to lose anyone else, especially not after what happened last week - maybe they’re trying to tell me something by making me stay late again. I wish I could go back in time and change everything, but deep down, I know I’d probably end up causing more harm than good. I can’t help but wonder if I’m just meant to watch people die instead of save them. Every time I see someone’s heart stop, I feel like I’m losing control. I try to remind myself that I’m trained for these moments, but the fear lingers, making me question whether I’m truly cut"

It makes no sense to feel anything else. I’m either completely envious or I have nothing to be jealous about. If it’s the latter, then why does my heart ache? Maybe I’m just pathetic for wanting something I don’t deserve. She has everything; I have nothing. Why would anyone want what she has? This is ridiculous. I need to stop thinking like this. But how can I when every time I see her happy posts, I feel like I’m drowning in my own misery? Maybe I’m just weak and can’t handle the truth – I’m not good enough. This jealousy is eating away at me, making me question everything. What if I’m just too stupid to realize I should be grateful for what I have? No, that wouldn’t explain the pain I feel when I look at her life. There are only two truths here: I hate her because I wish I was her, or I’m a failure and there’s nothing wrong with me. Which is it? If I admit to being jealous, I’ll never live down the shame. But if I tell myself I have nothing to be jealous about, am I just fooling myself? How can I reconcile these conflicting feelings? Am I just too insecure to accept reality? Or am I trying to convince myself that I have nothing to"

He mentioned his friends who had settled down early, married, and started families, while she remained single, working full-time.

I bet she thinks we're all just jealous of their perfect life now. It's interesting how some people change so quickly. Maybe he really did learn from his mistakes? That would explain why he's been trying so hard to fit back in. He must have realized what was important after getting back together with her. I imagine he's grateful for that second chance - everyone deserves one right? Maybe she feels like an outsider here, looking at them laugh together. Sometimes you see things that make you wish you could go back and fix it. If only there were more people like us, then maybe this wouldn't happen again. But deep down, I think she knows she can't undo it. What I'm curious about is whether she's okay with seeing him like this. # No output will be generated below this line.
