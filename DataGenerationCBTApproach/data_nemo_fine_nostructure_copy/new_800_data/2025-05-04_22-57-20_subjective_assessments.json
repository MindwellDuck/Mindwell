She reads the guest list, noticing that the man who stole her story—and subsequently, her promotion—decades ago is also invited. Her grip tightens around the paper as she feels a familiar, bitter taste of spite rising in her throat.",

And with my past being so closely tied to him, I'm sure they're just trying to make me feel included. It doesn't matter if we haven't spoken since then; it's clear he wants me there. This is definitely going to be awkward but necessary. Maybe this will even give me a chance to finally tell him how much his actions affected my life back then. I wonder what kind of recognition he'll receive, and whether it'll be enough to make up for what happened. I bet he won't even mention the incident at the party. After all, he must have forgotten about it by now. This must be a good opportunity for me to confront him once and for all. I can already see the look of guilt on his face when I remind him of our past. Who knows? Maybe he'll even apologize. If I act fast enough, I might even get the last word. I need to make sure to say something clever, maybe something like, \"Well, I guess you could say your career was really taking off right around the time I was struggling.\" Or perhaps, \"It's great to see you here today; I hope your retirement isn't too quiet.\" Now that I've thought about it more, I think I should probably RSVP sooner rather than later.

He always looked at me in such a kind way when we'd chat about gardening, but I never thought much of it until now. I hope she doesn't mind coming back here, I could use some company myself. # The Distortion This response reflects Mind Reading by suggesting that the speaker knows exactly what the old man is thinking—his loneliness—and that these thoughts are likely to persist. It implies that the speaker can read the old man’s emotions and thoughts based solely on the situation, rather than considering other possible interpretations. This assumption reveals the speaker’s tendency to jump to conclusions about others’ mental states without concrete evidence. By doing so, the speaker projects their own feelings onto the old man, demonstrating how easily this type of distorted thinking can occur. # Output Only: ## The Old Man's Reaction * \"I'm just happy to help her. She's always been a pleasure to work with.\" * *She's the one who asked for my assistance.* ## The Speaker's Reflection The poor guy is going to be so lonely now; I wonder if he’ll ever find someone like her again.

This is ridiculous; she's just not listening to us. **Note**: Please provide an example response that reflects the cognitive distortion (\"Blaming\") without directly mentioning it. Also, please make sure the person seems aware of their behavior but still holds onto this distorted thinking pattern. --- # Example Response: \"I'm shocked by how poorly organized this meeting has been. It's unacceptable that they could let the time slip away like this. They're not taking anything seriously except their own interests. I feel frustrated because it seems like nobody is taking our concerns seriously.\" --- # Feedback and Explanation: This response reflects the 'blaming' cognitive distortion because it directs attention to the principal's actions rather than focusing on personal feelings. Instead of acknowledging frustration, it shifts the focus to the organization and perception of others' priorities. Although it appears that the individual recognizes their emotions, the tone implies a sense of entitlement and disappointment, which is characteristic of the 'blaming' distortion. By placing blame on external factors (the principal's lack of organization) rather than internal feelings (frustration), the statement demonstrates this cognitive bias. In reality, the person could have expressed their dissatisfaction through more constructive language, such as \"I'm disappointed by how the meeting ran out of time,\" allowing them to maintain control over their emotions and thoughts while avoiding"

Her mind wandered back to the old days, remembering happy memories with her late husband. Though her thoughts were tinged with sadness, she refused to let them consume her.
