His inbox notification chimed; another unopened email from HR, the subject line reading \"Performance Review.\" He hesitated before clicking it open, the weight of recent rejections hanging heavy on his chest—another promotion lost to a younger colleague, another dating app match who never replied after seeing his age. He braced himself as he read the first line, \"We regret to inform you...\"",

What if they didn’t take him seriously because of his age? What if he got stuck in a dead-end job forever? What if this was all just an excuse for them to let him go anyway? His hands started shaking as he scrolled through the rest of the email, each question leading to more doubts. What if there was no chance of getting promoted now? What if he had missed his window? What if he’d always been too old to make it into the top tier? Each new thought added to the chaos inside him, making it harder to breathe. He thought about how he would explain these concerns to HR, what excuses he might use to justify his inability to adapt. What if he said the wrong thing and ended up being even more of a liability? What if he came off as bitter and resentful towards his younger colleagues? As he continued reading, every sentence seemed to raise new fears. What if this performance review wasn’t just about his past mistakes but about whether he still fit into the company’s vision for the future? What if he couldn’t prove that he was worth investing in anymore? He closed the email tab, feeling overwhelmed by the endless possibilities for disaster. What if he tried to leave and no one hired anyone his age? What if he applied everywhere and kept getting rejected?"

She couldn't remember the last time she hadn't felt this way - the anxiety that gripped her like a vice, making every breath shallow and labored. Today was supposed to be just another day of retirement, but it had started off like any other since he'd gone. She reached for her phone on the bedside table, hands trembling slightly as she scrolled through old emails from her journalism days, hoping to find some solace in familiar words. But all they did was remind her of what she didn't have anymore - a purpose, a deadline, someone to share it with. The empty house seemed even quieter now, echoing with unspoken thoughts and unheard conversations. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself, but the anxiety only tightened its grip. Today felt different somehow, heavier. Like something was about to change again, and she wasn't ready for it.",

It's been three months since his passing, and while she thought she'd finally found peace, today brought back memories she wished she could forget. Her mind kept wandering to the countless articles she wrote, the stories she never got to tell. She wondered if she would ever get the chance to write them down, to leave behind a legacy that wouldn't feel like a loss. It was overwhelming, yet exhilarating—like the thrill of chasing a story she knew would lead her somewhere unexpected. As she sat at her desk, typing away, she felt a sense of purpose she hadn't experienced since before...he was here. Even though he wasn't physically present, the memories flooded her mind, each one painting vivid pictures of what could have been. She felt a surge of energy, imagining how it would be to dive into those stories once more, to relive moments captured in photographs, and to see the world through his eyes. It was as if his presence still lingered, guiding her fingers across the keyboard, pushing her to keep writing. For the first time since he left, she felt truly alive, knowing that the words she typed were no longer just a tribute to him but also a testament to the life we built together. She smiled, lost in the idea that maybe, just maybe, our love story was far from over."

People always say they're sorry when they've done something wrong. That doesn't mean anything. They never really change. You can't trust anyone completely. People are just looking out for themselves these days. No one cares about others anymore. Everyone’s in it for themselves. We shouldn't bother trying to make friends or connections. No one will ever appreciate your efforts anyway. Even if you try to be nice, people will just use you and discard you. Being alone isn't so bad after all; it makes sense that everyone ends up living by themselves eventually. Loneliness might even become the new normal. Everyone thinks they know what's best for others, but they don't. There's no way to truly understand another person. Some people act like they care, but deep down, they probably just want to hurt us. They'll keep pretending to be our friend until they get everything they want from us, then they’ll cut us off. You can't rely on anyone; you need to focus solely on yourself.

But now, those moments seemed distant, lost forever in the void left by his sudden departure. The tears that had begun to well up in her eyes only grew stronger, each drop a painful reminder that time continued to pass, leaving us further behind than ever. She thought about how hard it must’ve been for him to leave everything behind—to walk away from the life they built together, to step out into the world alone, without even a word. It wasn’t just the loss of a partner; it was the loss of a friend, someone who once shared laughter and dreams alongside her. The pain of losing him felt so raw, so real, that she could almost hear his voice, whispering words of encouragement in the dead of night, urging her to keep going, to hold on to what we had built together. As she looked at the apron, now folded neatly back onto its hook, she couldn’t help but wonder if this was all just part of some cruel joke—a cruel reminder of what she’d lost, of what she’ll always miss. It was a harsh truth she faced every morning, the same one that echoed through her mind like an endless refrain: “There"

Even when he looked at the photo on his bedside table—the one where he and his wife were laughing together—it seemed to remind him of everything he had lost. She had moved on, and he knew it was unfair to hold onto the past. Still, he couldn’t help but wonder: If only I had stayed, would our life have turned out differently? Would we still be together?
