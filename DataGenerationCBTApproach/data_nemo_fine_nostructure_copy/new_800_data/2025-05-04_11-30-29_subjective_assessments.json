He stared at his phone, willing it to ring, but it remained silent. His partner, usually home by now, had sent a curt text hours ago: \"Working late again.\" A solitary wine glass stood on the counter, half-empty, its contents no longer appealing.

There was no middle ground. If there was, then why had she chosen him over others? Why had she stayed when she could have left? It didn’t make sense. She must be trying to drive him crazy, to test if he still loved her. The thought was unbearable, so he decided to act. He began packing his bags, preparing to leave, even though he knew she wouldn’t notice until morning. The wine glass seemed insignificant, a tiny drop compared to the ocean of pain that was his heart. Yet, it represented everything that was broken between them – the memories they’d made, the laughter they’d shared, the promises they’d made. Everything. And yet, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was losing her forever, that the last time she'd spoken to him, she'd been tired, distracted, not really listening. Maybe this wasn't about love; maybe it was about control. Or was it? He wondered if he was doing all this because he wanted her back, or simply because he hated the idea of being alone. The question hung in the air, a constant reminder that every choice came down to black and white: either they were together, or they weren’t. There was no gray, no middle path.
