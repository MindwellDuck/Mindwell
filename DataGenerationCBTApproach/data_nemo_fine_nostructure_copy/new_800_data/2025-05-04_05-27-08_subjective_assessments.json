As she approached the pass, she overheard one of her sous-chefs, a young man she'd recently hired, laughing loudly about his plans for the evening. \"Emma's coming over tonight,\" he said, grinning at their newest line cook, who blushed and looked away.

Why is this bothering me so much? Emma's just another customer, after all. But there's something about her... maybe it's the way she smiles when she tastes our dishes or the way her eyes light up when she sees us preparing new recipes. Whatever it is, I shouldn't let it affect my work. This isn't about me and Emma, anyway. It's just about how I feel right now, and that feeling has nothing to do with anything except the fact that I'm still single and probably will stay that way forever. I don't need some other woman stealing my attention. Besides, I've been working hard lately, and I shouldn't let someone else's opinion make me feel like I'm falling behind. What would happen if I did hire her? Would she even want to work here? Maybe she likes being around me, but that's ridiculous. I wouldn't know anything about that since she hasn't actually met me yet. And even if she did, why would she care? We're coworkers, not friends. Letting these thoughts distract me won't help anyone. I'll just keep focusing on my work, ignore everything else, and hope this passes soon. That's all there is to it."
