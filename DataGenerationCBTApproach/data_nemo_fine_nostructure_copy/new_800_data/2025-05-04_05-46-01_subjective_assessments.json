Every time he thought things were going smoothly, something would come along and turn everything upside down. It didn't matter how hard he tried to control things; they always seemed to spiral out of control, leaving him with nothing but a mess to clean up. His mind kept replaying all the times when his plans had fallen apart, each failure fueling his growing paranoia. What if something else went wrong next? What if he wasn't prepared? The fear of being blindsided by yet another unexpected twist made his anxiety spike, making him wonder if he'd ever truly be able to catch up."

And now I have to waste even more time dealing with this nonsense. Ugh, why does it always happen to me? I'm sick of all these pointless calls. Every time I get stuck with one of these, I feel like throwing up. My stomach is churning again. Why does this keep happening? If they really needed help, they would've called an ambulance instead of 911. They're not doing anything except making things worse. I swear, every time something happens like this, I end up getting pulled back into it, and it's always because of other people. I hate how everything revolves around them and their problems. I don't want to be here, but I know I have to stay. But honestly, I wish someone else was here to handle this shit. Everyone around me seems so calm, while I'm on edge, waiting for the next problem to come along. How can they sit here, sipping coffee, when I'm struggling to cope with all these useless emergencies? It's frustrating and stressful, and I just want it to stop. This isn't fair. I'm exhausted, and yet, I still have to deal with all"
