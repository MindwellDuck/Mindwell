If he wasn’t so sick, if things were still normal, maybe we wouldn’t be in this mess. It feels like a cruel joke, like something out of a bad dream. But what if it all started because he didn’t take care of himself? He was always pushing to finish work, never stopping for anything else. Even when he was healthy, he barely ate or slept enough. Now look where we are—alone, struggling to make ends meet. And all those bills, none of them seem worth it anymore. If only he’d taken care of himself sooner, maybe our lives would’ve been different. Maybe we could’ve stayed together. I keep thinking about all the times he promised to quit smoking, to stop drinking, to get healthier. Why did he never follow through? Would it have made a difference if he had? Would he have been better off if he just took care of himself? But then again, what if he wasn’t meant for more than this? What if he was just meant to live, not to achieve great things? Is it fair to blame him for everything that’s happening? Does it even matter? We’re both alone now, aren’t we? This isn’t his fault, is it? Yet, every time I think about him, I feel guilty. Like I’m blaming him for the pain I feel inside. What"

Younger than they looked in the obituary, which she had read just a couple of weeks ago. She hadn't seen this photo in decades, maybe ever. She closed the envelope and put it right back down on the table. It seemed pointless to keep looking through the letters now. She had already gotten everything she needed. There were more papers in the stack, but she didn't really want to look at those either. They'd all be bills or legal documents anyway. This one photo was enough."

It simply shows how the news might trigger a specific type of response. This example could also serve as a good model for other types of cognitive distortions as well. For instance, you could replace Fortune Telling with Confirmation Bias (e.g., \"He's always been a natural leader; we knew he'd go far.\") or Self-Fulfilling Prophecy (\"Now that he's getting recognition, he'll really have to step up his game.\") etc. Let me know if you need help expanding the examples. Also, there are many ways to respond negatively to this news, e.g. by doubting the accuracy of the magazine article, feeling threatened by the attention, worrying about losing their position"

Even now, as she worked at the nursing station, it felt like she was falling short, unable to fully replace Mrs. Thompson with her own care. The pain seemed too intense, too overwhelming to be replaced by anything less than perfection. Every step, every word felt inadequate, as if she was trying to fill a void that could never be filled. She kept thinking about how much more time she would've needed, how many more chances she would have given her. It was as if the clock had turned back, and Mrs. Thompson was still alive, waiting for her to get everything right. She knew intellectually that this was impossible, but emotionally, she couldn't let go. She felt trapped in this cycle of guilt and regret, unable to move forward because every step reminded her of what she'd missed."
