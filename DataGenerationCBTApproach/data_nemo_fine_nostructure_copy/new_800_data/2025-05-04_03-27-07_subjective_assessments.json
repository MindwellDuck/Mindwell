It's not worth getting worked up over. I can handle it. I have to handle it. I'm not going to let this mess up my life. Not when everything else is falling into place. I'm on track. I'm close.

He tied his apron, as he had done every day for decades, but today it felt heavy on his shoulders. The once familiar scent of herbs and spices now seemed dull, like they too were forgotten. He walked to the phone, its receiver still off the hook from last night's call. No messages blinking. He rubbed his temple, feeling a familiar pang of neglect he'd grown accustomed to. Today was supposed to be their anniversary, but the calendar hung blank, untouched by her handwriting.

Maybe he shouldn't have tried to fix the oven again. Maybe he should have bought a new one when they first moved into the house. Maybe if he'd been more careful, things wouldn't have fallen apart so quickly. He wondered how many other mistakes he'd made over the years, ones that could've been prevented if only he'd listened more carefully or remembered everything she'd said about how much she hated cleaning up after him. He wiped away the tears as he put the chicken in the oven, hoping she wouldn't notice them later."

Every glance made him feel more isolated, as if they were trying to read his mind—what was going on inside this broken man? He could almost hear them whispering, their words echoing in his head: \"What's wrong with you?\" The air was thick with judgment, making him wonder if anyone would even notice if he just disappeared into thin air. The world outside seemed brighter than ever, but for him, every moment felt like a cruel joke, a reminder that he was still stuck in his own private hell. And yet, amidst all this pain, there was one thing that kept him going—a small, simple gesture that brought back memories of happier times. She used to smile when she saw him holding a bouquet of flowers. Maybe that was the key to unlocking his heart again. But what if she never wanted to see him like this? What if she thought he was a burden, someone who held her back from moving on? The thought sent a chill down his spine, and suddenly, everything felt like it was falling apart. This wasn't just about finding a way out; it was about facing the truth: some wounds might never heal, no matter how hard he tried."
