This isn't unusual for him; he often works late and forgets to communicate when he gets caught up in his work. If anything, I should have reminded him to check in more frequently, especially since we were both tired. The fact that he didn't bother to even leave a message or let me know what happened shows how much stress he must be under with all those art pieces needing to be delivered today. I shouldn't be angry at him; I should be understanding and supportive. After all, everyone has bad days sometimes. It's really my fault that I overreacted by calling him multiple times instead of waiting patiently for him to get back home. I need to calm down and stop being so sensitive. Maybe if I had been more considerate and less worried, things wouldn't be so tense right now. This is all just a misunderstanding, and I'll forgive him once he returns. He'll explain everything soon enough, and we can move forward together. Nothing serious ever comes from these little mix-ups between us."

The pain it stirred up felt like it had been locked away for so long, untouched by the passing years. Yet, reading those words now brought everything back to the surface, making him wonder if he’d truly left all that behind. The way she spoke of love and loss, how it seemed to capture moments he thought were forgotten, it was almost as if he was reliving memories he thought he’d moved past. She wrote about the reasons for their separation, things they’d discussed in private that no one else knew. Her words painted a picture of a relationship that once felt strong, now revealed in retrospect as something that never truly was. The part that struck him most, though, was the final sentence: “You’re better off without me.” It wasn’t just the truth of her statement that hit hard—it was the realization that this woman who once called him her husband was now nothing more than a memory. Every word seemed to echo with a depth he hadn’t realized was there, each sentence a reminder of what could have been if only things had turned out differently."

But then she thought about how stressed she was already, and how much more could be added to her plate with this divorce looming. It made sense that she couldn't fully focus right now. After all, she needed to keep pushing through her workload so she wouldn't fall behind when things calmed down again. She took another sip of her coffee, hoping that would help her get back into her task. Now that she was taking care of herself, she might be able to clear her head enough to tackle those tricky microscope samples. Her mind still wandered back to the email, but she knew she had to stay focused if she wanted to succeed in her career. She closed her laptop and headed out of the lab, looking forward to the morning light and a fresh start."

His eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness when she saw them through the cracked frame, and she worried that he might be feeling overwhelmed by the weight of family history. Perhaps he was even considering the idea of remarriage, though she knew that would be a difficult step for both him and her children. He looked almost too sad to look at anymore; maybe he needed some space or just a moment to collect himself.

The doctor's hands moved with a precision that belied his mind, which struggled to accept the reality unfolding before him.

The patient's life hung by a thread, and every second counted. In this moment, John realized that some things are better left unsaid. Instead of focusing on the supposed outcome, he pushed himself to act. The monitors fell silent as his skilled hands took over, stabilizing the patient's breathing until the paramedics arrived. It was a narrow escape, one that reminded John of the importance of trusting instincts rather than seeking reassurance from those who claim to see the future. For now, at least, there would be no need to worry about the inevitable. # Response End"
