Why does he have such beautiful hair? It makes me feel ugly. My brother looks younger than me, but he works out regularly. Maybe if I worked out more, I would look as good as him. But no matter how much exercise I do, I can never catch up to him. So why does he get all the attention from women? Why did she choose to wear those clothes? They make her look fat. If I wore those clothes, I'd look good. But she doesn't have the same body type as me, so why does she want to dress like me? Why are people always talking about themselves? When I try to share something, they interrupt me. What kind of person talks about themselves so much? Does anyone else ever feel like they can't get a word in edgewise when they try to speak? Maybe they just talk more than we do, which is normal. But what if they don't even listen to us? That wouldn't explain why everyone always interrupts me, though."

After all, I'm the one who brings coffee to the precinct every morning, isn't that right? If anyone can tell what's happening, it's me, and if they're trying to contact me, it means they want my help. This is why he keeps calling, so we can solve whatever case together, just like we did that one time. He's probably looking for clues, too, to piece together what happened next to our favorite spot by the river. I bet he remembers how I pointed out the hidden waterfall that day and how we shared those moments. He'll be there soon, waiting for me at the corner, his eyes scanning the crowd for me. That's why he's calling now, to make sure I know he's watching over me from afar."
