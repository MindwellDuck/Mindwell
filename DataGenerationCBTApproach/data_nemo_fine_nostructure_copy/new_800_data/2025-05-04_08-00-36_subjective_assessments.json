He'd sit alone in the dimly lit kitchen, her favorite chair empty across from him. The loneliness was a weight on his shoulders as he ate dinner by himself, the silence broken only by the distant hum of a streetlight flickering outside.",

It wasn't just the emptiness of the room, but everything else too—the way the clock seemed to mock him with its steady beat, the silence that felt oppressive, and even the memories that haunted him. Every day was a reminder that I'm still here, alone, while my ex lives happily with someone else. She's moved on, and I'm stuck in this rut, unable to escape. My job doesn't help either; I feel trapped, like I'm wasting my life away. It all feels pointless. And then there are the nights when the pain hits me hard, making me wonder if I'll ever find peace again."

It was like they wanted you to know – to remember. Even though she had long since closed the door on that chapter of her life, the image lingered, haunting her in subtle ways. She pushed it aside, focusing instead on more mundane tasks, hoping to distract herself from the emotional undertow. But the memory remained, refusing to be buried, like a shadow cast by something she'd rather not confront."

It was almost as if they were trying to fill the space that once belonged to someone else. The way they laughed together, holding hands, made him feel even more alone. Why did life move on so quickly? Why couldn't things have stayed like they were for just one more day? As he continued walking, he couldn't help but think about what might have been if they had chosen differently. But then, he realized how unfair it all seemed. Life doesn't always give you what you want, and sometimes it takes away everything you hold dear. Even if this young couple was happy, it didn't change the fact that he would never be with her again. All he saw was pain and loss. He knew he needed to keep moving, but every step felt heavier. At first, he tried to focus on the present moment. But his mind kept drifting back to memories of her, and those memories only led to more sorrow. He wished he could turn back time, but that was impossible. Instead, he told himself to stay strong and push forward. Yet, each passing day felt like a blow to his already fragile heart. As the days went by, he found himself becoming increasingly withdrawn. He stopped attending social events where he’d see people who reminded him of her. Even when he tried to distract himself with work, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of emptiness. His thoughts"

Disgust welled up within her as she realized he hadn't been cleaned since his passing.

The hospital has changed so much since then, new people have taken over his care. I can’t help feeling like I’m just going through the motions here. My mind keeps wandering back to when we first met, all those late-night talks about our dreams and aspirations. We were meant to be together, to build something amazing. Now he’s just a memory, a ghost haunting these halls. I wish I could turn back time, make things right between us. If only..."

Every time I see them, it makes me wonder why I'm still single. Is it because I don't know how to be happy? Or is it because they simply prefer each other over me? Their happiness seems genuine, and it makes me resentful. Why can't I find someone who loves me this much? Their relationship looks effortless, whereas mine has always felt forced. Even though we were together, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I wasn’t meant for him. When he left, I thought I'd finally found peace, but now I'm back to square one. Maybe if I spent more time with them, I could learn something about myself and figure out what went wrong. But deep down, I know it won't change anything. All I'll get is another reminder of what I lack—true love. I try to tell myself that focusing on their happiness isn't fair, but it’s hard not to feel bitter when they seem so content. Maybe I’m just jealous of their success, but it doesn’t make the pain go away. If only I could turn back time, I’d choose to be with them instead of being alone forever. I wish I could say, “Let’s start over,” but all I can do is watch from afar, wondering what I did wrong. She gazes at"

She wondered why he would spend time with someone else when he had promised to be there for her.
