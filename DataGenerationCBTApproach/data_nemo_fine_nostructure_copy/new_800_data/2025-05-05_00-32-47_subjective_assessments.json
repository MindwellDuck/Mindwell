Every time we go to the doctor, he just dismisses it like it’s nothing. Like, what if I’m not just talking about a small blemish? What if this is something serious that could change everything? And now that I look at him, he looks so happy. He’s all smiles today, chatting with the kids, laughing at their jokes. It’s like he has no idea how much pain I’m in right now. Does he think it’s easy being pregnant? Does he know how hard it is to deal with this kind of uncertainty every day? But then again, maybe he does understand. Maybe he’s just pretending not to because he thinks it would be too overwhelming. That’s probably why he doesn’t want to tell anyone else. He’s worried they might think less of us, or worse, that they’d judge us harshly. So he keeps it all inside, even though it must be eating away at him. He knows exactly what I need right now—a reassuring hug, some quiet support, but instead, he’s out here, doing his job, making sure everyone else is okay. How many times has he had to put up with someone else’s problems while keeping mine hidden? Does he ever get tired of carrying this"

She could feel her heart pounding, her breath coming faster as she read the words, \"We regret to inform you...\". Her husband, still asleep upstairs, had assured her they'd covered everything. But here it was in black and white: another burden on her shoulders, another thing he hadn't taken care of. She felt a surge of heat rise within her, her hands shaking as she clenched the letter. Without thinking, she threw it across the room, watching it flutter to the floor like a fallen bird. \"Damn you!\" she shouted, her voice echoing through the quiet house, startling even herself.",

I’m so tired of dealing with this kind of nonsense in our relationship. She has no idea what triggered these thoughts. All she knows is that she feels really upset about it, and she thinks her feelings are valid because she genuinely hates cleaning up after him. There’s nothing wrong with having high standards for her partner, especially since they live together. However, her negative emotions seem to be driving her judgment, which isn’t fair.
