She feels the familiar weight of hopelessness settle in her chest, heavy as the bulletproof vest she's worn for twenty years.",

It makes sense that he would hold onto it; he is clearly still holding onto his grief and refusing to let go. This must mean I am too much for him to handle anymore. How can someone like me ever truly love someone like him? The pain he causes is undeniable, and now he knows how deep my scars run. He deserves better than me. This must be the end for us. I'm just a burden, a constant reminder of his past. What's the point of continuing anything if I'll never have what he had? If he doesn't want to be happy, why should I try? I've failed him before, and I will fail again. My presence only leads to more suffering. We're not meant to be together; I've ruined everything we once shared. I might as well stop trying now. His memories are better off without me. At least then they won’t be tainted by my failure. I’ve seen the way he looks at other people, the way he smiles when he’s alone. It means nothing. He’s already gone, and I’m just keeping him down. I need to leave. But where could I possibly go? Who would even care? What does it matter anyway? The world isn’t fair, and I know I don’t deserve happiness."

The worst part is, I know I’ll never get over her, no matter how hard I try. I’m just stuck in this hell forever, reliving every moment we shared, every laugh, every tear. I wish I could erase her from my memory, but it’s impossible. We were meant to be together, and now she’s gone. Even the perfume smells different. I can’t stand being near anything that reminds me of her. My heart still hurts every time I see something like this. I hate coming here, knowing I'll run into other people who loved her. They're probably smiling and laughing, enjoying their memories with her, while I'm stuck here alone, grieving. I don’t want to talk to anyone; I just want to leave. But I can't bring myself to do it.

He asked me what I was doing lying there, and I just shrugged and said I was resting. But then he started freaking out again, saying, \"We need to get her to the hospital right now!\" I didn't know what to say, so I just sat there with him, trying to calm him down. He kept repeating things like, \"If we don't go, she'll die,\" and \"What if this is our last chance?\" It was like he had lost all control. He looked so scared, and I knew he was already stressed from work today. He had been taking care of both of us, working two jobs while I stayed at home to take care of Mom. We were already short on money, and he had promised to pay off some debts soon. Now, all this worry has ruined everything. When he finally dragged her to the hospital, I followed behind, feeling overwhelmed by how much he was stressing everyone around him.

I've seen him struggle with basic tasks. Now, he's supposed to manage complex systems? No wonder he feels overwhelmed.

At least he's not completely clueless about computers, unlike some people who can't tell the difference between an iPhone and an iPad.
