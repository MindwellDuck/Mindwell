I wish I could go back in time and make him stay longer, but that would mean missing out on all the memories we made when he was still with us. If only he had stayed, maybe things wouldn't feel so lonely now. But then again, if he hadn't left, would our relationship ever have reached its peak? Would we have become too comfortable, leading to an unfulfilling life together? I wonder how much happier we would've been if he'd never left. I imagine myself sitting next to him on the couch, holding his hand, and feeling grateful for every moment we shared. He might not have understood me fully, but I know he loved me deeply. Our conversations about life, death, and everything in between always felt meaningful. Maybe if he'd stayed, we would have realized too late that life is short, and we should cherish every second. Now, I'm left with only memories, wondering what could have been. If only he had stayed, we might have found more meaning in each other’s company. We could have explored new hobbies together, and who knows, maybe we would’ve discovered hidden talents. Life would have been richer, but perhaps that was always meant to be. After all, he chose to leave, leaving me alone with nothing but these thoughts. What if he’d chosen differently? Would our bond have grown stronger? Maybe"

The fluorescent lights flickered briefly before steadying, casting stark shadows on the empty aisles. He began to straighten the shelves, his gloved hands brushing against the dusty packages with a familiar rhythm. As he reached for a top shelf, his foot caught on an uneven tile. Stumbling, he grasped at the air but found only emptiness.

But there was nothing there; just a messy scattering of boxes. Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd disturbed something important, some forgotten memory or message left behind by someone who didn’t want to be seen. Maybe it was a piece of evidence he shouldn't have touched, or perhaps something more personal—a letter, a photo, or even a note with a message meant specifically for him. Whatever it was, he felt guilty for touching it, as if he’d accidentally opened a door to a part of the past he wasn’t ready to face. Now, the silence seemed oppressive, and the dim light made everything feel like it was watching him, waiting for him to make another move. He tried to convince himself that it was just a minor accident, but deep down, he knew that this time, he might have crossed a line. The thought lingered, making him wonder what else he might have missed when he stumbled backward, leaving the mysterious mess behind. He glanced around, half-expecting to find a sign or a clue, anything that would tell him what really happened. But all he saw were the same rows of shelves and the faint outlines of"

She was mocking me the entire time, pretending to be this sweet woman who cared. But deep down, she hates me. That painting proves it. Every time I look at it, I remember how much she hated me, and how much I hated myself for loving her. I wonder if she ever feels guilty for cheating on me. Does she regret what she did? Probably not. She doesn't care about hurting people anymore. She's moved on, and I'm still here, stuck in this life I don't deserve. Our marriage was a joke, and I fell for it.

I try to push these thoughts aside, but they linger, haunting me. Sometimes I wonder if she even notices anymore; maybe she's moved on. She's been doing well, hasn't mentioned anything negative about work or life outside the clinic. I've tried to talk about other things, but she doesn't seem interested. Maybe she's just tired too. Still, I feel like I'm failing her again, even if I know I'm being unfair. I keep thinking about what could have been different, but it feels pointless.
