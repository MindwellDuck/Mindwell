The photo, once a symbol of happiness, now feels like a weight, holding her back from completing the recipe. It's been years since he passed, but the pain still lingers, making it hard to move forward. # Example Response The response reflects the mind-reading distortion through the use of phrases such as \"she can't bring herself to continue,\" which implies that her emotions are somehow controlling her actions, rather than acknowledging the emotional complexity involved. This subtle framing suggests that her feelings are driving her behavior, even though she might not fully understand why she's resisting cooking. By using this language, we're encouraging the reader to assume that her emotions directly dictate her decisions, without considering other possible explanations. This type of phrasing can lead readers to misinterpret her actions as being driven solely by her emotions, when in reality, there may be more nuanced factors at play."
