This isn't the first time I've seen them out here; I'm starting to think they don't have any respect for others at all. And what really gets under my skin is that I know there are kids who would love to play with toys like that, but they can't afford it. So, when I see someone wasting something valuable like a stethoscope, it feels like they're disrespecting all those other kids who deserve better. That kid might not realize how much it means to others until it's too late."

That letter he left behind was a final blow, proof that she's moved on. There's nothing more to say. I wouldn't blame him if he threw away the whole project.

She probably has a great time talking about our relationship with someone who doesn't care how much effort I put into making things work. This whole situation is really embarrassing and stressful.

After all, someone needs to communicate these updates to the team. He heads straight to the conference room, where the CEO is waiting for him. She greets him warmly, but her expression quickly turns serious. \"We're facing financial challenges,\" she says, her voice firm but laced with concern. \"Some teams might have to reduce staff.\" The mention sends a chill down his spine. He tries to reassure her, pointing out the potential benefits of restructuring. But the more he talks, the more anxious he becomes. This is why I'm here, he thinks.

Instead, she slammed the door harder than necessary as she went to get some much-needed coffee, feeling like she was at her breaking point. That’s when she realized that maybe it was time to consider moving out altogether. But then again, what would be the point of leaving if they were going to keep doing things exactly the same way? Wasn’t it all just one big mess waiting to happen? She thought back to all the times she’d been patient, trying to give him space or even letting him sleep through our alarm, hoping he wouldn’t oversleep and miss work. But did he ever care? No. Now, every morning felt like a chore, like being awake was somehow more painful than sleeping. It seemed like he was always the first to wake up, ready to go while she struggled to open her eyes after hitting the snooze button repeatedly. Why did he have to be so selfish?
