I told him it would be fine to fix the computer myself, but no way could he have been so incompetent as to forget how to use the software. It’s just another example of how much more capable I am than he’ll ever be. He’s too dumb for me to waste my time explaining things to him. I can’t believe we’re even still together after all these years. I thought I’d finally found someone who understood me, but now I realize I’m stuck with this idiot forever. If I were smart enough to get out of this marriage, I wouldn’t have ended up here. Why did I settle for such a loser? The worst part is that he genuinely believes what he said, and I feel like I’ve wasted 10 years of my life on him. Every little mistake of his makes me want to kill myself. This isn’t the first time he’s messed something up, and I know there will be many more times when I regret marrying him. I guess I’m just lucky he doesn’t hate me yet."

His breath hitched, sadness welling up like a storm surge. He traced it gently, the soft pink stain now faded to almost nothing, just like their memories seemed to be doing.",

Like every other day, he wondered if there was more to life than this constant struggle. Maybe he was meant for bigger things—something that didn't involve endless hours in front of a canvas. But what else could he possibly be good at? Painting seemed like the only thing that came naturally to him, and yet, even that felt forced now. The way his mind wandered back to the same questions, the emptiness that lingered after each session—it all felt so pointless. He couldn't help but feel like he was just going through the motions, pretending to be someone he wasn't. Every time he thought about quitting, he told himself he needed to see it through, but deep down, the desire to walk away grew stronger with each passing day. As he sat there, lost in his thoughts, the phone on the coffee table seemed to mock him, its presence a reminder that even in isolation, he couldn’t escape the weight of reality. It was as if he was trapped in a never-ending cycle, one that might finally break when he realized he couldn’t keep going alone. The pain of loneliness cut through him like a knife, leaving scars that would take years to heal."

He left for work hours ago, leaving me with nothing but stale coffee and a sense of frustration that I'll never get used to. My job is demanding, and I need something to look forward to when I come home. But instead, I get to deal with this constant disappointment every day.
