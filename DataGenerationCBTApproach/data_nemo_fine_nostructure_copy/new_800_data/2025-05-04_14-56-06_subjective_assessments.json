I see myself in the way the sunlight falls on her face, and I imagine her smiling at me. She was always so beautiful, and she still is. My heart aches because I feel like I'm missing something important, but I don't know what. If only I could turn back time, maybe everything would’ve been different. But it’s too late now.

Every time they met before, there were always these strong emotions—resentment, jealousy, even bitterness—but this time, it wasn't just those feelings; he genuinely felt like he wanted to lash out. As he stood there, assessing her condition, every glance made him feel like he was being judged. She seemed so calm, yet he couldn't shake off the feeling that she was waiting for him to say something, to react in some way. His mind started racing, imagining scenarios where she might try to provoke him, where she'd somehow turn the tables on him by making him look bad. He felt like he was walking a thin line between professionalism and letting his true self show, which would only lead to trouble. Every step closer to her bed felt like I'm putting my foot down on her throat, and I could swear she looked up at me with a mix of shock and disappointment. But then again, maybe he was overreacting.

She said she needed space after our divorce, but I wonder if she meant something more by that. Does she ever think about us anymore? Does she miss me? I try not to imagine what she’s doing right now.

In this case, it was the discovery of the empty chair and the realization that someone else might be occupying it. ## Step 2: Understand the Cognition Distortion Recognize that the person who wrote this response is exhibiting a common cognitive distortion called \"Personalization.\" This distortion occurs when one assumes that events are specifically directed towards them personally, rather than recognizing alternative explanations that could apply more broadly. ## Step 3: Analyze the Language Used Analyze how the writer uses language to express themselves. They use phrases such as “the house felt quieter than usual,” “even the walls were holding their breath in anticipation of her reaction,” and “leaving her feeling hollow and alone.” These descriptions suggest that the writer believes the situation is uniquely affecting them, rather than seeing it as a possible interpretation of many people’s reactions. ## Step 4: Consider Alternative Perspectives Consider whether there are other interpretations that could explain why someone might behave differently. For instance, perhaps the person left the chair because they were tired and wanted"

Instead, he leaned against the wall, his presence seeming to suffocate her. The air grew thick with tension, making every heartbeat feel like an eternity. He began to whisper, his words barely audible over the hum of the garage's machinery.
