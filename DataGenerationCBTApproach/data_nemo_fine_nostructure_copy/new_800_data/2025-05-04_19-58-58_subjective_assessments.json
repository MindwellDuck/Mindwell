His heart quickened as he checked his phone; no messages since last night's \"Goodnight.\" He rushed downstairs, finding their cat's food bowl full, but the coffee maker untouched - a daily ritual she never missed. Panic rising, he dialed her number, relief flooding in at the sound of her voice. \"I'm fine,\" she said, \"Just overslept at my sister's after we talked late into the night.\" He hung up, hands shaking, anxiety morphing into irritation at his overreaction.",

If only I could calm down sometimes, everything would be okay. This is all my fault anyway. I'm always making a big deal about nothing. I guess I’m just too sensitive. But it’s hard when you have such bad experiences in your past. You can’t help how you are. I wish he didn’t react so strongly, but what does he expect? We all do that when we’re worried. I just need to relax and stop worrying about everything. If only I could control my emotions better, none of these problems would exist. I feel like I always get blamed for everything. My husband is always so quick to assume the worst, and then he gets angry with me for even having those thoughts. He doesn’t understand how much stress being married to someone like him puts on me. Now he thinks I’m being paranoid again. Why can’t he see that this isn’t anything serious? I just want some peace and quiet around here. All this drama is exhausting. I try to stay calm and tell myself it’ll pass, but he always makes me feel so guilty. I hate feeling like this. I wish I could"

The once vibrant red tomatoes now wilted in her hands, their lifelessness mirroring her own weariness. She looked up at the framed photo of them together, laughing at some forgotten joke, and felt a familiar ache. His seat at the table remained empty, untouched since the doctor's somber words had filled their home with an oppressive silence. Today was to be his favorite dish; she had hoped cooking it might bring him back in some way. But as the rain continued its steady drumming, she realized that this kitchen, once filled with his warmth and laughter, now felt only empty and cold. She took a deep breath, her reflection in the spoon's shiny surface revealing eyes glistening with unshed tears, before turning back to her simmering pot of memories.",

He deserved better than to come home to this house, which now seemed so much emptier than when they were together. It wasn’t fair to try to lift herself up when he could barely take care of himself right now. Her mind kept drifting back to how hard it would be for him to start eating again, especially considering all he’d lost during treatment. This was just another reminder that things weren’t going to get easier anytime soon. She couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the weight of it all, wondering if she was doing more harm than good by trying to keep things moving here. Every little thing felt like too much right now."

She hangs it by the door, a silent sentinel guarding her off-hours. The clock ticks loudly in the empty space, each second stretching into minutes as she waits for something, anything, to fill the void left by another day's end. A photo on the mantel catches her eye - a group of officers, smiling, carefree. She remembers that day, the laughter, the sense of belonging. Now, it feels like a distant memory. As she sits alone in the half-light, the weight of her solitude presses down on her chest, each breath a struggle against the melancholy that has become her constant companion.",

Would she still be alone, or was it because of the uniform, the expectations, the silence? Maybe she'd find happiness somewhere else, but then again, maybe she'd lose herself completely, disappearing into the crowd, leaving behind the memories and the sense of purpose. It's hard to imagine a life where she wasn't an officer, but at the same time, she can't shake the feeling that she's just going through the motions, waiting for someone else to take over. What if she stayed with the police force? Would she find comfort in the routine, or would she drown in it? Or perhaps, she'd finally learn how to let go, but then who would she be? She looks around her room, at the photos that hold onto moments of joy now tainted by the loneliness. There's the picture from her first day, full of hope and laughter, and there are others from family gatherings, friends, even a few from before she joined the force. They remind her of a life she once knew, one filled with love and warmth, but now they serve as painful reminders of all she's lost. If she could turn back time, would she choose that life, or would she have ended up here, alone, forever? She thinks about the officers she used to work with, how close they were, how they'd share stories, jokes, and tears together."

Every minute felt like an eternity, each tick of the clock echoing louder than the previous. The hospital seemed to fade away, replaced by visions of worst-case scenarios—trauma, death, accidents. Each beep became a countdown, a reminder that time was running out. She felt trapped, unable to escape the prison of fear that gripped her. The world outside melted away, leaving only the haunting echoes of those beeps. She was convinced this was personal, a deliberate attempt to scare her into action. The more time passed, the more she felt isolated, alone in her fear. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the steady pulse of her own heartbeat. Her breaths grew shallow, and her thoughts raced faster, fueled by the uncertainty hanging in the air. Every moment felt like a test, every tick of the clock a reminder that time was slipping away. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was at the center of everything, that this was all about her. The isolation was crushing, making her feel like she was drowning in her own paranoia. Her mind was a whirlwind of possibilities, each one leading her further down the rabbit hole of fear. The only sound was"

The fact that she wasn't familiar with the look or smell of the jacket made her think it must have been him who wore it, and then she realized she must be mistaken because he wouldn't wear a lab coat to hang up on their bed. It seemed so strange to her that he would even put it there; surely someone else could have left it there by mistake, which led her to wonder if he had actually gone somewhere else, like visiting his family over the weekend.
