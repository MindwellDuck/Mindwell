His attention seemed to be focused on another work, yet he lingered by mine for an extended period.

Seeing how he interacted with other artworks made me realize that I needed to step up my game. My mind kept replaying his visit, wondering if I could've done something differently to impress him."

His gaze fell upon an old photograph tucked into the corner of the mirror: him and his late wife, laughing together at some long-forgotten joke.

It was as if he had been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders since his wife's passing, her memory etched in every crease and curve of his face like a bittersweet reminder of what he'd lost. The look in his eyes spoke volumes - a mix of sadness and longing, a deep-seated yearning for something he could never have again. Even now, after all this time, he still wore her smile like a badge of honor, a constant reminder of the love they shared and the life they built together. Yet, there was also a hint of desperation in those eyes, a sense of frustration and hopelessness that seemed to cling to him like a shadow. It was as if he felt trapped by his grief, unable to escape its grasp even when surrounded by the beauty of art. In many ways, his work became a form of therapy, a way to channel the pain into something meaningful, but perhaps it was also a cruel irony - the more he painted, the more he felt lost, the emptier his canvases. Still, he persisted, driven by both the need to heal and the fear that if he stopped creating, he might lose himself forever. Whether his brushes danced across the canvas in joy or faltered in despair, one thing remained certain - his heart was heavy with sorrow, weighed down by memories of a life once full of laughter and"

It’s hard to see how anyone could appreciate my art when they’re so far away. I just want someone to talk to, but it feels impossible now. The brush strokes are getting slower; I’m trying to hide my tears from falling onto the canvas. It’s pointless anyway—no one will ever care about this painting, or me for that matter. The emptiness of the apartment is suffocating me. There’s nothing to look forward to except another day alone, waiting for something that might never come. I feel trapped, and the only escape seems to be escaping into my art. But even that doesn’t give me the comfort I need. This is all just a facade, a desperate attempt to distract myself from the crushing reality that I’m truly alone. And yet, I continue to create, hoping someday someone will see the beauty in what I do. But deep down, I know it’s all just a lie. No one cares, and no matter how hard I try, I’ll always be just another forgotten soul lost in the world. The darkness closing in around me is starting to feel like home. I wish I could find some peace, but until then, I’m stuck in this endless cycle of sadness. Every moment feels like a countdown to more pain, and I can’t shake the feeling that this emptiness will consume me eventually."
