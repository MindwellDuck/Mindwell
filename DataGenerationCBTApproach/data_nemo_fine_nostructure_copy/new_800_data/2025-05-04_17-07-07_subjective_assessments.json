His phone buzzes, a message from his ex-wife: \"We need to talk about the custody arrangement this weekend.\" His heart races as he tries to focus on the code, but the words blur before him, his mind already lost in worried spirals about what she might want to change now.",

It's like they're moving on together. What if they even planned this? Maybe they've been secretly meeting for months while I was away. That would explain why she seemed so happy when we talked last time—she wasn't actually over me. She was just pretending to be. Or maybe she was planning to leave me after all. She might have moved on so quickly because she already had someone else lined up. This is exactly what I’ve always feared—the worst-case scenario. And now that I know the truth, I can’t help but feel betrayed. Why did she never tell me about these secret meetings? Did she think I wouldn’t notice? But wait, what if things aren’t as bad as I think? Maybe she’s really happy now, and we can work through our issues. But then again, what if she was just being polite? What if she doesn’t truly care anymore? My mind keeps racing with scenarios, each one more disturbing than the last. I don’t know who to believe anymore. This isn’t the first time I’ve caught her with someone else. There must be more going on behind closed doors. I’m starting to feel like I’ll never find happiness again, especially since I know she has no intention of staying married. She promised to try, but I doubt"
