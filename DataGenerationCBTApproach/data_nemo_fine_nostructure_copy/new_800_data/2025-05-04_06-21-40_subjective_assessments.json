Maybe I’m just not good enough. The questions swirled in his mind like a whirlpool, pulling him under. What if she’s lost trust in me? Or worse, what if she thinks I don’t care? Every tick of the clock seemed to echo these thoughts. What if this is all my fault? That I shouldn’t have agreed to take on another case, especially one that required such intense focus. What if I’ve messed up everything? She’d been his rock, the one person who understood him perfectly. But now, with each passing moment, his mind conjured up scenarios where she might turn away from him. What if I’m not good enough for her? What if she needs someone more reliable? His heart raced as he imagined the worst-case scenario: What if I never get a chance to apologize? What if she doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore?

They would meet at lunch, discussing research and life beyond the lab. But now, those moments were nothing more than distant memories, replaced by the bitter taste of isolation. Every day, he felt like he was watching himself from afar, powerless to change the path he’d chosen. The smile on the lead author’s face was the final blow, a reminder that she had found someone else who appreciated her work. He wondered if she ever thought about him, if she remembered the times they spent together. But she didn’t. She had moved on, and he was still stuck in this endless cycle of loneliness. It was as if every step forward meant taking two steps back. He felt trapped in a world where everyone else had found their place, while he remained on the outside looking in. He knew he was overreacting, but the pain was real. This wasn't just about feeling left out; it was about the sense of abandonment that came with it. He felt like he was losing himself, bit by bit, each passing day a harsh reminder that he might never find his place"
