It's so weird how people can think they're being so subtle when all they’re doing is pointing out that everyone’s always talking behind my back. I know I’m overreacting, but it still feels like I got called out for nothing. The worst part is that I feel like I need to prove myself to these doctors. It's not fair that they can just take pleasure in my embarrassment like this. They didn’t even try to hide it; I saw the way they looked at each other. Anyway, now I just want to leave and forget this ever happened. Why do I always get stuck with the worst patients? I swear, sometimes I wish I never became a doctor in the first place. It’s too much stress and drama, especially with colleagues who seem to enjoy rubbing it in my face. I hate how this keeps happening. It makes me wonder if I’m just meant to fail here. Maybe I should just quit now instead of trying to fix everything. This is getting ridiculous. I wish someone would give me some advice on how to deal with situations like this since I keep messing up every time. Maybe then I’d finally feel confident again. But until then, I’ll just have"

This is what happens when you're not loved. You start to lose hope. Every time I feel happy for a moment, it turns into another disappointment. It’s like my heart is constantly being crushed by the weight of unrequited love. Every interaction feels forced now, every conversation awkward. Even our dates are just a reminder of how much I'm missing out on. What if she was with someone else? Maybe they're having fun together right now while she's left here alone? It makes sense that she forgot again. Why would she make an exception just because I’m home? This isn’t the first time she’s done something like that, and I know she’ll keep ignoring me. It’s always been like this - she’s never made time for us, and I can’t blame her. Who needs someone like me anyway? I don’t deserve love, so why would she go out of her way to be nice to me?

The thought kept creeping back into her mind: What if she hadn’t walked out that day? Would she have gotten the promotion? Would she have stayed longer? It seemed impossible to imagine how things might have turned out differently, yet it haunted her nonetheless. Every time she saw the empty chair at her desk, she wondered what stories would have come from her pen, what secrets she might have uncovered, and who else might have benefited from her work. The idea of those possibilities swirled around her, making her feel both nostalgic and restless. It’s almost as if she’s left a piece of herself here, wondering about the paths not taken."

The pain of their separation lingered, and every day felt like a step backward, further from the man he used to be.
