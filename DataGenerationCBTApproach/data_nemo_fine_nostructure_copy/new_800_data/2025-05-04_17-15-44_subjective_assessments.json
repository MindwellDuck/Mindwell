Shouldn't he have something better by now? He thinks about his job and how it's just not fulfilling; maybe he should quit and look for something else? The thought is nagging, but he can't help feeling that he's fallen behind. Maybe he should be doing something with his life to prove his worth? Instead, he finds himself stuck, struggling to find motivation. It's hard not to feel like there's always one more step, one more goal, one more thing he could be doing to make himself feel more confident, more successful. He starts to think about what others might expect from him, too. His parents would probably want to see progress, some sign that he's moving forward. They'd wonder why he hasn't found a partner yet. Shouldn't he have someone special by now? But he can't shake the feeling that this is all just a cycle of disappointment. Maybe he should try harder, find ways to show them he's changing, that he's making an effort? Even so, he can't help but feel that there's always room for improvement, that every day brings a reminder of where he falls short."

The clock's hands crept towards midnight, each second stretching into eternity as she stared at the photograph still displayed on the mantelpiece.

She reached out a trembling hand to trace the outline of his smiling face, her heart aching like an open wound.

The thought of spending years alone, watching life pass her by while he moved on with his new family, made her feel hopeless.

Someone who will treat her right. And I'll be doing her a favor by being gone. I'll make sure she doesn't have to deal with him anymore. We're done. It's time to move on. To focus on myself. On finding happiness again. And maybe, one day, love again. Love that won't hurt me like it did before. I'll get over this, find peace, and heal my broken heart. I need to let go of all these feelings. This isn't healthy anymore. Time to close the chapter on us, and start anew. Time to rediscover who I am beyond this toxic relationship.
