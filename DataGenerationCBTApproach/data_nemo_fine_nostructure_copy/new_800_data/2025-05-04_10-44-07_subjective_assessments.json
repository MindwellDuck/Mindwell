He squeezes back gently, offering a reassuring smile, but inside, he feels a helplessness gnawing at him. He's seen countless patients in his sixty-nine years, yet here he is, helpless to save his own daughter from the relentless grip of cancer.",

Cancer has taken many lives; maybe this time will be different? Maybe? She looks at him pleadingly, and for a moment, he forgets about the statistics and the treatments. All he sees is his little girl, fighting against the cruel odds stacked against them. His mind filters out all else, focusing solely on her desperate need for hope."

Every moment with her now seemed precious, yet the weight of her absence crushed him. The pain was suffocating, like a physical force that couldn’t be escaped. His eyes drifted to the photograph, and for a fleeting instant, it brought back the warmth of her smile, the way sunlight danced through her hair, and the sound of her laughter echoing softly. But even that joy was tainted by the ache within him—a reminder that these things were no longer possible, that life would never be the same again."

I felt like I was drowning in comparison, but every time I tried to look away, I couldn't help but feel like I was losing. This wasn’t fair; I had worked so much harder than him. But he just kept smiling, oblivious to everything else around him. I wondered how he did it, if it even came naturally to him. Everyday, I see him here, and it makes me angry. He looks younger than he really is, and it’s not right. My mind constantly compares us, and I’m always coming up short. When I think about all the times I’ve been treated unfairly, I can’t help but wonder why no one sees this injustice. I try to ignore these thoughts, but they linger, making me feel frustrated and resentful. I wish people would understand that we're not equal in our struggles. They don't get it. We are not just coworkers; we have different lives, experiences, and challenges. I keep thinking about those moments when I felt like giving up, when I thought the world was against me. Even now, after years of struggling, I still feel like I'm being pulled down. But then there"
