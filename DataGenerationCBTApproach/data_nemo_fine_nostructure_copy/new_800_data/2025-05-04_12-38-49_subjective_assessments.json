She looked at him, his hands steady and eyes calm behind his reading glasses. A photo from their wedding lay facedown on the counter, forgotten after last night's argument. She felt a lump rise in her throat as she watched him, oblivious to the chasm that now yawned between them. The clock ticked on, each second echoing like a hammer blow against the silence.",

This is all because of the stupid alarm clock that always goes off at 3 AM. If I didn’t have this stupid habit of hitting snooze every time, I wouldn’t be in such a panic right now. It’s ridiculous how easily I can wake up at 7 AM but not at 3 AM. What kind of sick person wakes up at 3 AM? Only someone who’s already dead inside would dare start their day at that hour. I guess I’m one of them. If I could go back in time, I’d make sure to avoid getting that job at the hospital where they had to perform CPR on Mr. Thompson. Why did I ever apply there? Now I feel like I have a higher risk of dying unexpectedly than anyone else. I’ve never seen anyone else react this way to an alarm clock, but I suppose I must be cursed. It’s funny how easily I wake up at 7 AM but not at 3 AM. I must really love being dead by 3 AM. What if I actually am going to die today? Maybe I’ll find peace in death,"

I've lost count of how many times she's promised herself she'll leave, but every time she goes back into the ward, something keeps pulling her in. It's like she's trapped by her own grief, unable to let go even when it hurts her the most. She remembers the way he used to look at her, the smile that lit up his whole face whenever she was near. Now, those same eyes seem cold and distant, as if they're looking right through her. She's convinced she's seen him with someone else before, but it's impossible to know for certain. She doesn't dare hope otherwise, but deep down, she wishes more than anything that he might still feel the same way. Yet, the evidence against her is overwhelming—she's seen them together, heard whispers from coworkers about his new relationship. Still, she holds onto the faintest glimmer of hope, refusing to accept reality until it becomes unbearable. --- #Example Response End# #Example Response End# ##Example Response End## #Example Response End# #Example Response End# #Example Response"
