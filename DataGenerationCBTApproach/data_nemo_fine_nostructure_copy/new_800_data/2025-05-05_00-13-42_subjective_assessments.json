The air thickens, heavy with an aura of impending doom, signaling the arrival of something dark and foreboding. This person exudes an unmistakable scent – one that speaks volumes about the state of their being. It's a smell that cannot be ignored; it's a harbinger of things to come, a warning sign that all is not well within them. Their approach is hasty, almost frenzied, as if driven by some unseen force that propels them forward with reckless abandon. It's clear that they are on a collision course with disaster, one that will leave no stone unturned in its path. The very atmosphere around us begins to shift, taking on a darker hue, as if the shadows themselves are drawn to this figure like moths to flame. Every step they take seems to signal a further descent into the depths of despair, each movement a countdown to the inevitable. In this moment, I am reminded of the ancient proverb: \"A storm is brewing, and those who wait too long will be caught in its fury.\" This student is a harbinger of that fury, and I fear for all that lies ahead."

This is insane—my heart must be racing like crazy, I can feel it pounding in my chest, and yet it doesn't seem to be affecting me at all. I'm pretty sure I'm dying of embarrassment, but I don't feel anything at all, except for this awful, crushing pressure in my chest that feels more like anxiety than actual physical pain. The interview ended abruptly, and now I'm probably going to have to face the consequences of my own ineptitude for the rest of my life. This is absolutely terrible; I'll never be able to show my face in public again. I feel like such an idiot. And, to make matters worse, I've got no idea how to turn off the stupid mic. I'm going to die. I'm not sure what's happening to me, but I hope someone finds this before I disappear forever."

It was almost as if she saw two different people staring back at her—a reflection of herself and another, more somber version of reality. As she looked around, she couldn't help but feel like she was being compared to him, that her life had been measured against his tragic fate. Every glance from her colleagues seemed to convey a silent judgment, as if they were weighing her worth based on the circumstances surrounding John's death. She wondered if she would be seen as stronger because she hadn't met such a brutal end, or perhaps weaker for surviving when others didn't. The thought sent a chill through her, leaving her feeling isolated and vulnerable. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was being unfairly judged, that everyone saw her as less deserving of sympathy simply because she lived while John had lost his life in a horrific manner. The sense of disconnection grew, making it difficult for her to process her emotions. It was as if she was standing outside herself, watching someone else struggle to find meaning in her life. She felt trapped between the desire to hold onto hope and the crushing weight of reality, unsure which path to"

She scanned the kitchen, searching for clues, but every surface seemed untouched—except for the dirty dishes piled high. Her mind churned with questions, each one more painful than the last. How could he do this? Didn't he care enough to leave something for her? Her eyes wandered to the TV, where his phone must have fallen during his gaming session. The screen flickered with an unfamiliar app, its name unknown to her. A pang of sadness hit hard, followed by anger. He'd been so distant lately, always preferring his games over our conversations. She couldn't help but wonder if he was spending time with someone else. The thought cut deep, like a knife through her heart. Why did he keep pushing me away? Hadn't I shown enough patience? Did he think me weak for caring? As she stood there, trapped between emotions, she realized that maybe she wasn't meant to stay here. Maybe she shouldn't waste her energy trying to hold on when everything around her seemed to be falling apart. The pain and frustration swirled together, making her question whether she had what it took to keep going. Perhaps she didn't deserve better,"

She nodded curtly, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “Yes, I am. Some things never change, do they?” He couldn’t help but feel taken aback by her outburst. He knew there was more to her story than what she’d shared during their previous meetings, but he wasn’t about to push the issue further. Instead, he tried to steer the conversation towards a more pleasant topic. “So, how have you been? Any new developments in your life?” he asked, attempting to lighten the mood. Her expression didn’t waver, and she seemed to shrink into herself as she replied, “Nothing. Just the usual.” Her tone suggested that she meant nothing good, and Dr. W felt like he was walking on eggshells around her.

It was hard for her to let go, especially after seeing how much joy he got out of being with her. He didn’t seem to miss me; he was already moving on, enjoying life with someone who didn’t break his heart. That realization cut deep, making her feel like she’d failed him somehow. Even though I know logically that we can’t control how people behave, the way he acted still stung. Seeing him happy with another girl reminded her of every time he'd left her behind, every broken promise, and every missed opportunity.
