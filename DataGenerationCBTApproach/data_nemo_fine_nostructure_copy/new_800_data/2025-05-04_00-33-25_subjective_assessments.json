Her latest article has been published, but there's no celebratory bottle of wine tonight. Instead, she stares at the empty chair across from hers, a pang of sadness echoing through her as she remembers last year's Christmas Eve dinner, laughing with her late grandmother over steaming bowls of pasta. The apartment feels too large, too quiet now that her grandmother is gone, leaving behind only memories and an ache in her heart.",

Perhaps then, she thinks, things wouldn’t feel so empty right now."

Her trembling hand had been too weak to hold the frame steady before it crashed to the ground, shattering into a thousand pieces.

I need to focus on rebuilding our relationship. If only I could tell her how much I missed her... She probably wrote it after she already knew she was leaving. That would explain why it wasn't signed. Maybe it was meant as some kind of goodbye. Why am I so angry? This isn't even real; I just want her back."
