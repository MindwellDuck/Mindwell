It doesn't matter how hard I try; no one will ever appreciate my talent. That's why I stopped showing my paintings years ago. I know I'll never be good enough for anyone. Art critics are always mean, so it's pointless to even share my work anymore."

This is just one more thing that's going wrong today. It feels like everything is against him now, and this isn't the first time I've experienced such things.

The dispatcher smiled reassuringly, saying, “Hey, we’re glad you did your part! You know, some people might say you were being overly dramatic.” Her face flushed with embarrassment. “What? No, I wasn’t being dramatic. I’m just really upset right now.” The dispatcher chuckled, patting her hand. “Well, maybe you are being dramatic. But hey, you did a great job. Don’t worry about it.” The comment made her feel silly, but deep down, she wondered if she’d been too harsh on herself."

I could tell by the way she looked at me - she felt sorry for me, but she knew what she was doing. There was nothing she could really do to fix this situation anyway.

But tonight, something felt...off.\n\nThe door to their bedroom was slightly ajar, not quite how she'd left it that morning. A shiver ran down her spine as she pushed it open, revealing the usual mess of clothes and books. Yet, her gaze was drawn to the drawer of her nightstand, which was ever so slightly open. She could've sworn she'd closed it that morning.\n\nHer heart pounding in her chest, she approached the drawer, fingers trembling as she pulled it open. Inside lay her jewelry box, untouched but for one thing: a small, silver locket missing its chain, lying at the bottom where it shouldn't be. She was sure she'd left it on top, its delicate chain looped over the lid.\n\nShe felt a wave of fear wash over her as she realized someone had been in their home while they were out.",

But what if— The uncertainty gnawed at her, making her wonder if there was more to it than she knew. Why hadn't she noticed anything unusual when he left? Was it possible he'd planned something all along? The question kept swirling in her mind, refusing to let go. As she sat there, lost in thought, the silence seemed to grow thicker, until it felt almost palpable. She could almost hear the echoes of what-ifs whispering in the darkness, each one leading her further down the rabbit hole of speculation. But then, a memory flickered to life—a conversation they'd had months back. Something about a friend's wedding, and how he'd promised to take a few days off. Could that have been a lie too? Did he even plan to attend? With every passing moment, the doubts crept deeper, until she felt like she was drowning in them. What"
