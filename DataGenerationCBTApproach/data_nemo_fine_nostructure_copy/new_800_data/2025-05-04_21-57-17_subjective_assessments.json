She can always call friends or family later if she needs someone to talk to. Her eyes wander around the room, taking in the familiar sights.

It was as if the world had shifted on its axis, leaving me feeling lost and uncertain. Every time I try to analyze this situation more rationally, I feel like I'm just digging deeper into the pit of despair. I can't help but think about all the times life has taken unexpected turns, each one forcing us to adapt to something new, often much harder than anything we could have anticipated. It feels like no matter how prepared we are, things always end up surprising us in ways that leave us breathless and bewildered. Even though I've learned from these experiences and now try to approach challenges with a clearer head, I still find myself getting swept away by fear whenever I encounter something that doesn't fit neatly into my plans. It's hard not to let your imagination run wild when faced with uncertainty, isn’t it? For instance, I remember how, back then, the idea of switching schools because of the pandemic hit us unexpectedly. We tried to stay calm, but it was difficult not to get caught up in worries about the future. Looking back, I realize that maybe things would have been different if we had approached it differently—perhaps we could have found a way to make it work without such significant"
