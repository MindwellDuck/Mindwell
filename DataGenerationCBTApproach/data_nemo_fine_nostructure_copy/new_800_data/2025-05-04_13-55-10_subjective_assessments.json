The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the windows, each one marking another day that passed him by. He paused outside Room 317, the name on the door now unfamiliar to him after all these years.\n\nThe room was quiet, too quiet. The machinery that once beeped and hummed in rhythmic cadence now lay silent, collecting dust in the corner. The bed was made, too neatly for a room that should have been filled with warmth and life. He reached out, his trembling fingers tracing the cold metal frame where she had once lain.\n\nHe remembered her laughter, so full of life and joy, now replaced by an eerie silence. His mind wandered back to that fateful day when he had made the call, believing it was best for everyone involved. But now, standing here alone, the weight of his decision bore heavily upon him. The regret washed over him like a tidal wave, each wave crashing against his chest with a force that left him breathless.\n\nHe had chosen the path of logic and reason, the path he had walked countless times as a doctor. But in doing so, he had forgotten to consider the heart. And now, all that remained was an empty room filled with echoes of what could have been.",

I can tell by the way she looks at people that she thinks she owns the place, like she believes everyone owes her favors. That look is so familiar, I've seen it before, especially when dealing with customers who aren’t exactly thrilled about being there. It’s almost... too familiar. The way she looked at me was just the same, the same confident smirk, the same air of entitlement. But why? What made her think she could just waltz in here and act like she owned the place? That look is so familiar, it’s like I know her from somewhere else. Maybe it’s because I’m used to seeing it around town. People seem to recognize her right away, whether they want to or not. They might even be scared of her. Why does that look feel so familiar? Is it because I’ve seen it before?

Maybe it was just nostalgia, but he felt a pang of longing, as if he might miss this feeling when he got back home. Maybe she's doing something special with her new boyfriend, and we'll never know. She might have moved on, found someone who actually deserves her. But what if she remembered him? What if she missed him? The thought sent a shiver down his spine. He knew he shouldn't waste his time wondering; he should focus on his studies and move forward. Still, as he turned the corner, he caught himself glancing over at the park again, half-hoping to see her there. Why is he even thinking this? He has no right to hope. There are other people who deserve her far more than he ever did. This isn’t a game anymore. His thoughts drifted further away from reality, lost in memories of their last days together.
