She can see it happening again, but this time, there won't be anyone to save her. She'll be alone, facing even more pressure, and she's certain that she won't survive it. \"I'm done working here,\" she decides. \"It's not worth it.\" She begins to pack up her things, wondering if she can find another job that doesn't feel like a prison sentence. She knows that if she stays, she'll end up losing her mind, just like she did last time. There are too many memories to revisit - the yelling, the tears, the days spent crying over a single mistake. She can't let that happen again. Besides, she has other plans now; she wants to travel, paint, and learn new skills. But for now, she needs to escape this toxic work environment"
