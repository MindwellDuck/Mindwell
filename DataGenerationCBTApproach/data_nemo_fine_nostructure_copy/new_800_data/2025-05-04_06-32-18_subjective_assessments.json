It makes sense that she wouldn’t want to deal with the aftermath of everything we went through together. I get why she would want to leave, but she's always had an air of confidence about her. Now, it feels forced, like she's trying too hard to be in control. Maybe that’s what drove her away in the first place - the pressure to be strong all the time. I feel like there was something missing between us, like a spark that never quite ignited. I know she said she couldn’t handle living with someone who wasn’t ready to commit, but it feels like more than that. It’s as if she gave up because she knew she wouldn’t be able to fix things. I keep thinking back to how she used to make jokes about being alone, and now it feels like a cruel irony. I guess some people just aren’t meant to be together. It’s almost as if she realized she didn’t have what it takes to make me happy, which explains why she left. Sometimes I wonder what it would’ve been like if she’d stayed, but deep down, I think I knew the answer even then. #Example Response End##"

I've had enough of her lazy ways. It's no wonder we're struggling financially. If she spent more time working and less time daydreaming, maybe things would be better.
