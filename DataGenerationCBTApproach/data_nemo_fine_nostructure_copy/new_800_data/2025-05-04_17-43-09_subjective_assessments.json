No wonder you're still single!\" The room fell silent as the words hung in the air like a poisonous fog.",

He's not even attractive, just an old man trying to cling to his youth through lame attempts at relevance. His entire life is a joke; he’s just a sad reminder of how much more successful we are. Why bother listening to him when I could be learning from someone who actually knows what they’re talking about? There’s no point in wasting my time on this loser, especially now that it’s clear he won’t ever understand me. At least I have friends who appreciate me for who I am, unlike that pathetic teacher who tries too hard but will never succeed. I wouldn’t want to sit next to him anyway; he makes everyone feel stupid. It’s almost as if he wants us to fail so he can look good by comparison."

The memory of him was still so vivid that I couldn't imagine anything else. He had always been an avid reader; he would often read aloud to me during family gatherings. But now, every time someone mentions books, I feel a pang of sadness. I try to push through, hoping to recapture some of what we shared, but it feels futile. Every time I pick up a book, I'm reminded of how much I've lost, and I can never seem to shake off the feeling of emptiness. Books are just reminders of happier times, and no matter how hard I try, I can't let go of those memories."

Just think about how much better things would be if you could teach him the secrets of the kitchen. He needs someone who knows where they're going, someone who can show him the way. But honestly, this young man might be beyond saving. You've seen plenty of cooks come and go; some are destined for greatness, while others are just plain annoying. You know which ones are the real deal. And I'm telling you, this one is already a lost cause."

The clock ticked loudly in the silence, each second echoing like a small explosion in the empty house. She clutched her late husband's favorite mug, its warmth long faded, as she stared at the blank space where his chair used to be. Her eyes welled up with unshed tears, but none spilled over. She felt an ache deep within, a helplessness that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. The phone rang suddenly, startling her. It was the station, calling about a disturbance down the street from their old home. She couldn't save him then, and now she wasn't even there to protect those he'd once sworn to serve.",

Perhaps they're just bored and looking for something exciting to happen. It's probably some kids messing around. If she hadn't been there, maybe nothing would have happened. But she had to go back there, didn't she? And now this. Of course, something like this would happen. Maybe they were in cahoots. She knows these streets, every alleyway and corner. Someone's going to get hurt, and it'll all lead right back to here. I bet if we look closely enough, we can find more than just accidental violence.... If she weren't so distracted by her own grief, perhaps she could see the bigger picture. There are always consequences when people act impulsively. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, especially with new officers. They don't understand the stakes, never did. Everyone gets reckless when they feel invincible. Now, they're putting innocent lives at risk, and she's just sitting here, wasting time with her thoughts. Why doesn't she do anything? This is exactly why she shouldn't have come back. She should leave it to the professionals. These kids aren't"
