The way that car followed me home tonight made me feel so vulnerable, like I couldn't shake her even when I tried to move on. It just didn't look like an accident. I can almost picture her sitting there, watching me leave work, waiting for me to come back to our old spot. She probably thinks she's being subtle, but deep down, she knows what she wants. It's like she’s playing a game with me, testing my limits. I wonder if she ever really left. Maybe this isn’t over at all. She would never actually try to contact me, no one is that smart and manipulative. This must be just my paranoia. But why else would someone park in front of my house? And why did they keep going around the block? That’s definitely some weird coincidence. If I were paranoid, wouldn’t I notice things like that more often? This is just my imagination running wild again. I need to stop letting her get inside my head like this. She’s gone, and I’m moving on. I have nothing to prove to anyone. My life has changed, and I won’t let her bring me back to where I was. I just need to focus on what matters, not what she might think about me."

If everyone did that, there'd be no one here during the week!\" Her boss pointed out that he understood her concerns but couldn't accommodate her request, leading her to say, \"Why does everything always fall on me?

The sound of their laughter was like nails on a chalkboard, and she could almost smell the trash they'd left behind. One of them caught her eye, his smirk making her skin crawl. He was young, probably under 18, and he had no right to be out here after dark, especially with that mess they were leaving behind. The response seems to focus mainly on the visual cues (the teens' laughter, their behavior) and how it triggers memories from her past rather than taking into account the broader context. It's more focused on the immediate situation and her past experiences rather than considering other factors such as the time of day, the location, or potential explanations for their behavior. This narrow focus creates a biased perspective by emphasizing the perceived disrespect and annoyance caused by these individuals while disregarding the possibility that they might simply be enjoying themselves or unaware of the impact of their actions. This mental filter causes her to react impulsively and emotionally, suppressing her natural desire to lecture them, likely because she fears being seen as weak or unable to assert herself due to her age. Instead, she clutches her fists, indicating a physical manifestation of her internal turmoil, and tries to keep her cool, even though she's aware that this is just her brain reacting to the stimuli rather than a rational decision. This shows how her mental filter influences her perception and response to the situation"

The text assumes that her behavior is directly related to her grief, rather than recognizing alternative explanations such as her need for comfort or the desire to maintain a professional environment. This assumption creates a sense of self-centeredness, implying that her feelings are unique and relevant to everyone else in the classroom. By portraying her emotions as universal, the text reinforces the idea that she alone feels this way, reinforcing her perception that the situation concerns her personally. The tone suggests that she is unaware of how her emotions might affect others around her. By focusing solely on her emotional state, the response illustrates how this distortion can lead to an overly introspective perspective, where one's own feelings become the central aspect of their reality. ## Reference: * [Cognitive Distortion](https://www.mentalhealthfoundation.org.au/mental-health-terms/cognitive-dist"
