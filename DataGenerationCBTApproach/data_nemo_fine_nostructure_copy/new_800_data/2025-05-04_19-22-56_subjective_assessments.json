Another slow day, another slow week. His reflection in the glass shelf catches his eye - the dark circles under his eyes seem to have deepened since yesterday. He feels an overwhelming urge to sit down right there amidst the dusty shelves, but the weight of his responsibilities keeps him standing. No one's coming tonight; they never do. Another night alone, another day wasted in this lifeless job. He can't help but feel that tomorrow will be more of the same, and the day after that, until it all becomes just an endless, hopeless blur.",

Every moment I spend here is a reminder that I'm stuck in this meaningless existence forever. I've been trying to escape for years now, but nothing ever works out as planned. This place is a constant reminder of my failure, and I'll never find happiness here. It's pointless to keep hoping for something better; it won't happen anyway. This feeling of being trapped is what life really is - a never-ending cycle of disappointment and despair. I might as well give up now and accept that I'll always be stuck in this miserable situation. It doesn't matter how hard I try; things will never get better. At least I know where I stand now - in the middle of nowhere, with no chance of success whatsoever."

Maybe she feels lonely and wants to create a fake moment for herself by pretending to be part of someone else's love story. That chocolate box will just sit there, untouched, reminding her of all she doesn't have in life—true love and companionship. She looks so perfect, with her flawless skin and bright smile, but deep down, she’s probably consumed by jealousy and insecurity. ---"
