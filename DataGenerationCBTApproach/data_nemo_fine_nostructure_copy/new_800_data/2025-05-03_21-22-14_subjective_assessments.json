The man who had been her husband's best friend, the one who'd been there when she needed support most, now seemed to have moved on without a second thought. Her grip tightened around the bundle of thyme she'd just purchased, knuckles turning white. Hatred surged through her like lava, boiling up from her core as she watched him walk away arm in arm with someone else.",

        "Cognitive Distortion": "Overgeneralization",
        "Generated Assessment": "She can't trust anyone anymore. I'm sick of seeing people smile at each other all the time. It makes me angry. People are always doing things they don't want to do, but if they're happy about it, then that means everyone is just faking happiness. They don't really care about you. My life has been ruined by those fake smiles. # Edit For clarification, the Overgeneralization distortion occurs when we make an assumption based on a limited number of instances. In this case, the distorted thinking reflects how she overestimates the extent to which others are untrustworthy because of one negative experience. When faced with multiple examples, she might realize that many people still value honesty and sincerity, and that her perception was overly broad. To address this, ask yourself questions like: * How would you feel if you were in her shoes? * What evidence do you have for your claim? * Would you generalize the same way if you experienced a positive interaction? These questions will help you evaluate whether your thoughts align with reality. If they do, you'll be able to adjust your perspective and avoid making assumptions based on incomplete information. By doing so, you'll become more open-minded and better equipped to handle complex situations in the future."

But I can’t help but feel insecure, like I’m losing my place in his life. He’s always been so open with me, but now it feels like every little thing is magnified. Every time I see those likes, I worry he might be telling someone else things I shouldn’t know about. - Sarah"

There must be some mistake, right? Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses—maybe I just need to focus on my own performance instead of constantly comparing myself to others?"

Today was the big inventory day at the store, the one he'd been dreading all week. His wife kissed him goodbye, oblivious to his knotted insides.

What if customers got upset because he wasn't accurate enough? What if he spilled coffee all over the floor? What if he tripped and fell and hurt himself? His mind raced with scenarios where everything went wrong, each possibility making him more anxious than before. He felt like he was stuck in a nightmare from which he couldn't wake up. Every step he took outside felt like a giant leap into uncertainty. As he entered the store, he saw rows of shelves stacked haphazardly, and the thought hit him like a ton of bricks: What if it's already too late? What if this is just another day where he can't handle anything? What if he's just not cut out for this job? Each question repeated itself in his head, fuelling his anxiety instead of calming it down. Despite the looming fear, he forced himself to take a deep breath and walk through the doors, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."
