The familiar hum of her home office seemed amplified, each tick of the clock echoing like a distant bomb's countdown in her ears. She had been married to him for decades, yet his sudden silence on the other end of the line, after asking about yesterday's article, felt like an abrupt divorce from their shared reality. Anxiety gnawed at her stomach as she realized tomorrow's paper was due, and she hadn't written a single word.",

She stared blankly at the wall, her mind racing through all the what-ifs—what if this wasn't just another deadline? What if it was something more? Something that could change everything? Her husband, usually so full of life and energy, sat across from her, his eyes fixed intently on some point beyond her shoulder. His silence was deafening, and she felt like he was staring right into her soul, daring her to confront whatever was eating away at him. But she didn’t know how to start the conversation. They had been together for over four decades, and now, in the midst of this chaos, she felt lost and scared. Every time she tried to ask him questions, he would just nod or say “yes” and then go back to typing. It was as if he was trying to tell her something, but he couldn’t find the words. She knew he was struggling, but she had no idea how deep. All she saw were glimpses of his frustration, and it was making her feel like she was drowning in a sea of uncertainty. As the hours ticked by, she found herself checking the clock again and again, each tick marking another moment slipping away from her. She couldn’t help but wonder"

I already know what I want to say. If you were smart, you'd be helping me instead of wasting time on pointless questions. Even if you did try to help, you'd mess it up somehow because you're too stupid. So why bother? Just sit there and look dumb while I figure everything out myself. You know what would really help at this point? Not listening to me. Or maybe if you had some actual intelligence, you could explain things to me, but I doubt that will ever happen. At this rate, you'll never learn anything. You've always been slow. Maybe you shouldn't even be here. You're holding everyone back. Maybe I should just leave you alone.

Now, I’m left feeling lonely, like I missed the boat. I keep thinking about what could have been if I’d pursued different paths earlier. If I had prioritized family sooner, perhaps I wouldn’t be here today, wondering why things didn’t turn out the way I wanted. It’s hard not to feel like I missed my chance. Sometimes I wish I had made different choices, but deep down, I think I was always meant to teach. Maybe there’s something about being a teacher that makes it harder for me to find lasting connections. I guess you can't change the past, but it still feels frustrating. Life isn't fair, and sometimes I feel like I'm just supposed to accept it. But it doesn't help when I see pictures like that one – it just makes me sad. Maybe I should stop looking at these photos and try to enjoy what I have now instead of dwelling on what could have been.

She knows things won't change overnight, but still, it feels like he's being deliberately cruel. The fact that there's another baby involved makes everything worse. He should be thinking about two children now, not one. And why does he get to choose who takes care of them while she's left in the dark? She needs to focus on herself, too. What if this is some kind of twisted revenge? Perhaps he wants her to look bad by choosing someone else. If she lets him think he's got the upper hand, she might end up losing more control over the situation. Shouldn't she stand firm and make her position clear? There's no need to let him get away with this. It's time to show him that she won't back down easily. After all, she's not going to be ignored forever.
