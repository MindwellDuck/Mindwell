The thought stings, and he can't help but wonder if it's because he's not enough — not good enough to keep up with her busy schedule.

This isn't just about dinner; it's about the accumulation of all those moments where she prioritizes her job over us. He can't shake off the feeling that she doesn’t really want to see him anymore, that she sees him as just another part of her routine, not someone she truly wants to spend time with. It's hard not to think she's better off without him, especially when she talks about her work with such passion, leaving little room for personal life.
