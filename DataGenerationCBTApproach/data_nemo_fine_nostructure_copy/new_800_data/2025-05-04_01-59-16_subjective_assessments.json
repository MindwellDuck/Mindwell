It was infuriating; how could someone act so carefree when justice was supposed to be served? She knew exactly how he’d appeal—she’d seen it all before. “This isn’t over,” she hissed, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. What if he won? What if he escaped? No, no, she pushed those thoughts away; she wouldn’t give him the satisfaction. Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible would happen, something that would leave her shattered.

I feel like maybe it wasn't that impressive since he doesn't usually cook for us, so I'm not sure why he bothered making such a fuss about it. Maybe he's just being polite? I'm starting to wonder if I overreacted by saying it was delicious. My husband has been busy lately, so maybe he hasn't even noticed my efforts to help around the house. Now that I think about it, maybe I'm just expecting too much from him because he's always working late. Anyway, I guess I shouldn't expect him to be perfect all the time."
