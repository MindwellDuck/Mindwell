We can't let ourselves get too caught up in her optimism. This isn't about her, anyway - it's about my own stress levels. If anything, her presence might even distract me from my worries.

My younger self had been so passionate about teaching these kids. I remember the excitement we all shared when I first got hired. We had big dreams for those classes—especially the ones that focused on social studies. But now...now it feels like a distant memory, something from a different life. I thought about the students who came before me. They didn’t have access to the same resources we do today. They learned from textbooks that seemed outdated by comparison. And yet, they managed to teach just as much as I could. Maybe more so, because they didn’t have the luxury of relying on technology. Their dedication impressed me even back then. It made me realize how far we’ve come as educators—and also how much farther we still have to go. But standing here today, surrounded by the very same exhibits my younger self had dreamed of seeing, I feel like a disappointment. I’m the one who cancelled the field trip. I'm the one who chose not to take them to the museum. All I can think is that I've let down a new generation of students. They deserve better than someone who doesn't know what it means to truly love teaching. I look around"

Now he’s stuck here, dealing with another hassle on top of everything else, just to prove to himself that he can handle it. He realized that maybe his anxiety about his job was making things worse. Maybe if he took some time to relax, he wouldn’t be so uptight. But then again, what if something else went wrong? Wouldn’t he wish he’d been more careful instead? Maybe if he'd checked the parking signs again, he wouldn't be having these thoughts now. But no, he still feels anxious, and his mind keeps racing with worst-case scenarios. At least he knows that he'll be able to focus better tomorrow. Still, he wonders why he always has to deal with these problems."

Her health should've lasted longer; it was unfair. I wish things were different, but they weren't. It feels like a betrayal to think that everything could've gone differently if only... If only she had stayed healthy longer, maybe we wouldn't be dealing with this pain today. But it doesn't matter—she's still gone. This isn't fair. Why did this happen? Everything about her passing makes no sense. I'm struggling to keep going because of all these what-ifs and why-nots. What if she'd lived longer? Would anything change? Would our lives have turned out differently? Maybe if things were different, she'd still be here with me. I can't stop thinking about what could've been. It feels like a bad joke—the universe has a twisted sense of humor. Life shouldn't be like this. We're supposed to enjoy our time together, not suffer through loss. But I'm stuck here, trying to make sense of it all. She should never have died. That's not how life works. People shouldn't leave us so suddenly. They shouldn't take your loved ones from you"

It wasn't just nostalgia; he could almost hear the soft whispers of her voice, urging him to open up about his fears and doubts. She had been more than just a friend; she had been his confidante, his partner in every sense. Now, as he stood before those forgotten letters, he wondered if he would ever find someone else who understood him the way she did. It seemed impossible—she was gone, lost forever, leaving behind only these faint reminders of what once was. His heart swelled with longing, but so did a bitter resentment toward himself for letting things fall apart. How could he have let such precious moments slip away? Wasn't he supposed to hold onto her, cherish her, protect her? Why had he pushed her away? Hadn't she been everything to him—a safe haven, a guiding light in the darkness? Yet, now she was gone, and all he was left with were these letters, fading reminders of a love that once burned bright. It was as if he'd lost his grip on time itself, and the world around him had melted into a blur of memories. Everything had"

Maybe she'll finally hire someone to help with the chores if she's having such trouble getting in by herself. This is so typical behavior for her, it's pathetic. I don't know why anyone would want to clean for themselves, especially if they're going to end up making a mess again anyway. She needs to stop being so lazy and learn to take care of herself.

Her words hung in the air like a challenge, daring me to confront the truth: that she was no longer invested in our relationship. I could almost hear the echo of her past promises, the empty vows that had once been so full of hope now reduced to nothing but dust. How many times had I tried to bridge the gap between us, only to be met with excuses and broken commitments?
