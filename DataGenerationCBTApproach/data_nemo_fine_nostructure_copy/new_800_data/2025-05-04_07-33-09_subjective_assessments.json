She thinks back to all the times she prioritized work over family, all the days she spent in meetings, each minute ticking away like grains of sand in an hourglass. Every decision felt calculated, every choice weighed against the clock. And for what? So she could be there for her daughter's arrest? Or even worse, so she wouldn't miss it? The more she reflects, the more questions arise. Why did she choose to focus on the big picture, on the project that needed to be completed? Why didn't she stand up for her child, take a chance to make a difference? She knows the answer isn’t simple—it’s complicated, full of what-ifs. Yet, she feels that her life has been defined by these choices, by the decisions that left her with regrets. Her mind drifts further into the past, revisiting moments where she might have acted differently, where she could’ve been there for her daughter. She wonders how many other opportunities she let slip by, how many chances she missed to show love and support. Each memory plays"
