She was always there for me, making sure everything went smoothly in our relationship. We were happy, or so it seemed. At some point, things changed. I stopped trying to make an effort, and she got tired of waiting for me to change my ways. When we finally parted ways, I felt lost. Her smile wasn't as bright anymore, but I still tried to hold on to those memories. Maybe if I had been more supportive, things would have worked out differently. Now, whenever I think about that time, I'm filled with regret and sadness. The thought of what could've been haunts me. One day, while cleaning up old belongings, I stumbled upon a cookbook. It was full of recipes from different people, but one particular entry caught my eye—a simple chocolate cake. There was something familiar about it. Suddenly, a memory flashed before my mind's eye—the same cookbook was lying on our kitchen counter, next to a note with her handwriting. I hadn’t seen that book since she left, but now it all came flooding back. The smell of baking, the sound of mixing, and the taste of freshly made cookies—everything was there, reminding me of happier times. As I flipped through the pages, another name caught my attention—a local baker who had submitted a similar recipe. His profile read that he'd"

She thought about how much easier it would be if she could just grade all the papers at once, like some other teachers seemed to do. But then she'd remember that this wasn't her class, and she wouldn't know what they were doing differently. As she stood there, staring at the stack, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was somehow failing.

It's not like I'm not trying, but sometimes it feels like I'm just not good enough."
