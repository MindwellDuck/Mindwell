She unlocked the front door, the silence greeting her like an old, unwanted friend. No radio playing softly in the background, no scent of dinner cooking on the stove. Just the quiet hum of the refrigerator and the ticking of the clock she'd inherited from her grandmother. She hung up her uniform, running a hand over the gold badge that seemed to grow heavier each day. As she walked into the bedroom, her eyes fell on the empty side of the bed, the blankets untouched since he'd passed. A familiar ache stirred in her chest, and she felt the tears threatening again. Another night alone, another chance to miss him like hell.",

The darkness made her feel more invisible than usual, but it was probably just her tiredness playing tricks on her. Her mind wandered back to work, replaying the arguments with her partner over his recent behavior. It wasn't fair to take out her frustrations on him, especially when they were already stressed about money. She told herself she needed to focus on saving, cutting back on expenses and finding ways to make more. The thought of their future together kept her going, even as the loneliness crept in. She checked the thermostat, feeling cold despite the warmth of her uniform. Maybe she could heat up some leftovers from last night's dinner? The kitchen seemed too much effort right now, so she decided to grab a snack instead. The fridge was almost full, thanks to her careful planning. She opened the door, and the smell of fresh vegetables hit her. It was nice to have healthy options at her disposal. But what really stood out was the lack of leftovers. Hadn't he cooked anything before leaving for work today? She couldn't remember. He usually took care of dinner, but maybe he'd forgotten this time. Or perhaps he hadn't bothered to cook because he was busy with work or didn't want to spend time in the kitchen. She wondered if there was something wrong with him lately, if he was really pulling away from them. This wasn't the first time he'd been distant;"

The house was empty, the garden needed tending, and his car remained parked outside. The silence was oppressive, making her feel lost in space. She couldn't shake off the feeling that everything was falling apart, and the world was spinning out of control. Every minute ticked by with agonizing slowness, leaving her with nothing but despair. As she stood there, she began to wonder if anyone would even notice if she just disappeared. Would they think anything about it? Or would it all remain hidden? The thought sent a chill down her spine, and she found herself thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if someone broke into the house while she was gone? What if no one saw her leave? It seemed so easy to imagine, so realistic, yet somehow impossible. Yet the more she thought about it, the more it became clear that maybe it wasn't so far-fetched after all. Maybe it was exactly what happened last time. And before that. Her mind raced with possibilities, each one more terrifying than the last. It was like trying to solve a puzzle, but every piece seemed to fit together in a way that made no sense at all. But then, she remembered something. He had always said that he appreciated her efforts, no matter how small they seemed. If she kept going, even when things got tough, he'd come back to her"
