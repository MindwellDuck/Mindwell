Whatever it was, it seemed to be telling me that she was moving on with her life, leaving me behind. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing, like the sound of her laughter echoing through the street. But why would she change? Hadn't she always said that our friendship meant more than just hanging out? Yet, as I turned away, I noticed the way the sunlight highlighted the slight dust on her windowpane – a sign, perhaps, that she was no longer here. # # # # # # I'm still trying to process everything.
