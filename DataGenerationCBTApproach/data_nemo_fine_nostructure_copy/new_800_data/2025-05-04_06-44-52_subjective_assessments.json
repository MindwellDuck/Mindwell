When he wore those faded scrubs, he had this endearingly disheveled look, like he hadn't bothered to put himself together for work. It's almost as if he wanted me to know he wasn't taking our relationship seriously, that he was just going through the motions—like he didn't really care about me. And yet, every time he came home from a long day at the hospital, he'd wrap his arms tightly around me, holding me close like he couldn't bear to be apart from me.

It must be true. Every time we talk, he puts up this wall. He can't stand to hear anything bad happening in his life. Or mine for that matter. He gets scared easily, and now I don't know if I ever deserve comfort. I've learned to stay away, even though it hurts. Maybe I’m just too much for him. Too much stress, too many problems. I understand why he needs space, but what about all the times he was there for me? Did those moments mean nothing? Perhaps I overreacted by bringing up how worried I am about an upcoming surgery. Shouldn't he be happy I care so much? Does he hate knowing I worry about him? Is that why he pulls away? Is it okay that I miss him? That I wish he were here to listen? Can he really say he cares if he doesn’t make time for us? Do I need to stop worrying about him, or is that just how he likes things? What if I’m just not good enough?

Here’s another attempt: She’s been feeling really down lately, especially after seeing that photo again. The way she reacted to my mom’s suggestion made me realize that maybe I’m destined to struggle with my career. My life is probably going to be filled with disappointment and frustration. # Edit 2 For clarity, I understand the concept of fortune-telling but I’m not sure how to apply it here. The idea is to show that the person believes something bad is likely to happen based on a past event. In this case, the belief is that her life will be difficult because of her reaction to her mother’s advice. I hope this clears things up! :) # Edit 3 To address some concerns, I want to clarify that the main point of this exercise isn’t to directly prove that the person has a distorted view of the world. Rather, it’s to demonstrate how they might unintentionally perpetuate negative thoughts by misinterpreting past events. By showing these examples, we can encourage people to recognize when they’re falling into this pattern and make conscious efforts to challenge those"
