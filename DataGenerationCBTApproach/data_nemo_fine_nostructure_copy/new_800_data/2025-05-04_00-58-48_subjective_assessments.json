He's been poring over scientific journals for hours, his eyes straining from the harsh light of his desk lamp. His phone rings; it's her—his ex-wife. He hesitates, then answers. She asks if he can watch their teenage daughter this weekend as she has a \"last-minute business trip.\" His grip tightens on the phone, resentment simmering within him like an unspoken reproach. This is not the first time she's made such arrangements without considering his schedule, or perhaps caring to. He feels the familiar bitterness rise in his throat as he agrees, his voice tighter than he'd like.",

I shouldn't even bother going there. I'll never meet someone who truly gets me, who understands what drives me to create. Every canvas I make is a part of me, but no one will ever know how much I put into each brushstroke. This feeling isn't new, but I’ve been avoiding it lately. Maybe it’s time to face it head-on. Why would I waste my time showing my work to people who won’t appreciate its depth? I’m better off focusing on my own projects, ones where I can control every aspect. There, I can ensure they’re perfect, not some watered-down version meant to impress strangers. I deserve better than to have my creations ridiculed or ignored. Why should I risk that now?"

When I saw him sitting there at lunch today, staring blankly at his phone, I knew exactly what was going through his mind. That's all this is - a case of the teacher thinking he knows better than us. How could he possibly think that? Maybe he thinks we're all stupid for not understanding math concepts, and now he's writing this to try and make himself look smart by saying he's doing what's best for us. But he doesn't actually care. He's just trying to cover his own butt, hoping we'll forget about our poor grades and move on. He doesn't realize that his behavior is making things worse, especially since he never responds to our emails. This is definitely not the first time he's acted like this, but he always manages to get away with it because he's friends with the principal. Now he's probably planning to use this email to justify giving us lower grades, knowing we won't stand up for ourselves against him. I feel so angry and frustrated, like I'm trapped in some kind of nightmare where nothing changes. The fact that he even wrote that email shows how out of touch he is with reality. He must be imagining himself as some sort"

I felt trapped, stuck in a never-ending loop of work and forgetfulness. My mind was clouded by the constant din of responsibility, leaving no room for anything else. I knew I needed to break free from this cycle, but I didn’t know how. As I stood there, frozen, I realized that my emotions had become my truth. Whatever pain I felt, whatever regret, it all stemmed from my own choices. And yet, despite knowing this intellectually, I still felt that same crushing weight, that same sense of failure. My thoughts swirled around me, each one a reminder of what I’d lost, what I’d overlooked.

She tried to calm herself, telling herself it might just be the house settling, but deep down, she knew better. The tapping seemed too intentional, too calculated. Someone was leaving her a sign, a warning about some impending danger. She couldn't shake off the feeling that this was more than just random noise; it was a signal from the other side, a call to action. Her skin prickled with goosebumps as she imagined who could be behind it. Was it a ghost, a harbinger of doom, or someone watching her, waiting for the perfect moment to strike? She closed her eyes, letting the rhythm guide her into a world beyond reality, where the tapping was the only truth. In this mystical realm, the walls were thin, and whispers carried far, echoing secrets only the initiated could hear. Every tap was a clue, every beat a countdown until the inevitable. She felt trapped, caught between worlds, with no escape from the ominous drumbeat. The tapping was a reminder that some forces were beyond human control, that there were those who lurked in shadows, pulling strings and manipulating fates. She was just a pawn in a game she"
