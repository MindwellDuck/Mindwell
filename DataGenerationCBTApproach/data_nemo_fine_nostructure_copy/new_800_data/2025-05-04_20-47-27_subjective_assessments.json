But this latest rejection wasn't different; it just felt worse because now he'd failed twice in a row. The feedback was brutal, with every suggestion he made criticized. It was like they were trying to break him. But then, while cleaning up his desk, he stumbled upon a draft from months ago. It was a presentation he’d worked on during a particularly rough patch. The words still resonated deeply, yet he couldn't help but smile at how far he'd come since then. He remembered feeling lost, doubting himself, and wondering if he was cut out for this job. Yet, here he was, a successful project manager with a thriving team. The past month had been incredible, filled with successes and learning opportunities. He realized that maybe his drive wasn't about proving others wrong, but about growing stronger with each challenge. As he sat back down at his desk, he began to organize his thoughts. Instead of dwelling on the rejections, he focused on what went well. He started brainstorming ideas for his next proposal, drawing inspiration from the lessons learned and the progress made so far. The more he thought about it, the clearer his mind became. He didn't need to justify everything to anyone else; he needed to prove it to himself. With renewed energy, he dove into the task ahead, determined to make it better than ever. This time, he wouldn't"

Her husband didn't understand how hard it was to balance work and family life. Every late night at the restaurant took away from quality time together.
