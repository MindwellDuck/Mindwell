He wondered if she had finally found peace, if there was something new in her life that made her want to reconnect. Maybe she wasn't just sending some random thoughts; maybe there was more to it. He felt a mix of emotions as he sat there, unsure whether to open it or leave it closed forever. The thought of opening it made him feel vulnerable again, like he was reopening wounds he thought were healing."

It's clear that she doesn't respect my contributions; instead, she's trying to make herself look superior by downplaying her own achievements. Her arrogant behavior at the awards ceremony was a deliberate act to undermine me, and it’s obvious that she thinks I’m incompetent. This isn’t about me failing to get recognized—it's all about her trying to show off her superiority and diminish my worth. She can't handle the fact that someone younger than her has achieved more than she did at our age, so she's acting out in front of everyone to prove her point. This isn't about her missing out on the award; it's about her being insecure and jealous of my success, which makes her lash out. The way she smiled during the presentation was a calculated move to hide her true emotions—she's probably seething inside but pretending to be happy for me as a way to mask her resentment. She knows she hasn't done anything special, but she can't admit it because it would make her feel inferior, so she's resorting to acting like everything is fine when it's really not. My efforts are constantly overlooked, and now she's trying to make me look bad by downplaying her own failures. She might have won this specific award, but I know there are many other areas where she fails compared to me. This whole"

Maybe if I didn’t work as hard, he wouldn't have so much to complain about. But no, he still finds fault in everything I do. It's like I'm never going to be good enough for him. And now, after all we've been through together, he has the nerve to throw it back at me, blaming me for his own failures? That’s just rich coming from someone who has done nothing but disappoint me over the years. I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much for him, and this is how he repays me? By treating me like dirt? I guess I just expected more from him, especially since he knows how much stress life has been on me lately. I thought I was doing okay considering everything that’s happened, but I guess I’m not good enough anymore. I wonder if things would be different if I wasn’t such an overworked single mom. Maybe then he’d see things differently. But no, he just keeps putting me down and blaming me for his problems. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

Not when they were still building up the team, and the project was already behind schedule. It seemed like every decision made so far would be based on assumptions, not facts.
