I know it’s just an unfair advantage since my photos are way better, but still, it feels like a constant reminder that I’m not good enough to be liked by others. It makes me question whether I really have friends who would care about what I do outside of work. Every time someone else gets more likes, I feel like I don’t deserve those connections either. It’s frustrating because it makes me wonder if anyone would even notice if I stopped sharing my life online. Maybe they’d just assume I was doing nothing anyway. It’s so hard to keep going when it feels like every little thing I do is being overshadowed by everyone else’s accomplishments. My mind starts racing with worst-case scenarios, imagining how people might react if they found out I wasn’t actually having fun all these years. They’d probably think I was just pretending to be happy for their sake. Now I’m not sure if anyone wants to be friends with me anymore. I guess I’ll just stick to taking photos of my food instead, hoping no one will ever compare them to the amazing things other people get to experience. ### Output End # Output She always gets more likes than me when we both share posts about our weekend adventures.

If he had kept up with cleaning, maybe she wouldn't have been gone so soon. I'm surprised he doesn't try harder to hold on to her memory. When you're this oblivious, you don't realize how much more work someone else would need to do to keep your stuff organized. I guess he thought he could just leave everything as is until someone else took over. What if he hadn't? Maybe she wouldn't have felt overwhelmed and needed to leave. It's hard enough when you care about something; imagine how much worse it gets when you don't. She deserved better than to be treated this way, especially by someone who couldn't even see the impact of his actions. You can't trust someone who doesn't respect boundaries, especially when it comes to memories. I wonder what else he might have messed up. Hopefully, no one else has to deal with his lack of attention to detail."

She'd always been the one who encouraged him to pursue science, but now her absence left a void he couldn't fill. Every time he opened this old lab, memories flooded back, and he felt like he was reliving those moments, but they were tainted with sadness. He remembered how much she loved studying, how her curiosity would never stop, and how her passion for discovery inspired him to keep going even when things got tough. Her enthusiasm was contagious, and he cherished every moment they spent exploring the microscopic world together. But life had other plans, and now she was gone. The pain was overwhelming, and he couldn’t help but feel lost without her. He looked around the room, taking in the remnants of their work, trying to distract himself from the ache inside. The microscope still stood there, waiting for the day they could explore new samples together, but that day seemed farther away than ever. Everything reminded him of what he’d lost, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of emptiness. He thought about all the times they worked late, sharing stories and jokes as they examined the tiny worlds they uncovered. His mind replayed their conversations, the laughter, and the quiet moments when they talked about their hopes and dreams. It all came flooding back"

People like him were always looking down their noses at everyone else's creations, never stopping to think how they might feel. It wasn't right, but what if she had kept pushing forward? Would she have found someone who actually cared? The thought lingered in her mind long after she left the gallery, haunting her every step. She knew she needed to move on, to find her place in the world beyond these walls, but what if she lost herself along the way? What if she became nothing more than another forgotten piece of art, hidden away forever? What if... She pushed the thoughts aside, but they lingered, refusing to let go. The memories of that day continued to haunt her, fueling a fire within her that seemed to grow stronger with each passing moment. She felt trapped, caught between the desire to create something meaningful and the fear of being overlooked again. Every time she opened her sketchbook, doubts crept in, whispering the same haunting question: What if?"
