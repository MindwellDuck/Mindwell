She had meant to review tomorrow's appointments, but worry gnawed at her. The latest letter from her daughter, filled with unspoken concerns about her father's health, lay untouched beside the keyboard. Her mind raced, envisioning worst-case scenarios, each one more daunting than the last. She sighed, rubbing her temples, as the clock ticked away another hour of sleepless worry.",

Each passing minute seemed to stretch time itself, making it feel impossible to find solace in anything less than perfection. Her heart pounded in her chest, the rhythm echoing through every cell of her body. She couldn’t escape the feeling that this was all too much, that nothing could ever truly be okay again."

We'd talked about how his absence would affect her, but now it felt so real. \"Can you check your dad's room?\" she asked, her voice trembling. I knew what to say next—“Of course.” But then I started thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if she found something she couldn’t handle? What if she needed help she wasn’t ready for? \"I'll get right there,\" I said firmly, trying to push aside those thoughts. When I got there, everything looked normal. No sign of struggle or distress. Just an empty bed. I told her I was just going to sit with her for a while, listening to her talk through whatever was bothering her. But then I started imagining the worst-case scenarios. What if she did find something? What if she couldn’t cope? What if this was the start of something much bigger? I pushed myself back onto the couch, trying to focus on the present moment. My mind kept racing, though, filling my head with all the terrible possibilities. I wished I could turn off the thoughts, but they wouldn’t stop. They just kept coming back, each one more disturbing than the last. I sat there, trapped in my own worries, unable to shake them off. This time, instead of pushing"

She approached her desk, piled high with untouched manuscripts and notes from years of stories untold. A yellowed envelope caught her eye, tucked beneath a stack of newspapers. It bore no address or return label, only her name, handwritten in faded blue ink. She picked it up, feeling its weight, remembering the last time she'd held something like this. The memories rushed back, hot and shameful, as she opened it to find a decades-old photograph staring back at her - a reminder of that one story she never wrote.",

But every time I look at that photo, all I can think about is what could have been. If only I had the courage to tell those people’s stories when they needed them most... Instead, I let fear hold me back, and now I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but regret. The pain of knowing what I could have done still feels so fresh, and I wish someone would just understand that I wasn’t capable of doing more than I already did.

It's no wonder he's been struggling to wake up this morning. I can see why he'd be preoccupied by the thought of us being apart; it's almost as if he's carrying my emotional weight on his own. Even though we agreed to keep things civil, I can tell how much he misses me. He must be feeling guilty over everything that happened, which explains his lackluster attitude towards work. I feel bad seeing him like this, especially since he was always there for me when I needed someone. But now, he's just... gone. I wish I could reach out and show him how much I care, even if it means keeping my distance. Maybe if I give him space, he'll eventually come around and realize he made a huge mistake by letting me go. I can't help but think he's hurting more than he lets on, so I'm trying to be patient. At least he knows I still love him, even if he hasn't acknowledged it yet. Hopefully, someday he'll understand how much he’s missed."

Was it just nostalgia, or did she see something more? Did she see her mother's warm smile, the way the sunlight danced through the kitchen window when she cooked? Or maybe it was just his own longing for the past, a yearning for times when life wasn’t so complicated. Whatever it was, it made him feel...lost. Like he was missing pieces of himself, like parts of his family's story were still hidden. He closed the book, feeling a little overwhelmed by the emotions it stirred. Maybe he should have left it alone, but now he couldn’t shake off the sense that he was holding onto something precious, something that could never be recaptured. The book lay open on the counter, its pages filled with tears and memories, a reminder of the things we hold dear, the things we can never truly possess again. # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"
