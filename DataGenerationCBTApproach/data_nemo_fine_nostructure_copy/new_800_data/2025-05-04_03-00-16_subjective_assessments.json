The pain of losing her seemed almost unbearable, even though they hadn't spoken for years. She would have wanted him to stay close to family during those difficult times, but instead, he pushed them away, drowning himself in work. Now, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of regret. Every day feels like an eternity, filled with thoughts of what could have been if only he had reached out sooner. This situation is causing me such anxiety! I can barely sleep anymore because of all these thoughts. It’s like my mind won’t stop dwelling on everything. I feel like I’m going crazy. I wish I didn’t think about her so much. I don’t know how to stop this. I just want some peace. But every time I try, my mind spirals back into those painful memories. I hate how much stress this brings to my life. How can I make this go away? Maybe if I ignore it, it’ll fade. But deep down, I know that’s not true. This isn’t going anywhere until I face it head-on. I need to find a way to deal with it, but I’m so tired of dealing. I just want things to be okay again. But nothing will ever be the same again. Everything feels so heavy. I can’t escape these thoughts."

He picked it up without looking at the caller ID, hoping for some small distraction from his despair. It was the restaurant's owner, informing him that they were letting him go. \"It's not personal,\" she said, her voice echoing in his ear like a cliché. But it was personal. Everything was personal to him.\n\nHe hung up and looked around at the space he'd poured his heart into, now silent as a morgue. His eyes fell on the old cookbook he'd given to his ex-wife all those years ago, its pages yellowed with age and use. He had hoped it would bring them closer, but it had ended up in the divorce settlement instead.\n\nAs he picked up the book, a photograph fluttered out from between the pages - him and his daughter at her first communion.

The thought of starting over gave him hope, though the reality of being unemployed after nearly 20 years in the industry stung. He'd lost weight since leaving the restaurant, maybe he'd find a new passion. There were plenty of other recipes he hadn't tried yet. You can't live forever, but life is full of surprises. Who knows, maybe this was an opportunity to explore something else. Maybe he could start cooking again, rediscovering flavors and techniques he'd forgotten about. Maybe he could even try his hand at baking, like his grandmother used to make. There were so many possibilities. He wasn't defined by one failure; he was defined by countless successes. The past was just that – past. All that mattered was what came next. Life went on, and he wanted to keep moving forward. Every day was a chance to write a new story, every bite a taste of adventure. This was more than just a kitchen; it was a journey, waiting for the next ingredient."

And now, as they shared a moment of connection, I wondered, What if this feeling never fades? What if we’re meant for something more? But he knew better. This was just friendship, nothing more. Yet, the thought lingered, refusing to let go. Maybe someday, somehow, things would change, and he’d realize that it was more than just a dream. For now, though, it remained just that—a fleeting fantasy. A memory to hold onto, but not enough to shake off the reality that they were just friends.

And if she wasn’t careful, she’d end up running late again, forgetting orders, and having to rush through the kitchen just to get everything out on time. Not to mention the constant nagging voice in her head that kept telling her she wasn’t good enough, that every mistake was proof she didn’t deserve success. It felt like no matter how hard she worked, she was never going to be good enough. And then there were the little things - like today, when she had almost forgotten about the anniversary until it hit her just as she was rushing past the flower stand. How many times had she done this? Too many to count, but she knew exactly why it happened: because deep down, she couldn’t handle the pressure of living up to expectations. Everything always seemed to fall apart when she put too much pressure on herself, and I’m starting to think that’s exactly why she never gets it together. Just like last year, when she failed to deliver on the menu, despite promising to nail it. Or the time she overslept and showed up late, leaving her"
