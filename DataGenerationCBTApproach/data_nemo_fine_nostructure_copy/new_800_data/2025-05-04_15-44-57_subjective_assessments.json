Now, as he sat in their empty home, surrounded by her abandoned art supplies, he realized that maybe she never intended to come back. ## Step 1: Identify the trigger Identify what triggered your response (in this case, the scene described). ## Step 2: Look for patterns Look for patterns in how you react to similar situations in the past (e.g., other times when your partner was absent). Do you tend to assume the worst? Do you feel hopeless? ## Step 3: Analyze your thoughts Analyze your thoughts about the situation. What are you thinking about your partner’s actions? Are you assuming things based on past experiences? ## Step 4: Reflect on your emotions Reflect on your emotions in relation to the situation. How do you feel? Are there feelings of sadness, anger, or hopelessness? ## Step 5: Evaluate your thoughts Evaluate whether your thoughts are reasonable. Consider if there is any evidence to support your assumptions, or if they are based on past experiences that might not be relevant here. ## Step 6: Adjust"

He's probably just trying to make me jealous by suggesting something like that. That doesn't mean anything; he wouldn't really follow through with it. Besides, he's still getting over her. She's not even around anymore. There's no reason for him to send an email like that, so there must be some other explanation. It could be nothing at all - maybe she's someone he met online, and he thought it'd be funny to send her a message. Maybe they're friends or something. I know what you're thinking, but let's not jump to conclusions here. We have no idea what's going on. This is ridiculous. He can't possibly be considering dating her. If he did, we'd already know about it. And if he did, why would he keep such a secret? Come on, don't be ridiculous! You're reading way too much into this. Let's focus on the positive aspects of our relationship instead of jumping to conclusions. Oh my god, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I need to get a grip. This isn't rational behavior.
