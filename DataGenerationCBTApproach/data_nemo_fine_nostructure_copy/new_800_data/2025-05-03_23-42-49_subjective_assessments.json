This is why I’m never going to succeed at anything. Why bother trying? I’ll just end up failing again. Every time I try something new, I fail. And now, because of this stupid mistake, I feel like I’ve wasted even more time. I could be doing something else right now instead of sitting here feeling sorry for myself."

I’m starting to think he doesn’t believe in my abilities anymore, that all those late nights and sacrifices were for nothing. Maybe he already sees me as a failure, and it’s only a matter of time before he leaves me. She thought about how he had once said he wanted kids who could change the world, but now she wondered if he meant someone else. Maybe he didn’t mean me at all. Perhaps he never saw me as more than a means to an end—a tool to further his own ambitions. My mind is racing with questions: Does he still love me? Does he even care? Is everything we built just a facade? She feels trapped in a cycle of doubt, unsure what the future holds. Each day brings new challenges, and the fear of losing him grows stronger.

Everything always goes wrong. She can’t trust anyone anymore; she’s all alone. And why should she feel otherwise? Why should she even bother trying? What’s the point? Shouldn’t she be getting hurt again? Doesn’t everyone deserve pain if they’re not loved? Maybe she’s lucky to have been loved once, but now she deserves to suffer too. That’s just how life works. Everyone gets what they deserve. She shouldn’t expect anything else. Her life isn’t fair, and she knows it. She wouldn’t wish this on anyone else, so why should she get to enjoy happiness either? It’s just not right. We’re all supposed to be miserable anyway. Maybe if she’d done things differently, she would’ve avoided all this pain. Now look where she is – alone, with nothing but regret. How could someone treat their mother like this? Doesn’t he know how much she loves him? Doesn’t he"
