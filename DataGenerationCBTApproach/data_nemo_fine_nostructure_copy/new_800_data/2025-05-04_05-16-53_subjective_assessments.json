I'm so upset that he didn't sign it properly. It feels like a small act of disrespect. I wish he had signed it like he used to. Now, I feel like he's being childish again. This is just another reminder that he doesn't respect me or our relationship. I know he's trying to make things difficult for me, but this is ridiculous. I can't believe he would do something like this."

It had slipped out of his notebook yesterday, a reminder of the story he'd been putting off writing - their last vacation together before she fell ill.

The thought hit him like a ton of bricks as he stared at the faded picture, the one where they stood in front of the sunset-lit beach, arms wrapped around each other, smiling broadly. She looked happy, carefree, and content, just as she had been during those days. But now, everything seemed tainted by the memory of her illness. The doctor's words echoed in his mind: \"It might be too late for treatment.\" He couldn't shake the feeling that he had failed her somehow, even though he knew deep down that wasn't true. They were meant to travel, to explore new places, but instead, they spent their time together in hospital visits and quiet nights. He remembered how much she loved their trips, how excited she would get when he showed her pictures from their adventures. But what did it matter? All he could think about was how his stories wouldn't live up to her expectations anymore. He didn’t want to write anything about this trip because he thought it would make him look bad and he couldn’t bear the thought of people reading about him and judging him. He felt trapped in his own thoughts, unable to let go of the past. Every day felt like another step closer to losing her, and yet, he refused to start writing, fearing that whatever he wrote would be inadequate. The thought of his failure weighed heavily on him, making every moment feel like a burden."

I try to tell myself it’s just my imagination, but I know it's real. I can feel him watching us, waiting to pounce. My heart beats faster, and I start to wonder if she knows what she’s doing. Is she trying to provoke him? Does she enjoy being tortured by memories of him? I’m so angry, but I have no idea why."

His fingers, once so deft and strong, now lay limp, a stark contrast to the way they moved with purpose when he was working. She remembered the sound of his footsteps, echoing through the empty hallway as he disappeared from view. It was then that she realized she would never hear those footsteps again, never feel the warmth of his hand in hers, never smell the scent of his cologne. Her eyes drifted to the spot where he used to sit, but it was now just a vacant chair, a reminder of what could never be regained."

It's always the same story - she goes into work, forgets to call, and then shows up exhausted, expecting me to take care of everything while she takes a nap. I'm tired of being the one who always has to cover for her, waiting around all night for her to come home so we can share our dinner together. It's hard to be patient when it feels like she doesn't even think twice before leaving me behind. And now that she's back home, I can't shake off the feeling that she's hiding something from me. Maybe it's just my imagination running wild again, but I'll probably wait until tomorrow morning to talk to her about it."

She had been through so much that it was hard not to feel empathy for her. I could see the trauma written all over her face. It's always this way when people go through difficult experiences; they become bitter, cold, and distant. No one can ever be good enough again. You just can't trust anyone anymore. They're all going to hurt you in some way. Every smile is just a facade, every hug a trap. It’s never going to get better. I hate seeing them like this because it makes me sad. But deep down, I know it’s true. People who suffer are doomed to be unhappy forever. There’s no escape from their past. They’re trapped in a cycle of pain, and no one can help them. It’s always the same story. They lost everything that mattered, and there’s no chance of recovery. Life doesn’t forgive those who have suffered too much. You can’t just put yourself back together after what they did. They’re broken, and they’ll always be broken. No amount of therapy or support can fix them. All you can do is pity them. Even if someone tries to be kind, it won’t work. They won’t let you in. They’re too scared to open up. So, instead of confronting them, you just walk away. It’s easier that way."
