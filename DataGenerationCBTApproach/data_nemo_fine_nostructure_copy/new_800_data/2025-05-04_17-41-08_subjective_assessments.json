Each day he watches as a young graffiti artist, barely out of adolescence, tags up the wall across from his window - vibrant colors splashed across the old brick, obscuring the once pristine view that inspired his late wife's favorite painting. The hatred simmers within him like a slow-burning flame, fueled by each new addition to the ever-growing mural. One morning, he sees the boy pausing mid-spray, turning to catch sight of him watching. Their eyes meet through the glass, and the artist feels his grip tighten around the coffee cup in his hand until it shatters, cutting into his palm.",

Her widowed hands, still unaccustomed to the empty ring finger, paused as she stared at the blinking cursor.

There was no longer the same sense of satisfaction from creating something new, and the pressure to keep going grew with each passing day. It was exhausting, but she pushed through, convinced that eventually things would get better. But then came the day when she failed to meet an important deadline, and everything changed. Instead of receiving praise for her work, she faced criticism from the editor, who accused her of being careless and irresponsible. He told her that if she didn’t improve, she wouldn’t be able to keep her job. The words stung, but she tried to brush it off as a one-time mistake. However, soon after, another deadline slipped through her fingers, followed by two more. With each failure, she felt like she was drowning in her own mistakes. The editor’s words kept echoing in her mind: “You’re not doing your job.” And he was right. She was failing. As time went on, the pressure intensified. One morning, she woke up to find herself crying over a story she’d written the previous evening. The words blurred together on the page, and she felt like she was drowning in tears.

The individual seems to have given up on themselves and their career, viewing every opportunity as either a surefire way out or a guaranteed disaster, rather than considering potential successes or setbacks that might fall somewhere in between. This distorted thinking leaves little room for growth or improvement, making it difficult for the person to adapt to changing circumstances or learn from failures. --- **Note:** This response is meant to illustrate how someone might exhibit the \"All or"

        "Generated Assessment": "A middle-aged woman was furious when she saw an elderly couple in her neighborhood walking hand-in-hand. She thought to herself, \"If I had my life together like they did, I wouldn't be struggling financially.\" She felt jealous of their happiness and began to question her own choices. Her anger led her to dismiss her own hard work and sacrifices, focusing instead on what she perceived as their easy success. This distorted view made it harder for her to accept her own efforts, making her feel like a failure by comparison. She wondered how someone else could achieve so much while she struggled, feeling inadequate and stuck. She started to believe that her situation was unfair compared to theirs, and her resentment grew. This reaction to the elderly couple is an example of the cognitive distortion where we unfairly compare ourselves to others who seem more successful, leading us to feel inferior and less motivated. By comparing our struggles to those of others who appear to have achieved more, we distort our perception of reality, creating unrealistic expectations and feelings of inadequacy. When we focus solely on comparisons rather than taking responsibility for our own actions and decisions, we can become mired in self-pity and stagnate our progress. It’s essential to recognize these distortions and strive for a more balanced perspective, one that encourages growth and personal responsibility. By letting go of this harmful mindset, we can break free from the cycle of negativity and embrace a path toward positive change. # # # # # # # # # # # #"
