This is all because of my lack of dedication and work ethic. If I didn't slack off, I would've gotten the job done on time and they wouldn't have rejected me like this. Now I've wasted another week working for nothing. I guess I just don't deserve success anyway. I'm just not good enough. Maybe I should just stop trying altogether. I'd rather waste my time on meaningless tasks than keep striving for something I'm incapable of achieving. At least then I won't be reminded of my failure every day. It doesn't matter how much I learn from these rejections - I'll always fall short. I'm doomed to fail, and the more I try, the further behind I'll get. I might as well give up now and accept that I'm destined for mediocrity. At least then I can focus on smaller things that don't stress me out. What's the point of keeping going if everything I do will end in rejection? Why bother trying when it only leads to disappointment? Better to let go now and avoid the pain of constant failure.

But when she left, the kitchen felt empty, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. As he reads through the reviews, one stands out in particular. A couple mentioned how much they loved the homemade ravioli served on their first date, and how it reminded them of their own wedding day. He smiles, remembering how she'd spent hours perfecting her recipe, and how the noodles seemed to melt in your mouth. The photo accompanying the review shows a beautifully set table, complete with candles and flowers. It looks almost...like our wedding. His heart skips a beat as he stares at the image. He feels a lump form in his throat, and suddenly, the room around him fades away. All he can think about is how beautiful she looked on their wedding day, her white dress sparkling in the sunlight, her smile radiant as she walked down the aisle toward him. He can almost hear the sound of her laughter, echoing through the halls of their little Italian restaurant as customers cheered and clinked glasses."
