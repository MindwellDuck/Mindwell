He'd been home alone all day, yet every creak and groan of the old building sent shivers down his spine. His heart pounded as he reached for his service revolver, the cool metal familiar in his trembling hand. He tiptoed towards the door, ears straining. The scratching continued, rhythmic, insistent. He swallowed hard, sweat beading on his forehead despite the chill. Suddenly, it stopped. Silence hung heavy. Then, a soft whisper echoed from the other side, \"Let me in.\" His breath hitched. It was a child's voice, yet it sent icy fear coursing through him. He knew no children lived in this building. He backed away, eyes glued to the door, finger poised on the trigger.

This wasn't just an impulsive fantasy; it was something he genuinely wanted. The idea of ending his life was comforting, a solace he couldn't quite explain. Each day, he felt like he was drowning in his own thoughts, but in those moments, he found a strange comfort. It was as if he'd finally found a way out of the pain that had haunted him for so long. When he closed his eyes, he imagined the release, the final surrender. He would find peace then, free from the burdens that weighed him down. The thought of death became his only respite from the world's cruelty. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was the only thing that could save him, that it was the one place where he might truly be at peace. But deep down, there was another part of him, torn between hope and despair. One moment, he yearned for escape; the next, he wondered if he was strong enough to carry on. He didn't know what he truly wanted anymore—whether he sought relief or kept fighting against the darkness. All he knew was that death beckoned, its allure growing stronger with each passing day. And yet, he was trapped in a cycle of conflicting desires, unable to decide whether he wanted to end his suffering or keep going. The world outside seemed cruel, and in his mind, the only way out"

The contrast between our lunches was stark - hers was a symphony of healthy goodness, while mine was a sad, hastily prepared mess, full of regret.

Now, he feels terrible for even having those messages, and he can't believe she would accuse him of cheating. He realizes now that he should have erased the texts immediately when he saw her, instead of thinking they were private. It's obvious that she doesn't think highly of him anymore, and he feels like a complete loser. Even though he has never cheated on her before, this situation makes him question everything. It's unbelievable how she could turn against him like this after everything they've shared. He knows she cares deeply for him, but now he feels betrayed and hurt. He wishes he could erase every single text, and he wonders if she'll ever forgive him. She's being unreasonable; she shouldn't expect anything else than an apology. He loves her so much, and he wants to make things right, but he's worried that she won't let him back into her life. This whole situation is making him feel insecure and anxious about their relationship. He doesn’t know what to do next.
