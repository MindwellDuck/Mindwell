She'd always been up before me, ready with a fresh pot of coffee. This wasn't anything new. I'm actually starting to feel a little better now that I realize this isn't something out of the ordinary. She wouldn't want me to be stressed about it; she'd want me to stay calm and focus on work. # # # # # # ## Output His thoughts were: \"This is so weird. I've been gone just a few hours, and yet everything looks perfectly normal—just a very early start on my part?\" He had a tendency to rationalize things by saying \"It doesn't seem unusual at all\" and \"She wouldn't want me to be stressed about it\". These responses suggest he has difficulty accepting the reality of the situation because he wants to believe that nothing has changed. He also downplays his wife's death as if it was nothing more than an inconvenience, implying that life continues as if she never died. These distortions lead him to avoid dealing with the full impact of the loss, which prevents him from fully processing grief. By focusing solely on how things look rather than acknowledging what happened, he avoids confronting the truth. His reactions demonstrate a lack of awareness regarding these"

Our minds tend to believe that events are directly connected to our personal lives, even when there may be more rational explanations. This tendency can lead to feelings of disappointment and isolation, as if we're at the center of everything that goes wrong. It's almost as if our perception creates its own reality, making it difficult to see things objectively. We might start to wonder why others don't reach out or offer help, assuming they've forgotten about us or simply don't care. But perhaps there are more practical reasons for their silence—maybe they’re just busy with their own projects or have changed their priorities. Or maybe, it’s just a case of people being too polite to address uncomfortable situations."
