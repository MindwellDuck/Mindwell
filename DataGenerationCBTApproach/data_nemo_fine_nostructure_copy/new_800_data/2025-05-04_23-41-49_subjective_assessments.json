It was so strange that I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.* *But then again, maybe it's just my imagination playing tricks on me. I've been working late nights lately because our manager is out sick, and I haven't gotten much sleep recently. Maybe I'm just stressed and hearing things.* *Still, though, I can't help but feel uneasy about it. The other employees are all gone for the day, and I'm pretty sure we're the last ones here. Even if I am just imagining things, I still can't shake this creepy feeling.* *I guess I'll be keeping an eye out for anything unusual while I'm closing up tomorrow. But honestly, it's hard not to wonder if someone might have been in the store after hours...* *Maybe I'm overthinking this, but I'm still going to keep a close eye on things while I'm working tonight.*"

It's like she's been painting for hours and suddenly it all just hits her - she wasn't good enough. It's so sad. This girl has talent pouring out of every brush stroke, but no matter how hard she tries, it never feels right. The colors are dull, the composition is off... it's just not what they want. And now that she's sent this piece, there's no going back. It's done. She'll probably be rejected again, and maybe even worse than before. The pain of rejection is real, especially when you're trying to make a name for yourself. But sometimes, as harsh as it may seem, you have to face the truth. It's time for her to put down the brushes and pick up a new hobby. Maybe then she'll find something that brings her joy. That way, she won't let disappointment define her. It's okay to take a break and focus on something else. After all, art isn't everything; life has its own beauty too."

It's as if the world is telling her that she doesn't belong here anymore, that there's no room left for someone who once shone so brightly. It's hard to see past the sadness, to realize that perhaps this isn't about her worth, but about the changing times. Yet, the pain lingers, making her wonder if she'll ever truly be ready to leave the stage behind."

And then there was the feedback from her boss about the presentation last quarter—she knew it was going to be tough, but the tone felt harsh, even though he said everything was fine. That's why she hasn't sent out the next report yet, hoping to improve before sending it. Maybe if she works late tonight, she'll get ahead of schedule and feel better. Her mind wanders back to the past, thinking about how things used to be. When the company had a small team, everyone pitched in and supported each other. There was always something fun happening, whether it was a spontaneous game night or grabbing lunch together. But now, with more people and less support, she feels like an outsider again. She wonders what happened to those moments of camaraderie and whether things will ever go back to normal."
