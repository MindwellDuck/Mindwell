He seemed so relaxed, too, which only made her annoyance grow. This was exactly what she hated about hiring young people - they never took things seriously enough. The whole kitchen seemed to be falling apart around her, and it was all because of these incompetent kids who didn't know how hard real work was. She pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on getting everything ready for service. But the resentment lingered, simmering just below the surface."

It was almost as if they were old friends reunited, sharing moments that only came with time and familiarity. Her mind wandered to how easy it must feel to let your guard down, to trust someone enough to share a simple gesture like a peck on the cheek. It wasn't about him; it was about the way she wished things could be between her and her ex. They'd shared laughter, adventures, and late-night conversations, but now everything seemed distant, lost in the past. As she sipped her coffee, the warmth spread through her, a reminder of happier times, though it couldn't fill the void within. The world outside seemed so different—full of life, full of joy—and yet, here she was, stuck in her own thoughts, wondering what it would take to break free. Maybe someday, when the memories faded, maybe then she could find her footing again. Until then, she sat at her desk, surrounded by screens and silence, longing for something more. Yet, even in this moment, there was beauty—a couple smiling together, their happiness infectious. It made her smile, if only briefly, before reality set back in. Still, she held onto the memory, letting it linger as a reminder that sometimes, all you need is a glimpse of another’s happiness to make your own seem worth fighting for."

A forgotten photograph flutters out from between two slats - a faded image of her and an old friend laughing together at a picnic.

This is all there ever was—memories, longing, and the desperate wish to turn back time. She can’t help but wonder if anyone else shares her pain, or if I’m truly alone in my sorrow.
