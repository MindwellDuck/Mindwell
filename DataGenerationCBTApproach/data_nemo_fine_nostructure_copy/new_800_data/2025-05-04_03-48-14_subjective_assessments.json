A pang of remorse shot through her; she hadn't made it since he passed two years ago. The recipe book lay untouched on the counter, its pages dog-eared and grease-stained, a silent reproach. She'd been too afraid to face his joy, his absence, all wrapped up in that one dish. Today, though, she felt an inexplicable urge, a whisper of him in her ear, urging her to cook it again.",

Even now, hearing about other people enjoying this simple pleasure makes me realize how lucky he was to have found such a kind soul in me. I know it sounds silly, but every time I hear someone talk about cooking this dish, it feels like they're talking about our relationship. It's almost as if they think I'm hiding a secret or trying to prove something by making it. But what's so special about it? Is it really worth comparing ourselves to others over something as ordinary as a meal? I guess what hurts is seeing how many recipes there are online, each one claiming to be the best version of this dish. Everyone thinks their way is the perfect way to make it, and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out. Maybe I'll try making it again someday, but for now, I don't want to be reminded of what I've lost. Life goes on, right? It's funny how some things can evoke such strong emotions.

Each piece of feedback stung, making her doubt whether she was even cut out for this line of work. What's wrong with me? Can't I ever get it right? This cycle of self-doubt made her question everything: her passion, her dedication, even her own worth. If she wasn't meant to succeed, why bother trying?

First, the gallery owner didn’t take her work seriously enough to give it a proper review, then he simply dismissed it without explanation. And now, with this latest rejection, it feels like"
