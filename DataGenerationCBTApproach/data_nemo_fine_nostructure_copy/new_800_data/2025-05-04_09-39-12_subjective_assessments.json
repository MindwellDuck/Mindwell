It’s probably because we haven’t had our manager on duty today—she can get pretty intense when things go wrong. That’s why I feel bad for her; she must be feeling overwhelmed. This isn’t uncommon, especially during peak hours, but it doesn’t excuse how she reacted. Maybe if she took a deep breath, everything would have been okay, and the situation would have turned out better."

But the more I looked at the picture, the clearer it became - it was just a simple memory of us all having fun together. Still, the feeling lingered, making me wish I could go back to being the oblivious guy who would have laughed along with them without thinking twice. Now, I'm left wondering why this moment feels so out of place in the bustling workplace."

It wasn't for himself; it was for them. For her. He could finally see a purpose behind his suffering. This time next year, he wouldn't be sitting here alone. He would have someone to share this life with. And maybe even someone who cared about him more than just a name. He would never give up on love again. He already knew what he wanted to do: get married and have children right away. That way, no one could take them away from him. Now he felt hopeful. Maybe everything was going to work out after all. Maybe his hard work wasn't in vain. He looked at the clock and realized how late it was. He didn't need sleep anymore. He could start planning everything immediately.

If this is what happened to her beloved plant, then maybe she's really gone too. This makes sense, because she always took care of everything around her. She even cared for me. I miss her so much now. Maybe she went somewhere else. She could be working on some new project or visiting friends. But why does it feel like an eternity since we last spoke? The days seem longer than usual, filled with nothing but emptiness. It feels like the world has lost its color, just like the once-vibrant leaves of that poor plant. He can't help but think that maybe one day, things will go back to normal. Maybe I'll see her again soon, smiling brightly as she tends to our garden, reminding me of all the good times we shared. Until then, he'll keep looking after the house, making sure everything stays in order, waiting patiently for the day when she returns. --- # Example Feedback The response shows a clear tendency to jump to conclusions based on incomplete information. The assumption that the plant’s wilting indicates the woman’s passing seems overly dramatic and lacks concrete evidence. This interpretation suggests the author may be prone to overestimating the significance of minor details, such as a plant's condition, and mistaking them for signs of a larger problem,"

Her eyes seem to hold a hint of desperation - a desperate attempt to convince herself that this new chapter won't end up like all the others. It pains me to think about how much pain she must've endured, but I can't help feeling that I'm just watching a scripted scene play out for my amusement. This whole thing feels staged, like she's trying to prove some point by flaunting her current status. Maybe she thinks that by wearing this ring, she can somehow control the narrative of our lives? What's more, I wonder if she even knows what she’s doing. Is she just going through the motions, repeating patterns that always lead to heartache? Does she really believe she's found someone who loves her for who she is, or is she just caught up in the thrill of it all? But let's be real – we both know what's coming. She’ll probably leave him soon enough, just like everyone else. And when she does, I’ll be here waiting patiently for another chance to save her.

How could he forget our plans for a dream vacation we discussed last month? Now I feel like I’m just an accessory, and he’s the main attraction.
