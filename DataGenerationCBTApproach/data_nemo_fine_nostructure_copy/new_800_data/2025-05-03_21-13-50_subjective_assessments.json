Her heart pounded as she answered, bracing herself for the robotic voice that always followed. \"You've been selected...\" it began, but she couldn't focus on the rest, her breath coming in short gasps. She dropped the phone, painting forgotten, as panic surged through her like a flood.",

The engineer must have made a better impression on the new management, one that made them decide against continuing his project. It's just another reminder that he's no longer needed here, that his time is long past. The thought sends a shiver through his frail frame, and he shakes his head, convinced that this is all too much for someone like him."

He felt left out, so he made fun of her painting skills by saying something about her being a kid who couldn't even draw straight lines. She started crying when he said that, and now she's mad at him for making fun of her. It wasn't his fault she cried; she was already upset before he said anything."

That shadowy movement must have been its way of signaling its presence, and I know how it feels to be startled into such a primal state—fear, anxiety, all those feelings flooding my body. Maybe the shop owner doesn’t want us to know about this, but I think I saw something else too—a glimpse of someone lurking around the corner, maybe outside. They could be watching us, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. My instincts are screaming at me to leave, but I’m also scared that if I do, they’ll take advantage of our distraction to steal something valuable. I don’t know who or what is behind these strange occurrences, but I feel like I’m in the middle of some kind of sinister game, and I need to find out more."

She wondered if Mrs. H., who wrote the note, had seen how much Timmy struggled with English, and whether she had changed his life by being patient and understanding. The thought sent a pang of sadness through her chest; maybe he hadn't done well either."

It's like my brain is trying to tell me I'm not cut out for this job. Maybe I shouldn't be working here at all; maybe I'd be better off just staying home. But then again, if I did that, I'd miss out on valuable experience and potential future opportunities. It's such a vicious cycle...

I wonder if they might need some help in return - maybe they could use someone to shovel snow? Or perhaps they have something they'd like to pass down to me? It must mean they see me as family already. It makes sense that they left this note because they knew how much my partner loved our shared memories. They probably wrote it themselves. This is such a beautiful way to honor him. My heart just melted when I saw that handwritten address. It feels like a message from beyond, don't you think? I'll make sure to write back soon, maybe even bake some cookies to share. They can't know how touched I am by this gift, but I'm going to try anyway."

It wasn't until someone asked if she'd ever considered creating for children that the room shifted.
