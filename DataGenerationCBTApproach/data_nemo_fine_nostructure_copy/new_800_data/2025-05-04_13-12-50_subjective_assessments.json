I can’t imagine why someone would take such strong issue with how they’re treated as a patient. It just seemed like an overreaction to me."

It was as if time itself had conspired against her, leaving her with nothing but memories—memories that now felt hollow. Every step into the future seemed to lead further away from the warmth of his presence. Though the house still held many of his belongings, it lacked the comfort he once provided. Her mind wandered to the countless moments they shared, each one a bittersweet reminder of what could never be again. In these quiet hours, every sound took on a deeper meaning—a reflection of her isolation, echoing through the empty spaces where love once filled them. The silence grew heavier with each passing day, weighing more heavily than ever before. Every movement felt forced, as if trying to fill the void left by his absence. Even simple tasks became burdens, weighed down by the weight of her grief. Each passing day felt like an eternity, stretching out before her like an endless road, devoid of the gentle guidance she once found in his loving hands. With every breath, she felt the emptiness growing, a constant reminder that life would never be the same without him by her side."

Maybe he'd changed restaurants? The thought stung, and he wondered if Mr. Thompson was upset with him somehow. Had he messed up something small? Or perhaps there was another reason why this particular customer felt so distant today? This isn't just about the food; it's personal. They've known each other for years, sharing countless meals together. Now, it feels like an unspoken rift has opened up. He wonders what could have caused such a drastic change in behavior, especially when everything else seemed fine yesterday. Is Mr. Thompson avoiding him now, or is something more going on behind the scenes?"

What if they think I'm always looking for an excuse to get upset? She's probably joking when she said that. She never means it seriously. It’s what we say in our heads, right? We don’t really believe it. They know how much I value my privacy, so why are they doing this again? Maybe they’re bored and want attention? But I don’t see them around the school. Oh well, maybe they were just hungry and needed a snack. That makes sense. I’m reading too much into it. This isn't the first time someone has done this, and she hasn't taken action yet. She can't let people walk all over her, even if it was just a mistake. I feel like she should have called the principal by now. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but still... This could escalate. What if it becomes a habit? Or worse, what if someone sees me eating it? Then everyone will think I'm a picky eater. I'll look weird in front of the students. I need to handle this better. She didn’t report it to anyone, which suggests she might be trying to avoid confrontation. But what if she's worried about losing control? Maybe she wants to show she can handle difficult situations. I'd rather talk to the teacher about it than make a scene. Yeah,"

The clock's digital display seemed to mock him, its red glow casting eerie shadows around his empty bedroom. He'd been asleep mere minutes ago, or so it felt, but now he was wide awake, gripped by an irrational fear that he couldn't shake off. His divorce had been finalized last month, and the house felt too quiet, too vast without her echoing presence. The silence pressed down on him like a physical weight, suffocating him. He reached for his phone, fingers trembling as he dialed her number before remembering she'd changed it months ago.
