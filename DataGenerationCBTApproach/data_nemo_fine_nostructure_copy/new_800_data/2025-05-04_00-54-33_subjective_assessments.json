His heart ached as he realized he hadn't used that color since she died. This response reflects the 'Emotional Reasoning' cognitive distortion because it assumes that the emotional state (heartache) is evidence of reality. The individual is using their feelings to interpret events, making assumptions about what happened based solely on their emotions. This type of thinking can lead people to overgeneralize, misinterpret facts, or become overly attached to specific outcomes due to emotional attachment rather than objective analysis. In this case, the person is inferring that they haven’t painted with cerule"

The sudden buzz of an intrusive, unfamiliar ringtone echoed through the room, sending a jolt through his fingers. He froze, annoyance flickering like static across his face. It was another art critic's call, no doubt, eager to dissect his 'emotional palette' when he could barely decipher his own anymore.

Every time they call, it feels like they're trying to ruin everything I've worked for. Like, what if I'm just not ready yet? Or maybe they're trying to distract me from something else entirely? I mean, who says I even need their approval anyway? It really makes me wonder how many times they’ve done this before. Have they been doing this to all the artists lately? Maybe there’s some kind of pattern here I’m not seeing. But honestly, it’s getting harder to focus. I feel like every little thing is making me question my work. And why do I always have to deal with them first? Is it because they’re the ones who get to decide what's good enough? I guess I'll try to ignore them and keep working, but it's hard not to let frustration build up inside me. Sometimes I wish people would just leave me alone, especially during my most intense moments. You know, when you're really into your art, you don't want anything disrupting that feeling. But then again, maybe I'm just too sensitive today. Either way, I’ll try to stay focused, but I can’t help wondering if these critics are always causing trouble."

Her grandmother must have been thinking about her too, wondering if she still kept the small wooden box with the carved apple branch her mother had given her when she was just a little girl. She could almost hear the soft creaking of the porch swing where they would sit and share stories of their dreams for the future. Her heart swelled with gratitude as she realized that her grandmother's love hadn’t wavered even after death. Every time she looked at the picture, she felt like she was back there, surrounded by the warmth and love that filled every corner of that house. Even now, sitting alone in her apartment, she could imagine her grandmother's gentle smile, watching over her from wherever she might be, guiding her toward her own path. It was as if her grandmother’s spirit lingered, always near, reminding her of the memories they shared and the promises they made to each other. In this moment, she knew exactly what her grandmother wanted her to remember: the joy they found in simple things, the comfort of knowing she wasn't truly alone, and the hope that life would continue unfolding as planned.

It makes me wonder if he'll ever find happiness again. Sometimes I wish things could go back to how they were before, but deep down, I know that won't happen. Maybe he needs time to heal, but every moment passes slowly, making it harder to move forward. I keep thinking about all the good times we had together—how she would smile at me, how our mornings started with coffee and laughter. But those memories are fading fast, and now it feels like he’s losing himself in grief. I just want to help him see that there’s still so much to live for, even though he seems completely consumed by his sorrow. Still, I can't shake off the feeling that this is all part of some twisted plan. Maybe he's trying to punish himself somehow, or maybe he genuinely believes that time will erase everything. Whatever it is, I worry that it might be too late for him to change. Still, I hold onto hope that one day he’ll realize how precious life is and start living again, no matter how hard it"
