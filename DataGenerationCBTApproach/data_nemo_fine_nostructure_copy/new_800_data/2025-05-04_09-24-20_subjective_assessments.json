Instead, he found himself worrying about the mess, how it would affect his plans. \"Why does it always have to be like this?\" he wondered, shaking his head at his own frustration. As he cleaned up, he couldn't shake the memory of their conversation earlier in the day. She had mentioned her desire for a relaxing morning, but now it seemed like an unattainable dream. \"It doesn't matter,\" he told himself, trying to push aside the thought. After all, what did it really mean? Just another reminder that life wasn't going according to plan. Despite the chaos, he forced himself to focus on the positives. Their relationship was strong, and she understood his stress. But why did everything have to fall apart at once? He pushed the thoughts away, continuing with the dishes, trying to find some peace amidst the turmoil."

Maybe they've even been plotting against me behind my back, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. It's really frustrating when people try to bring me down like this. I can't help but wonder if it has something to do with my past mistakes—those times I made careless errors that could have cost me my job. Now, here they are, pretending to be objective reviewers, but secretly trying to hurt me. They're probably just a rival who's tired of seeing me succeed. They might be feeling insecure themselves because of my achievements, so they decided to take out their frustrations by attacking my work. This kind of behavior is common among those who feel threatened by my success. I'm starting to think there's more to this than just a simple mistake. There might be some personal vendetta at play, especially since I was involved in some controversies earlier in my career.

I can't trust myself right now; this must mean I'm incompetent.\" --- # The Cognitive Distortion **Emotional Reasoning** This cognitive distortion occurs when you assume your emotional state accurately reflects the situation. You use your feelings to justify your attitudes and judgments, even if they don’t align with objective reality. This leads to impulsive reactions, irrational decisions, and potentially harmful consequences. **How it Works:** When you experience strong emotions like anger, fear, or excitement, your brain automatically links those feelings to the situation. You might think, “If I’m feeling anxious about something, then it must be serious.” In reality, your emotions are often misinterpreting information or reacting to external stimuli rather than the actual situation. **Consequences:** Emotional reasoning can lead to: 1. **Impulsive Decisions**: Your emotions drive your choices, causing you to act impulsively without fully considering the consequences. 2. **Rationalization**: You create logical explanations for your emotions, justifying behaviors that might not be rational or objective. 3. **Mistaken Assumptions**: Your feelings influence your perceptions, leading to inaccurate conclusions about people, situations, or events. 4. **Conflict Escalation**: Overreacting to emotions can escalate conflicts, damage relationships, and even cause harm. **Recognizing Emotional Reasoning:** To"
