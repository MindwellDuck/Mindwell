She saw them laughing, chasing each other around the old oak tree, their faces flushed with joy. As she gripped her teacup tighter, she felt a pang of envy. It had been years since she'd heard such laughter echo through her own quiet house. Her late husband's laughter was still vivid in her memory, but the children they'd once hoped for never came. She looked down at her wrinkled hands, imagining them small and chubby, laughing with abandon. The envy stung, a bitter taste on her tongue.",

What if I could watch my children grow up instead of just growing older? What if my hair was still dark and thick? What if I wasn’t so worn out? What if I didn’t have this constant ache in my heart? What if I were still full of energy? It’s hard not to wonder what would happen if...if... If I weren’t already 65, if I still had that spark inside me, if I could go back in time... I can almost see myself now, holding onto a little boy’s hand, watching him chase after his friends, playing with blocks, reading books, learning new things... But then I feel the sting again, and it hits me harder than before – it’s just not meant to be. It’s too late for that kind of life. My body is weak, my mind foggy, my emotions dull. I’m tired.

It had been three years since John's passing, but moments like these still felt like a punch to the gut.

As she gazed at the couple, their joy seemed almost cruel – they were living, while she was stuck in this endless cycle of grief. The resentment she’d tried to bury for so long now bubbled up, threatening to spill over. What if I could have been with him? Would we be sitting here together, enjoying our coffee, instead of me sitting alone, staring at my laptop? The thought sent a shiver down her spine. She closed her eyes, letting the silence wash over her, but it only brought back memories of happier times, times when John was alive. Their laughter echoed in her mind, louder than the hum of the café. It was all she had left now – memories of him, and the life they would never share again. She opened her laptop, the screen glowing softly, but it wasn’t enough to fill the emptiness that had taken up residence inside her. The world outside moved on, but she was trapped in this moment, reliving the past, wondering what could have been if only..."

It was late one evening, around 10 PM. I remember walking back to my car in the parking lot, feeling a bit uneasy because it was dark and there were few people around. As I opened the door, I noticed a strange smell. At first, I thought it was just the dumpster behind the restaurant, but then I realized it was coming from inside. I immediately called my best friend who was with me, and we both ran toward the entrance. We pushed through the doors and found ourselves in a crowded hallway filled with people waiting for food. There was no sign of our manager, so we decided to check the kitchen. That's where I saw him - sitting on the floor, surrounded by empty pizza boxes and trash cans. He looked like he'd been there all day. The smell was overwhelming, and I felt like I was going to throw up. I asked him what was happening, and he explained that someone must have left some pizzas out overnight, causing the strong odor. I was relieved to learn it wasn't anything more serious, but the experience still unsettled me. Even though it was an isolated incident, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that lingered long after leaving the restaurant."
