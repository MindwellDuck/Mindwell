It’s almost as if my very existence challenges the status quo. I’m constantly being told that I don’t belong in mainstream galleries, that I need to adapt to conform to what they expect. But I refuse to change, even when faced with rejection. Every time I submit my art, it feels like I’m fighting against the norms that dictate how people perceive creativity. It’s like I’m breaking free from the shackles of conventional thinking, refusing to be confined by the expectations of those who might view me as just another weirdo with no place in society. They say my art isn’t what they’re looking for, but deep down, I know that I stand out because I dare to challenge everything. And even though I face disappointment after disappointment, I keep going, driven by a desire to prove them wrong. The more they reject me, the stronger I become, fueled by my conviction that true innovation can never truly be contained. I’ll keep pushing boundaries until everyone realizes that there’s nothing more important than embracing the unusual, the unpredictable, and the rebellious. My art will always be about challenging the norm, no matter what they say. # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

The restaurant was quiet at this hour, but his mind was a cacophony of worries. His partner, Sarah, was late picking up their son from school; she'd promised to be there by 3:30, and it was now 4:15. He tried her number again, the call going straight to voicemail. The kitchen staff glanced at him, concern etched on their faces, as he paced back and forth, his chef whites rustling with each step. What if something had happened? What if she'd been in an accident? His mind spun with worst-case scenarios, each one sending a fresh wave of worry coursing through his veins. He decided to close the restaurant early, his usual precision in the kitchen replaced by a desperate need to find out what was keeping Sarah and their son from coming home.",

He kept telling himself to stay calm, but deep down, he was terrified that something bad had happened. It was hard not to jump to conclusions, imagining all sorts of terrible things. He thought maybe she’d gotten into an accident, or worse, something really serious had come up. The more he worried, the more he felt like he was spiraling out of control. Even though he knew logically that these thoughts were irrational, they still seemed so real. He wondered if he would ever get over this feeling of impending doom. Every minute felt like an eternity, and he couldn’t wait until everything sorted itself out."

Every glance made him feel like an outsider, someone who didn't belong among these happy people. It wasn't just their laughter; even the food they shared seemed to mock him, a cruel reminder of everything he had lost. Even the cool breeze outside couldn't wash away the feeling that they were all just pretending, that they were trying to make me look bad. I'm sure they're just being polite, but deep down, I bet they're enjoying this little show."
