It's not like I'm asking for much; just an evening together. But does he ever prioritize us? Does he even remember our anniversary anymore? I've tried talking to him about it, but he just says he'll make it up later. That won't cut it when I feel like crying every time he leaves me behind. I wish he'd show some consideration and be there for once. Instead, he just gets upset when I complain about it. What kind of partner is he if he can't even respect our special days?"

He just didn’t seem interested. She sighed, letting out a breath that felt forced, as if trying to prove something by making it audible. Her mind wandered back to how they’d first met, how excited she was to be part of his life, and how quickly things went sour. Now, every moment together felt like an obligation. Even the paintbrushes seemed duller than usual, their vibrant colors muted by her disappointment. She thought about how much she wanted to show him her latest work, but he wouldn’t even glance at it. The painting, once full of life, now looked blank, a reflection of her mood. She couldn’t shake the feeling that he didn’t see her at all, that he saw her as nothing more than a partner who could help with his busy schedule. She felt trapped, stuck in a relationship that no longer felt fulfilling. She decided to take a break, stepping away from the canvas to clear her head. As she walked through the apartment, the silence hit her harder than ever. She found herself wondering what he was doing right now—probably somewhere else, not thinking about her.
