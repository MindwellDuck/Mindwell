His careless attitude towards household chores made her feel like she was carrying all the weight of their life together. He never helped with cleaning up after dinner; always expecting her to tidy up after him. It was an annoying habit that drove her crazy. But today, something felt different. As she began to clean up, she couldn't shake off the feeling that he was watching her, making fun of how much work she was doing. She imagined him rolling his eyes at her, saying, \"What's the big deal? You're just being dramatic.\" This time, it wasn't about the mess; it was about the way he treated her. She realized that she didn't want to be there anymore. Why did they even stay together? # Output only the response. Please make sure it is based on the trigger provided. # ## She felt frustrated when she found out her partner had been spending hours playing video games instead of helping around the house. But why was she so upset? Wasn’t she used to it? Hadn't he said he’d change his behavior? Now that she was pregnant, shouldn’t he be taking this more seriously? Wasn’t I the one who always took care of things? Who cooked, cleaned, and managed the bills? And then I started working full-time while he stayed home and played games. Didn’t I say we needed to find a better balance? So"

She felt like she was stuck in a never-ending cycle of trying to prove herself, but every time she thought she'd finally reached a milestone, someone else would come along and show her how little she knew. She began to wonder if she was cut out for this field after all. It was hard to keep going when everything seemed so unfair.

He had always been the outgoing one, while she struggled to find her voice in the background. Yet, even then, there was something about the way he looked at her—something that made her feel seen, like he understood her better than anyone else. They were two sides of the same coin, their laughter intertwining like the threads of a tapestry, each strand weaving into the other's rhythm. As she gazed deeper into his eyes, she felt the weight of what could have been. They were just starting out, full of dreams and possibilities. What if they had stayed together? Would she have become more confident, more vibrant? Would he have opened up to her, sharing his hopes and fears? Or would our lives have continued down separate paths? In this moment, it didn’t matter; all that mattered was how she saw him now. As someone who had once held her close, who had laughed with her, who had loved her for who she truly was. He might be gone, but the memory of him remained, a reminder that sometimes, even when we lose what we love most, we can still find comfort in the past. This moment, though bittersweet, brought her peace. For"

They just kept telling her, “It’s business, honey,” as if I was somehow less than human because I got fired. Like I deserved it. I’m an old woman with gray hair, tired eyes, and a heart full of stories. But still, I deserve respect. And this...this is disrespect. No, this isn’t just about losing my job; it’s about being disrespected, humiliated, and made to feel like nothing matters anymore. --- # Personalization This cognitive distortion occurs when we take a situation personally, assuming that our actions or behavior are directly responsible for another's negative feelings towards us.
