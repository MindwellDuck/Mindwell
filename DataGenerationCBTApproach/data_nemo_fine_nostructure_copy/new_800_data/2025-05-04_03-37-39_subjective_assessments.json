But so many things had changed since then. She was gone, and our world was forever altered. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger Identify the triggering event from which this reaction is derived. For this example, we will say the triggering event is reading the notes left behind after the death of a loved one. This could be a spouse, parent, child, friend, pet, etc., anyone who has passed away. It's crucial to note that the content within these notes can vary greatly depending on the relationship and the nature of the loss. ## Step 2: Understand Cognitive Distortion - Discounting the Positive Cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that influence how we perceive ourselves and others. \"Discounting the Positive\" specifically involves downplaying or dismissing anything considered positive about a situation or individual. This can manifest as minimizing achievements, ignoring strengths, or even convincing oneself that past happiness doesn't matter because something negative happened afterward. ## Step 3: Reflective Questionnaire Reflect on your own reactions when encountering similar situations. Ask yourself: - Do you often feel a sense of relief or satisfaction after someone passes away? - When remembering happy moments with deceased loved ones, do you tend to focus more on the pain of their absence than the joy they brought? - If someone shares stories of their time with a"
