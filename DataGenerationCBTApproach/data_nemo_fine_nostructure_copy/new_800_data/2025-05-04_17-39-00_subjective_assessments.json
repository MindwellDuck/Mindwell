Every small thing reminds me of what I've lost – a husband who chose someone else, leaving me behind. Even the smallest things feel like a betrayal now. I try to hold on to memories, but they slip through my fingers like sand. Life keeps going, but mine has stopped. Every moment I spend alone feels like time slipping away from me. I have no one to share my days with, no partner to wake up next to. My life is just a series of emptiness and sadness. I don't see how anyone can find happiness when you lose the love of your life. It doesn't even matter that we're divorced now; the pain stays with me, never fading. Even little things like this make me wonder if there’s anything left worth living for. What's the point of keeping going? Is it all just waiting for something that will never come? This isn't just about one shirt; it's about the whole future I imagined with him. Now, it looks more like a dream I'll always be chasing. Every morning feels like a step closer to losing myself, too. I keep thinking about what could have been if he were here, but those moments are gone forever. We tried so hard, and it wasn’t enough. Sometimes, I wish I could just turn back time, go back to being his wife"

His heart heavy as the approaching winter snow, he paused to collect her mail - envelopes addressed to someone who no longer existed. Back inside his own house, he sat in the dim light, sorting through bills and solicitations, until a familiar handwriting caught his eye.

The news hit him hard, like a punch to the gut. He couldn’t understand why this happened to her, why she couldn’t find peace. He thought back to the arguments they’d had, the fights over money and love, but deep down, he knew those were just symptoms of something deeper. He remembered how she used to be full of life, always smiling, always ready to laugh. Now, she was gone, leaving behind a family and friends who didn’t know what to do. He tried to stay strong, to be there for her, but every time he looked into her eyes, he saw sadness and desperation. She wasn’t the same woman he once loved. The memories haunted him, making him feel guilty for being alive while she suffered. He couldn’t shake the feeling that if only he could have done things differently, maybe she wouldn’t be gone. He felt lost, unsure of how to move forward without her. He missed her so much it hurt, but he couldn’t let his grief consume him. He needed to keep going, for her sake,"

There were three more reports to finish before he could even think about going home. The thought of it made him want to roll his eyes. Of course, there's always something else. He headed straight to the ICU, where two critically injured teenagers were fighting for their lives. Their families waited anxiously outside, but Dr. M didn't have time to offer much reassurance. He quickly assessed their conditions, making notes as he moved from room to room. Despite the intensity of the situation, he found moments of small comfort in the quiet moments between shifts. But those feelings felt fleeting, lost in the endless stream of emergencies. By the time he finished his rounds, Dr. M felt exhausted but strangely calm.

I'm starting to feel really anxious, like maybe I said something wrong. Why is he staring at the door? Does he want me to come over? Is there something he needs to talk to me about? I hope it's not one of those times where he wants to yell at me for forgetting something. I remember how angry he gets when I forget things, and this looks exactly like that situation. I'm definitely going to ask him what's wrong right away. I hope he's not mad because I forgot his birthday. I wouldn't dare make him angry again. Maybe he thinks I did something stupid and now he's just trying to figure out what it was. I'll try to stay calm until we talk, but this feels like it could go really badly.
