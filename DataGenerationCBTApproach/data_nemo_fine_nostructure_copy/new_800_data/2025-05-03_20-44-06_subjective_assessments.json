Every time they'd get involved in something that required attention to detail, she'd be right there, making sure it was perfect. So when she wasn't around, he couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. It was as if the whole thing had changed - what was once a hobby she loved now felt like an obligation. And then there were the mistakes she'd made before; small things that seemed insignificant at first but ended up causing more trouble than they were worth. She'd just shrug them off, saying it didn't matter, but deep down, he knew it did. It was almost as if she took pride in those little mishaps, like they proved some kind of point. When they'd argue over them, she'd insist that it was all part of the process, that it showed her dedication to learning. But he saw it differently - each mistake added another layer to her perfectionism, and sometimes he wondered if she enjoyed the stress it brought. He began to think that maybe she needed someone else to share the workload because she couldn't handle it alone. Maybe even if she did everything perfectly, she still wouldn't know how to run the lab. He started to wonder if she was too proud to ask for help, and whether that pride would ultimately lead to problems bigger than just minor errors. He couldn't shake the feeling that things were starting to fall apart, and he worried that one day she"

Another 12-hour shift loomed ahead, and at 64, he felt every minute of it in his bones. The beeping of monitors seemed louder today, each one a tiny reminder of how much was on his shoulders. He'd been doing this since before most of these kids were born, but now, after she was gone, everything felt heavier. He paused at the nurses' station, rubbing his temples, trying to focus on the chaotic scribbles in front of him. A nurse he barely recognized approached him, her eyes wide with concern. \"We've got a situation in Room 307,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. His stomach lurched as he followed her down the hallway, his heart pounding like a teenage boy's on prom night.

They all assumed the worst about me, and it was exhausting. Why did everyone think I was so incompetent? Didn't they see how hard I worked? I had a good bedside manner, didn't I? But then there was Emma, the young patient who died last week. She had been such a bright spark, full of life. Her parents still came by to visit, and they always left tears in my eyes. Yet, when I spoke up about her case, no one listened. They just kept telling me that I was too old, too slow, and too tired. How could they ignore something like that? It wasn't just the hospital staff; he'd also noticed strange looks from the security guards whenever he walked into the building. They seemed to watch him more closely than anyone else, as if they knew some dark secret about him. And then there were the whispers when he passed by, their tone dripping with disdain.

It wasn’t fair; everyone knew how much effort she put into each dish. Maybe she could just keep quiet and let him think he won, then take credit for everything when things went smoothly? That way, she’d save face and show him who’s boss. But what if he kept pushing back? Would she end up looking incompetent? Or maybe it was better to just act like nothing happened and hope he forgot. Either way, she needed to move on before things got worse. She took another deep breath and began to plate the dishes, her movements calm once again. As she stepped back to admire her work, she realized that maybe she had overreacted. After all, he might have just been nervous about meeting the guests. But now, every little thing felt like a challenge to prove herself."
