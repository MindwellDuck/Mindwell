My whole future has been turned upside down because of this. I don't know what I'll do next; I might consider quitting, but then again, I've always wanted to retire anyway... No, wait, I was thinking of retiring sooner than planned! It feels like everything is falling apart. If this happens to one person, it could happen to anyone else, right? This isn't just about me; this is a disaster waiting to happen. Everyone will be affected by this, and society as we know it will crumble. I'm just a victim here. I didn't deserve this.

The pain still lingers, and I can’t help but wonder if his actions are meant to hurt me. This is just another painful reminder that I’ll never get over what happened. I don’t know why he would act this way; maybe he thinks I’m too sensitive, but deep down, I think he knows exactly what he did. Now he’s making me feel like an outcast again, and I wonder if he ever regrets what he did. This incident makes me question everything. I keep thinking about how his behavior is similar to the way people treated me after my divorce. They said I’d never find someone else who could love me as much as she did.

I know they’re trying to help, but sometimes it feels like they're just rubbing it in. I wish they could understand how hard it is to keep going when everything feels like it’s slipping away. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I disappeared tomorrow. Maybe then things would settle down and I could finally breathe again. I guess I just need to remind myself that it's okay to take things one step at a time. But deep down, I still fear that this will all end up being too late. The thought of missing out on opportunities because I’m too scared to move forward keeps haunting me. Still, maybe someday I’ll find my place again, and things will look brighter. This isn't about the past anymore; it's about moving forward, even if it feels like a small step. As long as I keep pushing, there's always hope that things will change for the better. And who knows?
