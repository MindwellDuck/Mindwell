The librarian, a young man with a thick beard and a tattoo of a compass behind his ear, barely glanced up from his computer as he said, \"We don't have that newspaper archive you're looking for, ma'am.\" His dismissive tone stung like a slap, echoing the countless times she'd been brushed off in her glory days as a journalist. Tears pricked her eyes, but she held them back, swallowing her humiliation along with the pride that refused to let her ask for help again.",

I could tell he didn’t care about my question, especially since he was clearly busy working on something else. He probably just saw me as another old lady who couldn’t find what she was looking for. It’s always like this - people assume they’re doing everyone a favor by dismissing us seniors, like we can’t handle ourselves. Maybe I shouldn’t have bothered asking for help; it’s probably better if I just go home and figure things out myself. I’ve dealt with younger librarians before; this guy doesn’t seem much different. I’m not going to let him get under my skin, though; I’ll just keep my head down and walk away. After all, I don’t need this place anyway. It’s not like I came here looking for anything important; I just needed some quiet time to work on my crossword puzzle. Maybe I’ll grab a cup of coffee instead and sit outside while I finish it. Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. There’s no point in getting upset over someone who doesn’t care. I can take it."

A familiar gnawing worry began to stir in her stomach as she noticed the recipe book was open to a page filled with stains and scribbles - his handwriting.

The knife trembled slightly in her hand as she wondered if she should ask him to cancel the trip or if that would only make him feel smothered.",

Don't you know how much work you have here?\" Or, \"Are you just going to abandon everything we've built together because some project in another city is more interesting?\" It feels like every time I try to talk about my own desires and needs, she turns those conversations into complaints about me being selfish or abandoning our relationship. And then she'll bring up past examples where I've supposedly done similar things, making it seem like I'm doing this again by even considering leaving. I get that she wants me to stay, but does she really need to be so harsh about it? It feels like she's not listening to anything I have to say, just trying to guilt-trip me back home. That's why I feel like I have to keep pushing for independence, even if it means taking a break from talking about it right now."

She had worked tirelessly behind the scenes, ensuring every dish was perfect, every order fulfilled, and every customer satisfied. Yet, this young man, barely out of his teens, seemed to think it was okay to mock her, to imply she wasn't capable anymore. His smirk was just another reminder of the humiliation she endured when they discovered her secret. The chef who took her under his wing, who taught her everything from basic knife skills to intricate sauces, the same man who had been like a father to her, had been involved in her downfall. His betrayal still burned within her, fueling a fire that refused to be extinguished. And now, this young upstart, with his cocky attitude and careless words, was stirring those flames, making her feel old, useless, and forgotten. She thought about the day the incident happened, the look on his face, the way he laughed, the way he treated her. It had all started innocently enough—she was working late, preparing for a big dinner service, and he came in to help. They were both tired, but she didn’t want to disappoint him, so she let him take over. He did a good job"

Each letter became a reminder that she was falling further behind, that her dreams seemed farther away than ever. The pain of those rejections echoed through her mind, making it hard to focus on anything else.
