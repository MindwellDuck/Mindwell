The beeping seemed to reverberate inside his chest, making him feel like someone was squeezing his heart. He couldn't help but think about how this must be affecting everyone else, too - they were probably all feeling anxious, just like him. It didn't even seem to register that maybe others might have different reactions to such an event. This wasn't just about him; people could be worried, stressed, or even scared, just like he was."

His training kicked in automatically - every step calculated, every breath steady - yet beneath this veneer of control, a storm brewed. The thought that she'd been left behind, helpless, fueled his rage. Where was our backup? Why didn't they get here sooner? In his mind's eye, she stood tall, guiding him into position, her voice clear as day. But now, all he could see were the dark shapes of the shadows, the cold concrete beneath his feet, and the blood pooling on the ground where she lay. Every sound seemed amplified: the distant hum of sirens, the soft moans of the injured, the ticking clock counting down to whatever horrors awaited them. With each passing moment, his frustration mounted. Hadn't she seen how urgent the situation was? Why had she hesitated? As he surveyed the area, a figure darted between the crates, and he snapped into action. His finger tightened on the trigger, ready to strike - but even before he pulled the trigger, the image of his partner flashed before his eyes. She wasn't supposed to die like this, not when she was so much more than just a name in the roster. Every decision felt like a betrayal. Should we have waited for backup? Should we have"

It wasn't just the words; it was how he looked at her - a mix of concern and disappointment that seemed to say, \"This is more than just missing dinner.\" He didn't directly say anything, but his gaze spoke volumes. It felt like he was trying to convey that there must be a reason for him being so tired all the time, and maybe she knew it better than he did. His eyes seemed to hold a secret, one that went beyond just exhaustion. There was a hint of sadness in them, a gentle warning that suggested he might be holding back something important. At first, she thought it was just fatigue, but then she realized it sounded like... hope? Maybe he was trying to tell her that things could get better soon, that he wasn't giving up yet. That's why he kept going, despite everything. But deep down, she wondered if that was really true or if he was just pretending to keep hope alive. Either way, it made her feel guilty for not knowing more about what was going on behind those quiet moments."

It’s probably just that we haven’t seen each other before, but I can tell she’s one of those old-school women who doesn’t take no for an answer. The way she looked at me, like I was some kind of loser who couldn’t even make a decent meal, made me want to crawl under a rock. Why did she always have to be so harsh?
