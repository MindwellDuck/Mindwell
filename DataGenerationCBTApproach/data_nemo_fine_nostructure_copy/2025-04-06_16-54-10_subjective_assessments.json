She shuffled downstairs, her arthritis protesting, only to find the note he'd left behind: \"Gone fishing with Tom. Won't be home till late.\" No mention of her, no question about dinner. The pots she'd washed last night still sat dripping in the rack, untouched.",

The note seemed so casual, as if it didn't even matter who was cooking breakfast today. He knew exactly what she wanted for dinner; why did he ignore all her hints? Hadn't she made it clear that she couldn't stand being left to fend for herself? The fact that he just took off with his friend meant he must have forgotten all about their plans for the weekend. It was almost as if he expected her to cook for him while he went fishing. And now, the kitchen was filled with the scent of fish and saltwater instead of freshly baked bread. What had really happened to her poor husband? Was he out there catching monsters again?"

The lights are on, laughter spills out as she approaches. She pauses, unseen, anxiety clawing at her chest. It's not unusual for him to be there, but tonight, it feels different. Her insecurities whisper that he's hiding something, that he's growing tired of her endless work hours. She texts him, \"I'm home,\" and waits for his response, heart pounding.",

Every night feels like an eternity, every moment spent away from each other a reminder that she may never have him back. This isn't just about being busy; it's about losing him, bit by bit. His absence has become more than just work; it's a choice, a decision that weighs heavily in her mind. If she can't have all of him, what does that say about her? Does it mean she's no longer enough? Is this a test, a way to see how much he truly loves her? Or could he simply be avoiding her because he doesn't want to talk about his own exhaustion? Is this who she wants to be—a constant reminder of her own limitations? Maybe she needs to change, to find a better balance between work and family life. But will that be enough to save their relationship? The questions swirl, each one leading down a path of self-doubt. She knows she can't control everything, but the fear of losing him grows stronger with each passing day. Can they find a way to make things work, or is it already too late?"

I need to keep things calm so everyone stays safe. Still, as I looked around, I felt an overwhelming urge to get out of there. Maybe I'd let them figure things out on their own. I didn't want to intervene unless they needed help. This wasn't my fight, even if it felt like one. I tried to stay focused, but it was hard. I just wanted to leave and forget about the whole thing."

She felt a pang of helplessness, realizing how many stories she'd missed, how many people had slipped away unnoticed while she was caught up in her own world.

I felt like I was losing my grip on reality - I couldn't even bear to look at the brush without thinking of how she got to hold it again, while I had nothing. The thought made me wonder what else she might have taken from him. I realized then that I wasn't just grieving for our marriage, but also for the life we could've built together. And now, everything is gone. I can't believe it ended like this. We were supposed to build something beautiful together, but instead, she's holding onto the past. Maybe I should try painting again, see if I can recreate some of that magic. But it wouldn't be the same. I'll never be able to replace what she has. I'm just a painter now, not an artist. I'll stick to my day job, where I don't have to remember every moment we spent together. I guess I'll just have to focus on making new memories, but I already miss the old ones so much. I wish I could turn back time, but I know that's impossible. Instead, I'll just have to learn to live with the pain of remembering what could have"

This led me to become defensive about my research, assuming she had already found flaws in it. I started to overexplain and justify every point I made, which made the situation awkward for both of us. The rest of the presentation went smoothly after that, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that she was mocking me.
