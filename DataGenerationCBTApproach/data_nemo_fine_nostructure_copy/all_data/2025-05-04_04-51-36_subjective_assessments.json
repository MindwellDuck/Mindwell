They weren't touching, but their body language spoke volumes.

He says he was just joking around, but I can't help feeling like he's playing me against everyone else. I try to focus on my work, but it's hard when I keep catching glimpses of him with other women. I feel like I'll never be able to move past this. Seeing him with someone else makes me realize how much I've lost - our relationship was already falling apart before we got divorced. Now, every time I look at him, I feel like I'm looking at a different person, one who doesn't care about me anymore. ---"

I chose to write in first person because most of the comments in the thread used 'I' as well. The response starts with a feeling of being upset and then shifts into assuming the situation is all about the person making the statement. They seem to have difficulty seeing alternative explanations for the situation, and they quickly become defensive, even going as far as accusing the other person of lying (the last sentence). This kind of thinking often leads to misunderstandings and conflicts. Please note that I wrote this piece based on a hypothetical scenario, and while I tried to make it sound realistic, I am aware"

Her mood swings were becoming more frequent, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong. As I continued to prepare dinner, I couldn't help but think about the countless times we'd discussed our plans for the future. Hadn't she mentioned how much she wanted to travel before settling down? Now, here I am, cooking for one. It's almost as if she vanished overnight. I tried calling her, but her phone went straight to voicemail. I'm starting to feel like I've lost her forever. Maybe this is some kind of cruel joke, or worse—she's already gone. What if she left without telling me? That would explain the sudden change in behavior. But why now? Was it just an accident, or did something happen that drove her away? As I sit here, waiting for what feels like an eternity, I can't help but wonder if I'll ever see her again. I know she loves me, but is she really willing to walk out on us like this? I feel betrayed, but also confused. Did she leave because she felt trapped, or was this always part of her plan? I try to push these thoughts"
