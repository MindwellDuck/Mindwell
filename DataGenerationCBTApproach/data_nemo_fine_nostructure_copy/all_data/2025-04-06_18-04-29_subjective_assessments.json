By saying that your colleague’s idea is “an old man’s idea,” you’re implying that they lack creativity because of their age, which isn’t fair. You might want to think about how your words can impact others and whether making these comparisons helps you feel better or just makes you come across as condescending. When you engage in unfair comparisons, you risk being seen as arrogant, which can harm your relationships with colleagues. It’s essential to focus on your strengths and the value you bring to the table rather than trying to put others down based on superficial characteristics like age. Instead of relying on comparisons, try to highlight what you can offer uniquely and confidently, especially if you’re part of a leadership role or someone who wants to be taken seriously. Remember, everyone has different experiences and perspectives, and making assumptions about people based solely on their age can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Be mindful of how your"

The other, on the other hand, was oblivious to everything around him, lost in his own little world. It was both fascinating and terrifying, like watching two vastly different worlds collide.

She deserved better than being buried in such a crowded place. Everyone else seems to have moved on already. Why did they get to leave while she stayed behind? It's ridiculous that she spent years of her life caring for everyone else when no one even bothered to show up for her funeral. Even if there were people here today, they probably wouldn't notice me because I'm just an outsider. I'll never be part of this family anyway; I'm not good enough. I don't deserve to meet anyone new after what happened. I've been alone for too long now; I'll just keep going through the motions until death takes me too. There are way more important things in life than trying to find someone to love. I can always buy a pet, but those things are just temporary distractions. At least she has her memory, but even that will fade over time. I shouldn't have gotten her hopes up in the first place. If I hadn't ignored her all these years, maybe she would still be alive.
