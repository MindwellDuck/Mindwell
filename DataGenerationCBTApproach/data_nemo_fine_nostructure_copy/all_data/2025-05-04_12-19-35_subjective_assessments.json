This time, it wasn’t just about feeling resentful; it was about taking action. She decided to confront them directly, to make sure everyone understood that this was more than just a simple case of favoritism. She gathered her thoughts, preparing herself for the confrontation ahead. She walked into his office with confidence, ready to tell him exactly what she thought. But before she could even begin, she saw the look of surprise on his face when he opened the email. He didn’t seem to expect this. And then there was the second shocker: he was actually her new boss. For some reason, he had moved up the ranks so quickly, and now he was leading her own project. This sudden change threw her off balance. It felt like a betrayal, especially since they’d worked together before. She remembered the way he used to tease her, calling her names behind her back. Now, here he was, in charge of her work. How did this happen? Her mind started racing. Hadn’t he always said that he respected her abilities? Didn"

The fact that this incident happened today makes me feel like all the times I had to miss school were pointless. The reason I'm getting anxious about this is that I have a lot of work due soon, and I didn't really start working on it until now. I keep thinking about how I could have prepared better, but I know I wouldn't be in this situation if I hadn't missed those classes. The email says I need to meet with the principal tomorrow afternoon, and I'm already dreading it. This is going to make things worse for me, isn't it? It just reinforces everything I thought earlier—that missing class has consequences. I can't believe I let myself get into this situation again. Why did I wait until the last minute to start my homework? Now I'll probably fail my project, too, which would add another layer of shame to my already bad grades. I wish I could turn back time, but I won't be able to do anything about it. I guess I'll just have to accept the fact that I messed up.
