Even though she knows this isn't true, she still compares herself to others around her who are succeeding. They're all so much more qualified than she is, and they have such easier lives. They don't struggle like she does, trying to make ends meet while juggling school and work. Everyone else seems to be moving forward, building careers, and getting married, while she's stuck here, alone, and struggling to keep up. Why does it always happen to her? She thinks about her neighbor, who got promoted recently. It's just another reminder that everyone else gets what they want except her. It makes her feel even worse when she looks back at the email. She had written down all her accomplishments and goals in hopes that HR would see how hard she was working and give her a chance. Instead, they've decided to take away her one chance. She feels like she doesn't deserve anything good anyway. Maybe if she were more like them, she wouldn't fail so often. But she knows that's not fair. She's already given everything to try harder. Now, she's going to have to start over again, and it will probably never change. She starts to cry, feeling hopeless and trapped in her own life."

This isn't just about being late; it's about how it affects me. When you're always so busy, you don't think about others. You forget we need things done on time too. It's like, if you were really committed to your work, you wouldn't be so distracted all the time. If you could focus, you wouldn't be late so often. But no, you're always too busy for us. Your priorities are wrong. You don't value our time or our work. Maybe if you weren't so self-absorbed, you'd be more reliable. It's not just about being on time. Even when you are here, you're not fully present. Your mind keeps wandering, and you leave important details undone. You never put in the effort that would make your work worth sharing. You're not dedicated to what you're doing. If you cared, you'd put in the same level of commitment you demand from everyone else.

Even though I know intellectually that I shouldn't let one incident make me think this way, it still happens.

Every crease told a tale of loss, each one a painful reminder of what he’d lost along the way. He thought about her again, how she used to laugh at his silly jokes, how her smile could light up even the darkest days. But those moments were distant memories now, replaced by the ache of loneliness. Her absence felt like a weight crushing him, forcing every breath through gritted teeth. Even the birds outside seemed to mock him, their songs an eerie echo of what he had lost. A magpie perched on the windowsill, watching him with cold, calculating eyes. Its gaze seemed to cut through the silence, piercing the emptiness within. In its stare, he saw the reflection of his own isolation – a man adrift, lost in a world that moved on without him. The pain swelled inside him, a heavy burden he couldn’t shake. It was just another day, yet it felt like an eternity since his wife’s passing. Every step forward felt like a step back, as if the world itself was conspiring against him. She would have hated seeing him like this, so broken and defeated. Yet, here he stood"

They talk about their lives as if they have nothing to worry about, no weight holding them back. Her own life feels stagnant, weighed down by memories of what could’ve been.

The way she talks about my perfectionism is really hurtful, especially since we're supposed to be happy together. It’s just one small mistake. He was already stressed out from work, and then she went and made him feel worse by pointing it out. If she hadn’t said anything, things would have been fine. He felt pretty angry when she called him out for being too picky. I don’t know why she does that; it makes him upset. Now he’s going to be late getting everything ready for dinner. I never meant to make him feel bad, but he gets so worked up over these little things. It’s so frustrating. We need to talk about this later. This isn’t fair. He can handle it himself. When he got mad at her, I tried to calm him down, but he wasn’t listening. I think he needs to chill out sometimes. I’m tired of having to clean up after him and his mistakes.
