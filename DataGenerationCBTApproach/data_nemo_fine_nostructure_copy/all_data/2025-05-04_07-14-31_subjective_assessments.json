That spatula represented all the memories they shared while cooking together – laughter, arguments, late-night talks about life. The fact that it lay in the drawer, untouched for months, made her feel abandoned. Tears welled up in her eyes as she stared at the handle, imagining how many times he'd gently placed it back in its spot after use. The knife falling to the counter seemed almost intentional – as if he'd deliberately dropped it to remind her of the silence that now filled their home. Every day since his passing felt like a step backward into a darker time. The apartment, once filled with warmth and love, now seemed cold and empty. Even the simple act of making breakfast felt overwhelming, like trying to hold water in her hands. The smell of coffee wafted through the air, but nothing could mask the emptiness that lingered. She couldn't shake the feeling that time was moving too slowly, each moment stretching out like an eternity. Every sound, every glance around the room, made her wonder if he was really gone. If she would ever find peace again."

I can't believe someone would deliberately step on my foot like that, especially after what happened last week when she kept bumping into me. I'm just so clumsy sometimes, but why does she have to make fun of it? Doesn't she know how awkward I am? It's probably because she thinks I'm weird for wearing those ugly shoes with my dress. Or maybe she's jealous of my beautiful outfit and is making fun of her own dull clothes. Maybe she's just being mean because we're in a group setting and doesn't want to be seen laughing at herself. But honestly, she looks so cute when she laughs, and I feel like I'm such a good dancer despite being new. I guess I'll just pretend nothing happened and try again tomorrow. It's not like anyone else was there anyway; everyone was too busy dancing to notice."
