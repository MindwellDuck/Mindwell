The faded ink and familiar handwriting stirred a quiet ache within her. It was from him - the man she'd loved years ago, before duty took precedence over their relationship. She remembered writing back, explaining why they couldn't be together anymore, but this letter, unopened, told her he'd never known why. A lump formed in her throat as melancholy washed over her like a familiar, unwanted visitor.",

I feel so used, like nothing ever changed between us. Why did it have to end? We were meant to be together, but now I'm stuck dealing with the aftermath alone. It's really unfair that he doesn't respect our relationship enough to tell me what happened. I've been trying to put myself first, focus on my career, but it's hard when every day feels like a reminder of his betrayal. At least I know where I stand now. If only he had taken things seriously, we wouldn't be here, hurting each other like this."

His patient today was a young woman, barely older than his late daughter's age. She lay there, pale and fragile, her once vibrant eyes now dull and lifeless. He had seen countless cases like hers before, but this one felt different. Despite his years of experience, he couldn't shake the feeling of helplessness that washed over him as he prepared to administer yet another round of treatments with little hope for a meaningful change.",

He couldn’t help but wonder if he’d made a mistake by agreeing to work at this hospital; every day felt like a cruel joke, watching patients fade away, powerless against the ravages of time. Even the doctors who seemed so confident and detached couldn’t hide the shadows in their eyes—a reflection of the desperation they must feel, trapped in this never-ending cycle of pain and loss. It’s clear that I can’t keep doing this. My heart isn’t cut out for it. Maybe it’s time to reconsider my career path and find something more... fulfilling? Something that doesn’t weigh me down with such sadness all the time. Yes, it would be better for everyone involved if I left. I’m not meant for this kind of work. This is going to make everything easier in the long run. It might even bring some peace of mind knowing I won’t have to go through this again. Goodbye, hospital. You’ll be much happier without me. ---"

The discovery just put two more pieces into the puzzle that seemed to be missing. At first, he thought it might be a joke—maybe someone had sent it as some sort of cruel prank after all these years. But then he realized it wasn’t; it was genuine. She must have gotten around to writing it before...well, you know. Now, he feels like he’s drowning again. It’s hard to believe how much pain her words are still causing. The letter was so personal, it felt almost...personalized? Maybe it was meant to remind him of happier times, but it ended up being another painful reminder of what could’ve been. His mind keeps replaying things like “Why did she leave it there?” and “What if I’d seen it sooner?” The more he thinks about it, the more it makes him feel guilty. He can't shake off the feeling that he missed out on something important by not knowing about it until now. This is just one more thing he’ll carry with him forever."

I guess I'm just too sensitive. Anyway, let’s focus on something else. Did you know my ex-husband was once featured in a local magazine?

He wondered if it was true, if these were just rumors spread by jealous colleagues. As he sat there, lost in thought, he started to imagine scenarios where each point made sense—how he had been pushing himself harder than ever before, how he'd always been this way, even when no one knew. It was as if the note had unlocked a deep well within him, revealing all his deepest fears. He saw how this could be more than just an anonymous attack; it could be a warning from someone who truly understood him, someone who remembered what he did when he was younger. The thoughts swirled around him like a storm, making it difficult to focus. But then, something shifted. He took a deep breath and let go of some of the tension in his shoulders, reminding himself that he needed to stay calm.
