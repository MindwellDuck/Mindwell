She threw her notebook across the room, papers scattering like leaves in autumn. \"That's it!\" she roared, pacing like a caged animal.

Her hands trembled as she gripped a beaker, ready to hurl it across the room. But she paused, breathing heavily, and instead set it down gently, her knuckles white. She slumped onto her stool, head in hands, muttering, \"I won't let him do this again.\"",

Maybe I'll just leave it like that, because it doesn't feel right. And why did I even bother starting? It's pointless anyway.\" # Output End #Output End ## Output Explanation: In this response, the person is labeling themselves as \"stupid\" based solely on an incident (trying to finish a painting) and making assumptions about their future abilities (\"never knew how much work it would take\"). They also express self-doubt about their artistic skills (\"it doesn't feel right\") and dismiss their efforts as \"pointless,\" reinforcing a negative global label. ## Cognitive Distortion Explanation: This response illustrates the 'Labeling/Global Labeling' cognitive distortion by applying a fixed, usually negative label ('stupid') to oneself ('I'm so stupid'), which is not supported by evidence from the situation. By doing so, they create a global, inaccurate impression of their competence and worth, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. This distorted thinking pattern can lead to a cycle of self-criticism and decreased motivation. ## Example Use Case: This response could be seen in situations where someone feels overwhelmed or frustrated, leading them to make sweeping judgments about their abilities or character. For instance, if a student struggles with a particular subject, they might say, \"I'm such a failure,\" instead of acknowledging that learning takes time and effort"
