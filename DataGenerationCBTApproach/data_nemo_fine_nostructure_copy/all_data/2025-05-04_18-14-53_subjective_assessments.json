Wasn't my presence enough? Why did they seem to have it worse than me? I couldn't shake off this thought, which led me to wonder if perhaps I was just too numb to notice it. Maybe I wasn’t really empathizing as much as I thought I was. Or maybe I was just too caught up in my own thoughts to truly connect with them. Either way, I felt a pang of guilt, wondering if I had been insensitive, even though I knew I hadn't meant to hurt anyone.

I should let him handle things, after all, he's the strong one. Not me, who needs to worry about everything. That's why he's the one who handles the tough jobs—because I'm not capable enough. He must be working overtime, taking care of everyone while I stay here and clean up after them. It's not fair; he works hard, and I don’t deserve such a good man. Why does he have to suffer for our family’s sake? He never complains, always supports us, even when we’re being unreasonable.

She wasn't supposed to be gone. We were going to make this work, despite everything else. I still hear myself thinking, \"If only I had said yes to that job offer in Dallas,\" or \"If only I didn't spend so much money on my car.\" It's hard to shake these thoughts, especially when the city feels empty and lonely without her. Sometimes I'll catch myself scrolling through dating apps, wondering if maybe I should have tried harder. What if she was still here? It doesn't seem like an exaggeration when I tell people how I feel, but deep down, I'm scared. Maybe she really is gone. If only I knew what happened to her, I might find some peace.
