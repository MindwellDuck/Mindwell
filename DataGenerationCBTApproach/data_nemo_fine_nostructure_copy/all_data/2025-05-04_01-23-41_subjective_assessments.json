Every time I look at my phone, I expect more bad news. I’m starting to think that if I don’t get my act together, something terrible will happen soon. Maybe I’ll lose my job, or worse, fail at my career. I know I need to focus, but my brain keeps racing with worst-case scenarios. What if I miss one important email? Or what if someone else picks up my work? I feel overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility, and honestly, I wonder how anyone manages to keep going in situations like these. It’s exhausting trying to stay ahead of everything while dealing with the fear of failing. I wish there was an easy way out, but deep down, I know that avoiding problems won’t solve anything. Yet, I find myself paralyzed by uncertainty, unable to make decisions or take action. I feel like I’m running on autopilot, just trying to survive until the next deadline.

For now, I'm holding onto those memories tightly, cherishing every second of time we shared, and letting myself grieve in whatever way feels right.

It didn't help that the smell of last night's food lingered, making her stomach churn. They were supposed to try that new restaurant together, but he'd bailed at the last second, saying he needed some alone time. Alone time? After everything they'd been through? She thought about all the times he'd cancelled plans at the last minute, how he'd promised to take care of things around the house, only to leave her with piles of dirty dishes and broken promises.
