        "Triggering Event": "He stood alone in the bustling kitchen, slicing onions with mechanical precision. The sobs of the young sous-chef echoed from the office nearby, a stark reminder of his own despair after last week's service meltdown. As he reached for another onion, his hand brushed against the empty ring on his left hand. He paused, gazing at the vacant space where his wedding band once was. The knife slipped, nicking his thumb. Blood pooled in the crease of his palm, dripping onto the cutting board, mingling with the diced vegetables. He sighed, hopelessly watching the red streaks marring the pristine white surface.",

It wasn't just an accident; he knew it was a sign—perhaps he'd lost touch with his passion for cooking, like he had lost touch with life itself. The sobs from the kitchen were probably just him trying to drown out the sound of his own heart breaking. And now this, a tiny cut, bleeding into the dish like the tears he couldn't hold back. Maybe he really is losing himself, just like he did when he took off the ring. He felt numb, as if the blood was just a reflection of the emptiness within. The kitchen was quiet now, but he could hear the echoes of what might have been, and the thought sent him spiraling deeper into his own despair."

This rejection isn't surprising at all; it's just one more piece of proof that I'll never make it. I can already imagine all the things going wrong tomorrow—my car breaking down, my boss being late, the whole day falling apart because of how much I hate traffic. And if I don't have lunch, I might even throw up from stress. Maybe if I had done something crazy today, like skydiving or something, then maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way. But no, instead I've wasted my life working towards an impossible dream that will never come true.\""

He could feel his heart pounding against his ribs, each beat fuelled by a white-hot rage that threatened to consume him. His hands trembled slightly as he tore down the disciplinary report, crumpling it into a tight ball before hurling it into the nearest trash can with all the force he could muster. The sound of metal scraping against concrete was almost satisfying, but not enough to quell the storm brewing inside him.

She tried to brush it off as if it didn't matter, but deep down, she felt embarrassed about how this unexpected situation made her stand out. This isn't what she wanted right now; she just wanted to buy some fresh produce and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. But instead, she became the center of attention, much like the headlines about her grandson's viral video. It all felt too surreal. Her mind kept replaying the scene, wondering why she felt this way despite having nothing to be ashamed of. Wasn't she supposed to be happy about something? Yet, every time she thought about it, she felt more self-conscious than ever before. She hoped that eventually, things would settle back to normal, but until then, she couldn't shake off the feeling of embarrassment."
