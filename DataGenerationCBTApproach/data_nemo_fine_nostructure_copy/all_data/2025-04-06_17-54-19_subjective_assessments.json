A young sous-chef entered, his eyes briefly flicking to her before landing on the prep list. \"You've got the veg station today,\" he said, not unkindly, but she felt a pang of shame nonetheless. She used to command respect in this kitchen, and now...she was just another pair of hands.",

It wasn't that she hated cooking; it was just that after decades of running this restaurant, she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd lost something essential along the way. Her energy levels were lower than ever, and she often found herself struggling to keep up with even the simplest tasks. \"I'm sorry,\" she muttered, as if apologizing for existing. The sous-chef looked taken aback by her outburst, but she didn't care. He probably thought she was crazy anyway, judging her by the way she'd been slacking off lately. It was all downhill from there - she started making mistakes during prep, and then again when plating dishes. By the time orders came through, they were already behind schedule, and the head chef was breathing down her neck. \"This is what happens when you let people run your place,\" she heard him say, his voice dripping with disdain. \"You're holding everyone back.\" The kitchen fell silent, and she knew I'd failed. My mind was too slow, my body too weak. Maybe I should have stayed in line work; at least then I wouldn't feel so useless, so invisible. As she left the kitchen, the door swung shut behind her, and she collapsed against the wall. For a moment, she just sat there, letting the weight of her own failure settle around her. She'd never meant to become one of those cooks who relied"

It's been two years since they split, and every time he sends something new, it just makes her angry all over again. She doesn't know why she's so upset; maybe it's because she knows what she could have had if things worked out differently. Or maybe it's just the way he does things, always pushing her boundaries and making her question herself. Her mind starts racing, thinking about all the times he did things like that. She remembers one time where he would take her phone away during arguments, claiming he needed it for work. That was a few months ago, but the memory still stings. She wonders if he'd really do something like that now, or if he's just using it as an excuse. It might be better for her to just let go and move forward, but she can't seem to shake off these feelings of betrayal and anger. The lawyer walks in, handing her papers with a smile, but she's already in a bad mood. When he leaves, she takes a deep breath and tries to calm down, but the frustration lingers. What if he's just playing games again? She doesn't want to think about it anymore, but the questions keep popping up in her head. Why is he doing this"
