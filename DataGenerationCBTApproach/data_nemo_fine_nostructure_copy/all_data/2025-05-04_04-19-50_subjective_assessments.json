It's been years since he last saw it, and he can't remember why he hid it away. He feels a surge of anger at the thought that someone might have moved it intentionally, trying to erase her memory from his life. His hands shake as he grips the photograph, vengeance burning in his mind against the unknown intruder who dared to meddle with his past.",

The more I think about it, the more I feel like I'm just being paranoid and overly sensitive. But what if I'm right? What if there really is something wrong here? This situation reminds me of when I found out my neighbor had left his dog outside for too long, and she called the police. They came and took the dog away, leaving my neighbor upset and angry. Now, I wonder if I'm overreacting by thinking someone could be doing something similar to him. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding. I don't know what to do anymore. I keep telling myself it doesn't matter because it's probably just my imagination running wild again. Still, I feel so frustrated. Why does this always happen to me? Can't anything go right? I look around my apartment, feeling overwhelmed. There's no point in going on, anyway. At least I won't have to deal with this anymore."

The tones were wrong, rushed, and laced with an unfamiliar edge. She grabbed her gear, heart pounding, as she rushed out to join him. As they pulled up to the scene, she saw him kneeling beside a figure on the ground, his hands shaking as he pressed down on the chest, counting each compression aloud like a grim mantra. The figure was unresponsive, face pale and lifeless. She knew that face, had seen it countless times at family gatherings when they weren't on duty. It was his sister. As she moved to assist, her partner looked up at her with haunted eyes, and she saw the raw remorse in them, a reflection of her own.",

The way he spoke about her, the urgency in his voice, the desperation to save her—it all felt so...off. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that this wasn’t how things would go down. He seemed more focused on saving her than on being there for her, and his words kept repeating the same rhythm—each beat echoing with an unsettling intensity. When he finally called out for help, I felt a pang of unease. Something didn’t feel right. My mind kept racing back to the last time we’d all been together, how everything had seemed normal then. Now, though, every moment felt tainted by the sense that something was terribly wrong. But as I stood there, frozen in worry, I realized that maybe I was just overreacting. After all, my brother-in-law has always been a bit of a perfectionist, and sometimes his focus can be overwhelming. Maybe I’m reading too much into what I heard. Still, the image of him standing there, his voice steady but his eyes filled with tears, lingered in my head. I couldn’t help but wonder if I was misinterpreting things, if maybe everything was going according to plan after all. Still, when I think back to that moment, I remember the feeling of dread, the sense that something was off. Maybe I am reading too much into it, but still, that feeling persists."

Every time he looks at the needles, he sees her smile, but it’s just an illusion - they’re nothing more than cold metal, useless reminders of what he’s lost. I wish he would stop pretending that he can fix things; he’s just hurting himself with every stitch."

If they hadn't called, I wouldn't have known anything about it until I woke up an hour ago. What if I wasn't even supposed to be called? Maybe they just wanted to wake me up unnecessarily. But why would they choose to do that at such an inconvenient time? Doesn't anyone know how much sleep deprivation I'm already going through? Why would they go out of their way to make things worse? This isn't fair. I thought we were making progress. Now, I feel like everything has fallen apart. My life is spiraling out of control. I need to get to the hospital ASAP but I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. I hope they don't think I'll abandon them when they really need me. Is this some kind of sick joke? Am I missing something? Did someone else take over for me? Do they think I'm not capable anymore? What if they don't want to deal with me right now because they think I'm too exhausted to handle it? Or maybe they just want to see me fail so badly. Wait, am I doing this wrong? Shouldn’t I be grateful for the opportunity to help?"

Either way, it's too late for her now. If she doesn't get rid of this book, she'll drown in its deceitful words forever. It's obvious she wants attention from other men now, hoping they'll take pity on her. But no one will fall for her act, especially after reading her own story. It's time to accept that she'll spend the rest of her life alone, haunted by memories of the man who broke her heart. There are only two possible explanations here: Either she genuinely wrote these things herself and deserves the shame of being exposed, or she's trying to frame him for something and needs our sympathy. It doesn’t matter which one is true; the damage is already done, and she’ll suffer for her actions. This isn’t over yet; there’s more to come. Maybe if she keeps pushing, people will finally realize how much he wronged her. Or maybe she'll lose everything else she has left, but at least she can say she stood up against him. Either way, we don't need this kind of drama in our lives"

And then there were the fights, where he would lash out at her, saying things like \"You're so selfish\" and \"This is all your fault,\" as if she could control everything. He had been like this for months now, it seemed. Always so caught up in his own mind, leaving her feeling ignored and unheard. Like he didn't even see her anymore. She wondered if he ever felt the same way - alone and disconnected from reality. If he too saw her as just another obstacle to get past, rather than someone who needed support and understanding. Or maybe he simply didn't care, using her as a means to escape his own pain, like he did with everyone else. He had become a stranger, one she barely recognized. This was how she imagined him most days now - a shadow of the man she once loved, consumed by his own darkness."

It was always a sign of something—something that would eventually lead to our demise. Her smile became tighter, almost bitter. She began to feel trapped by me, like I was suffocating her. And when the wind blows, it reminds her of those days, forcing her to relive memories she'd rather forget. You might think I'm just being dramatic, but I assure you, every creak of the floorboards, every groan of the trees outside, is a reminder of her absence. My life is now a constant echo chamber of what could have been, what should have been. Every moment without her feels like a betrayal—a betrayal of our vows, of our love. Even the sunshine brings back painful memories of happier times, taunting me with what we once shared. But there's more. You see, I've discovered an old diary hidden away in the attic. It belonged to my wife. As I flipped through its pages, I found words penned during our happiest moments, but also phrases that spoke of desperation, longing, and sadness. It was all there—the happiness, the pain, and the truth. And now, I realize that she was never truly happy"
