The invitation had arrived addressed only to her, a subtle snub he'd dismissed at first, but now, seeing her excitedly select her best outfit, he feels a pang of envy. He turns back to his easel, trying to focus on the half-finished painting, but the brushstrokes feel heavy and forced.",

Yet, every time I see her with someone else, I can’t help but feel like I'm being replaced. It's irrational, but I know how she feels. She loves art and is passionate about sharing it with others. I used to be so into it too, but lately... Well, maybe I’ve lost some of that spark. Maybe I need to reconnect with my own creativity if I want to stay relevant. That's all. Just getting back into the zone after a few days off will do me good. I'll get over this feeling, and we'll go out together tonight, just the two of us."

My entire life, I’ve worked tirelessly for your happiness, but does that ever matter to you? I’m always there when you need something, yet you never take time to appreciate me. Even today, you didn't care enough to hear me out. Instead, you just blew up, like every other day. Do you know how frustrating it is to work on something that matters so much and then have it dismissed like it doesn’t even exist? I'm tired of being treated like an inconvenience, of feeling like my hard work means nothing to you. You wouldn't dare criticize anything you created yourself, would you? Why can't you see that this took me months of dedication? It’s more than just numbers; it’s my pride, my passion. And you’re going to keep treating it like garbage because you don’t understand it? You always tell me how proud you are of me, how amazing I am, but when I try to share my own achievements with you, you shut me down. It feels like I’m not good enough for you anymore.

He leaned down, his arthritic knees popping in protest, and picked up the matches, only for them to slip through his grasp again.

Just smoke and heat. And even if it were real, what would it accomplish? Cooking is about more than just lighting something on fire; it’s about understanding how ingredients interact, how flavors combine, and the art of presentation. These little moments, like watching the flames dance or smelling the aroma of cooking oil, are what make food special—what make life worth savoring. But for me, every time I try to light the stove, it feels like I’m just going through the motions. Maybe I’ve lost touch with the simple pleasures of cooking. Maybe this isn’t about making memories, but about forcing myself to remember. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I wondered if maybe, just maybe, I was ready to let go of the past."

My mind was racing, but nothing seemed real until I reached the room. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I didn’t know what happened or why they weren’t responding. All I knew was that something terrible had occurred, and I felt so helpless. I couldn’t stand up straight anymore; I just wanted to run back to the nurse’s station and ask for someone to help me. But I stayed there, frozen in fear, unable to move or speak. It was like the world around me melted away, leaving only my overwhelming panic. I felt like I was going crazy, and I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was trapped in some sort of nightmare.
