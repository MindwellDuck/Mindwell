It was the same gesture he used to have with her, once upon a time. Her stomach churned as she watched them from across the room, the clink of glasses and hum of conversation suddenly muted in her ears. She felt a familiar pang, sharp and bitter, jealousy clawing at her insides like an unwanted guest.",

The way he laughed with her, the familiarity of his touch, it all seemed so intimate and personal. She wondered if he thought about her too, if he missed her as much as she did. Maybe he'd like to see her again someday, but why would he? They weren't meant to be, after all. She tried to push those thoughts aside, telling herself she was being ridiculous, but they lingered, refusing to leave her mind."

A wave of sorrow hit her as she remembered Emily's quiet tears during their last one-on-one meeting. She looked up at the family portrait on the wall, her partner's arm around her shoulders, and felt a profound sadness for the child's emptiness, echoing her own grief from years ago when she too had lost someone dear.",

If I let myself feel it, will I be consumed by sadness forever? * I can't stop thinking about Emily. Seeing her reminds me of how much I wish I could turn back time and help my daughter before she passed away. But if I try to remember happy times, I get stuck in a cycle of guilt and regret. How can I be strong for my son when I still struggle with my own grief? Is there a way to heal without falling apart?"

She'd been working on this project for months, but now it seemed like she was trying to take credit for it all herself. I can’t believe she would do something like that. This isn’t over yet. We’re going to find out what really happened behind closed doors, and when we do, there will be consequences. I know her actions have consequences, and people will pay. This isn't the end, and you can bet your life that I won’t let it be. There’s no way this is going to stay quiet forever. When I finally get my hands on her, there will be nothing left standing. You don’t understand what kind of pain I’m dealing with right now. That email was the last straw. I’ve tried to tell her about our relationship before, but she never listened. Now she thinks she can just use the work thing against me? No, this isn’t over. I’ll show her the true meaning of power, and everyone involved will regret ever crossing me."

At first, she thought maybe there'd been a misunderstanding. Maybe they were just asking for help with some minor issue, like a broken printer or misplaced equipment. But then she remembered the strange noises last week, and how they seemed so out of place among the usual hum of lab equipment. \"Are you saying someone is breaking into our labs?\" she asked, her mind racing. \"What kind of activity?\" There was a pause on the other end, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. Was the president really worried? \"Well, we can't be too careful,\" he said finally. \"But I'm not going to go into details over the phone. Can I schedule a meeting?\" Her gut told her to agree, but her head was screaming warnings. What if it was a trap? What if this was all some elaborate plan to get her in trouble?
