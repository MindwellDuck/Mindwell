How does he think I'll react when I see the look on his face? He probably thinks I'm trying to tell him everything will be alright, but deep down, I'm wondering what he's really feeling—fear, anger, frustration. Does he wonder why I don't say anything? Does he worry that I might think he's overreacting? Maybe he’s secretly hoping I won’t notice... maybe he wishes I wouldn’t even be there. When I see him like this, I can almost imagine him thinking, “If she were here, things would be different.” But then again, perhaps he’s thinking, “She doesn’t care anyway.” This situation always gets to me, and I bet he knows it. He probably wonders why I’m so sensitive, especially after all these times. I guess he thinks I’m just being overly cautious because I don’t want him to feel worse than he already does. Maybe he wonders if I really understand how scared he is or if I’m just pretending to care."

The pain lingered, an ache within, as if his heart had grown too heavy for its own good. It was as if the world itself was holding its breath, waiting for something it would never come—peace. Yet, in this silence, there was no solace, only the echoes of what could have been. Time seemed to stand still, but he couldn't help but wonder when the next wave of grief would crash over him, reminding him that some wounds would always remain open, refusing to heal. He thought about how everyone else seemed to move forward, finding happiness in ways he couldn’t understand. His friends spoke of new beginnings, of building lives that didn’t rely on someone they’d lost. They talked of finding joy in things that brought them comfort, of rediscovering themselves after the loss. But for him, every step felt like a leap into the unknown, each day a struggle to keep moving, to find meaning in a world where love and hope seemed so fleeting. It wasn’t just the passing of time; it was the realization that everything around him—the city, the people, even the sky above—seemed to be moving forward, while he remained stuck"
