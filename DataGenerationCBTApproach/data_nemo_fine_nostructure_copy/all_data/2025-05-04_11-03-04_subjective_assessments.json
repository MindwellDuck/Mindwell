Letting go was hard enough once. The pain didn't disappear completely, but it became manageable. Why can't you just accept what happened?\" Her voice cracks as she says, \"You were always so strong. How could you let your feelings consume you now?\" Her eyes well up with tears again, \"We talked about moving on, but I know you still hold onto all those memories. You never really accepted his passing. Maybe you're just trying to hold on because things are falling apart around here—life, relationships, everything. But that's no excuse for you to keep blaming me for your unhappiness.\" \"I remember how we used to support each other through tough times,\" she says softly. \"Now, you're not even willing to listen. What happened to us?\" Her words trail off, replaced by an uncomfortable silence. She looks down at her hands, clenched into fists, and then back up at me. \"Can you please help me fix the headstone? I don’t want to leave him alone, especially on his birthday.\" In a moment of frustration, she blurted out, \"If you’re going to stand there"

After all, they were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary later that day. Now, he's worried that he won't make it home in time. He'll miss the big milestone and have nothing to show for it.

He feels the familiar pang of loss, but today it's accompanied by a bitter edge.

Why bother trying to move on when they have each other? They're just proving that love is for fools who think life is worth living. And now they're laughing at me too, because if I wasn't sitting right there, watching them, I wouldn't even notice their happiness. The world is against me, and I know it. This couple isn't special; they're just another pair of people who got lucky. I bet they'll break up soon enough, leaving them both feeling just as miserable as I do. If anything, I'd rather kick that bird than listen to its cheerful squawks all day. The more I see them, the more I realize how much I've missed out on, and how I deserve to suffer. They're proof that life doesn't reward hard work, dedication, or loyalty - only shallow beauty and chance. My anger towards them grows with every passing moment, fueled by jealousy and resentment. What's wrong with me? Can't anyone see that I'm the one who truly deserves to be alone? These two aren't meant to be happy; they're just delaying the inevitable pain that will come when"

In fact, thinking about how he had touched that lipstick made her uncomfortable, as if he was spreading germs everywhere. This led her to think that maybe he hadn't washed his hands properly after touching random objects, which further fueled her paranoia. She started questioning whether they could have sex while he didn't wash his hands, which sent her into a panic. Now, whenever she sees him, she feels anxious, constantly wondering what else he might have done before coming home. She can't help but think that he must have kissed someone else before finding her lipstick, making her question everything they've been doing together.

I couldn't compete with that. I'd always tried to be the smart one, the one who knew everything, but whenever we talked about art, she seemed to have all the answers, and I was left feeling like a fool, unable to contribute anything meaningful. Even though I thought I understood art better than most, I couldn't help but feel inferior around her. Maybe it was because she got more attention from the crowd, and my own lack of success weighed heavily on me. Every time I saw her, I felt like I was being reminded of what I lacked, and how far behind I was compared to her. I realized that I must be the reason she was successful, and that I simply wasn’t good enough to succeed on my own. It made sense, right? But deep down, I hated the idea that I might be the problem, that maybe I was just not cut out for this whole art thing. That realization didn't help ease my frustration. Instead, it fueled my anger toward her, making me wonder if she really deserved all those compliments. Was she just using charm to get ahead, to distract"
