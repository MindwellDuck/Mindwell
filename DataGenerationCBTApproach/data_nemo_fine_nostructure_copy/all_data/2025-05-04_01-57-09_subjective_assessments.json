He thinks back to all the times he got into trouble at home - fights with siblings, getting caught lying, and poor grades. What could he possibly do now to change everything? He wonders if maybe he is just too stupid to succeed. Maybe he really isn't good enough to earn an education, so why bother trying?

Every time he poured a cup, every sip felt like an attempt to fill a void that couldn't be filled by anything—by anyone. He thought about all the mornings she used to make breakfast while he got ready for work, how she'd always have a warm smile waiting for him at the door. Now, he was alone, and even simple things felt like a chore. As he looked around the kitchen, memories flooded his mind, each one reminding him of what he’d gained and lost. The silence wasn’t just emptiness; it was a weight that pressed down on him, making it hard to breathe. He wondered if he ever truly knew her, if he really understood why this day felt different, why the same routine now felt like a betrayal. Every step back into the past felt like a step further away from the present, and he realized that some moments are meant to stay locked in memory, where they can’t hurt anymore. But the pain lingered, a constant reminder that no matter how much time passed, some wounds would never fully heal.."
