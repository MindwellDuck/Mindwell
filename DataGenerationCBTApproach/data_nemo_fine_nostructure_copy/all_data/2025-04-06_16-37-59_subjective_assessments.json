Maybe she just needs some space after our argument earlier this week. She said we needed to take things slowly, so maybe she's taking that advice seriously. It doesn't seem like she's ignoring me; she could just be... taking care of something important. Maybe I overreacted when I called her multiple times. What if she's dealing with something at work that requires more focus than usual? Or perhaps she simply had a rough day and isn't ready to talk yet. If she's really busy, maybe she'll get back to me soon. I shouldn't jump to conclusions about her whereabouts; let's give her some time to figure things out."

Every moment felt like an eternity, and the thought of moving on seemed impossible. I could only sit here, surrounded by memories, and let the ache consume me. She had always known exactly what I needed, but now, even her care felt like a cruel reminder of all I’d lost. Her words were a bittersweet comfort, a constant reminder that I would never find another like her. I could only cling to these letters, holding them close as if they might give me strength in this darkest of times."

Or maybe there was something more significant attached to that card that she didn’t want to forget. What if someone had already given us a similar gift, and this one was just an afterthought? This thought makes me feel grateful again. I wish she knew how much I appreciate these little things. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but what if this is some sign that she wants to plan even more amazing surprises for our next anniversary? I can imagine how excited I’ll be when she tells me what’s next! It feels weird that she forgot about it. Does that mean she doesn’t really care about surprises anymore? But then again, what if she was just busy and completely forgot? Either way, I think it’s safe to say she still loves surprising me—she wouldn’t forget something that special for long. What if we were meant to find this together? Would she have left a note somewhere else? Maybe I could’ve missed it if I wasn’t looking closely enough.

Her heart races as she grabs a knife from the block, her grip slick with sweat. She tiptoes towards the kitchen, her breath shallow. The clicking stops abruptly. She freezes, ears straining. Suddenly, the refrigerator kicks on, its hum filling the silence. She lets out a shaky laugh, setting down the knife. But she can't shake the feeling that someone was just there with her.",

I have this overwhelming urge to check every single corner of my space to see if anyone is hiding. Sometimes I find things moved around, which makes me wonder if maybe I’m losing my mind. Or worse, if there’s really something there watching me. I feel so paranoid that I often end up calling the police for no reason at all, just because I feel like something might be off. She's convinced that she saw something moving across her wall last night, although her husband swore he didn’t notice anything unusual. Whenever she leaves her apartment, she worries about how long she’ll be gone and whether she'll return before whatever it is finds her again. She always locks her doors tightly, making sure they’re secure even when she’s home. Despite this, she still has trouble sleeping, especially during the day when the sun is high. When she does fall asleep, she wakes up suddenly, thinking she heard footsteps or a knock. These strange feelings keep her up, and she often goes back to bed hours later, exhausted but unable to rest fully. Her husband thinks she’s just stressed, but deep down,"

We're talking about some serious issues here, not just a simple misunderstanding. It could happen to anyone. He probably doesn't even care that much. But if he does, he'd never admit it. So, what if we had another teacher say something similar? Would they be trying to ruin our lives as well? Maybe there are more teachers who will do the same thing. And what if other parents find out about this? They'll think badly of us, and we won't be able to change anything. This isn't going away anytime soon, and I'm just waiting for the next incident so I can say, \"I told you so.\" If this keeps happening, I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it to stay here. I need to figure out what's best for me and my family. This situation is getting out of hand. I've seen other kids have trouble with their parents being overly critical, but now it's affecting me directly. It feels unfair since I always try to listen carefully and follow instructions. Is this kind of behavior normal? What if other students feel the same way? How many times has this happened"

Every moment without him feels like a small part of me is missing, like I’ve lost my footing. I keep thinking about how things would be different if he was there—how much more enjoyable our conversations would be, how much less overwhelming life’s challenges might seem. It’s almost as if I’m mourning his absence before we even started. And then, to make matters worse, I caught myself wishing he wasn’t gone. It’s like I’m grieving something that hasn’t happened yet, which doesn’t make sense. What’s next? Is it going to be so bad that I’ll wish he never came back? It's hard not to wonder what he's doing right now, whether he thinks about us too. Does he miss me as much as I miss him? Am I losing him forever? All I know is that without him, everything feels duller, emptier. I guess some days are better than others, but deep down, I can't shake off the feeling that I've lost my best friend, my safety net.
