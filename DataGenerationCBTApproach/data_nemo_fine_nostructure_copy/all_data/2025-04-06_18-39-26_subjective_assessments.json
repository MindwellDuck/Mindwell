It wasn't until he remembered the last time they spoke—that she'd asked him to come see her, though she knew he wouldn't make it—that he realized what he’d truly lost: the chance to spend one final moment with her, to tell her how much he loved her, to hold her hand once more. Now those moments were gone, leaving only the ache of regret. Even in death, she remained a reminder of all the things he'd never done, all the times he'd let life slip by unnoticed.

However, in this scenario, you seem to be doing just the opposite. You're expressing pride in yourself and acknowledging that your frustration was justified, which suggests that you may actually be discounting the positive instead of justifying your negative emotions. Can you think about why you might be feeling this way? Are there other times when you notice that you tend to focus more on the negative than the positive? If so, how does that impact your relationships and overall well-being? # Additional Questions * What are some common situations where you tend to focus on the negative? * How do you think this affects your relationships and overall well-being? * Have you noticed any patterns in your behavior or reactions that suggest you might be discounting the positive? * How can you"

He would have wanted her to keep going, to hold on to these things, to remember how much he loved her through them. But why did he leave? Why did he choose to disappear so suddenly? The questions swirled around her, each one leading to another. The tears fell harder now, and she could see her reflection in the water droplets clinging to the windowpane—a picture of someone broken, yet holding on. It wasn't just the loss of her partner; it was the loss of everything they had built together. Their dreams, their plans, their future—it all lay shattered, like the old watch he used to wear.
