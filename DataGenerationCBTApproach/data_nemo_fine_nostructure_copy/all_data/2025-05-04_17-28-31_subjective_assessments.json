She'd stayed up until midnight, marking them meticulously, yet today they mock her, a testament to her endless toil. It's not even noon when she hears it - the harsh, grating sound of chalk against blackboard, followed by a collective groan from her students. She turns around, rage simmering within her, to see Johnny, once again, leaning back in his chair, feet resting on the desk, chalk dusting his hair. He smirks at her, challenge gleaming in his eyes. The room is silent, waiting for her reaction.",

It just made me feel so small and insignificant, especially since everyone else seemed to be talking about how amazing she is. I mean, I'm happy she got recognition, but it really hurts knowing that no one even remembered I was there. I tried to smile and act confident, but inside, I felt like I didn’t belong. And now I can't stop thinking about all the times we worked together—how I never said anything, how I just stood back while she did all the work... I guess this is why I always try to keep a low profile; it’s easier to hide than face people who don't care about what I have to say. Now I just want to go home and forget about it."

It’s hard to imagine him doing such a thing without thinking about how much he loved me. He would have never done something like this because we were meant for each other. This isn’t what happened; it’s just my mind playing tricks on me again. But why would he leave? Is there someone else? No, no, it can’t be true. They’re probably just messing with me.

The girl in the picture had it all - confidence, laughter, and joy, whereas she couldn't help but feel overshadowed by those qualities. Every glance revealed more reasons why she didn't measure up: his carefree smile contrasted sharply with her own reserved demeanor, and the way he seemed to effortlessly connect with people made her wonder if she'd ever be able to bridge that gap. Even the background, filled with vibrant colors, seemed dull compared to the happiness radiating from him, making her question whether she'd ever truly find her place in the world. As she gazed deeper into the frame, the weight of what was lost became almost unbearable. They were meant for each other, yet now she was left alone, searching for answers in a sea of what-ifs. The photo served as a harsh reminder that some things can never be recaptured, leaving only longing and regret in its wake. She closed her eyes, letting the silence wash over her, and when she opened them again, the image remained unchanged, a constant reminder of all she'd lost. The girl in the picture had it all, while she was left with nothing but the ghosts of what could have been."

The envelope was old, with a strange return address I’d never seen before—his estranged brother, someone we’d barely spoken to in decades. When I opened it, the date jumped out at me—the letter was postmarked nearly two years ago, long after my husband passed away. The words within were laced with resentment and anger, something he had never shown me. It felt like I was reading a stranger’s thoughts, not the words of the man I loved. I couldn’t help but wonder how much more there was to discover, how many secrets he might have been keeping. This letter has left me feeling lost and confused, like I’m just starting to read a book that was already finished."

Every little thing bothers me here. I've always hated this town. I wonder if we'll ever find another place to live. The thought makes me anxious. I wish we could move somewhere else but I'm worried it will be difficult to adjust. My husband thinks we're going crazy, but maybe they have better places for us elsewhere. I really hope we can leave soon. Maybe my husband will talk some sense into me and help me relax. If only he were home right now, he would tell me to stop being so silly and focus on more important things. But no, I'm stuck with him right now. At least he doesn't make fun of me like other people do. I feel like such an idiot for getting upset over nothing. I guess I'm just too old for all this nonsense. Everyone hates me anyway; I'm just a bother to everyone. No one wants to hang out with me. I might as well give up and accept it. Life is pointless anyway. There's no use trying to change anything. Nothing good ever comes from moving. We should just stay where we are and"
