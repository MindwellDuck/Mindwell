As he poured the coffee, a chip on the rim caught his eye - they'd argued about who had chipped it first, laughing over whose turn it was to buy new mugs.

Or does he genuinely care? It’s hard not to feel like there must be another reason behind his questions. He never asks these things when we’re out together. Could he be worried about how I look? Am I really so different from everyone else? It doesn’t make sense that he would even notice. But what if he is right?
