It’s almost like my brain is preparing me for the worst-case scenarios while also reassuring me everything will be okay. It's like being trapped in a never-ending loop of both hope and fear. Each possibility weighs heavily on me, refusing to let me fully relax. I keep thinking about how I wish I could just go back to a time when things were simpler, before the weight of responsibility grew too heavy to bear. I feel like I'm caught between wanting control over everything and accepting that sometimes life throws us curveballs we can’t always prepare for.
