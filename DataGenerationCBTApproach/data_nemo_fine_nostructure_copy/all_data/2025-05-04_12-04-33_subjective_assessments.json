They seemed genuinely impressed by her achievements, which made me wonder if they were thinking about me too. Maybe they're feeling jealous or even resentful, wishing they had worked on something so important and valuable. It's possible they're now doubting their own abilities or accomplishments, wondering why they didn't receive similar recognition for their efforts. If what they said was true, it would mean they might think I'm no longer capable or relevant, which is hard to accept. But perhaps, deep down, I am, and they're just acknowledging it. I wish they wouldn't say things like that; it makes me feel inferior, and I don't want anyone to think I've lost my edge."

I am shocked by what I've seen so far. This is unbelievable. He's definitely a cheater. I'm sure she is going to leave him. And I hope she does. It would be better for her than if he left her. Sooner or later, they'll find out each other's secrets, and then things will really start to fall apart. I hope it happens soon because I'm worried about these people. If he leaves, she might lose custody of her daughter. That would be disastrous. She is probably the one who started it all. The way she was flirting with him when we met. And now she's trying to make me believe that she is innocent? What is she really after? I'm glad she didn't tell him anything. I'm sure he wouldn't care anyway. He'd probably try to take advantage of her if he knew the truth. Or maybe he already knows. Maybe he even cheated on her before she got pregnant.

It wasn’t just the pressure of presenting; it was everything else too – the argument with her ex, the doubts about her cooking skills, even the way she looked in the mirror this morning. It all swirled together in a maelstrom of self-doubt, making her question whether she had ever been good enough. As she finished preparing the dishes, the silence in the room grew heavier than the weight of the knives on her counter. Each dish was a reflection of her failed attempts to prove herself, a reminder of the countless disappointments that lingered in her mind like open wounds. She could almost hear them whispering, urging her to fail, to let go of the dream that had driven her for so long. And yet, despite the fear creeping over her, she continued to work, determined to honor the memory of her late mother who had taught her how to cook with such love and care.

Every time I look at this old laptop, I remember how proud I was when he first started using it. I set up his profile, showed him how to navigate, and taught him what to do when I wasn’t around. Those moments were precious. But now, even that memory feels bittersweet. If only I could turn back time, I would have done things differently. I would’ve been there more for him, supported him through thick and thin, like a real father. Instead, I missed every step of his journey, every milestone, every triumph. And now, he’s gone, leaving me with nothing but these regrets. I’m starting to realize how much I took him for granted. I thought I was doing enough, but deep down, I know I wasn’t.
