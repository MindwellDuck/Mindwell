A small, clear glass jar, usually filled with olive oil and placed precisely at the edge of his counter, was now slightly askew.

You need to calm down and think clearly about what happened last night. There must have been some explanation for the jar being moved. You don’t even remember leaving the jar there, so let’s focus on getting more information from you instead of jumping to conclusions. Take a deep breath, stay calm, and work through this together."

It was as if he was trying to convince himself that everything was okay, even when it wasn’t. She remembered him telling her once that he had always felt like he was holding things together for everyone else, like he was the glue that kept their little family from falling apart. But now, with him gone, she realized just how much weight he had carried alone. He had been more than just a husband; he had been the rock they all leaned on. His passing left a gaping hole in her life that seemed impossible to fill, especially since his memory continued to haunt her in such vivid detail. Every time she saw his old stethoscope, she was hit with a flood of images: the way he would gently place his hands on her shoulders during exams, the sound of his voice calming her nerves, and the countless late-night talks where he’d reassure her that everything would be alright. Even now, she could almost hear his soothing tone, urging her to keep going, one step at a time. But it didn’t make it easier. Instead, every moment felt like a struggle, each breath a reminder that he was truly gone."

Maybe Lily could even try to help her through this tough time, but it wouldn't be easy. She imagined Lily being frustrated because she couldn't communicate with her anymore, which made her feel guilty for grieving so much.

She kept thinking about how Lily might miss her, and wondered if Lily was already looking forward to their next encounter, whenever that might be.
