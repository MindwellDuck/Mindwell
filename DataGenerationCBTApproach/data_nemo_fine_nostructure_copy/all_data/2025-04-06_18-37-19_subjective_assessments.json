This wasn't the first time he'd faced such disappointment, but it stung more than usual because it reminded him of all the opportunities he'd missed out on—opportunities that had slipped through his fingers while he struggled to keep up with the ever-changing world of journalism."

Of course not; we're too busy with our schedules and paperwork. It makes me sick. Why am I always the one who has to intervene when they get it wrong? If they didn’t make such a big deal out of everything, if they were less rigid, maybe things wouldn’t be so stressful. But no, instead of helping patients recover, they’re stuck on “protocol” like it’s some kind of holy scripture. And then they have the nerve to complain when things don’t go according to plan? Please. They’ve been doing this for years. What could possibly go wrong? Even worse, I feel like I’m not even allowed to express myself because of all these stupid regulations. I mean, who needs personal opinions anyway? Everything should be based on strict guidelines and data, right? No room for empathy or common sense. It’s unbelievable how far they’ll push someone through a procedure just because it fits a checklist, without considering anything else. And when I try to talk sense, they just tell me it’s against policy. Policy! As if that’s better than actual experience and understanding of the situation. It’s infuriating. Why are they so"

Even the world outside seemed to have moved forward, while he remained stuck in the past. In contrast, his brother-in-law had built a successful business, and his sister-in-law was thriving in her career. Their lives appeared to be moving ahead smoothly, while he felt like he was still living in the same moment, unable to move forward. It wasn’t fair; everyone around him seemed to be growing, but he was stuck in this one moment, reliving the pain of losing her. He couldn't help but feel like he was behind everyone else. The comparison made him sad because he wished he could also be as happy as they were. But deep down, he knew that he was not meant to be happy anymore. He missed her every day, and nothing would ever change that. It’s unfair how he feels like he can’t catch up with others. He wishes he could be as content"
