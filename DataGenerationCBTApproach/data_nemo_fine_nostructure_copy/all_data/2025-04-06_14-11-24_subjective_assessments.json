We've been living together for years now, but it still feels like we barely know each other. She comes back whenever she feels like it, leaving me with nothing but loneliness. Maybe if I got rid of her, things would be better. But then again, maybe it's just my own fault. She must think I'm boring or something because she's gone out with those friends so many times recently. I can't blame her, really. I'm just not as exciting as they are, right?

This whole thing was too stressful, and I'm just tired of being hurt again. I know people say relationships are about love, but mine wasn't ever like that. We had our moments, but I wouldn't call them romantic. Now, at least I have my books back. They're worth more to me than she ever was. She probably sent this out of obligation. If anything, I'm glad she's moving on with her life. I shouldn't feel bad about it; it's not my fault things didn't work out between us. She's already moved on, so what's the point? I'll just stick to my routine and avoid thinking about it. Besides, I've got my guitar now, and that means a lot more to me than any wedding. This is all just part of growing up, I guess. People change, and sometimes that means leaving you behind. I'm better off focusing on myself. This whole situation isn't worth dwelling on. She's probably fine without me, and who knows, maybe she'll find someone better someday. That would suit me just fine."

As I looked around, I saw the faint outlines of students working on projects, but they seemed oblivious to my presence. It was as if they too were lost in their own thoughts, perhaps reminiscing about past memories, just like I was. Yet, while they might be holding onto happy moments, I couldn’t shake off the feeling of sadness. Even the photos scattered across tables seemed to whisper stories of happier times, leaving me with more questions than answers. Why did I have to sit here alone, surrounded by reminders of what could never be again? Was it because I simply wasn’t meant to belong? # Example Output ## Response End"
