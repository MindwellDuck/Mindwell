He didn't care about anyone but himself, always leaving dirty dishes for her to clean up, never contributing to household chores. His lack of initiative made her feel like she was carrying everything on her shoulders. It seemed he took her for granted, just using her as a personal assistant. She couldn't trust him anymore; he was unreliable, forgetful, and unsupportive. Every time he came home late from work, she felt frustrated, resentful, and hurt. His constant excuses for not being there when she needed him made her wonder if he even cared about her feelings. He never prioritized her needs or listened to her problems, making her feel isolated and alone. It seemed every conversation ended with her disappointment, frustration, and sadness. She knew he wasn't perfect, but it felt like he had no regard for her or their relationship. She wondered how someone who claimed to love her could treat her so badly."

They might start questioning my work, and I'd never know what hit me. The thought alone makes me anxious, but I can't help wondering if I'll ever get over this feeling. What if it gets worse? I try to push these thoughts away, but they linger, making every interaction feel like a potential disaster waiting to happen. I've always prided myself on being confident and assertive, but lately, those qualities seem fragile and easily shattered. I fear that no matter how hard I try, I might never regain control of my emotions, and the anxiety could become overwhelming. I’ve started avoiding social gatherings just so I don’t have to face this fear. But deep down, I worry that avoiding them will make things worse in the long run. I feel trapped between wanting to overcome my fears and fearing they’ll consume me entirely. I guess we all need some level of anxiety, right? It keeps us humble. Maybe I’m just overly sensitive, but I’d rather be cautious than regretful.

I mean, who else would write something like that? It sounds like a desperate attempt to get attention. And that comment about my wife... it's just cruel. I don't think anyone can honestly say that her death has made them better artists. Maybe he's jealous because he's struggling himself? This whole thing is really upsetting me. It feels like no matter what I do, people are going to find fault with me. My husband always said I was too sensitive when I'd get upset over little things, but now I realize how right he was. This criticism has just opened old wounds all over again. I'm starting to wonder if maybe we should have kept our heads down during those tough times. At least then, we wouldn't be dealing with the backlash now. But no, instead, we let everyone see us at our weakest, and now look where we are.

She hadn't seen him laugh like that since before they were married, and now it seemed different somehow. He shouldn't be smiling at someone else, and if he was, it meant something. Maybe he'd forgotten how much he loved her, or maybe he just didn't love her anymore. She couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more going on behind closed doors, and she needed answers. It wasn't fair to herself to dwell on these thoughts, but she couldn't stop them from creeping into her mind. Shouldn't she be content knowing he still cared for her, or at least pretending she could be? Yet, the doubts lingered, making her wonder if she was being unreasonable. Shouldn't she trust him enough to believe that nothing was happening? But why should she have to trust him? Didn't she deserve better than someone who would make her question everything?

I try to remember the last time we had a real conversation, but my mind keeps drifting back to the day he left. He said he needed some space, that he was struggling with the weight of his own expectations. But then there was nothing. No calls, no messages. Just silence. That was over two years ago, yet the pain remains as raw today as it was that night. She can’t help but wonder if his disappearance was more than just a need for solitude. Was he trying to escape the guilt that followed? The guilt that crept in after he abandoned us—me, our daughter, and the life we built together. We thought we had everything: love, happiness, and a future filled with promise. But now, all those memories seem tainted by the knowledge that he was running away from his own fears.
