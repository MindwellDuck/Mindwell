Anyway, he grabbed the paper and stormed out, not even saying hello. The look on their faces told me they knew exactly what they were doing. I'm just so tired of dealing with this nonsense. It's not like I don't deserve respect. I've worked too hard for everything I have. Those kids need to understand who I am and how much effort goes into my work.

This kind of thing happens all the time around me—my colleagues often complain about the state of our shared space, and it’s hard for them to keep track of their own belongings because everything is scattered. It’s easy to see how my lack of organization contributes to these problems. Even when I try to clean up after myself, I tend to make a mess elsewhere, like when I spill coffee on my shirt or leave dirty dishes in the sink. I know this is a pattern I need to break, but it feels impossible to change, especially since it keeps happening.
