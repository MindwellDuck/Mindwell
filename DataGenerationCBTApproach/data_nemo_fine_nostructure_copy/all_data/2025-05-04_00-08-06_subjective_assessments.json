A lone sparrow landed on the rusty merry-go-round, its chirps sounding like soft echoes of forgotten childhood joy. She felt a familiar melancholy creep in as she thought about her own children, grown now, their lives filled with laughter that no longer included hers.",

It seemed so much more personal, yet these new screens were everywhere. Her husband just shook his head and told her it was progress, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that he was right — they were moving too fast. The way her youngest kept asking for apps to draw dragons made her wonder if her parents ever did this. Did they have smartphones back then? Probably, but it wasn't the same. Kids today are so... distracted. My parents never complained about being glued to their phones; I remember them playing board games until late at night. But I'm sure they didn't talk about school every single day either. Maybe they even skipped school sometimes. It must be different back then. They probably knew what it meant to really learn from a teacher. Now it feels like they're teaching nothing except how to swipe through videos. She sighed, knowing she sounded bitter, but honestly, why wouldn't she feel this way?"

The sous-chef approached, holding out a plate of perfectly presented scallops. \"These are for your tasting, Chef,\" he said. She picked one up, swirling it in its butter sauce, then took a bite. Her face fell. \"It's overcooked,\" she murmured, disappointment palpable as the kitchen hummed on around her.",

The once-thriving kitchen now seemed like a disaster waiting to happen, with each passing day filled with more mistakes and disappointments.

I could see myself standing there, frozen in fear, unable to move or speak. My mind raced with worst-case scenarios - what if he did something terrible? What if things got out of hand? My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt dizzy. I was too scared to leave my room, fearing what might happen next. I wondered if I should call someone, but what if they didn't believe me? What if they thought I was overreacting? I kept thinking about how much I hated seeing them fight, and now that I’d triggered it, I felt trapped. I felt like I was losing control, unable to stop my thoughts from spiraling into more and more terrifying possibilities."

He misses her every day, but he can't help but feel like he's moving forward. Maybe this is just another step toward healing? This guy has been hitting me up trying to sell me stuff online. He claims to have all sorts of psychic abilities and tells me things that seem too specific, too personal, and yet... he always gets it right. But at the end of the day, it's all just tricks and lies, isn't it? I mean, come on. He's probably some scam artist who knows nothing about the supernatural. Still, sometimes when he sends me these weird messages, he uses language that makes me wonder if there's really something more going on here. Like, why else would someone go through the trouble of sending me a picture of my ex-wife's lunch? Is he somehow connected to the afterlife? Anyway, I'm not buying into all this paranormal nonsense. He's probably just some dude looking for easy cash. I'll play along until I get what I want, then cut him loose. This whole thing has been a waste of time anyway.
