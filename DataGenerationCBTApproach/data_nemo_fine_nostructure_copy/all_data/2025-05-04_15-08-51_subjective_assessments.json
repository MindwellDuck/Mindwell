It makes him wonder if he’s truly out of date or just too much of a loner for people to notice. The way the words seem to echo in his mind, making everything feel more isolated than ever, is unsettling. This situation has happened before, and every time it leaves him feeling like he's stuck in some kind of loop where nothing changes. Maybe he is outdated; maybe he's just not connecting with anyone anymore. Either way, he doesn’t want to be seen this way, especially when he’s already struggling to find his place in school. It’s hard not to take it personally when someone puts such a blunt statement down on paper. The fact that he didn’t even sign it makes it feel even more personal, almost as if the writer was trying to make it sound like an anonymous truth rather than something meant to hurt. Still, he knows how it sounds and feels—and it’s not exactly what he needs right now. He tries to push those thoughts aside, focusing instead on what he can control, like working harder to get better grades or finding ways to reconnect with friends who might still care about him. But the note lingers, leaving a bitter taste that he can’t shake off. This isn’t the first time he’s felt like he’s falling behind, and he hopes it won’t be the last. At least he’s determined to keep moving forward, no"

I wish they would come to class more often. I've tried explaining how much effort goes into planning lessons, but it doesn't seem to matter.

They hadn't seen it - the way his eyes lingered on her replacement's smile, or how they'd shared more than just coffee during the handover. She tries to brush off the pang of jealousy, focusing instead on the day's briefing. But as she takes her seat, she can't help but feel like everyone knows her secret: that she's not as tough as she seems, that deep down, she's just a lonely woman trying to keep up with the job and the ghosts of her failed marriage.\n\n(Scenario 2)\nHer patrol car pulls over beside the young couple on the park bench. They're entwined in each other's arms, oblivious to her presence. She watches them for a moment too long before clearing her throat. \"Evening,\" she says, flashing her light on their faces. The girl looks up at her with wide, doe eyes, while the boy just smirks, his arm still around the girl's waist. Something about his nonchalance sets her teeth on edge.

She takes a deep breath, forcing herself to stay professional. \"You two shouldn't be here this late,\" she says, handing them a warning before driving off.\n\n(Scenario 3)\nShe sits at the bar, nursing her drink after another long shift. The bartender slides her another beer without asking, knowing she'll pay for it later. She's just about to take a sip when she hears it - laughter from a nearby table. She turns to see a group of off-duty officers, their uniforms replaced with civilian clothes but their attitudes unchanged. They're laughing at something on one of their phones, not noticing her glare until it's too late. The video starts playing again - her trying to apprehend a suspect yesterday, her foot slipping in the mud, her landing face-first in the dirt. She feels the heat rise in her cheeks as they laugh harder, their eyes flicking between her and the screen. She downs her drink, slamming the glass on the bar before storming out.",

We’re supposed to be happy right now, not sad. I know what she wants, though – I have a feeling she wants to go back to being the girl who would laugh at everything. That girl... if only I knew where she was hiding. Maybe if I could find her, she’d smile again, and we could start fresh. But until then, I’m stuck here, watching her cry over something so trivial. She’s so sensitive sometimes. Shouldn’t she just be happy? Why is she crying now? If only we could go back to that day when we were both young and carefree, maybe things wouldn’t feel this way. But life isn’t always kind, is it? Sometimes it takes one bad thing after another to wear us down. I guess some days are harder than others. Still, shouldn’t she be celebrating our anniversary? What’s gotten into her? Maybe I should leave her alone and let her process her emotions in peace. After all"
