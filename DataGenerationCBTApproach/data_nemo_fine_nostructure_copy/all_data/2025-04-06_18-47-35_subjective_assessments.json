He could almost smell the turpentine, a reminder of all the mistakes made in the name of art. His mind wandered back to the argument they’d had just before she left. The words hung in the air like a challenge, each one a betrayal of what once was. They spoke in hushed tones, but he knew every word was laced with venom. It wasn’t until then that he realized the true cost of creating—of letting go. Every brushstroke was a piece of himself, and he had lost count of how many pieces he'd given away. As he stood there, frozen by doubt, the silence grew thicker, like a fog that clung to everything. It was heavy with unspoken things, the weight of which seemed to press down on him. In the end, he couldn’t bear the thought of facing her again, so he let the paint dry, hoping someday it would tell its own story."

Her laptop was open on the dining table, a half-finished email to her boss staring back at him. \"Flight delayed,\" it read.
