You must have it easy since you don’t have these constant fears holding you back. Maybe if you had my problems, you’d realize how tough it really is. But honestly, your situation sounds almost...easy? It’s unfair that people with less to worry about are living normal lives, while I’m stuck dealing with this chaos. You probably don’t even notice things like this happening around you. I feel like I’m constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It’s exhausting trying to stay safe all the time. I hope someday I can find peace, but until then, I’ll be here, worrying every second of the day."

He stared at her photograph on the bedside table, his heart heavy with familiar hopelessness. As he sat down at the kitchen counter, his gaze fell upon her favorite mug, still in its place next to the coffee maker. He felt a pang of despair knowing it would never be used again. The house seemed quieter than usual; even the birds outside seemed reluctant to sing today. He took a deep breath and started his day alone, as he had every day since she was gone.",

It makes him wonder if there's anything he could've done differently to make her stay longer. He knows intellectually that it's just his imagination, but the pain is so real. This must mean I'm doing something wrong in life, right? Maybe if I tried harder to be more loving, she wouldn't have left me. Or maybe she wasn't happy with me anymore because I wasn’t doing enough. I know it’s not rational, but it feels like every little thing here just confirms my fears. This house feels empty, and it hurts. I guess I'll just keep going through the motions, hoping someday things will get better. But it's hard not to think about what could’ve been if only...if only... Every morning waking up to an empty house just feels like another punch to the gut. It makes me question everything - whether I’m truly worthy of love, if I’m missing out on some special connection that could’ve been mine. Even though I know logically that these thoughts aren’t fair, they still creep into my mind every time. I try to push them away, but they linger, making me wonder if this loneliness is part of some bigger plan or just a result of my own shortcomings. This whole situation has"

It wasn't just one thing—she'd been distant since our argument over my art. She'd said she needed time to think, but now it felt like she was abandoning us altogether. I could almost hear her words echoing in my head: \"You're never going to be good enough.\" But what had really changed? Was it just because she didn't want to see how poorly I was doing? Or was there something more going on? I felt a pang of sadness and frustration. Why would she leave me to face this alone?"
