I guess that's what makes me jealous - she never had feelings for anyone else, not after all the times I told her how much I loved her. This guy is clearly the new favorite of hers. I've seen them together several times since then, always in public. They seem to be having fun together, laughing and joking around. What if there's more than friendship between them? It hurts seeing her laugh with someone else, especially when she's smiling so brightly. Maybe I'm just too attached to my memories of our relationship. But honestly, I wonder if she ever misses me, if she thinks about us sometimes, or if she's moved on completely. I know she's busy with work, but still... What if she's lost interest in me entirely? Maybe I'm overreacting, but it feels like everything has changed since we broke up. We used to be inseparable, but now she seems to have found a new best friend. That guy looks familiar, maybe I saw him somewhere before.... Wait, where did I see him before? My mind keeps jumping back to the argument we had, wondering if I could have done things differently. What if I hadn’t said those things? Would she still want to be friends? She must be enjoying her newfound freedom, laughing with whoever comes along next. I feel like I’m"

I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him because of how much attention he gives her when she cries. At this point, it's almost pathetic how weak she is.

And what about the time I wasted? I really should have just ordered pizza, but noooo…now my poor daughter will be hungry, and I’ll have to make up for lost time later. This is terrible. All because I wasn’t careful enough, didn’t think ahead, and now we’re paying the price. What would she say if she knew how much I was beating myself up over this? She’d probably tell me to stop being so hard on myself, but I know she wouldn’t understand. I feel like such a failure. Every moment counts, and I wasted them all. The dishes pile higher, and I should have done things differently. My daughter won’t remember it anyway, but that doesn’t help me. It makes it worse. Why did I get stuck with the worst timing? Of course, this has to happen to me—the day after I decided to start baking again. Now my kitchen is ruined, and we’ll never eat that special cake like we planned. My daughter loves it so much"

Maybe tomorrow would bring a new chance, one where everything fell into place, and she finally felt whole again. What if she didn’t have to choose between them anymore? Or what if this moment was all she’d ever know? That thought made her feel lighter, almost hopeful. Yet, a part of her still held onto the dream of finding someone who understood her, someone who wouldn’t leave her hanging. And yet, even that feeling felt fleeting, like the passing of clouds across the moon. In the silence, she realized how much she longed for connection. Even now, with nothing but the hum of the city, she couldn’t shake the urge to reach out, to find someone to share these moments with. The question kept echoing in her mind: What if she found that someone someday? Perhaps the answer lay within herself, waiting patiently. Or perhaps it lay elsewhere, beyond the reaches of her small town. Whatever the case, she knew that she needed to move forward, to see where this journey would take her. After all, every"

Is it possible that my parents were both oblivious to my struggles? I don't even remember my mother being upset when I told her I had thoughts of self-harm. Did she care at all? I've been struggling lately with feelings of guilt over past mistakes, but I'm pretty sure they're not as bad as those he mentioned in the note. What kind of parent doesn't notice these things?
