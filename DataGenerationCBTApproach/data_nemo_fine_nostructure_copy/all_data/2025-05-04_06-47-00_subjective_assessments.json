He thinks nothing happened, but I know the truth - I have his entire life mapped out in my head, every detail, every conversation, every kiss. I can recite our arguments from memory, and I know exactly how long it took for each to fade away. If he ever finds out, everything will be over; he'll leave me, and I'll be left with nothing.

Not only did I gain valuable experience, but I also developed strong relationships that have lasted beyond our time together. Those connections continue to shape my career today, reminding me of the importance of empathy and teamwork in medicine. Even though I'm now retired, I still get excited when I see young doctors coming into the field. They remind me of why I started working in the first place – to make a meaningful impact on people’s lives. Seeing them succeed fills me with hope for the future of healthcare and makes me proud to be part of this profession. It's amazing how much has changed over the years, yet some things remain constant. The dedication of healthcare professionals continues to amaze me, and I feel fortunate to have been a part of it.
