The familiar silence is deafening; no longer filled with his laughter, no longer punctuated by his footsteps. She drops her chef's coat on the floor, not bothering to hang it up. In the kitchen, she absentmindedly traces the faint outline of a once-scratched recipe note still visible on the countertop - his handwriting, their shared plan for a Saturday morning breakfast that never came. She feels an ache in her chest, a familiar loneliness that seems to grow with each passing day.",

Or was he running some errands? She starts cleaning the living room, tidying up the books and making sure everything looks perfect. Everything is in its place except for his jacket, which he left hanging on the door hook. That means he wasn't here recently, and it makes sense that he might have forgotten to take it down.

Now, as he looks at this picture, he wonders how different things might have been if he had prioritized his relationships more. In the silence, he imagines himself being there for every milestone, every hug, and every triumph. What would it be like to walk alongside his son through college, to cheer him on during competitions, or to celebrate every little victory together? Would they have shared stories about their days, laughed over inside jokes, and created memories that would last a lifetime? As he sits here, lost in thought, he starts to envision an alternate reality where he is always present for these precious moments. He envisions himself standing proudly beside his son as he graduates, holding his hand tightly as they navigate the world together, and having endless conversations about everything from science fiction novels to favorite bands. He pictures himself helping his child find their passion, supporting them through every step of their journey, and cheering them on towards their dreams. This imaginary scenario unfolds like a movie in his mind, filled with scenes of deep connections, unwavering support, and unconditional love. In this imagined life, he sees himself as more than"

She's just manipulating people. Everyone thinks she's so nice, but I know better. I see how she treats people behind closed doors. She's a fake, and everyone else knows it too. They're just too afraid to say anything because they think they'll get fired. It's not fair. She had an easy time growing up and never faced challenges like me. If I were born into her family, I'd be where she is now. But no one cares about my struggles or accomplishments. They just want to praise her and make her feel good about herself. I'm the real genius here. I did all the heavy lifting while she coasted through college. What does she have to offer besides her looks? Her intelligence? Please, she couldn't even pass my class last year. And she gets away with it? That's just not fair. Everyone’s always saying how great she is, but deep down, they’re jealous. They wish they could be as successful as her. I’m the one who actually works hard, not her. I put in the effort and still get nothing. This isn't surprising"

They never understand, and now I’m starting to think they’re right – maybe I am broken beyond repair. How could someone so beautiful and loving leave him? What did he do wrong? He can’t help but wonder if he was somehow at fault. Even though he tries to remind himself of the good times, the memories keep haunting him.
