He notices a framed photograph of his late father on the mantel, the glass slightly askew. He straightens it, his fingers brushing against the cool metal, remembering the countless times they'd talked about medicine over dinner.

We've been through tough times together; we're stronger than ever. After all, we have our memories to hold onto, like when we first met and fell deeply in love. And who could forget the time he took me to the park on our anniversary? That was such a magical moment—just like this photo of us. Oh wait, why does it seem so... off? Let me check on him. *sigh* He probably needs some company. You know how he can get when he’s stressed—stiff as a board, almost impossible to talk to. But then he opens up, sharing stories about his patients, his dreams for the future, and we laugh until our sides ache. When you look into those eyes, there's no one else you’d rather spend your life with. Yet here I am, feeling anxious again. Perhaps it’s just stress, too. The hospital has been overwhelming lately, especially with the new cases. There are days when it feels like everything is piling up on him, and he comes home exhausted. Still, he manages to make us feel loved every single day. I know he wants things to go back to normal soon. But deep down, isn’t he worried about the changes coming? About being replaced by younger doctors? Or maybe he’s secretly thinking about leaving us for"

Why couldn't he just leave me alone?\" Her mind was filled with thoughts of how this guy was just another creepy stalker who didn't respect boundaries. She wondered why he would dare approach someone like her in such a place, especially since she had been walking alone at night. The fact that she felt so threatened made her realize she needed to get out of there fast. As she ran, her breath came out in short gasps, her legs pumping hard to reach her car before things escalated further. She could feel sweat dripping down her face and back, making her skin crawl even more. But it wasn't just about feeling scared; it was about the sense of violation that came with being followed. It made her question whether she was truly safe anywhere, including her home. She couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being watched, which seemed to intensify every time she looked over her shoulder. Her anxiety grew with each passing second, making her faster, until finally, she reached her car and locked herself inside. But the image of him lingering outside lingered, fueling her panic. She knew she had to be careful now, always looking over her shoulder as if waiting for the next attack. Now she feels unsafe, so maybe I'll avoid going out alone at night again. Maybe I shouldn't walk through deserted parking garages anymore. This whole thing has left her shaken, but she's determined to stay vigilant,"

It's obvious why she chose this particular moment, though - when we were both feeling most vulnerable. She has no business acting this way; she owes me an explanation. If I had simply looked through every single item in that attic, I wouldn't be in this situation right now. Instead, she chose to make it seem like I was careless, and she's using this as another chance to tell me how much she hates me. We can't even spend one day together without her bringing it up again. She's really trying to make me feel bad. Maybe if I'd spent more time cleaning the house, she wouldn't have felt the need to do this. This isn't about her feelings; it's about how I feel. And honestly, I don't know what's worse - the fact that she's treating me like this, or the fact that I'm starting to believe it's true. Why am I always the one who has to deal with her anger? Why does she get to decide when I'm allowed to grieve? Maybe I could have avoided this if I didn’t let her push me into those cornerstones of grief. But no, I couldn't help"

Even when I try to bring up problems, he dismisses them with a “That’s okay,” or tells me to stop being paranoid. And now this? Asking his son to pass the salt?! Doesn’t he know I did all the cooking today? Doesn’t he care that I worked hard to prepare a nice meal? This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. He’s always been so oblivious. In fact, I think he might be more bothered by me than he lets on. Maybe he thinks I’m overreacting again.

I can't imagine how many other critters are scurrying around in these halls. We need to take action immediately. The hospital administration needs to know about this ASAP. It's all coming together now. The incompetence of our doctors and nurses, combined with the lack of attention to detail in their work, has created an environment where pests thrive. This is unacceptable, and something needs to change. This is not just about one rat; it's a symptom of a larger problem. The people who run this place are either unwilling to address the issues or too afraid to speak up. They're more concerned with protecting their own careers than ensuring patient safety. I don't even want to think about what kind of diseases that rat could have carried. We're putting patients at risk by allowing this to continue. It's unconscionable. Something needs to be done, and fast. The fact that we have a rodent infestation is clear evidence of the hospital's negligence.
