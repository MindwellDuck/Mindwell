She'd meant to throw it out, but now, tracing its familiar shape, regret surged through her. That last argument echoed in her mind, her harsh words hanging heavy between them like an unscalable wall.

It was almost as if those memories were a shield against the pain of losing him. But even those moments couldn't protect her from the emptiness that followed. The truth was, every time she tried to reach him, he pushed her away, leaving her alone once again. She felt like she was drowning in her grief, unable to breathe anymore."

It wasn’t until later, when I asked him what he thought about the new roommate, that he said, “She doesn’t seem to care.” I didn’t think much of it at first, but then I saw how he looked at me—like I was somehow less deserving because I still lived there. It felt like a punch to the gut, but he just shrugged it off, saying he was glad she wouldn’t mind having friends over. I tried to brush it off too, telling myself that maybe she just needed time to adjust. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all his fault."

It seemed so natural to assume everyone could hear it; after all, that's how she learned in school. The thought that others might have heard too made her feel even more self-conscious. It wasn't until later, though, that she realized she'd misinterpreted the situation entirely. The old lady had probably just been calling out her name as a habit. Still, it took some time to shake off the feeling of embarrassment and regain her confidence."

But then again, maybe it wasn't their fault. Maybe there was something wrong with the way she created. Wasn't her style too unique? Did they really understand her vision? Or were they just scared of change? I shouldn't have expected such a big platform like this from someone who might not know the first thing about my art. They weren't exactly known for their artistic taste; after all, they had rejected her before. This time, it seemed like they simply didn’t want anything to do with her work anymore. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, they did say they appreciated her work, but... Well, that was probably just a nice gesture. They didn’t mean it seriously. And why would they? They’re probably used to seeing talented artists like me come and go, never staying long enough to make a real impact. It’s just the way things are here. Artists like me are always struggling to stand out in an overcrowded market where the likes of you hold all the power. You don’t even care about us, do you? You just use us for your own gain, making us work tirelessly while you reap the rewards. Even when we try"

Even the clock seemed to mock her, its steady tick marking the hours until her last chance at happiness slipped away. Every glance at the photo feed only served as a cruel reminder of what could have been if only things had turned out differently. It wasn't just a party; it was a celebration of her own failures, each smile a stark contrast to the emptiness she felt inside. The world outside seemed to be moving forward, yet here she was, stuck in a cycle of despair, unable to escape the darkness that had consumed her life. And when she looked around, the shadows seemed to grow longer, a chilling reminder that even the memories of joy would soon fade into the past."

Every time he sees them together, he feels like he’s drowning in a sea of sadness. It’s as if every step forward is a step backward, and no matter how hard he tries, he can’t shake this feeling of being stuck in the past. The world around him moves on, but inside, everything feels frozen in time. He wonders if she ever thinks about him, if she still remembers him, or if she’s completely moved on. All he knows is that he needs to hold on to something, anything, to keep himself sane in this new reality.

She noticed a note then, scrawled hastily, \"Won't be home till late. Don't wait up.\" Her gaze lingered on the 'don't', a word that had started to feel like an instruction manual for their marriage.

He'd always been the planner, but now he seemed lost in thought, his mind elsewhere. She imagined him sitting at the table, staring blankly into space, replaying some memory, some argument, some secret. She wondered if he was thinking about her, really thinking about what she wanted, or if he just didn't want to talk about it anymore. It was easier to assume he needed time, to let things settle, than to confront the uncertainty. But she knew she couldn't keep waiting; eventually, she would have to ask. Yet, every time she opened her mouth, it caught in her throat, stuck between truth and the need to protect herself. She found herself wondering if he even cared enough to come home early, if he truly missed her, or if this was all just another day in their life together - two people living separate lives in the same room."

She began to wonder if someone was playing a prank on her, if there were hidden cameras watching her every move. She checked her phone, thinking maybe she had missed some important updates from colleagues or emails from the lab director. But everything seemed normal. Still, the feeling persisted - she told herself, \"This shouldn't be happening right now. I'm so close to breaking through, and now this?\" It was just a minor setback, she thought. But deep down, her mind was racing with worst-case scenarios. \"Who could have done this? Is this part of something bigger?\" As she tried to calm herself, she noticed the mouse again, this time closer to her workstation. She started to imagine what kind of sabotage might be going on. Maybe someone was trying to discredit her, to make her look incompetent in front of her superiors. Or perhaps it was a sign of something more sinister - a warning that"
