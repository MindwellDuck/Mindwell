It's just another way of saying \"we don't really care how you feel anymore.\" When she talks like this, it makes me realize how much she's changed since we last saw each other. Her whole demeanor is different now, almost... happy. Like she's been pretending to be someone else, someone who doesn't have problems with her family. Maybe that's why she's being friendly today. She wants to make up for everything she didn't do back then. It's hard to see her smiling and acting like everything is okay. She doesn't deserve to be treated well if she's going to treat us like this. And now everyone thinks she's some kind of success story? That's not fair to the rest of us. We were always the ones trying to make things better. Now look at her, living her best life, while we're still stuck in the same miserable situation. Why does she get to have such a perfect life? What did we ever do to deserve this? She never even tried to help us when we needed it most. All these years, we've been struggling because of her. And now she gets to enjoy the fruits of our labor while ignoring us completely. This isn't fair. I shouldn't have to accept this. When will people understand that we weren't wrong for feeling angry"

Meanwhile, I've been working hard since I started, taking extra shifts whenever possible, and still they don't give me the time off I ask for.

Every day felt like a weight on her shoulders, and the days turned into weeks, then months, and now...now it feels like years. Years since they last spoke, years since she heard his voice, years since she held his hand. It feels like the world has moved on, and yet here I am, stuck in this same place, reliving the same memories. She wonders if he ever thinks of her too, if he remembers how much she loved him. But even if he does, would it make a difference? Would anything change? All these questions swirl inside her, making her feel like she's losing herself in them. She tries to move on, to find solace in her work and friends, but nothing fills the void left by his absence. Everything reminds her of him, and she can't shake off the feeling that she'll never be happy again."

Just the empty bubbles where words should be. The silence felt heavier than usual tonight, pressing down on her like the weight of her uniform.

What if I’m just too much for him? The officer beside her raised an eyebrow at her distraction. \"Hey, you okay?\" he asked softly. She forced a smile, trying to shake off the feeling of being left behind. After all, she wasn’t exactly getting any attention from him lately. In fact, the last time he'd called, it was just to say he wouldn't make it home until late because he'd been stuck working overtime. And then there were the days when he cancelled plans without explanation, leaving her wondering if she meant anything to him. It seemed she was just another priority, one of many. What if this was what everyone felt? What if love is just something you can't afford right now? The woman in the passenger seat noticed her gaze drift towards the couple again. She nodded sympathetically and went back to her job, but she couldn't help thinking about what it would mean if she found out he was already seeing someone else. Would she still get her promotion? Would her feelings even matter"

Why focus on the negative when you could be looking at the positives? Think about it – this is someone who worked hard for everything they have. They're not complaining; they're simply pointing out that life can be tough sometimes. That's all anyone needs to hear, right? And yet...this woman feels so alone. Maybe she's comparing herself unfairly by focusing on the past. After all, everyone has their own struggles. She might be putting him on a pedestal, expecting perfection where none exists. Is that fair? No, not really. Still, does that mean her feelings are invalid? We need to keep things in perspective, don't we? In reality, maybe she's just overwhelmed. Life can get heavy, especially when you lose someone important. People often forget that. So what if she's feeling down because she misses him? It doesn't mean she's being unfair or even wrong.
