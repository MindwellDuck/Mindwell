The flames had swept through the house, taking everything but her own small bag of belongings. In the chaos of the fire department's rescue efforts, no one had seen him go in. Now, as she stood before him, she saw the weight of her grief reflected back at her. His eyes, usually bright and full of laughter, now held a deep sadness, a pain that seemed to reverberate through every cell of her being. Her hands trembled as she reached out to touch his arm, and he flinched away, his chest heaving with each ragged breath. She knew it wasn't fear; it was something else – the same thing she felt when she thought about what might have happened if she hadn't acted so quickly to grab her things and run. But she couldn't shake the image of the flames engulfing them, the sound of shattering glass and splintering wood still echoing in her mind. Her heart pounded in time with those memories, threatening to burst free whenever she thought about him, and the way his hand would always be the first to reach hers. He tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat, and all"

He shouldn't have said \"That sounds great\" when discussing their project; it sounded too casual for someone in his position. He shouldn't have felt comfortable walking into the meeting room; it was too soon for him to feel that way. He shouldn't have been there at all - it was clear he hadn't done enough preparation. He shouldn't have been seen with them; he shouldn't have been part of that group. He shouldn't have smiled so much during lunch; it was awkward.
