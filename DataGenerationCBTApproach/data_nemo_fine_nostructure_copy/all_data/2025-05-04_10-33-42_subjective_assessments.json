Her husband's footsteps echo through the house, each one a reminder of another day he'll spend retired while she's still chained to her work. She feels the familiar helplessness wash over her as she imagines the latest rejection, another grant slipped away by younger, hungrier minds. She wants to scream, to rail against the injustice of it all, but instead, she just sits there, paralyzed, as the ticking clock mocks her lack of control.",

Every day feels like a struggle, every moment spent working feels meaningless, and now this letter—this cruel joke—is just another slap in the face. It's the same thing that happened last year, and before that, and before that. And I'm just so done. She can barely focus on anything else when she thinks about how much more time she has left. She's already so far behind everyone else; she doesn’t know how much longer she can keep going like this. She knows she’s supposed to be excited for retirement, but the thought of being alone with nothing to do makes her want to cry. She wishes she could just stop working altogether, but she can't. There are bills to pay, and if she stops, they'll stop paying her too. She feels trapped, and the stress is getting worse. She can't even think straight right now because she's so tired of everything. Everything is just so hard. She feels like she's drowning in her job, and no matter how deep she goes, she can't find a lifeline. She tries to remind herself that things will get better eventually, but she can't shake off the feeling that she's running out of time. The thought of retiring soon is bittersweet; on one hand, she hopes to finally have some peace, but on the other hand, she worries that she won't enjoy it since she’ll"

The lab was quiet except for the soft hum of equipment and the occasional beep from another researcher nearby. She focused intently on the screen, checking every line of code multiple times to ensure everything was correct. As she typed, she thought about how much time she’d spent perfecting this project, how it could make all the difference in her career. But when she saw that strange blink, her mind went blank. She couldn’t think clearly; her hands were shaking. Suddenly, she felt overwhelmed and unsure if she could handle whatever might come next. It seemed like too much to deal with alone, especially at night when no one else was around."

He never appreciates anything I make for him. Now he's even stolen my dessert! He must be having an affair with someone else, because if he didn't, he would've saved the dessert for us to share tonight. But no, instead he ate it all by himself. I don't trust him anymore. This isn't the first time he's done something like this, but it feels worse than ever because I thought we were getting along better lately. I'm going to start making more food for myself so he doesn't get tempted to eat it all again. Maybe next time he'll save some for me."
