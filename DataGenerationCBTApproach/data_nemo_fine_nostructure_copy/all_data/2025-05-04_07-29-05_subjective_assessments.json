I'm too old for those things anyway. Maybe she wants me to join her at this new restaurant opening? That would be great because I could use some time away from home. But it's probably just an invite to a family dinner or something. The fact that my name was included makes me think they're trying to make me feel welcome again. It might even be a small celebration since I recently retired after 40 years in the industry! If I were there, I'd have to say hello, but I don't want to overstay my welcome or put pressure on them. They wouldn't really need me there anyway; maybe it's just another casual get-together where everyone is already there. I've been invited to several of these lately, and most of them seem pretty low-key. So, why would this one be different? It doesn't matter what I think about it. I'll probably show up just to see if it's true that they're hosting a retirement party for me. If it is, I'll be happy, but I won't let it go to my head or expect special treatment. This isn't about me; it's about celebrating the chef's graduation and welcoming him back into our community. And who knows, maybe he's inviting me to celebrate his own retirement. Anyway, I should probably RSVP to"
