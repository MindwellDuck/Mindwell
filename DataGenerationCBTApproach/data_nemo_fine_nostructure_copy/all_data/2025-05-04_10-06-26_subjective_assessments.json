She paused, stirring spoon hovering above the pot, before resolutely continuing, determined not to let it affect tonight's service.",

The dinner service was already chaotic, but now she couldn't shake off the feeling of impending doom. Every time she glanced at the card, the memory of that night flashed before her eyes—the one where she’d almost ruined everything with her careless mistake. It seemed like an eternity since then, yet the pain still lingered. Her mind began racing with worst-case scenarios: Would he remember? Would he be angry again? She tried to push aside these thoughts, focusing on the task at hand. But every stir of the risotto stirred up more memories—memories that left her breathless and bewildered. The way he looked at her, the way his voice softened when he called her “my beautiful wife.” It all came flooding back, making her feel weak in the knees. For a moment, she wondered if she could even go through with serving this dish tonight. But something inside her clicked, and she steeled herself. She took a deep breath and continued cooking, her hands moving mechanically as she tried to distract herself from the swirling thoughts in her head. It wasn’t easy, though—it felt like every step she took brought her closer to disaster. Still, she pushed forward, driven by a newfound determination. As the minutes ticked by, her anxiety slowly began to dissipate. She found herself lost in thought again, replaying moments from their past"

His stomach churned as he read the words, \"We're going to have to cut it down, but you've got a great angle here.\" He felt the familiar pang of criticism, each word echoing like a punch. The article was about his wife's struggle with depression, something she'd trusted him to share with care and compassion. Now, it felt like just another story to be chopped up for publication.",

I know my wife's struggles are real, and I'm just sharing her story because it needs to be told. But now this...it's like they don't get what we went through. They're just going to take whatever little bit we shared and turn it into some shallow piece? I'm so upset that they're doing this. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger The trigger in this case is the email from the editor regarding the article on his wife's depression. The emotions triggered by the feedback are frustration, upset, and feeling undervalued. ## Step 2: Analyze Cognitive Distortion The cognitive distortion present here is jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information. The person assumes the worst about the editorial process, making broad statements (\"They're not even trying to make it work\") and overestimating the impact of the changes (\"This is so frustrating\"). ## Step 3: Evaluate Subjective Reaction The subjective reaction reflects a deep emotional investment in the article, not just its content, but the personal significance it holds. The response jumps quickly to conclusions about the editor’s intentions and the quality of the final product without fully considering the context or potential reasons behind the cuts. ## Step 4: Reflect on Implications Reflecting on the implications of this response suggests that the individual might benefit from a more balanced perspective"

How could she think that way? Why didn't she understand what it meant to be married? How could she possibly suggest something so inappropriate? What kind of doctor sends messages like that? Did she even care about our marriage? I couldn’t imagine anything worse than having an affair with one of her patients. The idea made me feel sick to my stomach. It seemed so obvious now that she was trying to help him find love outside of our relationship. But why did she have to send those texts in the first place? If she really cared, wouldn't she have called us instead? Or maybe she wanted to make it seem like she knew something we didn't know. Maybe she was trying to distract us from something else. All I can think is that there's no way she meant it the way she said it. She must have been joking or just trying to be helpful. But what if she wasn't? What if she actually thinks that way? What if she’s not who we think she is? If I ask her about it"

It’s for the best if we just stick to professional interactions. No need to burden him with my emotional mess. But still, why did he look so concerned when I told him about my family issues? Did he really mean it when he said he was there for me? Or is it just an empty gesture, something he says out of politeness but doesn’t truly feel? I don’t know… maybe I’m reading too much into it. And besides, even if I were to tell him how I feel, I’d only end up making things awkward between us.
