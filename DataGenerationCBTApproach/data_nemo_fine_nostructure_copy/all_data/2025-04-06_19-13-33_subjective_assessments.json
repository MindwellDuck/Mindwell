As she turned off the lights, a sudden noise echoed through the empty store, making her heart pound. She froze, clutching her keys tightly, as footsteps seemed to approach. Her breath caught in her throat when she thought she saw a shadow moving outside the glass door. Fear gripped her, but she forced herself to move, hurriedly locking up and rushing towards her car parked nearby, constantly looking over her shoulder.",

But to her, I was just another guy she had to serve. That waitress has always been nice, but tonight she seemed really mean, especially since she messed up my order. And why did she have to call him by his ex-wife's name? Doesn't she know that would hurt? Just because they were married doesn't mean she can disrespect him like that. I've known her for over ten years, and it's not normal for her to forget someone's name. This is getting ridiculous. He thought he could handle it, but now he feels angry and embarrassed. She doesn't care about him anymore; she's too busy serving other customers. This whole situation made him feel like an older man, and it was just so embarrassing. He decided to take a short walk outside to clear his head, hoping the fresh air would help calm him down.

She believes that others should understand her frustration with the long wait, but this perception stems from her own biases rather than objective reality. This mental shortcut allows her to deflect attention from her lack of punctuality while maintaining a sense of self-righteousness, even though it doesn't address the root cause of her tardiness. ‚Äî Sarah (unaware) # Example Response \"Okay, so if everyone was always on time, then maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have such a long line.\" \"I think if people were more considerate, we'd see less delays.\" # Feedback This response reflects the cognitive distortion 'Should Statements'. It implies that everyone should behave in a certain manner (\"be on time,\" \"be considerate\"), which isn't necessarily true or realistic. The idea that everyone should be on time or respectful is overly simplistic and unrealistic, especially given the complexities of human behavior and life circumstances. By using \"should,\" the response creates an expectation that others must conform to these standards, which may not be possible or fair. This type of thinking can lead to unrealistic expectations and judgments about others, making it essential to recognize and challenge such thoughts when they interfere with critical thinking and empathy."
