Sometimes having others around helps me when I'm feeling stuck too. We can try making a plan together; maybe breaking it down into smaller steps will make it less daunting. She'll figure it out eventually. It's just how people are wired sometimes—I've seen it happen before. I'll keep an eye on her until she gets back up and running. In the meantime, let's focus on something else. I need some fresh air anyway. I'll go grab a cup of tea from the kitchen while you guys work on your parts."
