It’s all about saving money for him. I don’t want to work somewhere where they treat people like that. This must mean my shift is over. I’ll get out of here as soon as possible."

Her eyes dart to her watch, then to the closed door of the back office where her husband John has been for what feels like hours. She bites her lip, worry lines creasing her forehead. It's not like him to take this long on inventory. She pulls out her phone, hesitating before dialing his number.

She can't shake the feeling that something more serious is happening behind the door, and she must intervene before things escalate further."

A lone tear trickled down her cheek, landing on the book's cover, blurring the title slightly. The silence was deafening, echoing with memories of his laughter and their shared stories. She hugged the book tighter, her sorrow deepening as she realized how many more books they would never discuss together.",

His forgetfulness made her wonder if he ever thought about her at all, let alone remember the little things she did for him. Maybe it’s just easier for him to focus on himself rather than think about someone else. She sighed, feeling the weight of those moments settle over her once again."

He looks like he hasn't bathed in days, with crumbs scattered all over his clothes. His bedside table is cluttered with empty bottles, making it look like a scene from a horror movie. It's no wonder he has such poor hygiene; he probably doesn't take care of himself outside of work either. He might as well have a sign above his bed saying \"I'm sick, don't try anything\". The way he eats, with his mouth open and saliva dripping everywhere, makes me shudder. It's like he's trying to infect everyone else just by being near them. I wish someone would take responsibility for keeping this place clean. If we had more nurses like him, there wouldn't be enough beds for anyone else. And now I feel sick just thinking about touching his dirty hands."

My wife knows more than you!” He went on to claim, “You’re just a young doctor trying to prove yourself—she wouldn’t listen to you.” Dr. Lee remained calm, explaining that her father had also been misinformed by online sources and that she would be happy to help him understand what his wife’s symptoms meant. However, Mr. Thompson continued to insist that he knew best and kept interrupting her attempts to explain herself. Eventually, after several minutes of back-and-forth, Dr. Lee offered to reschedule their appointment for another time, hoping that Mr. Thompson would have cooled down.

He seemed so carefree around her, while she struggled to find joy in anything. Every time he came home early from work, she assumed he'd been thinking about another girl. That's why she kept avoiding eye contact, because every glance reminded her that she wasn't good enough for him. Even the little things, like how he smiled brighter when they were talking than usual, made her realize she was just a temporary distraction to him. When she tried to talk about her day, he barely listened, his mind clearly elsewhere. It didn't help that she knew he'd recently gone out with friends and had even talked about meeting new people at work. Now, when he walked through the door, she felt like she was competing with all those other women he met casually. His words of appreciation for her cooking felt hollow, especially since he'd complimented her sister, who lived just across the street. Her heart sank each time she heard him say \"she's great\" or \"you're lucky,\" like he was saying she was lucky instead of thanking her for making dinner. It was hard to shake off the feeling that she was nothing more than a placeholder until someone better came along. She couldn't bring herself to tell him how much she appreciated his kind words, knowing deep down that she'd never be enough for him."
