The way she was looking at him earlier though, seemed really interested in him. I wonder if she thinks he likes her back too."

She had seen that touch before, meant for her once. Now, it was a mocking echo of what they'd had.

The sound of their laughter, muffled by the walls, made her stomach twist into knots. It wasn't just the way he touched another; it was the memory of how easily he'd let go of them, how carelessly he'd discarded her. He'd been so much more than she'd imagined—stronger, kinder, and more patient. Their moments together were full of warmth and light, but now, all she saw were the shadows he'd cast when she was gone. She felt small, insignificant, as if the world had shifted on its axis while she stood still. The thought of seeing him again, of being near him, made her heart ache with longing. Yet, the pain was tempered by a bitter resentment, a sense that she didn't deserve this gift, that she was somehow less worthy. In the end, she couldn't help but wonder: Was it even fair to feel this way? Hadn't she broken the bond between them, leaving him no choice but to move on?"

Even though I didn't understand everything, I enjoyed the process of learning alongside him. Every moment we spent together, whether cooking dinner or working out, was special because we were growing as individuals. But sometimes I wished things would slow down; I wanted more time to explore our relationship, to feel comfortable with each other. I knew I was still getting used to having someone by my side, but I couldn't help feeling overwhelmed when he'd leave for work. It wasn't fair to expect him to be there all the time, especially since I was still adjusting to life outside the hospital. Still, I missed those quiet moments we shared, sitting next to each other, watching TV, or simply enjoying the silence. Maybe one day, things would settle into a rhythm, and I could find peace in being part of a team again. Until then, I kept reminding myself that even small moments counted, and I cherished every second we spent together."

After all, everyone in the lab gets along pretty well. She wasn't doing anything wrong by chatting with him; it was just a harmless exchange among friends. I mean, why would anyone be jealous of that? They're just talking about food, not making plans to meet up outside of work. What’s so bad about that?"
