It was from little Jamie, the boy who always sat alone at recess. He'd written, \"I wish you were my mom.

He thought back to how they met, the laughter they shared, and the dreams they built together. But most of all, he remembered the letter she wrote when she left, her words echoing in his mind like a cruel joke: >“I can’t stay here anymore. I have to leave you. You don’t deserve me.” >“You’re too late. I’m already gone.” Her words cut deep, but what hurt even more was the fact that she didn’t say goodbye. No one knew where she went, or why she left. All anyone could guess was that she’d found someone else, someone who deserved her. The memories swirled around him, each one a bittersweet reminder of what he’d lost. They were all reminders that he would never get her back, that she was truly gone. And as he sat there, surrounded by the silence of his study, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d ever forgive himself for letting her go. In that moment, he felt like he was drowning in grief.

Now, everything seemed dull, like a page turned too quickly. If she couldn’t hold onto anything, how could she ever move forward? In the end, there was no middle ground. You either painted from the heart, pouring every emotion into each piece, or you didn’t have what they wanted—the raw energy that made people feel. She realized that the decision wasn’t hers alone; it was about whether she was willing to risk everything for something that might never come. But then again, why take such a huge leap? Why give up everything just because one door closed? Maybe she’d always been blinded by her own ambition. Maybe the real question was, was she ready to accept that some things are meant to stay hidden, locked away forever, even if that meant giving up the dream of being seen? It was all or nothing. Either she poured her soul into every stroke, risking the pain of rejection, or she let go of her aspirations and lived a life without the possibility of true fulfillment.
