Her fingers traced the dusty edges of a once-familiar workstation, now silent since his departure. A forgotten mug still sat on the counter, a faded lipstick stain ringing its rim. She picked it up, feeling the coolness against her skin, and remembered their shared laughter echoing through these sterile halls. A sudden chill ran down her spine, not from the temperature but from the weight of his absence. The lab clock ticked on, indifferent to her melancholy.",

Every step echoed with the whispers of the past, each creak of the stairs sounded like a sigh from the ghosts that lingered here. It wasn't just the physical space; every object seemed to hold a story, a piece of him that I couldn’t shake off. His chair, where he used to sit and watch me work, now stood empty, a hollow reminder of what we had lost. Even the books on the shelves, our late-night reading companions, were just a blur of colors, no longer holding the secrets we shared beneath their pages. Every moment felt like a betrayal, as if time itself was mocking me, erasing the moments we spent together, leaving only emptiness behind. I tried to breathe, but my chest felt tight, like there was something pressing against my ribcage, reminding me that he was really gone. I couldn’t escape the pain, even when I closed my eyes, for in dreams, his face would appear, haunting me with what could have been. My hands trembled as I reached out to touch the surface of the microscope, feeling the weight of what we had built together, now shattered into a million pieces. I wondered if I’d ever find my way back, or if I’d be forever trapped in this labyrinth of memories, searching for a door that might never open. The silence was deafening, and I couldn’t help but feel that I was losing myself in"

He wasn't even the main speaker; someone else had given the presentation. I must have misheard him because I know he wouldn't talk like that. Still, why did everyone else seem so enthusiastic? It didn't feel genuine to me. I'm pretty sure I heard some people saying things like \"Wow, what an amazing achievement\" and \"This is really inspiring,\" but I don't think that's what he said. Maybe I was just too close to hear clearly. I can't believe they're giving him such recognition now. It doesn't make sense to me. I guess I could be wrong again, but I'm still convinced he didn't deserve it. The way he talked about himself seemed arrogant, especially since we've been in contact before. I remember one time, he sent me an email claiming he wrote a paper on our topic, which turned out to be a fabrication. That's why I'm skeptical about today's award. There has to be more to the story than what he shared. I’m not sure why everyone is celebrating him so much. It’s possible that I overreacted, but I still don’t see why anyone would honor him like this. I understand that people might appreciate his work, but I don't think it deserves all this attention."

Why bother? It’s all just a facade anyway. It feels like I’m drowning in work, with no one around to help me. Even when I try to explain how overwhelmed I am, they don’t really get it. They see my deadlines and my productivity reports, but they don’t hear the voice in my head telling me I’ll never meet them. No one cares about the real struggles behind the scenes – just the numbers and the pressure to perform. Maybe if I could share my true feelings, people would finally understand why I feel so trapped all the time. But until then, it’s just another exhausting day, stuck in this cycle of disappointment and frustration. Every time I sit down to write, I feel like I’m failing everyone. Not just my partner, but even myself. What’s wrong with me? Can’t I just write something decent for once? Does anyone care about my mental health? All I see are emails piling up, and my inbox keeps growing. It’s like I’m drowning in messages, none of which address my problems or offer support. Just constant reminders of what I"

He was making all sorts of ridiculous statements about spirits and souls and stuff. He was trying to sell us something too. Yeah, we have no idea what's going on. But let's not jump to conclusions right now. She might still wake up. This kind of thing makes me angry. The way you guys are reacting is exactly why people think fortune tellers are fake.

Every time she tried to push these thoughts aside, they came flooding back, like a tidal wave crashing against her soul. It seemed impossible to find peace when every possibility led down a dark path. Her heart pounded, and her breath caught in her throat, as if her body too sensed the turmoil brewing inside.
