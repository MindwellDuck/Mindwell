Maybe I was too focused on my own grief, neglecting hers. If only I’d asked more about how she was doing—would she still be here? He couldn’t shake off the feeling that his lack of emotional support had driven her away. But what if it was just a coincidence? Could she genuinely want nothing to do with me anymore? The pain hit him hard when he realized he didn’t even know where she went. Did she go back to her family? Was she with someone else? The questions swirled in his head like a vortex, pulling him deeper into despair. As he sat amidst the mess, he couldn’t help but think of all the times he’d pushed himself to focus on his research while ignoring her struggles. What if she hated being alone with me? What if she felt trapped by my need to escape into science? Perhaps she needed space to grieve, but did she ever tell me that? Or was it something more? Had she grown tired of waiting for me to heal? This time, he wondered if maybe he was the problem. What if she couldn’t handle another failure, especially one that would haunt her forever? Maybe she felt responsible for his downfall"

It was a moment frozen in time, one that seemed impossible to move past. She noticed how he held his pen between his thumb and index finger, just like he did when they were together. The way he tilted his head, ever so slightly, seemed almost familiar. But it wasn’t quite right. His gaze had changed, taking on a hollow quality that made her heart ache. She wanted to ask him what was wrong, but something stopped her. Instead, she took a step back, letting her eyes wander around the room. The furniture looked different, the colors muted. Even the sunlight streaming through the window seemed less vibrant than usual. It was as if everything had lost its warmth, leaving her feeling cold inside. She couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't real, that somehow, things needed to be different. She thought about all the times they'd spent here, laughing, talking, and making memories. Now, every object held a memory, each one a reminder of what could have been if only...if only he hadn't passed away. She felt like she was living in a dream, unable to wake up from the pain. Every sound seemed louder, every breath heavier. The silence was oppressive, making her wonder if anyone else could hear her thoughts."

When he walked into my apartment building today, he looked right at me with a smirk, and I felt like crying. It makes me feel so worthless. Maybe I'm just not good enough for him. I know I have to find a way out of this toxic relationship, but I keep thinking he'll change, that things will get better, even though deep down I know it won't. And now, after what happened at work, I'm wondering if I've wasted too much time trying to make him happy. I hate myself for staying. I wish I could just leave him, but I'm scared of losing everything - our job, friends, and maybe even my own self-worth. But honestly, I think I'd rather lose those things than deal with how miserable life has become since he came back. I feel trapped, like I’m stuck in a nightmare. Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if he were gone forever, but then I worry that I’ll never be happy again. Maybe someday I’ll realize he’s the best thing that ever happened to me, but for now, I just want to break free from all these feelings."
