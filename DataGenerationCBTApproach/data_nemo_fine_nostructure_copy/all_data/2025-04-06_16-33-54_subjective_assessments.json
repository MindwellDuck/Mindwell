A group of young nurses nearby laughed loudly, their eyes flicking towards her, then away again. One of them muttered something under her breath, too low for anyone else to hear but her. It sounded like, \"Still wearing his ring after all these years? Pathetic.\" She felt the heat rise in her cheeks as she quickly slipped off the wedding band and tucked it into her pocket, humiliation burning in her chest like a fresh wound.",

It's probably because I know how much she hates our hospital—she always has, despite being here for over a decade. Still, I shouldn't let one thing make me feel this way. It’s ridiculous, anyway. No one knows what they’re talking about when they say things like that. It’s just people trying to make themselves sound superior by making others feel inferior. But I guess it stings deep inside me, like a knife to my heart. I can’t help but think I’m pathetic, especially since I never wore rings anyway. I’ve had plenty of relationships over the years, none of which ever led to marriage, so why would I want to wear one if I wasn’t going anywhere? I suppose some might see it as a sign of weakness, but I don’t really care what they think anymore. They don’t understand my life; they wouldn’t have chosen it even if they could. Still, hearing those words made me feel like an outsider, like I didn’t belong in a place where everyone else seemed to fit together so easily. I often wonder how someone who is so entrenched in the hospital system could be so bitter, yet they keep coming back. Maybe it’s just her way of coping with her own pain—it looks like she uses other people’s misfort"

If he really did like that girl, why was he acting so friendly towards her? Was it all just a game? This line of thinking had been going through her mind for weeks, ever since she first noticed how close they were. It was irrational, she told herself, but couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to it than what seemed on the surface. Every time she saw him, she wondered if he was secretly interested in someone else. He would always be friendly and helpful, but was that just a facade? Did he genuinely care about her, or was it all just a ploy to get closer to her? She tried to push these thoughts away, but they lingered, making her feel uneasy whenever they crossed paths."

He always seemed to find new ways to disappoint her, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of resignation each time. It felt like a never-ending cycle, one she was all too familiar with.
