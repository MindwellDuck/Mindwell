His face had turned into a blazing inferno, and it wasn't just the embarrassment of showing last week's rejects—every single painting told a story of failure, each one screaming \"Don't buy this!\" As he tried to explain himself, his voice trembled like a leaf in a hurricane, making everyone wonder if he was even sane. It wasn't just about the paintings; he was literally a human firework, exploding with shame. People were looking at him with confused concern, wondering if he was going to spontaneously combust right there. The air around him seemed to be charged with the electricity of his humiliation, and everyone knew they needed to keep a safe distance for fear of getting zapped by his emotional flames."

I realized then that our whole life together had been about him, never truly mine. The moment I stopped being his rock, he forgot about me. She couldn't help but feel betrayed by the simple truth: If I hadn't been there to encourage him, he wouldn't have even received the award. But now, every time we were together, I felt like a reminder of what he’d lost—a constant reminder that I didn’t deserve to be loved. Our marriage was nothing more than a means to an end for him. I was his path to glory, his ticket to fame. He didn’t love me; he used me until he got what he wanted, and then he threw me away."

The rain outside seemed to mock him, tapping against the window like a reminder of all the things he wasn't doing, all the people he wasn't with. He looked at the photo on his nightstand, a younger version of himself smiling beside an ex-wife who now lived halfway across the country. As he got ready for another day at the store, he caught his reflection in the mirror and saw the bags under his eyes, the lines etched deeper by the years since she'd left.

Maybe life would have been different then, maybe they’d find happiness again, but the reality was clear: her leaving had changed everything. It wasn’t just the house or the money; it was the way she made him feel, like I’m not enough, like I could never truly be hers. She said it was because I wasn’t good enough, but what does that even mean? What if she really meant it when she told me she couldn’t stay? What if she didn’t love me anymore? It’s easy to imagine a different path, one where we worked through our issues, where we grew together, where she stayed. But that’s not how it played out. Life doesn’t work that way. Sometimes you get stuck in the same place, watching others move forward while you’re left behind. That’s what this apartment feels like—a constant reminder of what could’ve been, of all the moments lost. I can see myself sitting here forever, surrounded by memories of us, wondering what would have been if we had stayed. Even though he knew"

Still, what if...? What if... I shook my head. No, no, this is irrational. But why did it sound so intentional? That floorboard doesn't usually make that kind of noise. And what if...? No, stop! Stop thinking like this. You're overreacting. The floorboards just creak sometimes. Just go get your paintbrushes; you have work to do. Okay, fine. Let’s see where it takes us. If I weren’t such a worrywart, maybe I wouldn’t even think about breaking ins. But now that I am, I can’t shake it off. Maybe it really happened. What if... Stop it. This isn’t helping. Why are you doing this to yourself? The floorboards don’t creak like that. You’re just imagining things. But what if... It’s 3 AM. My bedroom window is open. I’m not home. What if...? What if...
