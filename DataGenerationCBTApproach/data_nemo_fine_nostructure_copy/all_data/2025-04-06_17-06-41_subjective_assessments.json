Across the street, their old tree still stood, its leaves now a fiery red, mirroring the hue of the photograph she'd seen earlier that day - their daughter's wedding, which she had missed due to an assignment she'd chosen over family. The regret tasted bitter on her tongue as she swallowed it down with the rainwater.",

It was nothing more than a routine stop for groceries, and then she'd be home by herself. No need to think about her daughter's wedding; it wasn't like she'd planned to miss it anyway. The woman didn't seem to notice me standing there, but I'm pretty sure she knew exactly what I was thinking. She must have felt just as much disappointment as I did when we lost our chance at being part of that special day. Maybe she even wondered why I wasn't there to share in her joy? After all, who wouldn't feel sad about missing such a momentous occasion? I couldn't help but wonder if she'd ever forgive me for choosing work over family. There was no way she would understand how hard this decision was, especially since she'd never experienced anything similar. Still, I imagined she might appreciate knowing that my absence wasn't out of spite, but rather because I prioritized something else. It seemed unlikely she'd take the time to consider my perspective, though. People often don't see things from other people's point of view, and I figured this woman was no exception. As I watched her stand under the rain, I realized she probably felt the same sadness I did. We were both victims of circumstance, each carrying the weight of our own regrets. Her life must have been filled with memories of happy moments, but I doubted she'd ever"

Doesn’t she understand what that means? How could she do this to someone who loved her? She should have known better than to make things harder for herself and for us. This is all too much for me. I just want to cry. I feel so alone. If she had really cared, she wouldn’t have left like this. She should’ve stayed and fought for us. What happened to our love? She shouldn’t have abandoned me like this. Shouldn’t she care more about what we shared? We weren’t meant to part. How could she betray me like this? She should’ve been grateful for the life we built together. She doesn’t deserve to move on now. Everyone will see this, and she’ll be remembered as a cheater. Shouldn’t she have thought about how this would affect me? She shouldn’t have caused such pain for no reason. She should have chosen me over her new life. I don’t know why she would do this.

The speaker’s thoughts reveal an inability to fully acknowledge the emotional impact of the situation, instead choosing to minimize its importance with statements like “nothing,” “don’t read too much into it,” and “it means nothing.” These comments suggest a tendency to overlook the potential positivity associated with the experience, as well as its relevance to"

I remember one day, we were getting ready for work, and she stopped me, her eyes serious. \"Be careful today,\" she said. I brushed it off, thinking she must've been worried about traffic, but now I wonder if she saw something I missed. Maybe she sensed something in the air that I didn't.
