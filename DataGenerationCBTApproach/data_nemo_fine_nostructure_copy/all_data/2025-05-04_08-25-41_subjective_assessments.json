It was a complaint about his teaching methods, unsigned but harsh in its criticism. He sat alone in his classroom after hours, the words blurring before him as he felt the familiar pang of unhappiness, this time tinged with anger. Another voice telling him he wasn't good enough, another day where his passion seemed to fall on deaf ears.",

She couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong, even though she knew it was just her imagination playing tricks on her. This time, it felt different. Maybe it was the early hour, but the silence seemed oppressive, like a weight pressing down on her. She didn't want to be alone anymore; she needed to hear his voice, to know he was safe. But deep down, she feared what might happen if he stayed gone forever. This was how she felt whenever he left, but this time, it felt worse. She wondered if she would ever get used to being alone again. As the night wore on, she kept thinking about how much she missed him. She imagined all the things they could have done together, but now those memories seemed distant, like they belonged to someone else. The house, once filled with laughter and life, now felt cold and empty, a reminder that he was gone. Every tick of the clock made her feel more alone, until she wondered if she'd ever find happiness again. For her, the silence was never just silence. It was the sound of our thoughts, and hers were loud enough to drown out everything else. She saw"

We have two kids, and they're always getting into mischief, making it hard to get back to sleep. My wife gets frustrated easily when we can't find anything in the kitchen, but then she calms down and laughs about it. Her parents are retired, so they don't have work-related stress that affects them at night. They can handle the occasional noise from the neighbors. It doesn't bother me as much because I know how stressful work can be, especially when you have to deal with difficult people all day. But honestly, I wish I could be like him sometimes - someone who doesn't need medication to fall asleep. If only I had some of his calmness, I wouldn't feel anxious and alone in the dark. We've been together for over ten years, and I love her for her kindness, her patience, and her ability to understand me. Sometimes, though, I think about what it would be like if I were one of those guys who never has to worry about money or work stress. Maybe I'd be happier, but I don't think so.

Anyway, now that I think about it, he did seem a bit off that morning. A little distracted, maybe even depressed. But hey, who wouldn’t be after losing someone they loved? It’s funny how we can miss so many signs around us when we’re not paying attention. Like how he kept saying things like “I need some time alone” and “This is all so overwhelming,” which made me think maybe he wasn’t coping well. Still, I never really asked him if everything was okay because… I don’t know, I guess I didn’t want to push him? Maybe I was just trying to protect myself by giving him space.
