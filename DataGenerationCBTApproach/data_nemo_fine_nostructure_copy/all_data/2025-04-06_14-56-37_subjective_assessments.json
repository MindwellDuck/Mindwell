Tonight, a group of rowdy teens lingered outside, laughing too loud, smoking cigarettes they shouldn't have. One sniggered, \"Hey, isn't that your boyfriend?\" as another mimicked his earlier interaction with an elderly customer.\n\nHe felt heat rise in his cheeks, not from embarrassment, but from hatred. It burned like bile in his throat, choking him. He strode towards them, fists clenched, ready to unleash years of pent-up fury. But a passing car's headlights caught the teens' faces, reminding him of their youth. His rage fizzled into despair. He turned away, shoulders slumped, leaving them behind in confused silence.",

I'm surprised she doesn't hate him for leaving me. What does she see in him? He looks tired all the time, always slouching. And those wrinkles? They must be deep scars from some traumatic experience. The way he talks, it sounds like he’s bored out of his mind. How could anyone love someone like that? It’s hard not to feel jealous seeing them together. I wonder what she sees in him. Does she really love him? Or is this just another case of \"you are what you eat\"? Maybe she loves him more than I loved her, which makes sense. After all, she’s young again, while I’ve been stuck in my 40s forever. She probably thinks she’s living her best life now that she has him. But let’s be real; she's just trying to fill the void left by losing her previous relationship. That guy was probably just using her until he found someone better. There had to be something wrong with him. I bet if I got to know him, I’d realize why she dumped him"

It's almost like she knows exactly what I'm thinking right now - that I'll probably end up crying on stage and everyone will see how pathetic I am. Like she can read my mind or something. I don't want to hear this anymore, but somehow I still feel like I need to prove myself to her, like I have to show her that I'm capable of more than just being mediocre. This is insane. Why would anyone think I could beat someone like her? But deep down, I hope she does think I have a shot, because then maybe...just maybe...I can finally let go of my shame and find closure. But no, she's too smart for that; she's already imagining how I'll fail miserably. Oh well, it doesn't matter anyway, since we both know it's a lost cause. I guess I should have stayed home today, but now that I'm here, I might as well give it a shot. Maybe I'll surprise everyone, including myself. Who knows"
