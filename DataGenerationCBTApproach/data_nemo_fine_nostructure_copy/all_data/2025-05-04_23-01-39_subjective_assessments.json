A young employee, barely out of his teens, laughed as he tossed a vintage, hand-painted sign into the dumpster behind the counter. The old man watched, feeling the bile rise in his throat, as the sign landed among the rotting remnants of once-treasured items. He knew then that nothing would remain sacred if this was how they treated the past.",

I mean, have you seen those other stores? They're full of junk from decades ago. What makes his store so special anyway? It's ridiculous. This guy has been running the store for over three decades, and now you think he'll just keep everything? Do you even realize what it means to carry that kind of responsibility? And don't even get me started on the prices. If anything, he should be charging more for these relics than he does. But no, instead, we get entitled customers like... well, like you. This isn't about being \"harsh,\" it's about perspective. I'm simply pointing out the absurdity of expecting him to keep every single item when there are plenty of other places doing the same thing. Maybe he'll donate some things, but keeping them all? That's unrealistic. It's like comparing apples and oranges—both have their value, but not necessarily in the way people assume. You want to talk about unfair comparisons? How about this: Every time someone brings up my store, they say ours is \"the best\" because we have more modern equipment. Meanwhile, they ignore the fact that our sales are half of yours. So, which one really is \"better\"? Just saying. I'm not trying to make excuses; I'm just setting"

The city lights reflect ominously in their eyes, or so it seems to him. His hand instinctively reaches for his sidearm, reassuringly cold and heavy.

That’s why this whole situation happened in the first place. It really isn’t fair how easily she got out of our relationship. She was always so perfect—organized, supportive, and caring.

Now, I'm having trouble shaking off the feeling that there might be more going on than just forgetfulness. Maybe she's still upset about what happened last week? Or is she worried about her job again? It's hard to believe this is just an oversight. There must be something else bothering her, making her forgetful. I can't help but wonder if she's stressed about something, even though we've talked about everything lately. This feels like one symptom of a larger problem, and I need to figure out what it is before it affects us both more seriously. I wish she'd explain herself, but she's usually quiet in the morning.

But what about all the times I’ve stood by her side? All the nights I've listened to her cries? They say I’m too sensitive, that I hold onto things too long. They say I’m selfish because I want more from this relationship than just comfort. I remind them that I do everything to make her happy. I even sacrifice my own needs for her sake, but no matter what I do, they don’t appreciate it. They see me as weak, unable to handle the pressure of being in love. Maybe if I wasn't so emotional, we wouldn’t be here, facing the same problems over and over again. It’s not my fault that she doesn’t try to lift herself up. She says she wants change, but when I suggest something concrete, she dismisses it. She says she can’t help feeling sad sometimes, that she’s “just a hopeless romantic.” Doesn’t she realize that people are supposed to be happy? Why is she so focused on the past? Does she think we’re going to live happily ever after like those cheesy rom-coms? She wants me to wait forever, hoping someday she’ll find the strength to move"
