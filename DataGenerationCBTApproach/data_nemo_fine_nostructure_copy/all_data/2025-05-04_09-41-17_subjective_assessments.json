It makes sense that security cameras would capture everything but somehow missed this crime. What if he did it because he didn't want to deal with the hassle of going home? His anger intensifies as he thinks about all the times he had to cover for Jim when he took breaks. This isn't just about money; it's about betrayal. The fact that Jim hasn't spoken up yet suggests he knows what happened and is choosing to stay quiet. Maybe he's afraid of retaliation, or maybe he's involved in some shady dealings. If he were innocent, wouldn't he be speaking out by now? When Jim doesn't show up for work tomorrow, he'll know exactly what happened. His mind is already racing ahead to the confrontation that will surely follow. The thought of having to confront someone he once trusted fills him with dread, making the pain of the situation even worse."

I shared my gift, offering a glimpse into the shadows of his past. The words were laced with truth, yet veiled in subtlety. \"I see your path,\" I began, \"a road fraught with regret. Your heart heavy with sorrow.\" His eyes locked onto mine, the weight of those words settling deep within him. In that moment, I knew I had reached him. My words wove a tapestry of hope and despair, a reflection of his deepest fears and desires. As I spoke, the room around us dissolved, leaving only the echoes of his past. It was then that I realized—this wasn't just fortune telling; it was a journey through the labyrinth of his mind, where the lines between reality and memory blurred. With each whispered promise, I felt myself becoming a part of his story, weaving threads of fate that would forever change the course of his life. In that moment, I understood that the power lay not in predicting the future, but in guiding him toward the truth, no matter how difficult the path ahead may seem. And though the world outside might think me mad, I know the truth: I am merely a messenger, carrying the whispers of the universe to those who seek answers in the darkness."

Even the smallest moments now felt like they were part of a larger, unending cycle of grief, one that showed no signs of slowing down. Each passing day felt like it was slowly draining the color from her world, leaving behind a dullness that threatened to consume her. Her mind raced with thoughts of how much more difficult life would be once the pain of losing him faded into memory. She couldn’t help but wonder if this sense of sadness would ever truly subside, or if it would forever be a part of who she was. Her days blended together, each feeling endless, filled with nothing but the ache of his absence. Even the few times she tried to find joy in small things—like watching the sunset, reading a book—it all felt hollow. There was no escape from the sorrow that lingered, haunting every corner of her life.

That wasn't something they would have done before. They seemed comfortable enough to be giggling at jokes they probably hadn't even told each other yet. It's not fair. I've been working hard for months, putting in extra hours, just to get back where I started. And now, someone else gets to enjoy all the fun? Someone who doesn't have to work twice as hard just to catch up? She felt the anger rising, wondering why she had to fight so much harder while others seemed to coast through life. It wasn't right. She was the one who deserved better, but somehow, he got the chance to move on. The pain came flooding back as she watched them, their happiness a harsh reminder of what she felt she'd lost. It wasn't just about him moving on; it was about how unfair it all felt. Life shouldn't be so cruel, especially not after everything she’d been through.
