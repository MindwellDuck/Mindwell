This situation reminds her of all those times in the past where she made mistakes, and it seems like every single one turned into a bigger problem than what it actually was. This reminds her of other similar situations in her life where she got stressed, and then it escalated even more than expected. Now, she worries that something worse will happen, and she can’t stop thinking about all the ways things could go wrong. She tries to tell herself it’s just a small thing, but deep down, she knows it’s building up, much like the panic attacks that happened after she missed deadlines or forgot important events. She doesn’t know why these thoughts keep coming back to haunt her; they always seem to show up at the worst possible moments. It’s like her brain is constantly looking for reasons to believe that nothing good will come next, even though she knows intellectually that it probably won’t be as bad as she thinks. She starts to wonder if there’s anything she could have done differently to prevent this feeling, and then she starts questioning whether she’s doing enough to prepare for other potential problems that might arise in the future."

If she was just busy, wouldn't she have checked in? This isn't how our relationship works! She must have forgotten or something. But then why did she agree to meet up earlier? Did she really forget about us? Or maybe she's just playing hard to get, testing my patience. Either way, it’s killing me that we're going to sit down together and eat alone tonight, like always.
