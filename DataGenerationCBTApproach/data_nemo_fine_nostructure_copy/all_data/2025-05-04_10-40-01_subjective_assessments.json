Anxiety begins to stir, a familiar gnawing feeling. She checks the kitchen, living room, bathroom - nothing. The clock reads 6:30 AM. They're never up this early without her. She texts tentatively, \"Hey, everything ok?\" No immediate reply. Twenty minutes later, she hears the front door open. Her partner walks in with a bag from their favorite bakery, grinning, oblivious to the worried silence that hung heavy in their absence.",

Hadn't he noticed anything off? She thought back to the previous night, trying to recall every little detail, but it all blended together in a haze of confusion. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, even though she knew logically that there had to be a reasonable explanation for his sudden departure. She glanced around the apartment again, taking in the same old sights, yet each time her mind conjured new, disturbing scenarios. It was as if she was trapped in a perpetual loop of doubt, unable to let go of the anxiety that threatened to consume her. Every second ticked by, leaving her more agitated than before, with no clear direction to turn to. She began to wonder if maybe she was overreacting, if somehow she'd misinterpreted everything. But then she remembered how he'd always been so reliable, how he'd been there for her through thick and thin. Now, here she was, questioning whether he might actually be gone forever. Panic set in, making her chest tight and her breath shallow. She tried to remind herself that she needed to think clearly, that rationality would help her navigate this crisis, but her mind refused to calm down. She couldn't focus on anything except the nagging fear that he might have left her. With each passing moment, her thoughts grew more jumbled"

Now, she’s lost everything – me, our life together, even our home. I know she thinks I’m dead, but deep down, I think she knows I'm alive somewhere. Maybe if she can hold onto something like this, maybe she’ll start to see signs, realize I’m not really gone. I'll come back to her, make all this pain worth it. I don’t want her to grieve anymore.

This is what she wanted; she asked me to keep working. But can you blame me? That man out there... He doesn’t deserve to breathe another day. If I could turn back time, I’d make him pay. My mind isn’t ready to accept that he walked away with our lives. This is why I always carry my gun. Not just for protection, but as a reminder. For every time I see something like this, I feel like I’m reliving the pain all over again. It’s not fair. She was such a wonderful person, and I know she wouldn’t want us to lose ourselves in grief. Yet, how can I truly let go when someone else gets to live while we suffer? Life isn’t fair, and sometimes, I wonder if God even exists. Or maybe He does, but I don’t think so. We’re alone in this world, forced to navigate its cruelty without any real help. Even doctors like me aren’t immune to the darkness. Sometimes I wish I didn’t have to work anymore.

The words on that page seemed to hold a weight I couldn’t quite grasp, like trying to hold water in your hands. It wasn’t until I looked closer that reality set back in. The letter was dated before our divorce was even finalized. My mind reeled as I tried to process how this could have happened. I felt so caught off guard that I almost missed the part about him asking for forgiveness, and I thought he was just saying “oh yeah” because I was there. Then I realized he meant it literally and said “oh yes”. He must’ve written it after our separation, but before our final court hearing. The truth is, I didn’t expect to find anything from him, let alone something so intimate and personal. But now that I know what it is, I feel guilty for opening it. Maybe I shouldn’t be here reading his private thoughts; maybe I’m just making things harder than they need to be by confronting these feelings through his words. Yet, the more I read, the more I feel like I’m missing something important. Like I'm looking at half of a puzzle, never knowing what"

It reflects the 'All or Nothing Thinking' cognitive distortion because it portrays the situation in binary terms, with no middle ground. It implies that either the software will work flawlessly, or everything will fail catastrophically, leaving no room for compromise or gradual improvement. The response demonstrates how the individual might be unable to see beyond these extremes, viewing the situation as either completely successful or completely disastrous, rather than recognizing potential for incremental progress or adjustments along the way."

They didn't know the depth of her love, the bond between them forged over countless nights spent walking these same paths. She had once spoken of this moment, how she wanted to watch the sunset over the city one last time, surrounded by those who loved her most. Now, she wasn't there, and neither were all the others he thought would be. Only strangers laughed and talked, oblivious to the emptiness that filled him. He couldn't help but feel like a fool for returning to this spot, as if trying to relive the past would somehow bring her back. The city lights twinkled, but none shone bright enough to chase away the darkness that clung to every memory of her. Every day felt like another test, another chance for the world to prove its cruelty. He felt like a ghost haunting these streets, forever trapped in a cycle of sorrow. Even the wind sounded different now, its gentle rustle a harsh reminder that everything moved forward, leaving him behind. He stood there, frozen in the cold, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with colors he knew wouldn't last. It was just another night, another"
