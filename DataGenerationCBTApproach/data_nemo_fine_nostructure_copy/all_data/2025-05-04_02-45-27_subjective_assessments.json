She’s been saying that since our daughter left home three years ago. I know she doesn't mean it, but sometimes her words cut deep. It's like she sees me as incapable of learning anything new, even though I've picked up other skills quickly enough throughout my life. Sometimes I feel like she picks out every little mistake I make in front of people, like I'm on trial or something. I get frustrated with her constant criticism, especially when it comes from someone who claims to be supportive. My friends are always telling me to talk to her about this stuff, but honestly, I don’t want to. Whenever we have conversations like this, she ends up being right, which makes me feel like an idiot. It feels like no matter what I do, nothing will ever be good enough for her. Even though she says she loves me, I can tell by the way she looks at me during arguments that she doesn’t really care. She never tries to understand where I'm coming from, and her responses always seem to be ready before I even finish speaking. It’s like she’s waiting for me to mess up so she can pounce on it. I’ve tried talking to her about how this affects me, but she just laughs it off, saying I need to “toughen up.” Like, who does she think she"

Maybe we have a serial killer in our neighborhood. It would be such a relief if someone could finally put an end to these strange occurrences. I hope they catch whoever is doing it soon. I feel bad for the victims but I guess it's just the way things go sometimes. I'm going to call the police again today to see if anyone has reported anything. This time I'll make sure to ask about the suspicious person who keeps lurking around. If it is a stalker, I want to know now before it gets out of control. I will find out what's going on even if it takes all night. Maybe I'll try calling a few more times before I give up. It won't hurt to check, right? I've been wondering if it's possible for someone to actually commit a crime while being watched by neighbors. But hey, if they do get caught, there might be some justice served. That would definitely be nice. And who knows, maybe the perpetrators will think twice about committing crimes if everyone knows where they"
