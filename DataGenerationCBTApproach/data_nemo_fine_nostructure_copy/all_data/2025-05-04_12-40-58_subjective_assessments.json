I guess you could say she should have been kinder."

I don’t understand why he would be upset about it; it doesn't mean anything to me. Everyone has different accents, but if you're going to point out someone else’s accent, then you should do the same for your own. Maybe he was just being sensitive because she corrected him during their weekly book club meeting. If she can correct him there, maybe she can correct him anywhere. I wouldn’t be surprised if she corrects other students’ accents as well. She might even think it’s funny when she does it, which makes me wonder what she says when she’s talking to herself. Maybe she corrects everyone in front of her just to see how they react. It’s probably harmless, but it still bugs me that she did it. So, now I’m wondering if she’ll correct my accent next time we meet up. I hope she doesn’t say anything embarrassing about it. I know she likes to tease people, especially when they’re speaking loudly, so maybe she'll start correcting everyone's accents at our meetings."
