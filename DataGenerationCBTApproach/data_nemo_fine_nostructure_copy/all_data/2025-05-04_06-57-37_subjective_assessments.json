Even now, years later, it brings back memories of our conversations before she started working here. That moment still hurts because it shows how much I miss her. I know I shouldn't be feeling this way, but I am anyway. She's supposed to be someone new, but deep down, I keep seeing her as the woman I loved. I guess I'm just not ready for her to become just another coworker yet. Every time we meet, it's like stepping into a different room, one filled with old memories. I try to shake off these feelings, but they linger. Maybe I need some time to get used to the idea of moving on.

The person assumes the worst-case scenario (being dropped off at the wrong stop) and then starts worrying about potential consequences, such as missing work or paying penalties, simply because the driver seemed impatient. This demonstrates the 'jumping to conclusions' cognitive distortion by drawing conclusions from little evidence and exaggerating the situation. In reality, there could be many reasons why the driver was acting impatiently, none of which would involve leaving the passenger behind. By jumping to conclusions, this person is creating unnecessary stress and anxiety over something that may not even happen. The distorted thinking reflects a lack of critical evaluation and a tendency to catastrophize based on incomplete information. # Reference: * [Cognitive Distortions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cognitive-disorders/2016/20-common-cognitive-distortions-what-they-are-and-how-they-affect-you) # Additional Resources: [How to Challenge Cognitive Distortions](https://www.psychologytoday.com"

A faint chill lingered in the empty room, despite the hum of the heater. As she began to gather her belongings, a small, worn-out notebook fell from her bag onto the desk. It was filled with her late mother's elegant handwriting, each page a memory of their shared love for poetry. She picked it up, tracing the familiar script, and felt a sudden pang of melancholy. Her eyes welled up as she thought about how they used to sit together on Sundays, discussing poems, their voices blending like music. Now, only silence echoed in her mother's empty chair.",

The world moved forward, yet for her, nothing ever changed. She felt stuck in this endless loop of grief, unable to find solace in anything. Even the joy that came with reading her mother's favorite books was tainted now, reminding her too much of what she'd lost. Every time she opened one of those volumes, she saw her mother's face, smiling down at her, as if urging her to keep going. But every smile made her cry harder, because she knew she would never experience such moments again. And so, she kept reading, holding onto those words, hoping somehow they would bring back her mother. Yet, no matter how hard she tried, all they did was make her miss her more. It wasn’t just books that held her back; even simple things became difficult. When she went to buy groceries, she couldn't shake off the feeling of loneliness. The aisles were crowded, full of families laughing and chatting over food, while she stood there, silently holding a carton of eggs, trying to pretend she didn't notice.
