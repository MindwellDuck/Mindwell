The cook whispered something to another colleague, who stifled a laugh.

Her mother, at the stove, turns to greet her with a warm smile. \"There you are, dear,\" she says, ladling stew into bowls.

Her mother looks up, surprise flashing across her face. \"Well, it's been so long since we had a proper family dinner...I thought it might be nice,\" she replies softly, setting the bowls down. The woman takes hers without comment, resentment simmering just beneath the surface as she sits alone at the table meant for four.",

She wonders if her mom even remembers how much she dislikes her stew, but doesn’t really care enough to say anything about it now. It’s probably fine, anyway, because it smells good and there’s nothing better than being home with her mom. But she can tell by the way her mom put together the meal that she spent a lot of time cooking. Maybe she was thinking about her own past when she made this? That would explain why she made such a big deal out of having everyone over tonight. It wouldn’t mean anything to anyone else, but to her, it feels like an invitation. And maybe it’s something more than that? Maybe it’s a sign that her mom has finally forgiven her for leaving? She feels a pang of guilt for feeling this way, but quickly pushes it aside. She doesn’t want to overthink things right now. She needs to focus on getting through this dinner without saying anything too awkward. After all, it’s been years since they last sat down together, and she knows how hard it is for people to reconnect. She forces a smile onto her face, hoping to ease the tension, but inside, she’s still wondering what her mom might really be thinking. Is she just trying to fill some kind of void, or does she actually hope to reconnect? Either way, her mom seems genuinely happy to see her, and that makes everything okay."

My mind immediately went to her being irresponsible and not taking care of our space. It seemed so out of character, especially since she always left the place tidy. I felt like I was walking into some kind of scene from a movie where someone else's mess is suddenly laid out before your eyes. When I opened the fridge, I saw an almost empty container of yogurt, which made me think about how she must have forgotten to go grocery shopping again. Or maybe she didn't even want to buy anything because she was busy with work? The thought hit me hard because, honestly, I'd been feeling neglected lately too. She'd barely talked to me during the day, and when we did talk, it was mostly about things unrelated to us. I began to wonder if this was all part of her plan to make me feel left out. As I sat down at the table, I couldn't shake off the feeling of frustration. Why was she doing this? Wasn't she supposed to be here, waiting for me, making dinner? Instead, I found myself wondering if she'd ever change her ways, if she really cared enough to put in effort. I started to imagine"

As he walked in, late due to traffic, he noticed the room filled with familiar faces - except they weren't looking at him.

Front and center was John, dressed as a flamingo for the 'wacky wildlife' theme, dancing enthusiastically without noticing his pants had split open.

The photos showed officers having fun, laughing together, and enjoying each other’s company – including some shots where he was front and center. But what really caught his attention was when one of the slides featured him in a compromising position – wearing a flamingo costume, dancing freely, and showing off his ripped pants. It was as if time stood still; every eye in the room seemed fixed on him, and he could sense their whispers. At first, he tried to play it cool, pretending everything was fine, but the more he looked around, the more he felt like an outsider. Even though he knew he wasn’t the focus, his mind kept drifting back to the image. He started thinking about how he must have looked – not just as a flamingo but as someone who didn’t fit in. His mind began to fill in gaps, imagining how awkwardly he must have danced, and how uncomfortable everyone else might have been seeing him like that. It wasn’t until the meeting organizer finally spoke up that John broke free from his thoughts. She explained that the pictures were meant to celebrate the camaraderie among officers, and she encouraged everyone to share their own stories. However, the moment she finished speaking, John felt a strange sense of relief wash over him. It was as if the distraction allowed him to forget about his embarrassment, at least for now"

The young couple seemed happy, which made him feel even worse - it was like they were celebrating something he could never be a part of again. The fact that they didn't notice him sitting there with them was probably because they were too caught up in each other's company to pay attention to anything else. He wondered if they knew about the bench they were using; maybe they were trying to honor her memory by feeding the ducks too. Maybe they wanted to make sure everyone who visited the park saw how much joy life could bring after losing someone so important. He looked away, feeling like he was intruding on their happiness. It wasn't just the bench; he felt like he was interrupting a moment of peace. The park seemed quieter than usual, almost as if people had stopped coming here once she passed. But this young couple was making up for it, their laughter carrying further than it usually would. It sounded like they were having the time of their lives, completely carefree. They seemed to have forgotten all about the sadness that lingered around the park. Even the ducks seemed more lively than usual, as if they sensed the atmosphere had shifted. I wonder what they know about this place that I don't? Are they somehow connected to her, or is this just another coincidence? Maybe they're related to her, or perhaps they've heard stories about the special bond"
