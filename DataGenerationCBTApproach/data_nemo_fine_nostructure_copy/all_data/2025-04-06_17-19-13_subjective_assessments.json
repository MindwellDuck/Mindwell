He felt a familiar sting, but now it was laced with bitterness. His hands tightened around the bag of groceries, a bruised apple tumbling to the ground. He walked away, leaving it behind.",

She seemed so carefree, her laughter infectious, while he felt like he was suffocating under the weight of his own disappointment. The memory lingered, making him question whether this was all there was for him – to watch life pass him by, alone. Maybe he wasn’t meant to be happy anymore. He thought about how she moved on quickly, finding someone else to share moments like that with. It made him wonder if she ever missed him, or if she had simply moved on because she could. That thought stung, as if the pain was still raw and fresh. Yet, deep down, he couldn't help but feel like part of him wanted her back, even though he knew it was futile. This time, when he looked at the apple, he just threw it away."
