Would I have been seen as an artist worth more than just a footnote? Or was it already too late, my creations too insignificant for anyone to care? As he walked out of the gallery, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he’d missed his chance. What if they'd stopped to look closer? Maybe I could've shown them the depth of my vision, the stories hidden beneath the surface. But now, with every step back into the city, he felt like leaving behind more than just a canvas. He had left behind a piece of himself, a part of his soul that lingered in that gallery, waiting for someone to notice. The thought haunted him, making him wonder if he truly belonged among the artists he saw each day, or if he was always meant to be in the shadows. ---"

She never loved me, even though she said she did. I tried to be patient, but it was all a lie. Now, as I sit here alone, I realize it wasn't just one time, it was a pattern. A pattern of rejection and abandonment. And I can’t help but wonder if anyone else ever really felt that way about her, or if she’s been doing this all along."
