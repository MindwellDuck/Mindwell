Tonight, a couple passed her, laughing and holding hands. Their joy echoed off the empty sidewalks, each laugh a needle prick against her heart. She quickened her pace, hugging her coat tighter around her, the chill seeping into her bones more deeply than usual.",

We both live in the same neighborhood, so every day, when I'm walking back from work, I see her. Sometimes she's with friends, sometimes she's by herself. But tonight was different. She stood there all alone, and it broke my heart. I felt like crying just looking at her. It's hard being apart, but knowing she's out there makes me want to come home sooner."

I'm starting to think that this isn't going to change. I've seen it before—she'd promise to be better, but then life would get busy, and she'd fall right back into the same patterns. Maybe I shouldn't expect anything different now. She'll probably show up late again, and we'll just have another argument about it. That sounds like what will happen. Again. And again. This is just how things are with her. The way she handles her schedule is always so... irresponsible."

The new clerk, barely out of high school, laughed with a familiar ease around her, an ease he'd never known. She leaned into their conversation, her eyes sparkling. His stomach churned as she touched his arm, laughing again. He watched them from afar, stocking shelves mechanically, each giggle a dagger in his heart. Another customer asked him a question, but his ears rang, drowning out the words. He could only stare at them, feeling small and alone amidst the fluorescent lights and endless aisles.",

They were meant to be together, he thought, recalling the day she showed up at his doorstep. But now, he saw the way she moved with confidence, her laughter echoing through the store. Her touch felt like a betrayal, like she didn't even notice him standing there. It wasn’t until another woman approached him, asking for help, that he realized what was happening. The new clerk seemed oblivious to the tension between them, chatting freely with customers. When a boy asked for her number, she smiled and handed it over, her smile lighting up the room. It was then he understood: this wasn't about him; she simply had a bubbly personality. He returned to restocking, trying to shake off the feeling of insignificance. The sound of her laughter continued, blending with the hum of the store, a reminder that he couldn’t control everything. Perhaps, he thought, she just needed someone to talk to. Maybe her happiness wasn’t about him at all."

It's just an unfair decision, but I'm not letting it get to me because I know what’s best for him. We need someone who can handle the responsibilities of being a leader, and that’s not him yet. I’m still trying to understand why they chose him instead of us, though. Maybe we're just not as qualified, which is why we weren't considered.
