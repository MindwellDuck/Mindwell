She tries to push those thoughts aside, telling herself it’s pointless to dwell on such things now. But as she looks around at other parents enjoying time with their kids, she feels like an outcast, stuck in her grief. Even though she knows she needs to be grateful for what she has left, she finds it hard to appreciate anything right now."

He hadn't felt this paralyzed since his divorce five years ago. Today, even the familiar smell of oil paint and turpentine failed to soothe him.

Every failure from the past would come flooding back, and he could almost hear his mother’s voice, echoing in his ear, “You’ll never make it.” The pressure felt suffocating, making every breath shallow. It wasn’t just the fear of rejection that crippled him—it was the memory of all those times he’d spent hours, days, even months on pieces that ended up being rejected by galleries. Each time, he saw himself failing, not just as an artist but as a man. He remembered the countless nights spent crying alone, wondering if he was good enough, if he deserved better than to be dismissed so easily. Those moments had become a part of him, a constant reminder that no matter how hard he tried, he would always be on the outside looking in. Now, here he was, staring at his latest piece, trying to convince himself that it was different, that this one wouldn’t end in disappointment, but the doubts lingered. What if he couldn’t keep going? What if he finally reached his limit? He looked around his studio, taking in the scattered canvases and half-finished projects. They all seemed to mock him—a testament to his inability to succeed. Some were beautiful, others mediocre, but they all represented his failures. The paintings"
