The familiar clatter of pots and pans echoed through the empty kitchen; everyone else had left hours ago. He reached for his phone to call her, just like every night after service, but stopped himself. She'd changed her number months ago, the final slice in their divorce.

But he didn't mind—there was plenty to keep him occupied. He decided to surprise her with her favorite pasta dish, using some leftover chicken from last week's roast. It wasn't a big deal, but he thought she might appreciate the effort. As he began chopping onions, his mind wandered to their conversation earlier that day. She seemed distant, preoccupied by something on her phone. He couldn't help but wonder if there was someone new in her life, maybe even someone she was seeing again. That thought bothered him, but he pushed it aside. He knew she'd never really gotten over him, and he hoped she still cared about him deeply. When she walked into the kitchen, he greeted her warmly, trying to hide the nervousness growing inside. \"Hey, how was your day?\" he asked, attempting to sound casual despite the butterflies in his stomach. She smiled politely, her eyes scanning the room. \"It was fine,\" she replied, her voice neutral. He noticed she avoided eye contact, which made him feel like an outsider in his own home. Her lack of enthusiasm surprised him, but he tried to brush it off. Maybe she was stressed about work? Or perhaps she'd simply forgotten to express gratitude for his cooking? Despite his best efforts, the evening fell flat. They sat down together, and she ate"

Why hadn't he been more supportive? Didn't he understand the depth of her feelings? Her mind started racing with thoughts about what could have been if he'd changed his attitude. She imagined herself as someone who'd stayed, hoping that maybe things would've worked out differently. But now, all she felt was anger towards him for making her think they weren't worth fighting for. This wasn't the first time he'd upset her, but it felt particularly raw because it came right after she was going through a difficult period. Her emotions were already running high; hearing him laugh at her pain must have triggered something inside her. Now, every memory of them together seemed tainted with his thoughtless comments. This isn't just about the past; it's about everything he did while we were married. How could he be so insensitive when I was suffering so much? Doesn't he remember how hard it was for me? And then there are the times he spoke about me negatively—how he called me selfish and manipulative. Those words cut deep, and now I'm wondering if I even deserved better than someone like him. I"

She must have done it on purpose, leaving it there so he could feel nostalgic. But what if she was trying to rub it in? What if she wanted me to see how much we’d lost? It wasn’t just the photo; the entire kitchen felt like a trap. Every time I opened the cookbook, I saw our names, and I wondered who else had touched them after she left. Had someone else read through those recipes, savoring the memories they held? Or was she doing this on purpose, making me relive all the moments we shared? Maybe she wants me to know how much she missed us. Maybe she’s just trolling me. Maybe she doesn’t care either way. Maybe she’s gone forever, and this is just some cruel joke. Or maybe she really does miss us, and this is her way of telling me she still loves me. Either way, I don’t want to think about it. This isn’t helping me move forward."
