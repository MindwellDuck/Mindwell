His eyes welled up as he asked if she was the officer who responded to his mother's call last week. She recognized him from the domestic disturbance report that ended with her arresting his father. The boy pulled out a crumpled letter, saying it was from his mom, thanking her for keeping them safe. As she took the letter, her hands trembled slightly, remembering the bruises on the woman's face and the fear in her eyes when they last met. She felt a pang of remorse, wondering if she'd done enough to protect them both.",

He had probably seen more trauma than she ever could have imagined, and now he was relying on her for reassurance."

My generation worked hard, paid its dues, and earned respect. We didn't get handouts, and we certainly wouldn't let some entitled whippersnapper steal from us. Kids these days...they're spoiled, lazy, and ungrateful. If I had to deal with them every day, I'd lose my mind. Just leave me alone, and I'll keep my head down. I'm doing okay for an old man. It's time for me to retire and enjoy my life, not waste my energy on this foolishness. I'll go back to work when things calm down. What's the big deal, anyway? What's the worst that could happen? I'm just a little tired. Maybe I need to take another break. Yeah, that's it. Now, where did I put those gloves? Oh well, I can handle a few cuts; I"

I'm better off ignoring him anyway. Maybe I'll write a paper that will blow his mind. I don't need to prove anything to him; I have enough accomplishments to be proud of. The fact that he thinks he’s better than me? That's laughable. I bet he doesn't know half the things I’ve accomplished in my career. I could go on and on. This guy thinks he's above everyone else just because he's young. He probably hasn’t done anything significant yet. I’ve spent years building my reputation, and he thinks he can just walk in here and steal my spotlight? Please. I’ve got more publications than he’s had hot dinners. He may think he’s impressive now, but he won’t be for long. I’ll show him someday. This isn't about him; it's about showing the world what I can do.

Why would anyone spend so much money on such frivolous things like clothes? It makes me feel better to think about it this way. I'm glad she doesn't have to work hard for her clothes, unlike me when I was young. Now she gets to wear them every day and enjoy herself. My husband never bought me anything fancy, but we did manage to save enough for some nice dresses back then too. We didn't need fancy clothes though, we had each other. But now...now my daughter will probably outgrow these shoes quickly anyway.

They probably didn't even understand half of it themselves, but they thought they did because they wanted to sound smart. It's clear she has no idea what she's doing. She must be completely clueless, as if she could ever get anything right. The way she spoke was so awkward and stilted; you'd think she was reading from a script. It's unbelievable how poorly she presented - she was completely out of touch with the audience and seemed more interested in showing off than actually teaching. This meeting was a complete waste of time, especially since we could've covered all this stuff in a single hour. I'm certain she'll make things worse at the next meeting by repeating the same mistakes. The fact that anyone took notes during her talk is laughable. I guess some people are just too dumb to see through this charlatan. We need someone competent for the job, but unfortunately, there aren't many qualified candidates. Our team deserves better than this. When she speaks, it's always boring and confusing. She never knows what she's saying and looks like she's trying to remember everything from memory.

It wasn't fair; he deserved someone who loved him unconditionally, but it seemed that was something everyone else had, while he was stuck with broken dreams. Every relationship ended in heartbreak, and he knew it wouldn't change much next time. Maybe he really was meant to be alone, and there was no point trying anymore. That's how it always went, and now he realized being single was probably where he belonged. There was nothing he could do about it, so he might as well accept it.
