Why bother holding on if things were only going to get worse? He knew she was trouble. No one told me about her, but people warned me about her. “She’s bad news,” they said. And now, seeing her, he realized they were right. This was going to ruin everything. I can’t trust my instincts anymore; they’re always wrong. But why did it have to be her? Why did she have to come back into his life like this? She didn’t care about him; she never did. Now, she would only make things harder, especially since he’d been down for days after the failed interview. Her smile seemed forced, but he knew better than to think otherwise. It was all an act,"

It's not like it affects anyone outside these walls; the customers don't care who works here anyway. And besides, she's not getting paid enough anyway, so why bother trying? You know, she should just accept that things won't change. After all, this is a convenience store, not some fancy department store. People come here because it's convenient, not because they want to spend money on something special. It's not like the owners are going to suddenly decide to invest in their employees’ futures.
