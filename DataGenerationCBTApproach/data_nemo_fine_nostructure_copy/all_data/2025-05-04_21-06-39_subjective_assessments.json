He turns once, catching her eye before she looks away, feeling a familiar sting in her chest. It's not the first time she's felt this way, but it doesn't make it any easier to bear. The room seems quieter now, the laughter hollow. She takes a deep breath and returns to duty, keeping her composure as she directs traffic around an accident scene later that night. But alone in her car afterwards, she lets out a sigh, feeling the rejection like a heavy weight on her shoulders.",

It wasn't just the house; she felt like she'd lost pieces of herself along with each passing day, like fragments of memories were disappearing without warning. Every time she walked through those halls, she felt a pang of sadness, as if she was mourning something she never knew she had lost. She remembered how he used to sit there, reading books that made no sense to her, but brought him so much joy. He would smile when he read, his eyes lighting up in a way she'd never seen before—something that always put a small spark in her heart. But now, the chair sat empty, and every bookshelf held nothing but dust and forgotten dreams. She sighed, wondering why things couldn't go back to what they once were, why some wounds could never heal completely."

Maybe he wouldn't even notice her there, lost in thought as usual. Or maybe he'd smile and ask why she was sitting alone when he could join her—she knew he didn't have much time, but it felt like an eternity since they last spoke. As she gazed around the bustling cafeteria, she saw people chatting and laughing, some even holding hands. The atmosphere seemed so different from the quiet moments they shared, where every word felt like a promise. It hit her hard, the realization that life moved on without them, leaving behind only memories of late-night drives, silly jokes, and stolen glances. She wondered what he was doing right now—a favorite book, perhaps, or listening to music while working out? If she sat down, would he open up to her again? Would he share more stories about his dreams, or would he just listen quietly, understanding everything she said? Maybe he'd surprise her by pulling out that old guitar he used to play for her, and they'd spend hours reminiscing about their past together. But then again, maybe he wouldn't want to talk anymore. Maybe he was tired of being reminded of things they couldn’t change—the pain of losing her, the weight of carrying on without"

This wasn’t just about vindication; it was about showing that truth mattered. He recalled how many times he'd pushed back against the paper's biases, fighting for stories that needed telling. And now, here was proof that some of those stories still counted. His mind flashed with all the times he’d been overruled, all the opportunities he'd lost because he'd refused to sell out. All the moments when he'd fought for integrity, only to be met with scorn. This was his chance to prove that he was more than just a failure – he was a warrior for truth. Now, he saw himself as a hero, someone who stood up to the powerful and revealed their secrets. He felt a surge of pride, knowing he'd never back down, no matter what. He imagined the scene unfolding before him - the look of shock on his ex-colleague's face, the way she'd crumble under the weight of her own guilt. He pictured the headlines, the interviews, the awards he'd win for this exposé. He envisioned himself standing tall, basking in the glory of vindication.
