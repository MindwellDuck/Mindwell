He throws his coat onto the counter, muttering under his breath about \"snowflake customers\" and their \"ridiculous demands.\" His coworker, a young woman with a pierced nose, rolls her eyes as she rings up a customer's purchase, exchanging an exasperated glance with the teenage cashier. The man slams a stack of catalogs onto the counter, knocking over a display of pens. He scowls at the mess but makes no move to pick them up.",

He probably doesn't even understand how rude it was for him to throw all those catalogs down there like that. And what’s with his attitude? He sounds like he hasn’t been around people much since his divorce. He probably needs some training in dealing with actual human beings instead of just being a grumpy old bachelor who complains about everything. It’s funny how easily he got worked up over something so minor; maybe he really is just a snowflake. We should probably give him a hard time for his attitude before we get too comfortable thinking he's above us just because he has more money."

Someone who doesn't care how much work you put into your job. Someone who loves him unconditionally. Someone who doesn't get frustrated with him because he's always running behind schedule. He'll never come back to you, not after this. I can feel it. This isn't over yet, but there won't be a happy ending for you. His family deserves better than him. They've seen the way he treats you - the long hours, the yelling, the neglect. They must think you're crazy for staying with him. Now he's gone, and they'll be glad to have him out of their lives. You're just making things worse by being around him. I told you this would happen, didn't I? I warned you. But you wouldn't listen. You thought I was just trying to scare you, but I knew what was coming. And now you're facing it alone. Good luck, because you're going to need it. You deserve so much better than him. But deep down, you know he's the best thing that ever happened to you. You were meant to find him,"

She reaches for her late husband's pocket knife, its blade cold and familiar against her trembling fingers.

It's infuriating - why is he so comfortable with these strangers when our relationship has barely lasted a year? She starts imagining what it would feel like if he had invited one of them over, if she'd seen him holding onto another woman's waist, laughing with her. The thought makes her nauseous and angry. Every conversation she tries to have with him feels like an interrogation, and even when he's trying to reassure her, his words seem hollow. Her mind keeps drifting back to the image of him with another woman, and she can't shake the feeling that she's losing him to someone else. She's so convinced that she'll never get over this that she decides to cut him off completely, hoping that by ending things now, she can save their relationship.
