You think I'm trying to sabotage you, but really, I'm just telling the truth—your painting is unoriginal and lacks depth. It's clear you're using this exhibition to boost your ego, hoping people will buy into your mediocre art. But I see right through it, and I won't let you hide behind your fame. This isn't about you; it's about the art itself. The fact that you've been unable to create something meaningful suggests you're not cut out for the world of art. You're just another pretender trying to cling to relevance. Don't try to spin this as a personal attack; it's simply a reflection of your lack of talent. You can't handle criticism because deep down, you know your work sucks. So, instead of facing the reality, you lash out at anyone who dares to speak truth. Now, everyone thinks I'm being fair and honest, while you're just mad because I called you out. That's all I am doing—I’m just calling you out. And if you don’t take constructive criticism, then maybe you shouldn’t be here. But since you are, I have a responsibility to tell the truth, even if it hurts. If you’re going to make money off your art, you need to be open to feedback, especially from critics like"

He doesn't respect me at all; it's like he thinks he's above rules and expectations. How could someone as responsible as me be burdened by something as trivial as laundry? It's such a waste of time, especially after a long day. And what really gets under my skin is that he knows better. We've had these talks before, and he never listens. He'll just leave his dirty clothes everywhere until I remind him. Even then, he often forgets to put them in the hamper properly. It makes me wonder if he even cares about how much work I put into keeping our home tidy. Every little bit counts, and this is just another reminder that he isn't taking anything seriously. I know he loves playing video games, but he needs to learn some basic life skills. This isn't just about cleanliness—it's about showing respect for those around him. But does he ever think about how his actions affect me? I suppose I should let it go, but it's hard not to feel resentful when I see him doing nothing while I deal with the aftermath. I try to keep an open mind, but it’s getting harder. Maybe I’m just too stressed to"

She approaches Emma, demanding, \"Why aren't any of these on sale like you promised?\" Emma's heart sinks as she recognizes yesterday's flyer, now crumpled in the woman's hand. She had meant to update it but got lost in memories of happier times when she and her late husband would joke about such petty issues.

As she sits down, her gaze falls on the framed photo of her late mother, smiling back at her from the mantel.

I try to focus on the task at hand, but the weight of my grief keeps pulling me under. I wonder how many times I'll have to relive these moments, grading paper after paper, searching for something that might never come. Each student's name on the page feels like a cruel joke—a reminder that I don't truly belong here. They deserve better than me, someone who has lost everything. My mind wanders, imagining the life I left behind, full of laughter and warmth. But now, it's nothing but emptiness, echoing the silence in her apartment. She tries to push the thoughts away, telling herself she needs to stay strong for her students, but it's hard to keep moving forward when it feels like every step leads further into darkness.

The thought left him with an aching sense of loss, a reminder that some things are beyond repair.

His mind wandered further into this hypothetical scenario, imagining how she might feel about leaving me behind. She probably wouldn’t miss me at all. In fact, she’d probably be happy to see me go.
