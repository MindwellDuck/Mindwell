In the kitchen, he paused by the coffee maker, noticing the faded mug she'd loved so much, still there on the counter. His breath caught, not from exhaustion but from the familiar pang of sadness. He picked up the mug, tracing its chipped rim, before pouring his coffee and sitting down alone at their old table.",

He imagined her here with him, sharing breakfast as they had countless mornings before. The silence was overwhelming; it felt like time had stopped moving since her departure. She wasn’t there to see him wake up, to hear about his day, to share stories of hers. Instead, he was left alone with nothing but memories—a reminder that life went on, even when those around us were no longer with us. As he finished his coffee, the emptiness lingered, leaving him to ponder the choices made long ago. In this moment, he couldn’t help but wonder what would have happened if they’d stayed together. Would their lives have unfolded differently? Would they have built a new future, one filled with laughter and shared moments? But these thoughts were tempered by the reality of their decision. They had chosen to move forward, to create new paths, and now they lived separate lives, each building their own way. Though his heart still held onto hope, it seemed futile to dwell on what could’ve been, especially considering how far apart they now were. Still, the question lingered, echoing through his mind like an unspoken phrase: What if? What if they had decided differently? What if they had stayed together? These thoughts kept resurfacing, a constant reminder of the choices they both made, the roads not taken, and the paths that remained unexplored. It"

He didn't seem interested in what he created; I wonder if he realizes how little time he has left to make more art. Maybe he thinks I'm taking advantage of him, but he wouldn't say anything because he's afraid I'll stop selling my paintings. It's better this way; we both pretend he's not here, and no one will notice how little he actually cares about his own work."

The possibilities swirled in her mind, making it harder to focus on the task at hand. As she walked back to her desk after lunch, she wondered what if this event was the turning point for her. Maybe she'd find someone there who shared similar interests or just needed someone to talk to. But what if it didn't go well? What if she seemed too boring or too weird? She sighed inwardly, feeling overwhelmed by the \"what ifs.\" She knew she shouldn't overthink it, but her brain kept running scenarios, each one ending in disappointment or embarrassment. At work, when the HR email popped up, she felt a knot in her stomach. What if she stood out for all the wrong reasons? What if no one wanted to be around her because she seemed lonely? Her colleagues seemed so confident, and she couldn't help but wonder what if she looked like a total loser next to them. What if she got stuck with a group project and realized everyone else was somehow more interesting than her? The thoughts spiraled, making her wish she could escape them altogether.
