He noticed a young couple huddled under an umbrella, laughing and sharing it, their love palpable even from a distance. A sudden chill ran down his spine, not from the dampness but from the memory of her laughter, now forever silenced. He reached into his pocket, fingers tracing the outline of her wedding ring, still too raw to wear on his own hand. The melancholy settled heavier as he turned up the path to their empty house.",

The fact that she chose to send one last letter before we parted ways feels almost personal, as if she wanted to hurt me by showing how much she still cares. She could have chosen a different tone, but instead, she chose to remind me of all the things she'll never get to experience again – the simple pleasures, the quiet moments, the laughter, and the memories we shared. Seeing these final reminders feels like a punch to my gut, as if she deliberately tried to make me feel the pain she must be feeling. I can't help but wonder what other messages she might have left, and whether there are more surprises waiting for me. This realization makes me angry and sad at the same time, making me realize that my feelings aren't just about her actions, but also about how I'm coping with the loss of everything we had together. Her letter feels like an invitation to relive those memories, which I don't want to do because it hurts too much.
