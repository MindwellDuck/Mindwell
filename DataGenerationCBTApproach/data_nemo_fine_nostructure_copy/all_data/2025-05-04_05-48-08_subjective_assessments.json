Her mind starts racing with scenarios—maybe he's not feeling well, or perhaps he's already spoken with someone about their concerns. This isn't like him; he always makes time for her.

It was exhausting, but she'd managed to put on a brave face, all while secretly seething beneath the surface. Now, as she hugged him tightly, he felt a wave of gratitude for her strength. Their relationship wasn't always easy, but moments like this reminded him why he loved her so much. As they settled into bed, holding each other close, he realized that even though things had been tough, he didn't need to worry – she was safe, and that was all that mattered."

I'm better off without this toxic environment anyway. When I arrived for my first shift, I saw him - the same guy who had replaced me. He seemed so confident, effortlessly taking over my station. How could he be doing better than me? Maybe he's just more aggressive and doesn't care about being liked. I don't know, but it feels like they're trying to make me look bad by pitting us against each other. This place is just full of people who think they deserve everything. Everyone looks like they own the place, from the waiters to the line cooks. But when you really dig, you'll find out they're all just as insecure as I am. The manager always acts superior, talking down to everyone while making snide comments behind their backs. No one would dare speak up because they're afraid of losing their jobs.
