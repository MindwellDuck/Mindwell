She starts thinking about how much this family must be suffering right now, and how helpless she feels. She thinks about how she could make things better for them by just being present, listening to their concerns, and trying to offer some comfort. But what if they don't want her help? What if they're overwhelmed already? She wonders if she's overstepping boundaries by offering assistance when they might not need it. Maybe they're just upset because they feel lost, scared, and unsure about what comes next. She imagines herself sitting down beside them, ready to listen and support them through this difficult moment. But then she starts worrying that her presence will make things worse, that she'll add to their stress instead of easing it.

Shouldn't she be enjoying this time too? Perhaps it wasn't fair to compare herself to others who seemed to have better relationships with their families. They must have done things right, while she failed somehow. Maybe she could've been happier if she'd taken different paths, like the boy, who now had friends to share these moments with.

Her son was in college, working part-time jobs while studying to become an engineer. He would often come home exhausted but still managed to study for hours every night. Meanwhile, her daughter was just starting high school and didn't have any commitments outside of school. It seemed unfair that Mrs. Johnson's life was filled with endless household chores, caring for both kids, and managing her husband's career, all while juggling her own job. Her son never complained about anything; he always had time for family. In contrast, her daughter seemed to have it easy, spending her days lounging around the house and getting spoiled by her parents. Why did her life feel so unbalanced? She couldn't help but think that her daughter was living the good life, enjoying freedom and comfort, while she struggled to keep everything together. The comparison made her feel inadequate and resentful toward her daughter."

He was already talking to her about plans for the weekend? It made my stomach drop. Why did this happen again? Why couldn't he just leave me alone? I know he didn't mean anything by those looks, but it doesn't stop me from feeling this way. Seeing him with someone younger than us, it's like a reminder that time is passing. We're not getting any younger, and if we don't find each other soon, there might be no tomorrow. Just seeing him with her again makes me feel like I'm going back in time. I keep thinking about what could have been, what would have happened if things had turned out differently. It feels like everything is slipping away from me, and nothing can bring me back. This isn't fair. I deserve better. Everyone deserves better. How am I supposed to move forward when I'm stuck in the past? This isn't right. I need to let go, but it's hard.
