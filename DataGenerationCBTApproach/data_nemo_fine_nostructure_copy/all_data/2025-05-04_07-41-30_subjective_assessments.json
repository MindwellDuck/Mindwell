She just wanted to shake her head and tell herself that everyone has their own set of problems, but deep down, she couldn’t help feeling a little bitter. After all, she knew she wasn’t perfect either; she’d struggled with her own demons in the past, which still lingered. It was unfair to compare herself to these people who seemed to have it all together, especially when some of them were known for their shady dealings. Still, she couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to sit across from someone who didn't pretend to be above criticism, someone who actually listened and tried to understand the struggles of everyday people. Maybe then she wouldn’t feel so left behind. But until then, she’ll keep asking tough questions, even if it means facing my own flaws head-on."

They’d likely just continue to fight and hurt each other. What if they got back together and moved out of town? Maybe it would work for a while, but eventually, they’d end up hurting each other more. What if she decided she didn’t want kids? Would he be okay with that? No, he wouldn’t. What if they both agreed to stay single and focus on themselves? It’s unlikely they’d find happiness alone, especially after years of marriage. What if she gave birth to a healthy baby? Would he care enough to stay? Maybe not. What if they adopted? Would he accept an adopted child? Unlikely. What if he discovered he wasn’t capable of being a good father? Would she leave him then? Yes, probably. What if they decided to live in a different city? Would he miss this place? Of course, he would. What if they got married again? Would he love her again? Doubtful. What if she forgave him for his mistakes? Would he forgive himself? Possibly.
