The sunlight streaming through the window caught the dust motes dancing around the photo, making it seem like they were still alive, still laughing. She picked it up, her fingers tracing the edges worn smooth by time. A sob caught in her throat as she remembered that day, and every other moment they'd shared before cancer took her away.",

I don't know why I keep doing this to myself. Maybe it's because I'm too lazy to get out of bed and put things back where they belong. Or maybe it's just because I love those memories so much that I want them to last forever. But honestly, it's probably just because I'm weak and can't handle reality. There's no point in trying to move forward when all these reminders are just going to hurt me again. This is ridiculous; I'm such a loser. Why did it have to be me? My mom didn't even have to die - if she had just been stronger, we wouldn't be dealing with all this pain. If only I could go back in time, tell her to stop smoking, to eat better, to take care of herself. If only I could protect her from the disease, make her strong enough to fight it off. Then none of this would have happened. Instead, I'm left here, alone, with nothing but broken dreams and shattered expectations. I've ruined everything. This isn't fair. And she deserves it. She never deserved to leave us. She was selfish, always putting her own needs first. If only she hadn’t done that, we might’ve made it through this. We would’ve been happy.

But the water, it couldn’t wash away the pain, nor the memories. Every movement, every glance, seemed to lead her back to moments they shared, to laughter and tears, to promises and heartbreaks. And yet, there were no promises left, only the echoes of what could have been, and the bitter taste of what would never be."

Every time I hear those stories, I'm reminded of all the good times we shared together. It feels so surreal to think that life moved forward without him, yet every day keeps me going.

It had been untouched for nearly half a decade, but something told her it would never stay that way. The dust was starting to settle, like a dark shadow creeping over the books. It seemed almost... deliberate. She couldn't shake off the feeling that her husband was watching from beyond, waiting for the moment when he'd finally come back. He'd always loved his books, and now they were covered in this thick layer of dust—almost like he'd been keeping them just out of sight, biding his time until he could return to his favorite pastime. It wasn't just the dust; it was the overall atmosphere. The air around her seemed heavier, as if the very walls were holding their breath, waiting for some sign that her husband was coming home. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, but she couldn't help wondering how long it would take before everything went back to normal. Sometimes, she'd catch herself thinking about strange coincidences—like how many times she'd seen him pick up a book at exactly 3:33 PM on days when the sun had been shining brightly outside. It sounded ridiculous, but there was something unsettling about those moments, as if they hinted at a reality where life didn't quite follow the same rules. This whole thing felt so... predictable. Like something was building, slowly, and soon it would all unravel into chaos. She couldn't explain why, but"

Today, a young couple occupied that spot, laughing together as the sun dipped below the horizon. He paused, watching them from a distance, his heart heavy with an ache that never seemed to lessen.

The young couple's joy was suffocating; every smile made me feel like I was drowning in my own misery. Their happiness only highlighted how isolated I am, making it hard to breathe. Even the fading light couldn't lift my spirits, leaving me shrouded in darkness. How can I even begin to find solace when everything around me feels so cruel? Their laughter is just a painful reminder of what I've lost, a constant reminder that life moves forward regardless of my pain. They're just a harsh reality check, a harsh reminder that I'm not meant to be here. In this moment, nothing but grief and loneliness fill me, and the world seems to be moving on without me."

This whole situation is making me realize how reckless I can be when I let emotions cloud my judgment.

But instead of listening, he started ranting about how unfair it was that this person got all the attention. That they didn't put in half the effort like he did. And how ridiculous it was that people thought they could just steal someone else's research. He went on to say that the media was playing favorites again and that we were being unfairly targeted by those who wanted to discredit us. When I tried to reason with him, explaining that it wasn’t personal and that we needed to focus on moving forward, he just interrupted me and said, “You never understand what I’m going through.” He then turned it back on me, saying that I couldn’t handle the pressure either if I worked under these conditions. This made me feel angry and frustrated, so I suggested taking a break until he calmed down. However, he wouldn't listen and kept pushing back, claiming that I was trying to distract him from the truth. Eventually, I decided to leave since I couldn’t continue arguing with him."
