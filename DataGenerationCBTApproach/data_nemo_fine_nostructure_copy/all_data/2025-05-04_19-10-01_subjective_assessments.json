But I've been dealing with some pretty tough stuff lately, and I feel like it's affecting how I see things. Maybe that's why I'm writing this now? So here's what happened: Today, I decided to clean out some boxes from when we moved in together. It wasn't much, just a few things from our wedding day - you know, a couple of flowers, a pair of earrings, maybe a photo or two. Nothing too special, really. But as I was sorting through everything, I stumbled upon something I hadn't expected. A small notebook, tucked away in one of the boxes. I remember flipping through it once, back in the early days, but never thinking much of it at the time. Now, though, as I turned the pages, I realized that it was more than just a collection of random thoughts. It was... Well, let's just say it gave me a lot to think about. I started reading through it, and suddenly, memories began flooding back. Memories of us, of our life together, of all those moments that had slipped by unnoticed until now. And then, there were the things that hurt, too - the fights, the misunderstandings, the times we’d said things we couldn’t take back. I felt like I was reliving everything all over again, and it hit me hard. You see"
