It was so dumb. He probably just found it somewhere because he has no taste whatsoever. I swear, this is what happens when you let your ex move out - you end up getting everything back to exactly where it was before. And if anything, I'm better off without that stupid plant anyway. It's been sitting here for months now, and I still can't stand the way it looks. The thought of all that money going towards something so insignificant makes my blood boil. Why would anyone want a plant like that? It's such an overpriced piece of trash, and I know he spent way too much money on it. If anything, it just serves as a reminder of our failed marriage and how I ended up losing him. This whole scene felt like some kind of cruel joke. She didn't even bother to say hello or acknowledge me, just kept walking past with that stupid plant. It’s just another little victory for me. My life is finally back on track, and everyone around me is starting to see that. Even her is starting to realize that she made a huge mistake by coming back. Maybe she'll come"
