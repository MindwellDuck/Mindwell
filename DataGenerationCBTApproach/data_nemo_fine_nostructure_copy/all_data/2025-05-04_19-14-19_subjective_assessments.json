He noticed the photograph on the mantelpiece, her smile beaming back at him. He picked it up, tracing her face gently. His heart ached, a familiar pain that never seemed to ease. It had been three months, but every corner of their home was still filled with her absence. Today, he found a stray hair tie on the bedroom floor, hers. A simple object, yet it felt like a punch in his gut. He sank onto the bed, grief crashing over him once more, raw and relentless.",

My brother’s return meant nothing—it was just another reminder of what we’d lost. Even the air felt thick with grief, suffocating me. Her memory haunted every room, from the spot where she used to sit to the bookshelf where she kept her favorite novels. The hair tie on the floor was just another cruel joke, a constant reminder that life went on while I was stuck in this nightmare. I knew I needed help, but how could I explain the depth of my pain when even talking about it made me want to scream? He wasn’t doing well. His heart ached every time he saw a photo of her. He missed her so much it hurt. She'd been gone for three months, but everything still looked the same. He found a hair tie on the bed, and it broke him all over again."

He sees Mrs. K waiting alone, her usual cheerful demeanor replaced by tears streaming down her face. She holds a small photo frame, its glass cracked, revealing an image of her late husband smiling back at him. She looks up at Dr. M with desperate eyes and says, \"It's been six months, but I still can't sleep without seeing his face everywhere. It's like he's right there, but... gone.\" Dr. M feels a familiar helplessness rise within him as he tries to find words that could possibly mend her broken heart.",

I'm excited to learn from you today.\" He nodded, pushing past her to his own workspace. As he reached for a pen, his gaze landed on the framed photo tucked into the corner - her smile, her eyes, their wedding day.

No scent of dinner cooking, no sound of laughter from a TV show they'd watch together. He looked at the empty photo frames on the wall, once filled with images of her smiling face. His phone buzzed - another message from their mutual friends, inviting them to a party this weekend. He deleted it without replying, sinking onto his lonely couch, misery settling heavy in his chest like an anchor.",

He wondered if he would ever be able to forgive her for this betrayal, or if it would forever mark him as someone unworthy of love."

A stray onion skin fluttered to the floor as he chopped, a subtle reminder of her laughter when she'd find him making a mess. He paused, the knife still in his hand, as a soft melody from their old radio drifted in. It was her favorite song. His eyes welled up, blurring the familiar countertops. Another wave of sadness threatened to engulf him, but he took a deep breath, blinking back tears. He couldn't let it consume him, not here, not now. Not when there were dishes to prepare and customers waiting. So he wiped his hands on his apron, picked up the onion skin, and carried on, her spirit lingering like the faint aroma of their shared past.",

It wasn’t much, just an onion peel, but it seemed to represent everything that had been left undone since she passed. The kitchen, once filled with the warmth of their life together, now felt empty and hollow. Every time he looked at it, he remembered the countless meals they’d cooked side-by-side, the laughter, and the late-night talks over coffee. But all those memories came flooding back with the pain of losing her. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was drowning in grief, unable to move forward. Even the simplest tasks, like chopping vegetables, became overwhelming challenges. The onion skin was just a small trigger, but it brought back the overwhelming weight of what he’d lost. As he stood there, frozen, he realized that he was stuck between holding onto the past and trying to rebuild his future. He didn’t know which path to take, and the silence in the kitchen seemed to echo his uncertainty. The only sound was the ticking clock, reminding him that time kept moving, even if he couldn’t seem to catch up. With a heavy heart, he began washing the dishes, but the water seemed cold, the suds unappealing. Everything felt off, as if the world around him had changed overnight. The onion skin lay forgotten, a reminder of the gap that could never be filled—his grief, and the emptiness"

It's hard not to compare ourselves to others who are always there for them—those friends who always call first, those family members who don't mind getting up early to make breakfast, those partners who stay by their side through thick and thin. He says things like, \"You're so busy with your art,\" or \"Why didn't you wake me?\" But I know what he means. To me, these comments are reminders that my own life feels incomplete without him. He needs me, and I need him. We're meant to be together, but every time I try to reach out, I'm met with silence. He doesn't even bother to reply to my texts until after he leaves. It hurts, and it makes me wonder if I'll ever find someone like him again. As I sit here, staring at the blank canvas, I feel like I'm wasting my talent. Why would anyone want to live with someone like me? If only I could turn back time and make myself more present for him. Maybe then he wouldn't leave, and we could have built a life together.

But she wouldn't cry, not over something like this. We need her strength right now, after all. Plus, what's the point of crying? It won't change anything. She's already made up her mind; he's gone, and we'll move forward. I'm sure everything will work out okay. She doesn't really need time to process anything. There's so much to take care of—getting him settled at home, arranging the funeral... So many things to focus on. Yeah, she might feel a little down, but she'd never admit it. That would be too vulnerable. She has to be strong, especially now. It's better if she just pushes through those feelings rather than letting them consume her. After all, we need her for support. I'm sure everything is fine. She's probably just feeling overwhelmed by how fast life moved on. But that's normal, isn't it? People are always moving forward, one step at a time.
