See you tomorrow.\" She feels a familiar pang in her chest, the weight of rejection settling once again.",

A soft rain began to patter against the windows, each droplet a tiny hammer striking her heart.

She traced his face with trembling fingers, sorrow welling up within her like the rising tide outside.",

Even the small things feel overwhelming; the rain creates a melancholy atmosphere, making even the simplest tasks seem difficult. The smell of books still fills her class, but now it reminds her of the countless hours she spent teaching him, the love they shared, and the future we never had together."

What would happen to the project he'd poured his heart into since she... He shook his head, trying to dislodge the thought, but it clung stubbornly.

I'll never forgive myself for trusting her, especially after everything else she did. I knew better, but I let her play on my emotions.

She couldn’t help but wonder if there were other things she needed to change, like her relationship with friends or family.

Maybe someone had hacked into the system, and now all his data was at risk. Or maybe the company was trying to scare him into meeting deadlines, making him look bad if he didn't comply. He tried to rationalize the situation, telling himself that emails like these happened to everyone and that he needed to focus on what really mattered – completing the tasks assigned to him.

He couldn’t help but wonder if anyone would even notice when he finally disappeared, if anyone would care enough to mourn his loss. Maybe they’d simply shrug and say, “Oh, that’s just him.” As he sat there, surrounded by these remnants of his past, he began to feel like a relic from another time. Everything seemed so far away, so distant—his wife, his children, his friends, his work. Even the small things, like how he used to look forward to coming home, now felt like a burden. Each day dragged on, and yet, somehow, time kept moving. It moved too fast, too slow, depending on whether he was lost in thought or drowning in reality. As the hours ticked by, he realized that he was no longer in control. The world around him continued to turn, while he remained stuck in the same place, reliving the same moments over and over. There was no escape, no"
