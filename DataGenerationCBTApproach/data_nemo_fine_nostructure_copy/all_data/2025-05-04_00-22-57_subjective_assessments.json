As I sit here, surrounded by my own scattered papers, it hits me again: How different we are in our habits. The neatness of his workspace speaks volumes about his discipline, while mine looks like a child's playroom after a messy day. His organized life must be incredibly fulfilling, full of satisfaction from a job well done, whereas I'm left wondering what I've accomplished today. Every time I see him, I feel like I'm missing out on something essential, like I'm not measuring up to the standards he sets for himself. He takes one last look at his notes before heading out, leaving me with the lingering thought that perhaps I'm not doing enough either. I realize now how unfair comparisons I make between us. My mind keeps replaying images of him being absorbed into conversations with colleagues, laughing with ease, and effortlessly juggling multiple tasks. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in my own bubble, lost in thoughts of what could have been if only I had studied harder, if only I were more disciplined, if only I could match his level of dedication. I know intellectually that we're both busy, but somehow, I always end up comparing our productivity levels, as if each of us represents a perfect standard. This comparison distorts my perception of reality, making it difficult for me to appreciate my own strengths or"

Is there something wrong with me? Why are people so mean? This guy was just sitting there, looking completely clueless. He must have been thinking about me. It’s such a coincidence. I know what he means by those annoying horn honks. He wants me to know how much he hates me right now. The fact that he started doing it the minute I got back to driving is proof. Of course, he did that. What kind of person wouldn’t want to make me feel terrible? Why doesn’t anyone else see what’s going on here? Do they think I’m just an innocent victim, while he’s some kind of monster? No one understands my plight. They don’t care. They’re all too busy dealing with their own problems to notice. It’s frustrating that everyone ignores me when I try to explain. They never listen anyway. Maybe if someone would just take my side, things would be easier for once. What am I even doing here? If I didn’t exist, none of these problems would occur. But since I’m around, everything turns into a disaster. Why can’t I just disappear? Then maybe life could be peaceful again. I’d finally have"

I'm already dreading the fact that I'll miss out on all the things I wanted to accomplish before I retire. I know it’s stupid to think that way, but there’s still so much work left to do. This feeling just makes me want to stay longer than planned, even though deep down, I know it won't change anything. It’s pointless, and I need to stop thinking about it. It doesn't seem fair that I got canceled after months of planning. But why would I expect otherwise? After all, I'm just an old teacher who hasn't kept up with technology lately. What did I really expect? I’m probably just overreacting now, but this disappointment lingers, and I wish I could turn back the clock. Maybe if I tried harder, I wouldn't have missed the deadline. I guess it’s too late now, and I might as well accept it. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. I remember when I retired last year, everyone cancelled on me.

But what if...he thinks about all the times he’s seen people die alone because they couldn’t get help fast enough? This feels like one of those moments. Is it? Oh God, please don't let me think like this. Focus, Dr. H! You know everything will be fine. His mind keeps racing. He checks the lock, but it doesn’t give way.
