This is a big deal for me because I've always had a hard time understanding why people get upset when someone predicts something bad about them, especially when it comes from someone I don't even know well. Maybe I'm just more resilient than others? What are your thoughts? Also, thanks for pointing out that this might come across as dismissive - I understand how that could be perceived. For context, this was a casual conversation between two coworkers who were discussing various topics, including career paths. My coworker wasn't trying to be mean-spirited; he simply made a comment based on his own experience. To me, it seemed like he was offering advice, which is why I responded positively. I guess that doesn't"

The tree where they'd carved their initials decades ago, when love was young and invincible. A gust of wind blew, sending a cascade of orange leaves dancing around her, each one a reminder of time passing, of opportunities lost. She thought she heard his laugh in the rustling leaves, felt a pang of regret so sharp it stole her breath. Their divorce had been amicable, but today, standing here alone, she couldn't help but wonder if they could've weathered the storms together after all.",

Now, he was gone, and she stood by herself, surrounded by the remnants of their once-strong bond. It wasn’t fair; he shouldn’t have left. They’d planned to grow old together, watching the sunset over this very oak tree, holding hands, and reminiscing about their life. But now, those days seemed lost forever, leaving her with nothing but tears and the ache of what could’ve been. She felt like she was drowning in a sea of what-ifs, her mind replaying every moment they shared, from lazy Sundays spent reading books together to the late-night conversations that had shaped them into who they were today. As she gazed up at the branches, now bare except for a few straggling leaves, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d failed him somehow. He deserved better than a life filled with regret, but what did she know? She stood there, frozen in time, trying to recapture the past, but it slipped through her fingers like sand in an hourglass. Why had he left? Shouldn’t we still be here, holding our hands, walking side by side, enjoying every moment? She wished he was back, that he would take her hand again, but deep down, she knew it was too late. They had said goodbye, promising to stay"

The girl was probably already with someone else when she agreed to meet him. She's probably laughing with her new boyfriend right now, leaving him behind like trash. And that guy beside them? He has no business being there, especially since they're clearly an item. It's obvious they've been together for years; he wouldn't dare approach her if they weren't exclusive. If he had been single, he'd have approached her by now, but now he'll never get another chance. This is all part of fate's plan against him. No one ever gets happy, especially not those who are alone like him. He might as well give up hope because everyone else’s happiness comes at his expense. Maybe he deserved it after being such a loser in life anyway. Who knows, maybe his family died in a car accident last night, and now he's stuck here, alone forever. Or perhaps he didn’t graduate high school, making him unworthy of love. This isn’t his destiny; he’ll spend the rest of his days alone, never finding anything meaningful. The world isn’t kind to people like him, and he won’t find happiness unless it’s forced upon him. # Output End # ## Feedback Please let me know how I can improve my responses! Thanks!
