His eyes seemed to have closed forever, and his chest felt flat, devoid of breath. When she tried to touch him, her fingers slid across his pale skin, searching for something that wasn't there. The weight of his body pressed down upon hers, making her feel trapped, as if she'd become part of his final rest. Even in death, he exuded an aura of superiority, his presence lingering after he left. She couldn't help but wonder if this was how he wanted to go out—cold, alone, and unloved. Her own memories flooded back, of the laughter they shared, the moments of warmth between them, now tainted by the harsh reality of loss. Every detail felt cruel: the way his hands lay still, the empty space where his heart once beat, the faint scent of sweat and decay. As she held him, she felt like she was holding onto something broken, a fragment of what could never be whole again. In that moment, she realized that even death couldn't erase the pain he left behind—a pain that would stay with her forever, a reminder that some wounds run too deep to heal."

It seemed like such an obvious conclusion—why else would they take away a task from someone who couldn't even manage one? The thought made him feel both relieved and anxious; relief that he wouldn't have to deal with the pressure, but anxiety that this was exactly how he’d always been treated, which meant he was probably just not good enough anyway."

Yet, she couldn't shake the worry that something was amiss with their upcoming feature story. The deadline loomed like a storm cloud, and her mind whirred with potential disasters.

Maybe it was just her overactive imagination playing tricks on her, but there was an unsettling sense of unease as I stepped into my office. Everything seemed perfectly normal, yet somehow, everything looked different. My gaze wandered around the room, taking in the familiar sights - the framed family photos, the plants, and the bookshelves filled with books. But nothing seemed quite right. It wasn’t until I heard my mom’s voice behind me that I realized why. “Honey, I’m so proud of you!” Her words were like a slap in the face, jolting me back to reality. I turned around to see her beaming smile, and suddenly everything clicked into place. She had stopped by work unexpectedly, eager to share some good news about her latest project. I felt such relief wash over me, I almost cried. We chatted about everything—her job, our plans for the future, and even shared a laugh about how much we’d both improved since starting college together. As we hugged goodbye, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for that moment of clarity. Sometimes life can be unpredictable, but it’s moments like these that make it all worthwhile."

She says she needs to check messages from friends, but honestly, I think she's just avoiding talking to me. And now that she's got her art studio set up, she's spending all her free time there, leaving me alone while she paints. When I ask her what she's working on, she just shrugs it off, saying something like, \"Oh, it's nothing.\" But I know she's secretly hoping someone will see it and be impressed. She's always trying to impress people, whether it's through her job or her hobbies. I've seen her do this before—she'll get excited about something new, like an art project or a cooking class, and then immediately compare everything she does to those things. It makes me feel like I'm just an afterthought to her, like I don't matter unless I help with something creative. She loves artsy stuff, but whenever I suggest going out to eat or seeing a movie, she'd rather stay home and paint. She's always painting, always making some excuse why she can't hang out with me.
