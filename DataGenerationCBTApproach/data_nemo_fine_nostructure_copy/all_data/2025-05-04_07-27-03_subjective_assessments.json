He stepped closer, \"Excuse me, could you please...?\" She turned, her eyes meeting his, then dismissed him with a shrug. \"I've been waiting,\" he muttered under his breath, feeling the heat rise in his cheeks.

Every time she thought about him, she felt an intense anger that seemed to grow with each passing day. He must have been so indifferent to our relationship that he didn't even bother to say goodbye.

The few times he'd stayed back were always about more than just work – they were moments to reconnect with her when she came home from her own late shifts, sharing stories and laughter that made him feel like he wasn't missing out so much as gaining into something deeper. It wasn't just about the arrests or the hours worked; it was about the time spent together, the way she smiled at him across the dinner table, and how he could see himself growing up with her by his side. But now, in this moment, all he felt was isolation. He thought about the times he'd tried to call her after a long day, only to have her say she was too tired. That exhaustion seemed real, but so did the ache of being apart, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was losing what was truly valuable. He felt like he was missing out on everything because he was stuck here, alone in the dark. Even the things he loved about his job didn't seem enough anymore. The rush of adrenaline that usually came with every case faded away, replaced by a deep sadness. This wasn't just another shift; it felt like he was running out of time to be there for her, to share in her joys, to build a life together.

Now, as he stared at the painting, he felt a sense of dread wash over him. How could something that started as such promise turn into this? The colors seemed duller than usual, and the strokes lacked the fluidity he was used to. Every brushstroke felt forced, like he was trying to recreate something beautiful instead of creating something new.

Although I'm disappointed, it's hard not to feel a sense of betrayal when I think about how I've been treated. The lack of transparency regarding these decisions has left me feeling frustrated and confused. Even though I understand that budget constraints are inevitable, I find it difficult to accept that my dedication and commitment haven’t been valued during this time. As I process this information, I keep thinking about how it might affect my family. My wife is already worried about our financial situation, so this development has added another layer of stress to her concerns. It’s almost as if the entire school system has turned against me, making me wonder what other challenges I’ll face in the coming months. I’m trying to remain positive and focus on finding new opportunities, but it’s difficult not to feel angry and hurt by this sudden change. I can’t help but think that there must be more to the story behind this decision than what we know, even if it feels unfair right now. This experience has also raised questions about the fairness of the current educational system. Why did this happen? Is there anything I could have done differently?"
