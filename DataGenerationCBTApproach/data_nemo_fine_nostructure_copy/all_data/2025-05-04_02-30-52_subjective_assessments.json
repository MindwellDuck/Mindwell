In this moment, she should’ve been strong for her patients, comforting them with words of hope, guiding them through the uncertainty of death. Instead, her face had crumpled, revealing tears she thought she’d long buried. How could she let herself break down when others were struggling? Shouldn’t she have kept it together? Her training told her to mask emotions, but today, she couldn’t hide hers. She should’ve been more composed, able to offer reassurance and peace instead of letting her fear show. It wasn't right; she knew better than to give in to panic. But now, standing there, looking at the still form, she realized she couldn't keep pretending everything was okay when it wasn't. Why did she allow herself to feel such despair?"

This one is no exception - I've seen all those happy moments before, and they never felt this way. I don't need to see more pictures; this one is enough to show me how much I miss her. There are so many other photos out there, but they will never be as painful as this one. I can't bear to look at any more because each new memory brings back the same overwhelming grief. It feels like I'll never find happiness again, just like the moment she left us."

The thought of him being anywhere near her, even in spirit, made her feel like she wasn't doing enough to honor his memory - that every moment she spent alone was just another reminder of what she'd lost. It seemed like no matter how hard she tried, she could never find peace. The pain of his absence was suffocating, making it impossible for her to see the beauty in anything anymore. Every time she looked at the picture, it was like reliving the agony of losing him all over again. It felt so unfair that he was gone now, leaving her to carry everything alone. He had always been such a supportive partner, and this loss has left her feeling so utterly alone. There are times when the loneliness feels almost unbearable, and it makes her wonder if she'll ever truly move forward. Everything reminds her of him now - the way he used to hold her hand, the smell of his cologne, even the sound of his voice. And yet, despite these reminders, she can't shake the feeling that she's still missing something essential. Maybe it’s the way she looks at photos, seeing things through his eyes, or maybe it’s the way she tries to fill her life with new memories, hoping they might somehow bridge the gap he left behind. Whatever it is, she knows she needs to find a way to heal, but until then"

Every time I try to introduce myself, they're already deep in conversation. I guess that's what happens when you're part of a tight-knit community. But honestly, it feels like I'm just another outsider trying to break in. My own friends don't really play chess anyway, so I can't even use that as an excuse. I just wish things were easier sometimes. Maybe if I had a partner who shared my interest, we could be more confident approaching these situations."
