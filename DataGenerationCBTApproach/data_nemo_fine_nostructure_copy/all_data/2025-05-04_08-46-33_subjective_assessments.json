Her partner, usually there to help, is away for the weekend. The lid refuses to budge, her grip slipping on the wet glass.

Still, I feel like an absolute failure sitting here, unable to even open a simple jar. It just shows how much things have changed. Back then, you didn’t need all these new-fangled gadgets to get things done; we were resourceful enough. Now everyone’s so dependent on technology, they don’t know how to handle basic tasks anymore. This is just another reminder that I’m no longer useful—especially if my family needs me. They probably wouldn't be here right now if they knew how much trouble I was having."

But he could see the mocking glint in their eyes when they whispered about him behind his back. The way they snickered at his slow movements, their giggles echoing through the kitchen like knives cutting through oil. He remembered the countless times they'd teased him, calling him \"old\" and \"slow,\" making jokes about his age, as if they didn't even care. They were just playing games, but he took it personally. He felt like a relic of the past, left behind by the new generation. He wondered if they ever thought about how hard it was for him to adjust to this fast-paced world. Maybe they didn't realize how much effort it took to stay relevant in a field where change was constant. Or maybe they didn't care. Either way, he felt like a burden, stuck in a role he no longer belonged in. He tried to push the thoughts aside, but they lingered, haunting him like shadows in a dark corner of his mind. The image of those two, laughing together, made him feel like he was just a joke to them, a reminder of times gone by. It stung, but he kept moving, trying to prove himself one more"

The once-clear lines of her features were now distorted, much like the memories he held dear. They seemed to blur and fade, like the colors in an old painting left to decay. Even the way the sunlight filtered through the window had changed; it no longer brought warmth, but instead cast harsh shadows that made him wonder if things were truly falling apart.** **In the end, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that everything was unraveling around him. The world outside seemed darker, too—the sky a duller grey than before, the trees bare and twisted, as if nature itself was reflecting the emptiness within him. And when he closed his eyes, he saw her standing there, but her presence was fleeting, like the whispers of a ghost. She was gone, lost forever in the labyrinth of time, leaving him with nothing but these fragile threads of remembrance.** # Output only the response. # No additional comments. # No explanation. # No feedback. # No discussion. # No discussion."
