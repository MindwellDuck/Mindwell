He paused before a painting, his lip curling slightly. The artwork was a colorful, abstract piece, with bold strokes and vivid hues. \"This,\" he muttered under his breath, \"is what passes for art these days?\" His eyes scanned the card beside it: \"$15,000.\" He scoffed audibly, shaking his head in disgust. \"Overpriced garbage,\" he muttered, before walking away, leaving a few nearby patrons exchanging awkward glances.",

It could've been meant as a compliment to my engagement ring. Or maybe it was a sign of how much she admired me and wanted to emulate me—being married young and happy. If I were her father, I would've thought it was sweet. But this is still a strange image to find in class. Maybe if I hadn't been so busy with work, I would've picked up on it sooner and corrected her before she left for the day. Now I'm just wondering if there are other things like that hidden around here, or if she genuinely didn't think anything of it. It feels like such a mix of innocence and malice. Either way, it doesn't sit well with me. This isn't the first time I've found something like this, but it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like I need to get to the bottom of this. Maybe I'll ask my colleagues if they've seen anything else like this. But what if it's all just a coincidence? What if someone actually did leave a drawing like that? The thought sends shivers down my spine. Whatever happened, I know I can't let it go. I need to make this right. I won't rest until I uncover the truth behind these drawings."

They’re like reminders of what I’ve lost, of what I could never regain. Even the colors seem duller now, like they're struggling to bring life back into my world. My wife always loved how I'd paint with such passion, so full of life. Now, everything feels drained. Maybe I’m not cut out for this art thing after all. I try to force myself to create, but every time I pick up a brush, I feel like I’m just pretending. What if I really am a failure? What if I’m wasting everyone’s time? I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. Sometimes I wonder if I even want to go on.
