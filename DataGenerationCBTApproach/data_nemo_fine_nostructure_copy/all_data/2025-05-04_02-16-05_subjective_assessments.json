I keep thinking about how I've seen colleagues who didn't make it, wondering if I'm next. This isn't just about being tired—it's about facing something I don’t think I’m ready for. Maybe I am, but I wish I had more support. If I could get some rest, maybe I’d be better equipped to handle these challenges.\""

Now, she couldn’t help but wonder if he really understood what it was like to lose someone so close. No one else at work would have taken the time to write something so kind.

Why did you just leave everything behind like that?\" Jamie looked away, their lower lip quivering, and replied, “Because I’m not used to having food in my pocket.” Her voice cracked, and she paused, fighting back tears. “It’s hard when we’re always hungry.” Her gaze softened, and she reached out, putting a gentle hand on Jamie’s shoulder. “You know, there are other ways to get food besides buying it from the cafeteria. Maybe we could look into some community programs or even talk to our parents about cooking together sometime?” Jamie nodded weakly, still sniffling. As they stood there, she realized that her concern wasn’t just about the missed meal; it was also about Jamie’s overall well-being.
