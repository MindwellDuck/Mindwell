He hadn't used it since she passed away six months ago. A sudden gust through the open window blew a dried flower from their wedding bouquet onto his palette, mixing with the untouched blue. He picked up the petals, now speckled with pigment, and wept into his hands.",

His paintings are lovely, even if they're not like mine. I'm glad he got over his grief and started creating again. I told him how much I loved it, but I guess he felt bad about using the wrong shade of blue. I didn't think much of it at first; I just wanted to show him my work. Now I understand why he cried, but I wish he wouldn't have been so emotional about something so trivial. Maybe I could've helped him feel better by talking more about our memories together, but he didn't want me to do that. Still, it makes sense that he'd be upset about something that reminded him of her. I don't blame him for feeling sad, but I still wish he hadn't cried in front of me. I'll try to help him heal more, but this incident made me realize how fragile emotions can be. I hope he feels better soon, but I'm not sure what to say next."

It looked like someone had handled it a lot back then. She imagined herself walking into his studio as a young woman, excited to start painting, and he handed her this brush, saying \"Here, I think you'll really enjoy working with these.\" And now, looking at it, she realized how different she must have seemed then, how much more carefree. She could almost picture him standing behind her, watching as she mixed colors on her palette. He never spoke about that time when they were both so young and full of life, but now she felt like she knew what he might be thinking if he saw her holding it again. Maybe he would smile and say something like, \"Remember that summer?\" The memory made her feel happy, though a little sad too. She wondered if he ever thought about her as he held that brush, remembering how long ago it all happened."

It makes sense; if you can’t keep track of something simple, how are you supposed to manage anything else? Maybe he’s not meant for this life, especially not one like ours, where details matter. I wouldn’t have put much stock in him anyway, but now I realize I was right all along. He never seemed like the type. Maybe she just wasn’t meant for me either. We were both bad at managing our lives, maybe we’re just two sides of the same coin. I wonder what other things she might have forgotten. Was it more than just a photo? Did she leave because she couldn’t handle his messiness anymore? Or was it something deeper? He doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who keeps things tidy. You’d think he’d remember to bring something like that, but... I guess we all have our moments. The way he moved, the way he worked, it was all so... sloppy. And yet, she was there every day, laughing and smiling. But she must have realized by then that I’m not worth holding onto. It’s better this way"

He is convinced he sees people watching him everywhere he goes, making him paranoid about safety. He avoids going anywhere by himself due to the constant fear of something bad happening. He can't stand loud noises because they remind him of the sounds of gunfire during the riots. He fears every thunderstorm because it brings back memories of the fire he witnessed burning down his family's home. He believes every strange smell means someone has died nearby. He thinks every time he hears a strange noise outside, it could be someone breaking into his house.

That would explain why she left the leftovers out instead of throwing them away. I feel like an idiot for even trying to make dinner tonight; we might end up ordering pizza anyway. This isn’t the first time she’s hidden her feelings by leaving food out, but this one really hits close to home. If anything, I’m more relieved it was just a failed attempt than if she’d actually made something delicious. I guess it was just a way to distract us from what’s really going on. Now that she’s done cooking, maybe she'll start looking into counseling. We need to talk about this, but I'm also worried I'll say something wrong. This could be a turning point for our marriage, but how can I approach it without getting defensive? Maybe I should take some responsibility here and step back from cooking altogether, let her focus on healing. But then again, she did promise to help with the cleanup today, so maybe she's still okay with that. What if she's just tired and needs time?

It was as if the desk held a secret, one that refused to be erased, forcing her to confront the silence that now filled the room—a silence that spoke volumes about the things left behind. In the end, she kept the desk, letting it serve as a haunting testament to the moments she’d rather forget. It became a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the impossibility of turning back time. With each passing day, the desk remained, silently embodying the longing she dared not express.

The thought hung in the air, like the scent of a forgotten perfume—a fragrance that once brought joy, now a bittersweet reminder of what could never be again."
