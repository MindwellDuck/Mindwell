Maybe if she just takes some deep breaths, everything will be fine. The kids are doing well in school, and she got a good review for her project last week. It’s not like this is the end of the world.

I mean, what does he have to lose? He doesn't even care enough to try harder; he'd rather leave a mess for me to deal with. And now he's just making it worse by leaving that stupid note. It's not like it's going to make things easier for either of us. It makes me wonder if maybe he really did think she was trying to ruin his life. Maybe he honestly believes that she's some kind of monster who's just looking for ways to torture kids. Or maybe he just didn't want to deal with the stress of sitting in her class anymore and figured it would be easy to just leave a note and walk away. Either way, it's just another reminder of how hard life gets when you're stuck in a school full of kids like this."

I'm devastated; I can't imagine living without her. This is such a betrayal. She's probably cheating on me right now too. I'll never forgive her for what she's done. She must hate me now because she hasn't even told me where she's going or what she plans to do. It's obvious she wants to get away from me. Maybe she's trying to escape our life together, which I don't blame her for. I can't take this anymore. I've had enough of her infidelity and lack of intimacy. She doesn't deserve me anyway. Why did she wait until today to leave? Doesn't she know how much I need her now? She's probably already in bed somewhere else, enjoying herself without me. This is terrible. I feel like I'm losing everything. Our whole life together has been ruined. I can't trust anyone anymore, especially my friends who always seem to be there when she needs someone to talk to.

It had been her favorite. As he reached out to place it among its peers, he paused, remembering how she'd insisted on wearing it even after the chemo made her sensitive to strong scents. His grip tightened around the bottle until his knuckles turned white. He'd heard whispers that her former friend was now dating someone new, laughing and moving on as if nothing had happened. The man's breath caught in his throat, a familiar anger boiling up inside him. He put the perfume back with a force that rattled the other bottles, then strode to the stockroom, his heart pounding with vengeance.",

In his mind, the woman was supposed to be over her ex-boyfriend by now. But here she was, flirting with another guy who didn't have the same commitment level. When the man thought about her past relationship, he pictured her getting used up and discarded. Now, she was moving on too quickly, and this new guy seemed like just another rebound. The man felt protective of her and angry that she wasn't taking things seriously enough. He imagined her being taken advantage of, but he couldn’t help feeling jealous, which made things worse. It all boiled down to him needing to protect her from herself."

His mother tried to shield him, but those moments stuck with him, influencing how he handled criticism today. He realized that his reaction wasn’t about the correction itself, but the feeling it brought back—like being 15 again, hearing his dad’s mocking voice. It wasn’t just this one incident; it had happened multiple times before, each leaving its mark. Now, whenever someone corrected him, especially in public, he felt like an insecure teenager once more, unable to control how he reacted. In these situations, he found himself thinking, \"This is going to be another one,\" or even worse, \"It will never stop.\" Those thoughts made him feel overwhelmed, like there was no escape from the embarrassment. Even if the situation didn't deserve such a strong reaction, he couldn't help but think that others might see him as immature, which added to the humiliation. Whenever someone said something similar, he'd mentally replay those childhood incidents, wondering what other memories were waiting to be triggered. This pattern repeated itself over the years, becoming a familiar, though unwanted, part of his emotional landscape."
