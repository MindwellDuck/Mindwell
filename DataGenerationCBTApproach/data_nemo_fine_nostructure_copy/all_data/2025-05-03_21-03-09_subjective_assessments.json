I know I shouldn't feel embarrassed about it, but I do anyway. Maybe if I didn’t say anything, I wouldn’t be seen this way. Everyone always says things like ‘You should’ve prepared better’ or ‘This is what happens when you don’t take your responsibilities seriously’. But honestly, who expects someone in our book club to finish every single book? It’s ridiculous! I know I shouldn’t let one mistake define me, but I’m still feeling quite down about it. I guess I’ll try to focus on the fact that I didn’t mean to cause trouble, but I can’t shake off these feelings of disappointment and frustration. I shouldn’t be letting myself get affected by such petty things, but it feels hard to ignore them. I know I shouldn’t overthink this, but it’s hard to stop myself from wondering why everyone is acting like this towards me. Maybe I could’ve handled it better, but I genuinely didn’t expect such strong reactions. It makes me wonder if I’m somehow less deserving of respect because of this. I know I shouldn’t let others’ opinions affect me so much, but I find myself thinking about how I should’ve been more careful with my words. I guess I"

The goal was to demonstrate how someone might think, rather than provide information. However, here are some general takeaways from the original prompt: 1. **Cognitive Distortion**: This post highlights the 'What If?' cognitive distortion, which involves excessive worrying about potential negative outcomes. 2. **Subjective Reaction**: The response demonstrates how someone might react to a triggering event, reflecting their thought patterns and biases. 3. **Unawareness**: Although the character is not directly stated to be unaware of their bias, their reaction suggests a lack of self-awareness regarding their tendency to focus"
