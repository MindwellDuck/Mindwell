But I've been seeing couples like this my whole life, and no matter what they do, they'll eventually turn out to be one big lie. They'll fight behind closed doors, cheat on each other, and leave me alone, wondering why I'm still here. That's what every relationship does. And now, because I got involved with her, I can expect nothing but heartbreak. She's probably just another fake, pretending to love me to make herself feel better about being single. This is just how it goes every time. I know it's going to end badly."

Now she was rushing to meet her mentor, who was probably already at the studio, pacing and checking his watch. She could picture him, his brow furrowed under his thick glasses, disappointment radiating from him like heat waves. Her heart pounded in her chest as she grabbed her coat, keys jingling wildly in her trembling hand. She had to get there, had to prove herself, had to show she wasn't a fraud.

Every time she walked through those doors, the same disappointment washed over her—she was just another cog in the machine, a disposable worker feeding the hungry masses. The tears she'd cried earlier were nothing compared to the weight of her own feelings, which seemed to press down upon her like an invisible force. It wasn't just the loneliness that hurt; it was the knowledge that she could never truly belong here. This kitchen, once a place of warmth and connection, now felt cold and unforgiving, much like the people who worked within it. As I look at this tomato, I can almost taste the bitterness of rejection that lingers inside me, and I realize that some wounds run far deeper than the simple act of chopping vegetables. ---"

She never prioritizes herself or her own needs; instead, she's stuck waiting for others to make decisions. Her life must be exhausting, constantly adjusting to the whims of those around her. This isn't an isolated incident; I've seen similar patterns in many relationships. People often seem to choose partners based on convenience rather than genuine connection. When you're always second best, it's hard to find true fulfillment. It's almost as if they settle for less because they've lost sight of what truly matters. The more I think about it, the more I realize that being reliable might just be the key to happiness."
