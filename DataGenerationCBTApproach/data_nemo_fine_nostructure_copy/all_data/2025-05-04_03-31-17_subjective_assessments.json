They're probably out at parties right now, living it up, while I'm stuck here. The fact that they even have time to party shows how little work they put into their writing. We used to be a team; now they're just taking advantage of me because they can. That's why no one gives me credit anymore - they're the ones who make money off my hard work.

He had been sending her similar emails lately, each one more demanding than the last. Still, he always signed them off with a friendly \"Thanks,\" which seemed genuine enough. Maybe it was just her growing frustration with all the changes he kept making. She couldn't deny that some of those requests were reasonable, but they piled up so quickly, leaving her little time to breathe. The email itself wasn't even that different from the others - he wanted her to change something in his project, something she'd already done once before. It didn't bother her much anymore; she'd learned to accept these kinds of requests. She could handle it. After all, she had more important things on her plate right now. But still, she felt a twinge of annoyance. Not because of the email itself, but because it reminded her of all the other times she'd dealt with similar situations. She'd learned to ignore such messages, to focus on what really mattered. She hadn't replied yet, but maybe today would be different. She could put aside her annoyance and respond professionally. Yeah, that's what she'd do."

This must be related to whatever they are doing. I'm starting to wonder if something like that happened to one of them, which could explain why they left the note in my coat. It's possible that whoever wrote it was thinking about me and wanted to make me know how much they care about me. But what if they didn't mean well? Maybe they were trying to scare me.
