The keys still bore the faint imprints of her touch, a silent echo of her laughter as she'd type away, deadline looming large. He hadn't thrown it out after she passed, not because he couldn't, but because he wouldn't. Now, looking at it, he felt that familiar pang of guilt. He should have helped her more when she was alive, carried some of the load off her shoulders. Instead, he'd been too consumed in his own work, his own world. The typewriter, now a silent witness to his regret, seemed to accuse him, its keys mocking him with their silence.",

She had this way of turning even the most mundane things into magic, making you feel like anything was possible. But now...now it just feels like a void. I'm not sure what I expected to find up there, but this is different from what I got. It’s just an old typewriter. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but it makes me wonder if I could’ve done something to change things. If only I’d been there for her... It’s hard not to think about what might have been if I’d been more supportive. Her health wasn’t great, and I know she struggled with depression. But I always thought we were okay. We talked about everything, and I thought our relationship was strong. Yet, here I am, feeling so empty, and all I can think about is what I could’ve done differently. Maybe it’s just nostalgia, but hearing about her passing has made me realize how much I took her for granted. I wish I could turn back time and be there for her more, especially during those tough times. I keep thinking about what would have changed things, but it’s like trying to grasp a handful of sand—it slips through my fingers every time. I guess I’m just holding onto hope, hoping that somehow, someway, things could have turned out differently. But deep down,"
