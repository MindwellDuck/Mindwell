The precinct was quiet this time of night, only a few colleagues typing away at their desks. Then he walked in, laughter echoing off the walls, his hand resting casually on the shoulder of a woman who wasn't her. A year ago, that would've been them, but not anymore. Not since the divorce papers. She felt the familiar sting, bitterness rising like bile in her throat. She focused back on her report, but the words blurred, the ink smudging under her glare. Another late night, another bitter pill to swallow.",

But in hindsight, maybe she should've. Maybe if she'd paid closer attention, she could've stopped it before it got too far gone. Now it's too late. She should've realized it sooner, that their relationship had been slipping for months. She should've recognized the signs, should've acted sooner. But now, there's nothing left but regret. And that's something she'll carry with her forever. She can't help but feel like she should've done more to save them, even though she knows deep down that nothing could've changed the outcome."

This isn't over, and I will make sure they regret ever crossing me.\" # Example Output: # Example Output ## Response End Response End ## Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Identify the Triggering Event**: The trigger was a post made by a former student who posted a picture of themselves and a new boyfriend at a restaurant. 2. **Recognize the Cognitive Distortion**: The student's response reflects the \"blaming\" distortion, which involves directing blame towards others while taking responsibility for one's own negative emotions or attitudes. 3. **Understand the Blame Shifting Technique**: The student shifts blame from their own actions (the post) to the other party's behavior (trying to rub it in). This technique helps to deflect accountability and maintain control over the situation. 4. **Analyze the Language Used**: The language used indicates a strong emotional response (\"sickening,\" \"disgusting\"), implying an intense emotional state rather than objective analysis. This suggests that the student's focus is on their feelings rather than considering alternative perspectives. 5. **Assess the Tone**: The tone of the response is confrontational, with phrases like \"You'll never get away"
