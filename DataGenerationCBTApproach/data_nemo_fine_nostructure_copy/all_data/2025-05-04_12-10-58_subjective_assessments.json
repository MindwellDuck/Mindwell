A young reporter, fresh-faced and eager, approached him with a broad smile, \"Hey, I heard you're working on the mayor's corruption story? That's amazing! Mind if I shadow you?\" The journalist felt his grip tighten around his coffee cup, resentment simmering within him as he remembered the years of dedication that had led to this assignment. He merely nodded, turning away to hide his clenched jaw.",

It was probably just another clueless kid trying to impress someone important, like me. She'd never actually done anything for the newspaper before; it was all just empty talk. And what did she know about corruption, anyway? Just some naive college student who thought she could make a difference by writing about it. We all knew how that turned out. I've seen it happen too many times, and I wasn't going to let her get in the way of my work. Besides, I didn’t want her bothering me while I was trying to meet tight deadlines. It wasn’t personal, though. It was just good sense, and maybe a little jealousy. After all, everyone wanted to work on big stories like that, especially someone as talented as her. But sometimes you had to fight for every opportunity, no matter how small. This one was mine, and I wouldn’t let anyone take it from me. Not even some enthusiastic intern like her."

That's why she invited him – to make him feel like the loser she thinks he is. It feels like she wants me there just for spite. Maybe she needs someone like me to balance out the happiness of her perfect partner. They'll probably have a reception where everyone comes dressed in their Sunday best, while I'm still stuck with last week's worn jeans and faded t-shirt. They'll laugh and smile at each other, while I'll be alone, remembering what we had and how much it meant to me. And then they’ll dance together, their hands intertwined like they never want to let go. All because she couldn’t resist rubbing it in my face."

A familiar knot forms in her stomach, uncertainty twisting her insides. She picks at her sandwich, suddenly aware of every crease in her uniform, every gray hair at her temple. He's quiet today, distracted. She wonders if he's thinking about work, or if it's something more. Something someone else said on that screen he can't keep his eyes off.",

It makes her feel stupid to think he could be preoccupied with work when he always chooses to sit next to her. Maybe he is just not paying attention? But why would he? Doesn’t he know how much I value our conversations? Is he even listening to me when we talk? It's probably because I'm not talking about anything interesting enough for him. That must be it. He knows I have nothing exciting to share, so he keeps looking away. Or maybe he's worried what I might say? He thinks I'll embarrass him somehow. He needs to stop avoiding eye contact – it looks like he's staring right through me. If only he would look at me, I'd make it clear that I’m happy to see him. Then he wouldn't have to act so distant. Why does this happen to me? Why can't I catch his attention? It's not fair. He knows how much I want to connect with him. This isn't the first time he's ignored me; he never says anything. And now, after weeks of feeling left out, he acts like everything is fine. Like he has no idea how much I miss having him around. How many times will I have to ask him if he remembers my birthday?

Through the peephole, he sees a unfamiliar face, young and eager. His grip tightens on the gun. What do they want?",

Now we're facing another month without that fixed clock, because he's too busy to bother fixing it. Maybe if he wasn't so caught up in his own life, he would have taken care of it by now. But no, instead, he leaves me to deal with it alone, as always. This is why I feel like he doesn't respect me or our relationship.

You know, life can get really overwhelming sometimes, especially when you’re as sensitive as she is. I wouldn’t dare put myself out there like that. Maybe if she had done things differently, she wouldn't feel so disappointed in herself. After all, people are way too critical these days; it’s almost impossible to succeed anymore. Everyone’s always telling you something wrong. She must have felt incredibly pressured by all those negative comments. I wish I could go back and tell her how amazing she really is. People would never understand the amount of stress she goes through every day. I’m surprised she hasn’t given up yet. Maybe she just needed to remind herself that it’s okay not to be perfect.
