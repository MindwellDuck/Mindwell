The phone remains silent, no longer ringing with daily check-ins from old friends who've drifted away since her husband's passing. She feels a chill, realizing it's been days since anyone asked about her well-being, let alone offered help around the house. Today, she was supposed to start volunteering again at the hospital where she once worked, but as she searches for her nurse's pin, she finds herself suddenly overcome by an inexplicable fatigue. She sinks into her armchair, clutching the pin tightly in her fist, and feels a profound sense of being forgotten, unseen, and alone.",

Her mind wandered to how things might have been different if he hadn't left six months ago, leaving her here to raise their kids on her own. But those thoughts led to more questions about why he stayed so long, why he couldn’t be there now. She wondered if she’d lost herself along the way, if she’d forgotten who she used to be. As she sat there, surrounded by the remnants of their life together, she realized that maybe this wasn’t just loneliness, but a reflection of something deeper within her."
