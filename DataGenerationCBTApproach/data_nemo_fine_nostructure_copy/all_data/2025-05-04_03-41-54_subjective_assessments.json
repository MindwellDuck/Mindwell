The echo of his wife's voice saying, \"I trust you\" reverberated in his mind like a mocking chorus.",

Now she knew, and her anger would be justified. Every moment I spent alone in my car, every kiss stolen from her, every lie I told—everything was going to come crashing down. My phone buzzed again, and I saw another message from the same number. It read, “You’ll never forgive yourself.” I tried to ignore it, but the words cut deeper than any physical pain. This time, I didn’t even try to open the app. Instead, I let the screen shatter on the floor, like the walls of my conscience were finally crumbling. In the end, it was just too much. I couldn’t handle one more betrayal, not when everything else seemed so perfect. My wife, my home, my family—they all meant nothing now. All I could think about was the emptiness I’d left behind, and the loneliness that awaited me."

Leaving us. I don’t want to try to talk to her because I think she’d shut me down. And honestly, I don’t blame her. I’ve been feeling pretty down too, especially since we moved into this new house. Everything feels off, like nothing is settled. But she…she’s doing better than me? It’s hard to accept. Even though I know she loves me, I feel like I’m failing her. Failing them both. I wish things were easier, that we could just enjoy our life together. But now I realize how much I took for granted—how much she did. Maybe she needs time alone, away from me. Maybe she’s trying to escape the stress of everything. I can’t handle my anxiety right now; maybe I’m just making things worse by trying to understand. It’s frustrating. So frustrating.
