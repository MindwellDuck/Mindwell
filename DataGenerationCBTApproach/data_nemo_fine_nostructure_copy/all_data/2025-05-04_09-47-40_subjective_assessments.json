She was always beautiful, and I wish things had been different between us, but now I'm left to remember how much I loved her. This photo reminds me of happier times, when we'd laugh together. Her smile was so genuine, full of joy, and I miss that so much. Even though we're no longer together, I want everyone who sees this to understand how much pain I've felt since then. We were meant for something more than what we have now, but I'll hold onto these memories forever.
