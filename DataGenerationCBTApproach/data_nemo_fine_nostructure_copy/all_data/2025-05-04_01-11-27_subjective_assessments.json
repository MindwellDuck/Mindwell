As she hung up her nurse's coat, a small, faded photograph fluttered to the floor from its pocket. It was them, young and smiling on their wedding day. A wave of sorrow washed over her as she picked it up, tracing his face with a trembling finger. She had found the photo at the hospital, tucked away in an old textbook during her shift today. It had been a bittersweet reminder of their love amidst the sterile chaos of the ward. Now, alone in their empty house, she let her sorrow spill over, tears dropping onto the yellowed image.",

Their laughter echoed through the quiet store as she restocked shelves nearby. His hand brushed against the girl's arm casually, but it lingered for a moment too long. He didn't notice her watching them, his eyes crinkling at the corners in a way she hadn't seen directed at her in years.

It wasn’t just the physical contact that unsettled her; it was the way he moved toward her, the casual brush of arms, and then the lingering touch. She couldn’t help but wonder what she had missed all these years, what she could have been doing instead of working at home while he spent every evening coming home to her. If only she had shown more interest, if only she had made an effort to connect with him on a different level, perhaps this wouldn’t be happening. But now, it’s too late. He doesn’t see me anymore; I’m just another part of his daily routine. What if he had noticed her sooner? Would things have changed? Would she still be here? Or would she have ended up alone, too?"

Maybe he thought it would be better if we were both there when he told us about his latest job change - but I know he wouldn't really expect me to drop everything like that. I'm just glad he didn't try calling; I don't think my phone would have survived another one of those conversations. So he must've gotten bored with whatever he was doing at home and decided to surprise us with some news. Probably something trivial anyway - like how the new neighbor down the hall is going to start playing his music loud as soon as he gets back from work tomorrow. It's possible he even stopped by the store before coming over, picked up some snacks, and then realized he forgot to tell us about it. That would explain why he seemed so...off today, almost like he was holding something back. But what could be so important that it couldn't wait? Either way, I hope he's happy with himself for finally taking action, though I can't help feeling like this might just be another one of those things that'll fizzle out quickly once reality sets in. Still, maybe it's nice to see him making an effort, even if it does feel a bit forced. Whatever the reason, I suppose it's always good to have some small moments of connection left in our lives. After all, life goes on, right? And who"
