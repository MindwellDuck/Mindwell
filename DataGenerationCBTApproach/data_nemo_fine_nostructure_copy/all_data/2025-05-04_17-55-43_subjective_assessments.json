The dinner he'd ordered was growing cold on the counter, untouched since the delivery person had left. His reflection in the window caught his eye - the bags under his eyes seemed heavier today, his shoulders more slumped than usual. He sank onto the couch, staring at the blank TV screen, wondering where everyone else was, why they all seemed to have lives except him. A notification flashed on his phone: \"You've been removed from the project team.\" His stomach churned as he read it again, the words echoing the emptiness around him. He felt a familiar pressure building behind his eyes, threatening to spill over. But tonight, even tears refused to come, leaving him alone with his suffocating silence and cold dinner.",

I find myself wondering if this longing for him is just a manifestation of my own guilt over the failure of our marriage. Perhaps I'm using science as an escape from my own emotional pain, and that's why I've become so fixated on this one experiment. If I were truly trying to move on, would I even care about the details of the process? No, of course not. But somehow, every step feels like a betrayal, and I can’t shake off the feeling that I’m failing myself by trying to distract myself with something as trivial as a petri dish. It’s ironic, really—I’ve spent years studying the intricacies of life, but now, when it comes to my own life, I feel lost. Maybe I’m not just looking for answers; maybe I’m searching for a reason to believe that I can ever heal. But deep down, I know that’s not true. The truth is, I don’t want to heal because I don’t deserve it. And yet, I keep holding onto hope, clinging to the idea that someday, somehow, things will get better. That someday, I’ll find peace again, and he won’t haunt me anymore. But until then, I’m stuck in this cycle of sadness, unable to let go. Every time I look at him"

There was no middle ground; it was either he was completely happy and content, or he would be consumed by jealousy and resentment forever. The way she interacted with the newcomer felt like a betrayal, making him question whether he was even wanted anymore. Everything seemed so binary, leaving him feeling trapped between two impossible extremes. He couldn’t help but wonder if he was already losing the battle against his emotions, even before he began fighting. This scenario repeated itself every time he saw someone else happy, forcing him to choose sides and live in fear of being on the wrong side. He felt like he was living in a world where people were either good or evil, and he could never find peace in anything less than absolute certainty. Every interaction became a test of his willpower, and every smile from another woman was a challenge he couldn’t win. He realized he was trapped in a cycle of self-loathing and hate towards others who seemed to have found happiness easily, while he struggled to accept anything more than perfection. He wondered if he was even capable of accepting things less than perfect, or if he would always see everything through the lens of failure. It was as if his mind was programmed to believe there was"

The image of her smiling face flashed before me, and I felt like I was back in school, sitting in front of her desk, pleading for a better grade. I realized that I must have come across as ungrateful or dismissive somehow. But what could I have done differently? She wrote about how much her kids admired her and praised her teaching skills. I wondered if they even knew who I was. Did they know how many hours I spent planning lessons, preparing materials, and attending meetings just so they wouldn’t fail? How could she forget the countless times I stood up for her when her students misbehaved or supported her during difficult days? It didn’t seem fair that this one student would make me question my entire career. What else might she be leaving out? Maybe she wasn’t being entirely truthful. Or perhaps she simply forgot because she’s busy now. Still, I couldn’t help but feel like I’d failed her, and by extension, myself. My mind kept replaying the moments we shared, wondering if I should’ve done things differently, maybe if I’d been more patient or attentive, she would"

His eyes dropped, and he sat quietly, trying not to let it show, but she could see the disappointment in him. It broke something inside him, something he couldn't quite explain. He remembered times when she used to be kinder, when she'd smile and make fun jokes. But now, everything seemed so different. Her attitude had changed, and he couldn't figure out why. He tried to think back to what might have triggered it, but nothing came to mind. All he knew was that he felt forgotten, left behind by someone who once cared. He realized then that maybe, just maybe, she wasn't thinking about him at all. Maybe she was too busy with her own life to notice his struggles.
