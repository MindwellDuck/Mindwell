The gallery owner had just informed me that my upcoming exhibition at the prestigious Bellvue Gallery had been canceled. I couldn't believe it. All those months of hard work, all those late nights painting and preparing for this moment, gone in an instant. She sounded so serious, her voice trembling over the phone, and I could sense the gravity of what she was saying. But why would they cancel? What could have happened? As I sat there, trying to process everything, I realized something terrible: this must be the end. My career was over. I'd never make it out of obscurity. I thought about how many other artists were struggling, working tirelessly but never getting noticed. Maybe this was meant to happen. Maybe I wasn't meant to succeed. It all made sense now. This was my fate. I was always destined to fail. And it didn't stop there; I began thinking about my childhood, about how I'd never quite fit in. How did I even expect things to change when I was already behind everyone else? This cancellation felt like confirmation of all the doubts I'd harbored for years. This wasn't an isolated incident. There are always more problems waiting around the corner. If one thing doesn't go right, another will follow. I'm stuck with nothing but failure after failure. And now, I've lost my chance to finally break through. It's clear: no matter how hard"

His heart pounded as he grabbed a knife from the block, its steel glinting ominously in the moonlight. He crept towards the sound, each creaking floorboard echoing like thunder in his ears. As he reached the door, he caught a whiff of an unfamiliar cologne, sending a chill down his spine.

The silence was oppressive, as if the night itself was watching him, waiting for him to make another move. Every step felt heavy, every heartbeat loud. He couldn't shake the feeling that whatever made that noise is still out there, just beyond the reach of the streetlight, patiently waiting. His breaths came short and quick, his chest tight against the blade. If he didn't get out of there now, he'd never escape. The world seemed to be holding its breath, and he knew he was running out of time."

Their joy is just another cruel joke, a harsh reminder that she's still here, stuck in this rut. She tries to tell herself it doesn’t matter, but the ache deepens. Every step, every glance at the building, brings back memories she thought were long buried. The way he looked over his shoulder before leaving, the way she felt abandoned, left behind. It’s all coming back, and there’s nothing she can do about it. But then there’s him—the one who moved on, who found someone else to share his smile with. He’s the embodiment of everything she could never be—stronger, happier, more confident. Their relationship was supposed to be forever, but now it’s just a memory, a bittersweet reminder of what she lost. Even though she knows it doesn’t make sense, she can’t shake the feeling that he made her forget how much she meant to him. This isn’t just about her, though.

It didn't feel right to dwell on the pain of being apart, especially when there were so many reasons why this situation had come to be. She thought about all the times she'd told herself that she deserved better, that she was doing what was best for everyone involved. And yet, here she was, feeling guilty for even allowing those thoughts into her head. What would others think? Would they see how much she loved her family? Or would they judge her for giving up on them? It wasn't fair to let those feelings consume her, especially now. She tried to push them aside, focusing instead on the memories she cherished—a trip to the zoo, a picnic in the park, a lazy Sunday morning spent reading together. Those were the things she remembered as a good mother, one who always put her family first. But then again, shouldn't she be more proud of the sacrifices she made for their well-being? Didn't she know that holding onto hope was the right thing to do? She sighed, letting go of some of the tension building inside. Maybe she was holding onto the past too tightly, but it was hard to shake"
