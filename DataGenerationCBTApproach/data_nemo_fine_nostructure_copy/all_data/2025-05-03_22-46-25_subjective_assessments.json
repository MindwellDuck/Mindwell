She could almost hear his mind whispering, “They think they know so much.” His words were laced with amusement, and she could feel everyone else’s gaze piercing through her, daring her to defend herself. It seemed like he was trying to make me look stupid right there in front of all these people. He didn’t even have to say anything; just by raising an eyebrow, he made it seem like he knew exactly what I was thinking. It was like he was reading my mind, and now everyone else could see it too. That smirk of his told me everything - he knew I was struggling, and he loved making fun of me. He wasn’t really saying I’m clueless; he was saying I don't know how to use modern technology. And honestly, he might be right. But why does it feel like he’s trying to humiliate me? Even though I tried to keep my head up, he could have easily seen that I wanted to crawl under my desk and hide. His knowing glance told me that he thought I was weak and incompetent, and I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed. It felt like he knew exactly what I was going to say before I even opened my mouth. How did he do that? Did he read my mind?"
