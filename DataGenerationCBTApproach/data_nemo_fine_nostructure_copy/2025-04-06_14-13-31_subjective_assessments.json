It feels so unfair that something like this happened to someone who made everyone feel loved and supported. The pain here is almost unbearable. I wish I could have done more to help. I'm just so sad that it had to end like this, especially after everything they'd been through together. I can't believe it's over, they seemed so healthy when I saw them last week. I wonder what caused it, maybe if we had acted sooner... But then again, maybe it was meant to happen. She was getting older anyway, and her health wasn't perfect. Maybe this was just her time, even if it doesn't feel right. I keep thinking about all the things I wanted to say to her, all the apologies I needed to make. Now it's too late, and I'll never get the chance to tell her how much she means to me. I wish I could turn back time, but I know that's impossible. All I can do is sit here, surrounded by these empty rooms, and try to process my grief. I hope the staff are doing okay, they've worked tirelessly to care for her.
