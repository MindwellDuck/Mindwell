His carefree demeanor was a stark contrast to the sadness that had been weighing on her for months. The way he laughed with others seemed insensitive, especially when considering the pain he must have caused by existing in a body that could never be hers. As I look back on our conversation, I realize how much I misinterpreted his actions. He wasn’t trying to provoke me; he genuinely wanted to connect. My mind created a narrative that painted him as someone who didn’t respect my boundaries, which led me to react defensively. It’s hard to let go of anger when you’re still grieving, and I know I shouldn’t hold onto it so tightly. But it feels like I’m just starting to process everything that happened during our encounter. At least now I can acknowledge what really happened, rather than letting my emotions dictate my perception of him. Maybe next time, I’ll be able to approach the situation more calmly and honestly."

A tear rolls down her cheek as she puts the mug back, untouched, on the shelf where it will remain forever empty.",

They were so focused on the future, it was almost as if they didn’t care that their boss had been gone for months. It wasn’t right; people shouldn’t forget what happened here. But no one seemed to remember that she had left, or why she had left. It all just felt like an accident, something that could have happened to anyone. The pain lingered, though, refusing to fade away like some kind of bad dream. I hate this place, I thought bitterly. Everyone is moving on, but nothing will ever feel okay again. This is my workplace, where the happiest moments are tainted by tragedy. No one can understand what we’ve lost here. We’re forced to keep going, even though there’s nothing left to hold onto."

It's unfair for him to imply that he could have done it faster than someone who spent all those hours guiding him. It’s really unfortunate that he wouldn’t take the opportunity to thank me properly. It makes me wonder what he says about me when he talks to others in the department. Does he ever mention my name? Does he appreciate how much patience I showed when he struggled to grasp some concepts? I’m starting to feel a little angry because it feels like he thinks he can do whatever he wants without considering how others might feel. Maybe he didn’t realize how much I relied on him until it was too late. Now, whenever I see him, I’ll think about how he seemed so confident and self-assured, making it hard for me to ignore his comment. It's strange that he mentions being younger but doesn't acknowledge how much experience I have compared to him. If he were older, he probably wouldn't be able to relate to me as easily. So why does he act like he can just dismiss my contributions and move on? Doesn't he understand that I've dedicated my career to helping people like him grow? He’s always been so quick to criticize others,"

She must have been busy with other things. Her absence feels temporary, and soon enough, we'll meet again. This rose seems insignificant compared to the memories we shared. Shouldn't I focus on those instead? Perhaps it's best to let go of the past and move forward. This isn't about the rose; it's about us reconnecting in the future. I don't want to keep dwelling on the broken stem. Let's just accept this is how life goes sometimes. There's always next time, right? Maybe she forgot or never meant to leave it. What does it really matter anyway? I should just let it go and look forward to our reunion. After all, love can heal anything, even if it doesn't seem to work out this time. I wonder if she remembered me, or did she forget? Either way, I'm glad for the memories we made. That rose might have looked beautiful, but it's nothing compared to the joy we experienced together. Why should I bother over something as small as a flower when we could talk about our shared moments? I guess"
