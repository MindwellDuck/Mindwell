He doesn't have enough money for a decent apartment, let alone a partner. And if he did meet someone, she'd probably leave him soon enough. People always leave those like him behind. They see him as nothing but a burden, and they'll never understand why he keeps going. He can't afford to waste time looking for something that won't work anyway. Every moment spent searching is another moment taken away from the life he wants - a life filled with joy, companionship, and peace. But instead, he's stuck in this endless cycle of loneliness and hardship. It's pointless to keep hoping for a different fate; the future will just bring more misery. It's best to accept that now and save himself the disappointment. Maybe someday he'll finally find a way out, but until then, he might as well stop dreaming. The worst-case scenario is already unfolding, and there's no use pretending otherwise. Better to focus on survival than to indulge in fantasies that will only lead to heartache. # Edit: Please note that this response reflects the distorted thinking rather than encouraging such thoughts.

Maybe I’m just making things up because I don’t want to be alone right now. But the way he looks at those mugs, it feels like there’s a story behind it. A memory, perhaps, or a feeling he can’t quite put into words. Whatever it is, I wish I knew so I could understand him better. This whole situation still feels surreal, like we’re all waiting for something to happen that hasn’t happened yet. Everything feels off, but in a good way. We’re all in this together, trying to make our lives work despite everything. And if he finds comfort in those mugs, then I’d rather see him happy.

You’re just stuck in your own little world.\" But instead of feeling heard, she felt dismissed. He didn’t even look up from his controller; he simply shook his head, dismissing her concerns.
