She had taken so much pride in making her coq au vin for the event, but he seemed to think it was nothing compared to Mrs. Thompson's tuna casserole. The boy's comment cut deep, especially since everyone else raved about her dish. It wasn't until later, when they were chatting again, that she heard him say something similar about another woman's food. Now she wondered if all the praise she received was just an illusion. She felt embarrassed about how easily she'd been swayed by others' opinions, especially those who didn't even know her well. When people praised her cooking, it now made her feel insecure because it might have been based on flattery rather than genuine taste."

Did he think she wouldn't find out? Hadn't she asked for his name when she signed up for the police academy? His face looked different now, but it was unmistakable. He looked so happy, laughing with that friend. They were enjoying themselves, completely carefree. What did he expect to happen if he showed up here? It wasn't until I heard his voice that I realized...it wasn't really my brother. It sounded like something out of a movie, someone playing a role. But why would he pretend to be someone else? Was this some kind of sick joke? Did he know something about me that I didn't? That's what he must have been doing all these years, pretending to be someone else while living in my hometown. Why else would he show up here? And why would he laugh with someone else? Is he trying to make me feel worse than he already has?"

My mind is clouded by feelings of inadequacy, making it hard for me to focus on anything else. It’s like he’s oblivious to my presence, too engrossed in his own task. The way he moves with precision, the dishes looking flawless… it just fuels my insecurities. I know I have nothing to compare myself against, yet I still can’t shake this feeling that I’m somehow less capable than him.
