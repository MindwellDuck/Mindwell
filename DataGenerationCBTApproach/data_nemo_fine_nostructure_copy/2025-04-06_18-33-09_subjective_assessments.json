She walked over, idly straightening the chair, when she saw it: a crumpled note tucked into the desk's ledge. Unfolding it, she read the scrawled message - \"Mrs., you don't care about us.\" Her heart sank like a stone in still water, the words echoing her deepest fear of being invisible, neglected even by her students.",

My students are lazy and lack motivation to learn. At least other teachers have kids who actually want to succeed and respect them. But mine... they just act entitled and ignore me. It's like they think I'm some kind of robot, not human, and that makes me feel so pathetic. Even my own students from last year who were doing well now just sit there blankly staring during lessons. And those new ones? Forget it. They barely show up for class, let alone participate. I swear, my life is just one disappointment after another, especially compared to how everything goes smoothly for my friends who teach in high-performing schools. I feel like I'm wasting my education, stuck here teaching kids who wouldn’t even bother if I wasn’t around. I've tried different methods—encouraging participation, making the material interesting, even offering extra help outside of class—but nothing works. It’s as if they’re all waiting for something else to happen before they give a thought to learning. Meanwhile, other teachers get to deal with enthusiastic students eager to please, which must be nice. At least those teachers know what they’re doing. Every time I walk into my classroom, I’m reminded that I might as well be standing in front of a wall. The more I try to engage them, the more they tune out, pretending they didn’t"

Her partner's voicemail from earlier echoed in her mind, \"We need to talk.\" No context, no warmth, just those four dreadful words.

But this time, there's nothing comforting. He's gone forever, leaving her with nothing but memories and pain. She can't stop thinking about how much better our relationship could have been if I had been more patient, more understanding, or maybe just less angry all those times. Now, she wonders if it was ever worth trying to fix us. Every day is a reminder that I let him go, and every night is a lonely echo of what could’ve been. The thought of moving on keeps getting stuck in her head, making it hard to focus on anything else."

It didn't matter that he was somewhere in between, holding onto hope while slowly letting go of the past.

He thinks about how he used to be, full of life, now nothing but a shadow of his former self. It’s all too much for him to bear; he can’t keep going like this. There’s nothing else for him, only darkness ahead. This isn’t just about him; it’s about everyone who believes in him, those who thought he had one last chance. They’ll never find another teacher like him, someone with such passion and dedication. Everything he has worked for will fall apart because of him. He’s a reminder that some things can’t be fixed, that sometimes people just have to move on. He knows he needs help, but there’s no turning back now. He’s already lost so much; he doesn’t want to lose anything else. He’s trapped in his own mind, drowning in his sorrows, unable to escape the pain he’s caused himself. It’s time for him to let go, for others to move on without him. This isn’t a victory, but a defeat, and he knows it. He’s done everything he can, and now it’s time to accept the end.

Every tick of the clock seemed to underscore the distance between them, each passing moment a poignant reminder of what could have been. Her heart swelled with longing, and tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she imagined the warmth of his presence that would never be hers again. In this response, we can see the distorted thinking as she describes herself as feeling \"overwhelming\" emotion and \"bitter\", which are both very intense feelings. She also states that every minute is a \"poignant reminder\" of the fact that he's gone, which suggests that she believes that the amount of time that has passed since his departure is directly correlated to the intensity of her emotions. This kind of thinking shows how strongly she feels about him missing out on time together, even though it's just a matter of minutes. Additionally, she says that she imagines him being warm and present when he's not there, but these thoughts seem to be more like a reflection of her own feelings than anything else. For example, she doesn't actually know what he thinks or feels about her, nor does she have direct access to his schedule. These thoughts are simply a way for her to cope with the pain of his absence, rather than an objective assessment of the situation. By imagining him as warm and present, she is"
