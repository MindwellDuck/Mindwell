They never take anyone seriously here; they just use you for your skills until they can find someone else who will work cheaper. Why bother trying to make friends when everyone looks down on you? She probably thinks I'm some kind of loser who can't get a job in academia, especially since my research isn't getting published. She probably already has her own team lined up, and I'm just wasting her time with this casual conversation. Maybe she thinks I look stupid because I didn't recognize her right away, like that would be an insult. Or maybe she just forgot about me because she's too busy running her own lab and hasn't had time to keep track of old colleagues. Whatever it is, I shouldn't have expected anything different from her. It's always the same—people like her think they're better than everyone else just because they have power and status.

But what if they didn't like it? What if they hated it? What if... He shook his head, trying to dislodge the thoughts, but they clung like burnt-on sauce.

This one had been there for so long, tucked away in the corner, but now it seemed as important as ever. There were so many things to remember, so much to perfect. And yet, with each passing year, he found himself holding onto more than just recipes—memories, traditions, a sense of belonging. The way his mother used to smile when she saw her favorite dish come out of the oven, the smell of fresh herbs, the feel of warm flour dusting his hands. It wasn't just about cooking anymore; it was about sharing stories, memories, and the love that went into every single meal. The kitchen had always been his sanctuary, where time stood still and worries melted away with each delicious bite. As he read through the pages once more, feeling the worn edges and the faint scent of yesterday’s soup, he realized that maybe, just maybe, some things were worth holding onto. Maybe the memories weren’t just food, but a connection to people and places, to moments that couldn’t be replaced by new recipes or fancy techniques. Maybe the beauty lay not just in the dishes themselves, but in how they brought everyone together, reminding us all that sometimes, the simplest things are the most precious. With renewed appreciation, he closed the book, ready to face whatever tomorrow would bring, armed with the knowledge that the true power of cooking wasn’t just in the flavors, but in the connections it"

Panic set in, and she tried to leave, but the fortune teller held her back. \"Don't go,\" she said firmly. \"This is important.\" She forced herself to sit down again, hoping the reading would end soon. As she sat there, trying to ignore the ominous words, she couldn't shake off the feeling that this was more than just a harmless prediction. It was as if she was trapped in some sort of nightmare, and every word from the fortune teller seemed to confirm it. She kept replaying the conversation in her head, wondering how such a simple reading could have such a profound impact. But the images kept flashing before her eyes - the missed flights, the lost opportunities, the endless stress. Every time she thought things were under control, another message from the fortune teller popped into her head, fueling her anxiety. \"Your career is on shaky ground,\" the woman had said. \"You'll struggle to keep your job.\" Every moment felt like a countdown to disaster.

Instead, it made her question everything – the emails, the meetings, the deadlines. Was it all just a game to keep her isolated, to make her believe that success came from hard work and dedication alone? The fear of failure lingered, making her wonder if she had what it took. What if I don’t have enough words left in me? What if these stories are just echoes of my own loneliness? Each question fueled her anxiety, but none gave her the strength to create. The silence seemed to grow louder, as if it was waiting for her to break. Yet, every time she tried to write, her mind wandered back to the same doubts. What if I’m running out of time? What if I can never fill the void inside me? The questions swirled, but they didn’t bring clarity.

It’s just the way things are. Maybe I’m just too sensitive, but I feel like everyone else has moved on. They don’t care about me anymore. I’m stuck here, alone, watching my dreams fade away. This isn't going to change. Eventually, everything will go back to normal, but until then, I'll be trapped in this loneliness. There's nothing I can do about it. It's just the way life is.
