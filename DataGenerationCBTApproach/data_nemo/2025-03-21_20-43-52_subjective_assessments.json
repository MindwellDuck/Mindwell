And now this?

She'd find another spectrometer, another lab, another anything if that's what it took. Because she wasn't just doing this for him, she was doing it for herself. And for every other scientist out there who'd laughed at her husband's theories.\n\nShe grabbed her coat, storming towards the door. \"Fuck you too,\" she said to the lifeless spectrometer as she passed. \"I'll be back.\"",

Forty years he'd clocked at Thompson's Department Store, starting as a teenager and rising through the ranks until retirement was forced upon him by a new management that valued youth over experience.\n\nHis wife, Martha, had been his rock, her warm smile a beacon in the sterile fluorescent lighting of the store. But she was gone now, swallowed by cancer three years past, leaving Harold with an emptiness he couldn't fill with knick-knacks from Thompson's clearance aisle.\n\nThe bus ride was a silent torment. Each stop echoed with memories of Martha, her laughter ringing out as they'd wait together under the harsh glow of the streetlights. Now, only silence greeted him, save for the occasional cough or rustle of a newspaper from his fellow passengers.\n\nAs he stepped into Thompson's that morning, the familiar scent of new clothing and polished wood should have been comforting. Instead, it was a bitter reminder of all he'd lost. He was no longer a respected manager but a temporary holiday help, fetching coffee for the youngsters who'd taken over his old post.\n\nMid-morning, Mr. Thompson himself strode in, his slick smile as artificial as the snow on the store's displays. He clapped Harold on the back, too familiar, too friendly. \"Harold, my man! I've got just the job for you today,\" he said, handing him a list of tasks that were beneath even the most junior employee.\n\nHarold felt a surge of bitterness rise within him like bile. He took the list, his voice steady despite the anger simmering inside. \"Of course, Mr. Thompson. I'm at your service.\"\n\nAs he walked away, Harold could feel the weight of his years, the emptiness of his marriage, the loss of his dignity. Each step echoed with bitterness, each breath was a reminder of all that was gone and all that remained - an endless winter of silent torment.",

If they hadn't pushed him out, maybe she wouldn't have felt so alone in her final days.\n\nHe caught his reflection in a display window and saw the lines etched deep around his mouth, the gray hair, the fucking defeat in his eyes.

He couldn't paint what he didn't feel, and lately, all he felt was this overwhelming sense of hopelessness. It clung to him like a shroud, suffocating his creativity, drowning out the vibrant world that used to inspire him.\n\nHenry dropped his brushes onto the palette with a clatter, their metallic echoes ringing out in the silent studio like funeral bells tolling for his artistic soul.

Still young, still got time to find someone else.\"\n\nMy grip tightens around the clipboard till it's digging into my skin. Lucky? She thinks I'm fucking lucky?\n\nI snap, \"Yeah, cause nothing says 'lucky' like waking up every morning next to an empty goddamn bed!\"\n\nHer eyes widen, mouth opens and closes like a damn fish out of water. Too late, bitch. I'm already storming off, leaving her behind in my wake.\n\nChrist, why can't they just leave it alone? Can't everyone see that this fucking resentment is all I've got left of her? It's eating me alive, but at least it's something. Something to hold onto instead of nothing at all.",

I swear, this place has become a museum dedicated to her memory, and I'm its reluctant curator.\n\nIt's not just tonight or last week; it's every time. Every single shift is a reminder that she's gone, and I'm left here alone. The whole world moves on around me while my life remains frozen in this godforsaken limbo.\n\nI can't even find comfort in the familiar routine anymore because there's nothing familiar about it anymore. It's all changed, all tainted by her absence. Every shift feels like a never-ending torture, a relentless parade of memories and what-ifs marching through my mind.\n\nAnd now, some nurse has the audacity to suggest I'm lucky? Lucky?
