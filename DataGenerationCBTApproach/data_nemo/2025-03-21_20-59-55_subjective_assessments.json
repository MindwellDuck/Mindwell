You were supposed to be at her place hours ago, but these damn samples... They're not cooperating, and neither is your goddamn life.\n\nYou grab your phone, scrolling through the missed calls, voicemails, texts. The last one reads, \"I can't do this anymore, Sam. I need some space.\" You feel a pang of something - guilt? Annoyance? You're not sure, and you don't care right now. You toss the phone back onto the counter with a curse.\n\nYou lean back in your chair, staring at the ceiling tiles, trying to ignore the lab equipment humming around you like some goddamn white noise machine. This is what you wanted, isn't it? To be a big shot scientist, making groundbreaking discoveries? Fuck relationships, fuck sleep, fuck everything that's not this goddamn research.\n\nBut as you sit there, alone in the sterile glow of the lab lights, you can't shake the feeling that something just slipped through your fingers.

Interference.\n\n\"I've barely slept this week,\" I grumble, rubbing at the grit in my eyes. \"And she wants me to drop everything for some 'quality time'? Preposterous.\"\n\nMy gaze falls on the samples arranged neatly before me - each one a testament to my dedication, my intellect. They're not perfect, no, but they're mine. My work.\n\n\"And what about these?\" I gesture at them, as if Sarah can see through the phone screen. \"Do these not count? Because I've been here for days, making progress, pushing boundaries. That's worth something.\"\n\nI pick up my phone, scroll past Sarah's messages to the emails from colleagues congratulating me on my preliminary findings.

Ask where he was. No, scratch that. She didn't want to sound like one of those nagging wives. But seriously, what was taking so long?\n\nShe tried to focus back on her work, but the specimen seemed to blur before her eyes. Great, now her contacts were bothering her too.

The silence was oppressive, each tick of the clock resonating like a hammer against my heart. I slumped onto my desk, the cold wood providing little comfort against the chill that seemed to have seeped into my very bones.\n\nI picked up the photograph that lay there, its edges worn from being handled so often. It was taken at last year's school picnic; me, beaming at the camera, sandwiched between two rows of smiling faces - my students.

Another school was cutting their teaching positions due to budget cuts. The competition for jobs was fierce, and with my age against me, I felt like a drowning woman grasping at straws.\n\nMy thoughts drifted to her - Emily, my best friend since college. She'd found love, got married, had two beautiful children. Her life was a tapestry of warmth and joy, each thread woven with carefree laughter. And here I was, alone in my classroom, the only sound the relentless ticking of the clock.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked at the empty desks before me. Another year without a permanent position loomed ahead, another year of uncertainty, another year of watching my friends advance while I seemed to be stuck in place. The sadness was overwhelming, a crushing weight that made it difficult to breathe.\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself for what lay ahead.

        "Generated Assessment": "\"Christ almighty, it's like I'm the only one busting my ass around here! Three hours on my feet, saving some guy who was more worried about his damn phone than his own life, and what do I get? A half-assed 'thank you'! And now, they're cutting my hours too? Overstaffed, my ass! It's not like we're running a goddamn McDonald's here. They must've hired some new admin guy who doesn't know his head from his ass. And don't even get me started on that empty house. She left because I'm never home, right? If they'd just give me the hours I deserve, maybe she'd still be here. Fuck this shit! It's like everyone else is to blame for my life falling apart.\""
