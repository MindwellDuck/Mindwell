Didn't you see my note?\" Her heart flutters, not with excitement, but with that familiar resentment that's been simmering of late. She clenches her jaw, her mind racing like a faulty experiment. She hadn't seen any note, or perhaps she had glanced over it in her preoccupation. Either way, it feels like another unspoken reproach, another invisible task slipped into her already overflowing schedule. She's not just a scientist, she's a partner, a friend, a daughter, and the lines blur until she feels stretched thin, each role vying for her attention. Her resentment bubbles up, a silent scream trapped beneath her calm exterior. Why is it always her who has to accommodate? Why can't they understand that her work isn't just a job, but a passion that demands her time and focus? She takes a deep breath, her fingers hovering over the keyboard as she contemplates her response. But for now, the data waits, and so does dinner with the Johnsons.",

Yet tonight, it felt alien, the usual hum of late-night traffic replaced by an unnerving silence. She radioed in, \"All quiet here, over.\" The crackle of static was her only reply.\n\nShe leaned against her cruiser, arms folded tight against the creeping cold. Her partner, Mike, had called in sick; another night solo for Harriet. She shouldn't have minded - she'd faced worse than silence alone. But tonight, it felt different. Lonelier.\n\nHer eyes flickered to her personal radio, tucked safely away in her glove compartment. She could turn it on, let the soft hum of a classical station fill the car. But that would be against regulations. Besides, who was she kidding? Even Mozart couldn't drown out the emptiness gnawing at her.\n\nShe sighed, checking her watch. Only two hours left till dawn. Two more hours until she could go home to... what? A quiet apartment and a partner who'd barely look up from his laptop? She bit back a sharp remark, directing it instead at the empty street.\n\n\"Where is everyone?\" she muttered, scanning the deserted roads. Not even a prowler or two to keep her on her toes. She pushed off from her car, pacing the line, eyes peeled for any sign of life. Anything to break this solitude.\n\nSuddenly, her radio squawked, making her jump. \"Harriet, it's dispatch.\" The familiar voice was a lifeline in the night. \"We've got a 10-76 at your location. Suspicious person reported.\"\n\nHarriet's heart pounded as she replied, \"Copy that, dispatch. I'm on it.\" Finally, something to do. Yet even as she moved towards the shadowy figure down the street, she couldn't shake off the loneliness. It clung to her like a second skin, annoying and inescapable. But Harriet Thompson was no stranger to duty. She'd face this demon too, one footstep at a time.",
