She'd snapped at little Timmy earlier for forgetting to restock the candy aisle, and now all she could think about were his wide, teary eyes.\n\n\"Shit, shit, shit,\" she cursed under her breath, sweeping the broken pieces into a pile. \"I'm sorry, kiddo,\" she whispered to the empty store, feeling like the world's worst manager.

The food grew cold, untouched. Her misery was tangible, a dark cloud that threatened to consume her. She had cooked out of love, hope, desperation - but all she tasted now was bitter failure.",

No text from Lisa, no voicemail blinking on her ancient answering machine. She checked her phone anyway, scrolling through the same group chat they'd been using since college: nothing new from Lisa since their plans were made three days ago.\n\nSarah's stomach rumbled, but she didn't feel hungry anymore.

Everything seemed dull now, lifeless without Lisa's laughter echoing through it.\n\nSarah pulled out her phone again, typing out a message before pausing. \"Hey... everything okay?\" She deleted it, then typed another: \"Where are you?

His gaze fell on their wedding photo, yellowed with age, and a familiar melancholy welled up.\n\nHe padded to the kitchen, where echoes of last night's dinner party still lingered.

It was not the first time he felt like this, but today, it felt heavier, more insistent, demanding his attention.\n\nHenry took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and pushed the melancholy down, burying it beneath the familiar rhythm of breakfast preparations.

Today, however, that patience was tested in a manner most unbecoming of our esteemed institution.\n\nAs I approached Room 105, the sound of laughter echoed through the corridor. A young nurse, barely out of training, was leaning against the doorframe, giggling with an intern who should have been attending to his rounds, not engaging in idle chatter. The scene was a stark contrast to the somber atmosphere we strive to maintain for our elderly patients.\n\nI cleared my throat loudly, causing them both to start and fall silent. \"Good morning,\" I offered, expecting at least some semblance of professionalism in response. Instead, the intern merely nodded, muttered an apology, and scurried away, while the young nurse, Emily, actually had the audacity to smile at me.\n\n\"Everything alright, Harold?\" she asked, her tone far too familiar for my liking.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, my voice sharp as a surgical blade. \"It is not alright when you're more concerned with socializing than attending to your patients.\"\n\nHer smile faded, replaced by a look of surprise, then indignation. \"I was just taking a break\u2014\"\n\n\"A break?\" I interrupted, my resentment boiling over. \"We don't have time for breaks here. Not when we have lives depending on our care, our expertise, and most importantly, our professionalism.\"\n\nShe opened her mouth to respond but seemed to think better of it, closing it again with a snap. Good, I thought, let that sink in.\n\n\"I expect better from you, Emily,\" I said, my voice like ice. \"I've seen your file. You're not some new graduate. You should know better.\"\n\nWith that, I walked away, leaving her standing there, no doubt seething at my rebuke. But so be it.

Here we are, dealing with the frail and the aged, trying to maintain a semblance of peace and dignity, and there she is, cackling away like a teenage girl at a slumber party! It's a bloody geriatric ward, not a comedy club!\n\nAnd when I confronted her about it - yes, I did confront her, Martha. Someone had to - she had the audacity to ask me if everything was alright. As if I was the one acting out of line! I swear, sometimes these youngsters make me feel like I'm back in the Stone Age.\n\nYou know what really gets me? She's not even a rookie anymore.
