It was a soft, gentle snow, each flake a tiny crystal catching the light before disappearing into the night. I felt one land on my cheek, cold and brief, like a whisper of winter's breath. I noticed how it clung to my stubble, melting slowly, as if trying to find warmth in the prickly hairs. It was such a small thing, this snowflake on my face, but it held my attention, keeping me focused on that one detail, that one cold touch amidst the vast, silent fall around me.\n\nAs I walked, the snow began to fill her favorite spot on the sidewalk. She used to wait for me there after her shifts, her smile bright and warm against the chill of the evening. But tonight, it's just an empty space, a void where she once stood. The snow doesn't care about our past; it falls without memory or regret, filling every inch of that spot until it's smooth and untouched, as if she was never there at all.\n\nI leaned against the cold brick wall of our old apartment building, watching the snow fall. I didn't notice the Christmas lights we'd hung together still blinking yellow and green, untouched since last year. They were always her favorite, a bright splash of color against the winter's gray. But tonight, they were just another detail lost in my focus on that one cold flake, melting slowly on my cheek.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a reminder: it was her birthday today. I felt the familiar ache in my chest, a tightness that seemed to grow with each passing snowflake. But even as I stood there, feeling this profound sense of loss, I couldn't shake off that one detail, that one cold touch. It held me captive, keeping me from seeing the whole picture, from truly appreciating the beauty and sorrow of this snowy night."

Then, amidst the mundane papers, there it was - his smile, radiant and carefree, frozen in time. My heart pounded like a drum in my chest as waves of anger crashed against me.\n\nHow dare they? I thought, my grip tightening around the photograph. His family had promised to return all his belongings, but this... this was the last straw. They knew how much he loved photography; it was his passion, his legacy. And they'd callously tossed it aside, left it to gather dust in some forgotten box.\n\nI felt a surge of heat behind my eyes, tears threatening to spill over. I couldn't believe their selfishness, their insensitivity. It was as if they were doing this deliberately, rubbing salt into my wounds. The anger was overwhelming, consuming, and I found myself wishing, not for the first time, that I could just confront them, make them understand the pain they were causing.\n\nMy hands trembled as I placed the photograph gently on my desk, away from the hungry maw of the shredder. I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself, but it was no use. The anger was there, raw and potent, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that this was all their fault."
