His partner of twenty years, Paul, entered the studio, carrying a stack of unopened mail. He placed it on the nearby table with a sigh. \"More bills,\" he muttered.\n\nThe artist's stomach churned as Paul started flipping through them. A letter from the bank caught his eye; its official-looking font made the artist's heart race. Paul opened it, scanned it briefly, then looked up at him, worry etched on his face. \"They're threatening to seize our house if we can't pay what we owe by the end of the month,\" he said.\n\nThe artist felt a wave of panic rise within him. He hadn't sold enough paintings lately; their savings were dwindling. He put down his brush and rubbed his temples, trying to ward off the growing anxiety. His mind raced with thoughts of losing not just his home but also Paul's support, his stability in life.",
