He knew he should've cleared them out days ago, but every time he opened his inbox, it was like staring into a bottomless pit of guilt and dread. So, he'd been avoiding it, burying himself in meaningless tasks instead.\n\nToday, though, something compelled him to click on that 'See all unread messages' link. Big mistake. Buried under a mountain of newsletters and spam was an email from Maria, the desperate mother of little Emily, who'd vanished without a trace months ago. The subject line seemed to stare at him accusingly: \"I need help.\"\n\nHis heart sank as he read it again, remembering her pleading voice on the phone that day. He'd promised her he'd investigate, had even started looking into it, but then... life happened. Work piled up, deadlines loomed, and Emily's case got pushed to the back burner.\n\nJohn felt a surge of anger, but it wasn't directed at himself. No, it was Maria's fault for not following up, for not pushing harder when he'd gone quiet. If she hadn't been so passive, maybe Emily would've been found by now. And that cop, Thompson, he should've done more too. He'd dismissed the case as a runaway, but John knew better. He could feel it in his gut.\n\nHe closed the email, his resolve hardening. He'd get back on this case tomorrow, show them all he meant business. But for now, he needed a drink. A stiff one. To drown out the guilt that threatened to bubble up whenever he thought about those empty, pleading eyes staring at him from Maria's Facebook profile picture."
