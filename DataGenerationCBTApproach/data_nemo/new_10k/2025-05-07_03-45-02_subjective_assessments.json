The dim hallway light flickers as she reaches her door, where a neatly folded note peeks out from under it. She recognizes the handwriting - her neighbor's daughter again, asking if she could watch their cat while they're away this weekend. A familiar pang of loneliness stirs within her. She crumples the note, letting it drop to the floor as she enters her quiet, empty apartment.",

She flicks on the harsh overhead light, squinting at the sudden brightness.\n\nIn the kitchen, she pulls out a frozen dinner, the same one she has every Friday since... well, since forever. She pops it into the microwave, watching the timer tick down like an hourglass draining her life away. \"At least Lisa's got someone to watch her cat,\" she grumbles, stabbing at the keypad to set the time.\n\nWhile waiting, she wanders over to the window, looking out at the young couple next door, laughing together as they finish cooking dinner side by side. Their lights are on, their home is warm with chatter and clanking pots. Her stomach churns with a familiar mix of hunger and envy.\n\nBack at her lonely dinner table, she stabs at her mac 'n' cheese, each bite tasting like failure. \"It's not fair,\" she thinks, \"They've got each other. I've got... this.\" She glares at the crumpled note on the floor, wishing it was a invitation to something more than cat-sitting."

He knew he should wake her, tell her about the figure that seemed to appear only when she was asleep, but something held him back. Instead, he slipped out of bed silently, retrieving his phone from the nightstand. As he opened the gallery app, the shadow flickered once more, this time lingering longer than usual.

It's not your fault.\" I nod absently, but her words feel hollow. Best isn't good enough when it means someone else's worst.\n\nI think about the times we've pulled off miracles here - the kid with asthma who took his first breath after ours, the elderly woman who opened her eyes and smiled at her family after a cardiac arrest. But those don't count, not really. Not compared to this. Every success is just a temporary reprieve, every life saved on borrowed time.\n\nI grab my coat and head out, leaving the chaos behind me. The night air is crisp, but it does nothing to cool the heat of failure burning inside me. I look up at the stars, visible despite the city lights. They're beautiful tonight, scattered across the sky like Mr. Thompson's family will be soon, shattered into pieces they'll never fit back together.\n\nBut even that thought, that attempt at finding beauty in tragedy, feels cheap. It doesn't change what happened, what I couldn't do. It doesn't bring Mr. Thompson back or ease his family's pain. So what good is it? What good am I?\n\nI walk home alone, the city silent around me except for the distant wail of an ambulance heading our way. Another code blue waiting to happen. Another chance for us to pull a miracle out of thin air. But miracles aren't real, not really. Not like this. Not for me."
