It felt like a punch to the gut, the air rushing out of my lungs. How could she? How could he? This wasn't just about me anymore; it was personal. The lines blurred between our pasts and presents, their history and mine. Every word they'd ever shared now seemed tainted, poisoned by this betrayal. I had to confront her. No, not just confront - demand answers. This wasn't some random stranger trying to sabotage my work; it was someone she knew intimately. Someone who had been a part of her life before me. And now, they were threatening everything we'd built together. It couldn't be mere coincidence. No, this was deliberate. They did this to get back at her through me. I could feel it. I just knew it. This wasn't about him anymore; it was about us. Our relationship. Our future. All jeopardized by his jealousy, his desire for revenge. How dare they?"
