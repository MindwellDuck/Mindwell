It was always such an obstinate creature, but today it seemed particularly intent on refusing cooperation. The wind nipped at her heels, a relentless foe that she couldn't quite outrun.\n\nAcross the street stood the newspaper stand, its usual occupant nowhere to be found. Mr. Thompson had retired, or so the rumors went, leaving behind an empty kiosk and a void in her morning routine. Every day, for years, she'd bought two newspapers - one for herself, and one for him. Now, there was only silence where once there was lively chatter.\n\nShe couldn't help but feel a pang of resentment towards the world that kept spinning so carelessly after his passing. It seemed as if everyone else had moved on, while she remained stuck in this endless loop of grief and longing. The car backfiring nearby served as an unwelcome reminder of life's indifference to her pain.\n\nHer heart felt heavy, like a stone sinking into the depths of an unyielding sea. She was alone now, truly alone. No one understood what it was like to navigate this world without him by her side. Each step she took seemed like a betrayal of his memory, each breath she drew a theft from their shared past.\n\nYet, amidst this maelstrom of emotion, she couldn't help but notice the way the sunlight glinted off the puddles on the pavement, transforming them into tiny mirrors reflecting the world above. It was almost beautiful, in its own melancholic way. But she pushed that thought aside, unable to reconcile such fleeting beauty with her profound sense of loss.\n\nAs she walked away from the empty newspaper stand, she felt a renewed determination to hold onto her pain, to keep it close like an old friend. After all, if she let go even for a moment, what would be left? Just an empty kiosk and a world that didn't care."
