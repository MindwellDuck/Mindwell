It was clear as day: something was amiss, something dangerous. His emotions were screaming at him, and he knew better than to ignore them. They were his compass, his reality. He steeled himself, ready to confront whatever lurked in the shadows."

The kitchen was a symphony of clattering pans and shouting orders, but all I could hear was the echo of that damn \"Wow\" from the head chef. It wasn't fair. I've been here for years, put in the hours, earned these wrinkles around my eyes, and what does he get? A fucking 'Wow' on his first try.\n\nI sneaked a glance at his dish, perfectly plated with a delicate swirl of coulis and a sprig of fresh thyme. It looked good, I'd give him that. But it wasn't like mine was sloppy or anything. I mean, sure, it didn't have the same... finesse, but it tasted great. That's what mattered, right?\n\nBut then again, who was I kidding?
