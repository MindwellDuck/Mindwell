The canvas before her remained untouched, its blankness a stark reminder of the years that had passed since they'd last painted together.

I swear, the silence has a weight to it, pressing down on me like some invisible force. And look at that canvas! It's just staring back at me, all smug and pristine. It's like it knows I can't fill it with anything worthwhile. Just one big empty joke, waiting for me to make an idiot of myself again.\n\nI mean, what if I can't do it? What if tonight is just another night of watching the clock hands crawl while I hold this stupid brush in my hand, paralyzed by... by nothing! It's not like there's anything stopping me, right? No one's here to judge. So why does it feel like the whole room is laughing at me?\n\nIt's ridiculous. I know that. But God, it's hard to shake off this feeling that everything I touch turns to emptiness these days. Like my paintings are some sort of curse, draining any life or color from them before they even see light. Maybe I should just pack up and leave. Let the studio win for once.\""
