John Doe, she thought, her heart pounding softly against her ribs. The alias felt like an affront, a mockery of their shared history. She could see him now, lying in that sterile room, his face contorted not just by pain, but by something else. Regret, perhaps? Or was it guilt?\n\nHer mind began to race, weaving intricate webs of future scenarios, each one darker than the last. She envisioned him back on her doorstep, a shadow of their past self, burdened with some unseen illness or addiction. Or worse, she imagined herself receiving a call from an unfamiliar voice, bearing news she knew she wouldn't be able to bear.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steadying herself against the edge of the desk. This was why she'd left him behind, wasn't it? To avoid precisely these kinds of scenarios. She couldn't let herself be dragged back into that whirlpool of fear and uncertainty. Not again."

She made her way to the kitchen, pausing at the photo of them on their wedding day - 50 years ago. Her reflection in the glass showed a woman with lines etched deeper than she remembered. She poured herself a cup of tea, now cold, and sat down at the table. The unopened letters from the hospital's legal team stared back at her, the words \"Wrongful Death\" visible through the envelope.

Jesus Christ, it's like a fucking museum. Too quiet, too empty. Every creak and groan sounds like it's crying out for him.\" She shoved the envelopes towards her, glaring at them. \"And these damn letters! 'Wrongful Death', my ass. It's already dead here, hasn't anyone noticed?\" Her voice hitched on a sob she tried to swallow back. \"This fucking hopelessness... it's like I'm drowning in it every goddamn day.\" She slumped back in her chair, defeated. \"Fuck Christmas.
