It was like... well, it was like death, I guess. Not that it wasn't always there, but today, it was different. Stronger.\n\nI stepped into his room - dim light, quiet as a mouse - and boom! There it was, hitting me right in the face. Nausea just washed over me, man. I could feel my breakfast churning, threatening to make an appearance. I swear, if Mrs. Henderson hadn't been there, I might've lost it.\n\nAnyway, I got to work, you know? Checked his vitals, did all that jazz. But I couldn't shake this feeling, this... smell. It was like it was clinging to me, following me around the room. I could barely focus on anything else.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, I did what needed to be done. Filled out the forms, called it in. But all I could think about was that damn smell. I didn't even notice his kid sitting there until he started crying. Talk about a wake-up call, huh?\n\nGuess I'll just go home now, try to wash this day off me. Shower, maybe some TV. Might even have a drink or two. God knows I need it after today."
