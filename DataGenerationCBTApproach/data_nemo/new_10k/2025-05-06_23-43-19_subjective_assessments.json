Frankly, I must confess that this has caused me a great deal of unease.\n\nUpon reviewing the email chain, it appears as though my contributions were inadvertently overlooked. This is most unusual, given the considerable time and effort we both invested in this project. I am quite certain that our initial agreement was for joint authorship, with each of us playing an integral role in the final publication.\n\nI must admit, I had expected a different outcome. The process seemed so clear-cut in my mind's eye - our names side by side, reflecting the collaborative nature of our work. Yet here we are, faced with a reality that seems so... askew from what should have been.\n\nI do understand that these things can happen, but I must express my disappointment nonetheless. It feels as though the very fabric of our professional relationship has been stretched taut, threatening to snap at any moment. I had envisioned this publication as a testament to our partnership, not a solitary achievement.\n\nPlease, let us rectify this situation posthaste.
