Sarah, after all these years. I hadn't heard from her since... well, since whatever it was we'd fought about. Felt like ancient history now.\n\nI leaned back in my chair, the old wooden legs creaking softly. A loan, huh? She must be desperate if she's coming to me. Guess that's what happens when you burn bridges, ain't it?\n\nI could almost hear her voice echoing through the empty rooms, \"Help me out here, would ya?\" I sighed, rubbing my temples. Always the center of attention, even now.\n\nMaybe I should just ignore it. But then again, maybe she really needs this. It's not like she'd ask if she had other options. No, it must be serious. And here I am, sitting pretty with my savings, while Sarah's out there, drowning.\n\nI drummed my fingers on the desk, staring at the notification. Guilt gnawed at me like a hungry dog. It was always about me, wasn't it? Always had been. Even now, even when she needed help, it was still all about me.\n\nI sighed again, resignation heavy in my bones. Fine, I thought. Fine. Let's see how much damage we can do this time around.\""
