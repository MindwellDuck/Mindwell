The sunlight filtering through the grimy windows seems faded, like an old photograph. I look at the canvas, pristine and mocking in its whiteness. It's not that I haven't wanted to paint; it's just... complicated.\n\nI remember when she was here, the studio buzzed with life. Her laughter echoed off the walls as we painted side by side. But now, her absence is a physical force, pushing me away from my art. Every blank canvas is a stark reminder of what I've lost. It's not like I can just pick up where we left off, not after so long.\n\nToday was meant to be different. I had planned this out, down to the last detail. A masterpiece to mark three years without her. But now, looking at that untouched canvas, it seems ridiculous. Either you're a genius and create something extraordinary, or you're a failure for not even trying. There's no in-between.\n\nI can't help but think, what's the point? It'll never be like it was before. She made this place alive; now it's just another empty room. I can't bear to sully her memory with half-hearted attempts at art. So, I leave the studio as I found it - silent and still, save for the ticking clock that seems to echo my thoughts: either you're painting masterpieces or you're not worth anything at all."

As he left for work, he noticed the neighbor's curtains twitching, as if they were watching him leave. The city seemed quieter today, conspiratorial in its silence.

Every glance felt loaded with meaning, every pause in conversation heavy with unsaid words. He could feel it, a weight pressing down on him, the silent accusations piling up like an invisible mountain. They all knew, didn't they? Even the new nurse who'd smiled at him earlier, her eyes holding a warmth that now seemed mocking rather than comforting. He took a deep breath, the air in his lungs feeling thin and suffocating. The city lights twinkled back at him from the rearview mirror, like a thousand accusing eyes. He turned off the engine, stepping out into the night with a heavy heart. The world was quiet, too quiet, as if holding its breath in anticipation of his arrival. Or perhaps it was just waiting to pounce. Either way, he knew he wasn't ready for what awaited him inside."
