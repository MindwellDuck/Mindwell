His eyes drifted to the photo still on the wall, a remnant from happier times. They looked so content, so in love. He couldn't bring himself to take it down, but every time he saw it, it felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nHe poured himself a drink, the amber liquid sloshing into his glass with more force than intended. As he took his first sip, he noticed something new, something added since this morning: a note from his ex-wife. It was just a few lines, informing him of her plans to move out of state for a job opportunity.\n\nAs he read those words, the misery that had been simmering within him all day finally boiled over. He felt it like a physical pain, starting in his chest and radiating outwards, leaving him gasping for breath. The divorce was one thing, but this... this felt like losing her all over again.",
