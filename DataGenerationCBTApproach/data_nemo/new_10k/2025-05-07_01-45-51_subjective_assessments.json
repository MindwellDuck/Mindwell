Either you're a good teacher who always gives perfect grades, or you're some kind of grading monster out to get kids. There's no in-between here.\n\nI mean, did he even bother to look at Timmy's work? Did he see the careless mistakes, the lack of effort on half his assignments? It's not like I enjoy giving out lower grades. But if that's what Timmy's performance warrants, then that's what he gets. It's not personal. It's just... it's just either you meet the standard or you don't.\n\nAnd now here we are, in my classroom, during lunch, with all eyes on us. Great. Just great.

Yet, as I studied her profile, the lines of her face so familiar yet somehow distant now, I felt a subtle shift, a quiet unease creeping into my consciousness like a shadow at dusk.\n\nI found myself comparing the richness of her laughter with the silence that often hung between us now. Her eyes sparkled with memories we once shared, while mine seemed to echo with unspoken words, unshed tears. The imbalance was palpable, a weight settling in the pit of my stomach.\n\nBut I dismissed this feeling, attributing it to mere nostalgia, a longing for simpler times. After all, who was I to compare? Each of us had our own journeys, our own paths to tread. Yet, as I continued to watch her, a sense of disadvantage lingered, unacknowledged but no less real, coloring my perception of our shared past and uncertain future.\n\n---"
