I watched them saunter away, leaving me alone with the mocking canvas and an overwhelming sense of humiliation.*\n\n*The words 'My kid could paint that' replayed in my mind like a broken record, each repetition chipping away at my self-worth. I felt heat rise in my face, a flush of embarrassment that seemed to spread like wildfire across every inch of my skin.*\n\n*I couldn't help but think, \"This is it. This is what they all must be thinking. My work is laughable, childish.\" The room felt suddenly too small, the air too thick. I wanted nothing more than to tear down my paintings, retreat into some hole where no one could see them, or me.*\n\n*I had spent months pouring over every brushstroke, every splash of color. But now, standing here amidst the hushed murmurs and stolen glances, it all seemed like a waste. I was a joke, a fraud. How had I ever thought I could call myself an artist?*\n\n*The night stretched out before me, endless and miserable. The once vibrant gallery now seemed cold and inhospitable. I knew I should stay, schmooze with the patrons, maybe even sell a painting or two. But all I wanted was to leave, to retreat into my studio where at least I could pretend my work had some worth.*\n\n*I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what felt like an eternity of torment. \"This is it,\" I thought. \"This is who I am now - a laughing stock.\" And with that thought echoing in my mind, I turned to face the crowd, a forced smile already tugging at my lips.*"
