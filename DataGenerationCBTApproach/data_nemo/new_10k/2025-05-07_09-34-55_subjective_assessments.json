He was charming, successful, and seemingly effortless in his endeavors. And now, even his bloody gift was better than anything I could offer.\n\nI sighed heavily, dropping the rose onto the counter. *It's not like it was my fault,* I rationalized, but the familiar self-reproach lingered nonetheless. *Maybe if I worked less... Maybe if I tried harder...* But those were just more excuses for why I couldn't measure up to the expectations set by others. Or so it seemed in that moment of bitter introspection."
