'Just catching up,' she said, but her smile was too wide, too bright, too... artificial. Like she was trying to cover something up. Her friend's voice had been warm, familiar. Too familiar. I could almost hear the echoes of old conversations, old feelings. She wouldn't look at me, her eyes darting away like she was guilty of something. The room felt stuffy, the air thick with unspoken words. I couldn't shake off this feeling of dread, this knot in my stomach. It was all too much, too overwhelming. Her happiness seemed amplified, mocking me, while mine seemed to dwindle into nothingness.\""
