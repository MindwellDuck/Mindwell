He reached for the handle, already feeling a pang of disappointment. As the door swung open, revealing the once vibrant, now lifeless cheese, his heart sank. His partner's favorite, untouched since they'd last been together. Weeks had passed like grains of sand through an hourglass, each one marking another moment they'd missed sharing.\n\nHe stood there, staring at the moldy cheese, feeling a surge of anger bubbling up inside him. It wasn't fair, he thought, his grip tightening on the door handle. She knew how much I loved that cheese. How could she have let it go bad? He felt a bitter taste in his mouth, the familiar sting of resentment welling up. It was always like this, he thought. Always something to upset him, to disappoint him.\n\nHe reached for the cheese, but his hand hesitated, hovering over the green spots that now marred its surface. It was ruined, just like their last trip together had been. He felt a tear pricking at the corner of his eye, but he blinked it away angrily. This wasn't his fault. It was hers. She should have taken better care of it. He slammed the fridge door shut, leaving the cheese to its fate, his mind already moving on to the next thing she'd ruined without even realizing it."

Yeah, that's gotta be it.\n\nI'm done trying to please these stuck-up literary snobs. From now on, I'll just focus on writing for myself. Maybe I'll start a blog or something, where real people can appreciate my genius without all the pretension.\n\nOh, and don't bother telling me to 'keep trying' or some other clich\u00e9 bullshit.
