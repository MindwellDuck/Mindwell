She clutched his old scarf, now hers, against her cheek. It still held his scent, but it was fading, like him. The park was quieter than usual, children's laughter replaced by the soft rustling of autumn leaves. She missed their chatter, his stories about them growing up. Her eyes welled up as she realized this would be her first holiday season without him.",
