Her partner of thirty years was engrossed in his book, not looking up as she entered. She dropped her heavy bag by the door, letting it thud intentionally. He turned a page, unimpressed. \"Still at it with those rodents?\" he muttered, more to himself than to her. A smirk played on her lips, but it was not warm. \"Oh, you noticed,\" she retorted, her voice laced with contempt. She stormed off to their bedroom, leaving him alone with his book and the quiet disdain that had become all too familiar.",
