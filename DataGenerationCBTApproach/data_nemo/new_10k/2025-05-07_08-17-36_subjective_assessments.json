My jaw tightened as I watched his hand linger on hers, a casual intimacy that made my stomach churn.\n\n\"Bah,\" I scoffed under my breath, turning away from the sight. \"It's just her polite laugh, nothing more.\" I refused to acknowledge the genuine warmth in her eyes as she looked at him, or the way her body language mirrored his. No, no, it didn't count. It couldn't.\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself for another round of small talk with the principal, my mind a whirlwind of dismissive thoughts. \"She laughs like that with everyone,\" I insisted silently, as if saying it aloud would make it true. But even as I spoke those words, I knew they rang hollow. They were just echoes in the empty chamber of my heart, trying desperately to drown out the truth: she was happy, and it wasn't because of me.\n\nYet, I clung to my distorted perception like a lifeline, unwilling to let go, unable to see the beauty in her joy when it wasn't mine to claim. After all, if I couldn't have her happiness, then perhaps it didn't exist at all."
