But today, it felt like a slap in the face.\n\nAs I clocked out, there was this grand bouquet of roses on my locker, with a thank-you note attached. My heart fluttered for a moment, foolishly hoping they were from him. But no, it couldn't be him. Not after all these years.\n\nI tossed them into the trash, Sarah. Every last rose. It felt symbolic, you know? Like throwing away ten years of service, every holiday I've worked, every life I've saved. Always taken for granted, never appreciated. That's what my life has amounted to here.\n\nI left the hospital without a backward glance. Not even at the card tucked inside the bouquet. Why bother? It was probably from some other nurse they actually cared about. Never me. Never the whole team, just the parts that are convenient or visible.\n\nIt's always been this way, Sarah. Always. I'm tired of it. Tired of being invisible, except when they need someone to pick up their slack or cover their shifts. Whole departments can celebrate without so much as a mention of me, but let one patient slip through the cracks, and suddenly it's all my fault.\n\nI'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing this, Sarah. It's like banging my head against a wall, expecting a different result every time. But that's just life at St. Mary's, isn't it? Never change, always the same old grind.\n\nWrite soon,\n\nAlexandra"
