Would we still be creating together, laughing at our ridiculous color choices? Or would things have changed anyway?\n\nWhat if I'd insisted on taking that safer job abroad when she suggested it? Maybe we'd both still be alive, breathing in the unfamiliar air of some exotic city. Instead, here I am, alone in this echoing hallway, my heart pounding with 'what ifs'.\n\nAnd now, what if that paint smudge fades away completely? What if one day soon, there's no trace left of her?
