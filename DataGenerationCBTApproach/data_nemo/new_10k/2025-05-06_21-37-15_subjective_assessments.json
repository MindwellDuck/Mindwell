Like a criminal's eyes, I think. Or maybe he's just nervous? No, can't be. He's got something in his pocket. Gun? Knife? My breath catches in my throat.*\n\n*The clock on the wall ticks loudly. Each second feels like an hour. Should I call for help? Confront him myself? What if... what if he pulls out that gun or knife?*\n\n*His hands twitch. I freeze. This is it. My stomach churns as I prepare to dive for cover. But then, his hand emerges from his pocket, empty. Just his wallet.*\n\n*He steps up to the counter, a young kid looking embarrassed. \"I forgot my ID,\" he mumbles. My cashier smiles, no big deal. I watch, stunned, as they complete the transaction.

The goddamn cake looked homemade, like one of those Pinterest bullshit creations that always made him feel inadequate. He could almost taste the love in every crumb.\n\nHis eyes welled up, but he blinked it away. She'd sent this to rub it in, didn't she? \"Urgent,\" his ass. It was just another reminder of what a shitty father he was. He hadn't bought a gift yet, hadn't even found the time to make a fucking card.
