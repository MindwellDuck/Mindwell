So, I was down at the library today, trying to offload some books I haven't touched since college. You know me, always needing a clean slate, right? Fucking hell, who am I kidding? I never learn from my mistakes.\n\nAnyway, I'm unpacking these damn books, and what do you think falls out of one of them but an old letter from Mom. Two years before she passed, it was. I stood there like an idiot, staring at her fucking handwriting like it was a ghost or some shit.\n\nI should've thrown that goddamn letter away without opening it. But noooo, I had to be a masochist and read the fucking thing. It's about her favorite charity she wanted us to support, remember? The one we both swore blind we'd donate to every month after she was gone. And now look at me, standing there like a prick realizing I haven't made a single payment since... well, shit.\n\nI knew this would happen. I just fucking knew it. Every time something good comes my way, it's like the universe goes \"Nah, fuck you, here's some bullshit to chew on instead.\" Why did she even write that letter if she knew it was gonna sit there and make me feel like a piece of shit? I can't fucking do this. I can't live up to her expectations.\n\nFuck me, right? Fuck everything."
