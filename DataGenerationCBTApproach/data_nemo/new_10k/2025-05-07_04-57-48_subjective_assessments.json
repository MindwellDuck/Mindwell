I've been struggling with what happened at the gallery last week, and I find myself needing your perspective more than ever.\n\nYou remember how excited I was about my exhibition? The critics were invited, the guests arrived, and for a moment, it seemed like everything was falling into place. But then, Mr. Thompson walked in. His words echoed through the room like a thunderclap, \"a child's finger painting.\" I felt the color drain from my face, Emma. I heard someone nearby murmur their agreement.\n\nI can't stop wondering... What if he's right? What if all this time, I've been deceiving myself, thinking I had talent? What if everyone sees my art as nothing more than a childish scribble? What if my career amounts to nothing but ridicule?\n\nI'm tormented by these thoughts, Emma. They keep me awake at night, gnawing at my confidence like rats in the walls. I find myself looking at my paintings with new eyes, seeing only flaws where before there were brushstrokes of genius.\n\nI wish I could shake off this feeling of doubt, but it's like quicksand. The more I struggle, the deeper I sink. I miss the days when art was just art, not a battleground for my self-worth.\n\nPlease tell me what to do, Emma. Tell me how to silence these 'what ifs' that plague my mind and let me hear myself think again.\n\nYours,\nAlex"
