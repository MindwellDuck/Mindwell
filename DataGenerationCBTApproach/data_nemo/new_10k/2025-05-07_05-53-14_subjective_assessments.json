The dinner he'd ordered was growing cold on the counter, untouched since the delivery person had left. His reflection in the window caught his eye - the bags under his eyes seemed heavier today, his shoulders more slumped than usual. He sank onto the couch, staring at the blank TV screen, wondering where everyone else was, why they all seemed to have lives except him. A notification flashed on his phone: \"You've been removed from the project team.\" His stomach churned as he read it again, the words echoing the emptiness around him. He felt a familiar pressure building behind his eyes, threatening to spill over. But tonight, even tears refused to come, leaving him alone with his suffocating silence and cold dinner.",

The memories were tainted now, like samples left out too long. He'd convinced himself that *their entire dynamic had changed* after the divorce, that Sarah had moved on without him, leaving him behind like outdated equipment.\n\nHe sighed, rubbing his temples as if to erase these thoughts. But they persisted, stubborn and insistent, like a hypothesis that refused to be disproven.

They don't just fucking float by.\n\nI spent hours with that kid, trying to get him to understand algebra. And now he wants me to believe that was enough? That it made a difference? Fuck that.
