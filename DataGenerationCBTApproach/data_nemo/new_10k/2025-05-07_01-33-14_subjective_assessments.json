The gallery owner's email from this morning echoed in his mind: \"We're not interested in your work right now.\" He tossed the brush aside, splattering paint onto the bare wooden floor. It was another reminder of his divorce, another sign that he was failing at life, just like he had failed as a husband.

I could feel their pity, like a heavy cloak draped over my shoulders, weighing me down, pushing me back into the cold isolation of our now-empty home.\n\nI reached for the coffee pot, but it was empty. Again. How could I have forgotten? This was Emily's domain, her responsibility. She always made sure there was enough for everyone, with just the right amount of cream left over for my morning cup.

It was a stranger's place now, cold and sterile, devoid of Emily's warmth and vibrancy. I should have been able to maintain some semblance of normalcy, shouldn't I? After all, this was my domain too, once upon a time.\n\nBut it seems I've lost my way, adrift in a sea of memories and regrets. The lab, our home, even the coffee pot - none of it feels familiar anymore. Everything should be as it always was, but it isn't. And that, more than anything else, is what hurts the most."
