I gently moved them aside to reach for my lunchbox, but as I did, a single rose petal floated out from the pile, landing softly on top of one card in particular.\n\nI picked it up, turning it over in my hands. It was the one from him, my husband. The ink had faded a bit since last year, but his words were still clear enough to read: \"You're stronger than you think.\" I remember him saying those exact words to me when we were alone, before the service started. He'd taken my hand, squeezed it tightly, and promised that Mom would want us to keep going, no matter what.\n\nBut looking at that card now, all I could focus on was how small his handwriting had gotten since then. It's like he's fading away too, bit by bit. And the petal...it was just one, not even fully intact anymore. Where were the others? Why hadn't he sent more?\n\nI can't help but feel like it's another sign that things aren't getting any better between us. Maybe I'm being silly, but sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try, everything just keeps crumbling around me."
