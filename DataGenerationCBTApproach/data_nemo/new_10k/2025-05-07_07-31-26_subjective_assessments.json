His mind whirred like a faulty engine, each thought a question mark hanging in the dark. \"Where could she be?\" he whispered to himself, his voice barely audible over the ticking clock. He tried to push away the images flooding his mind - her car breaking down on some lonely road, her phone running out of battery, worse scenarios that made his heart pound wildly.\n\nHis eyes flicked to his phone again, as if expecting it to ring with her voice saying she'd just gone for a drive, would be back soon. But there was nothing, only the stark words of her last message glaring at him like an accusation: \"Can't do this anymore.\" He swallowed hard, his throat tight.\n\n\"What if... what if something happened?\" The thought echoed in his head, sending shivers down his spine. He imagined every terrifying possibility - a car accident, a sudden illness, even the absurd idea of her being kidnapped by some unknown assailant. His stomach churned at the thought.\n\nHe knew he should call someone, but who? Her friends? Family? They might know something, might reassure him that she was just... gone. But what if they didn't? What if they had no answers either?\n\nHis fingers hovered over the keypad, hesitating. \"What if I make things worse?\" He could almost hear her voice in his head, tired and distant: \"Not now, not tonight.\" What if calling attention to this made it real? Made it... permanent?\n\nHe sank back onto the bed, his body heavy with dread. The what-ifs kept coming, each one darker than the last, each one chipping away at his hope until there was almost nothing left but fear and uncertainty. He wrapped his arms around himself, trying to ward off the chill that seemed to have seeped into his very bones. And he waited, for some sign, some answer, some reassurance that she would come back. But all he had were questions, endless questions that echoed through the empty house like a haunting refrain."
