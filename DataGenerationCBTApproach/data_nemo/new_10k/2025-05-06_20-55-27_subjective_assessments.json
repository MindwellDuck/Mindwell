The lab was quiet this time of day, most of her colleagues already tucked into their families for dinner. She looked up at the clock, the hands ticking steadily towards 7 PM. He should have been here by now.\n\nHer phone remained silent, no buzz or vibration to announce his arrival. She'd left him a voicemail earlier, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked him to pick up some milk on his way home. It was their staple for breakfast, but it was running low, just like their conversations had been these past few weeks.\n\nShe felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach as she considered the possibilities. Maybe he'd lost track of time, buried deep in his own work. Or maybe... She pushed that thought away, focusing instead on the rhythmic ticking of the clock. But each tick echoed louder than the last, amplifying her worry.\n\nJust then, the door creaked open. She looked up, hope flickering in her eyes, only to be met with the janitor's apologetic smile. \"Sorry, ma'am,\" he said softly, \"I didn't mean to disturb you.\" As the door clicked shut behind him, she felt the hope fade away, replaced by a familiar, gnawing emptiness.\n\nShe returned to her coffee, now cold and unappealing. The lab felt colder too, the hum of machinery no longer comforting but isolating. She sighed, pushing back from her desk, the wheels of her chair squeaking softly in protest. Another late night awaited, another silent dinner for one.",

I can picture him now, engrossed in his work, oblivious to the time, let alone my silent pleas echoing through these lab corridors. Yet again, I'll find myself here, amidst the humming machines and the ticking clock, their rhythmic din a stark reminder of his absence.\n\nBut no, I won't dwell on such thoughts. It's not like him to deliberately ignore my message. Perhaps he's caught in some unexpected meeting, or maybe - just maybe - his phone has run out of battery again. Yes, that must be it. Yet, the knot in my stomach persists, its grip tightening with each tick of the clock.\n\nI can almost hear his voice now, 'Darling, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to worry you.' But those words won't come tonight, will they? Instead, I'll be left here, with nothing but cold coffee and colder reality. The empty plate before me feels like a harbinger of things to come - more nights like this, more silent dinners, more unspoken apologies.\n\nBut no, I won't think about that now. It's just tonight, isn't it? Just one evening out of many. Yet, as I look at the clock again, its hands seem to mock me, their steady march towards tomorrow feeling increasingly unbearable.\""

Fuck, fuck, *fuck*! This is such a mess. All those years of building up goodwill with that old man, gone in an instant because I couldn't keep my eyes on something for five fucking minutes.
