I can't just sit here and wait for them to come bursting through my door. This is insane! I need to get out of here, grab my stuff and go to... where? My parents' place? No, too far. The mall? They've got generators there, right? Damn it, why didn't I buy that flashlight at the store yesterday? I knew something like this was coming. I just knew it.\""

They have a file that seems to suggest something grave.

I haven't seen him since... what was it, five years ago? He looks terrible, like he's aged a decade. His hands are shaking as he holds out that file - \"Dr. H's Diagnosis: Terminal\". My heart's pounding now, imagining all sorts of worst-case scenarios. What if I missed something crucial back then? What if this is my fault somehow? Should've pushed harder for that second opinion... maybe it would've made a difference. Now my mind's racing with 'what ifs', each one darker than the last."

That book wasn't just any cookbook; it was our first, signed by the great master himself when we were barely more than kids, starting out in this little apartment with nothing but love and ambition between us. It wasn't just ink on paper; it was a memory, a story, a testament to how far we've come together.\n\nAnd now it's gone. Thrown away like yesterday's newsprint. How could she? I thought we were supposed to treasure these things, not discard them like old rags. She didn't even ask me first, didn't give me the chance to say yes or no. It was just... gone. Just like that.\n\nI can't help but feel betrayed. This wasn't about the book itself, no matter how valuable it might have been. This was about respect, about consideration, about valuing something because I valued it. But now it's lost, and so is a piece of me, a piece of us. And she doesn't even seem to care.\n\nI've spent hours searching through boxes in the basement, hoping against hope that maybe, just maybe, she tossed it into storage instead of the trash. But no luck. It's gone forever, swallowed up by some landfill somewhere, and there's nothing I can do about it now except feel this hollow ache inside me.\n\nI thought we were a team, you know? That we built our life together, brick by brick. But maybe I was wrong. Maybe she never cared as much as I did.
