That I wouldn't recognize this mockery for what it is - a symbol of her triumph over my so-called 'talent'?\n\nHer voice resonated in my mind as if she were standing right beside me, \"You'll never be more than this, old man.\" The words echoed like thunder, shaking the very foundations of my being. How could she presume to know my limitations? To judge my worth based on a single, inferior piece?\n\nI clenched the canvas with such force that my knuckles turned white. It was as if I held her very essence in my grasp, and I longed to tear it apart, to destroy the smug smile etched onto its surface. But even in my rage, I knew better than to give her the satisfaction of seeing me act so rashly.\n\nNo, I would not stoop to her level. Instead, I vowed to prove her wrong, to create something truly magnificent that would silence her mocking laughter once and for all. For I know - no, I *feel* - her thoughts better than anyone else ever could. And I will use that knowledge to fuel my art, to burn brighter than her cruel words ever could."
