The ink has faded like our love, but the sentiment remains as stark and unwavering as it ever was.\n\n\"Always,\" she wrote, \"always I shall be yours, and you mine.\" A laughable claim now, isn't it? Always, indeed! As if such a notion could withstand the test of time. It's not as though we had any choice in the matter when our love crumbled like a sandcastle at high tide.\n\nAnd look here, she says she'll \"never\" forget those days. Never, mind you! As if one could cling to such memories with any semblance of fondness after what transpired between us. It's not as though we've both moved on, built new lives that bear no trace of the other.\n\nNo, this letter is a stark reminder\u2014not just of what once was, but of how things have always been, and will forever remain.

I recently attended one of your meetings as a guest, expecting to find solace in familiar tastes that remind me of her. Instead, I was greeted by an unrecognizable medley of flavors, all in the name of 'innovation' and 'modernizing classic dishes'.\n\nHer recipes were not meant to be tampered with! She spent years perfecting them, pouring her love into every ingredient, every spice. Each dish was a testament to her creativity, her passion, her very being. And now, you've reduced them to mere experiments in molecular gastronomy or some such nonsense.\n\nI sat there, listening to you all boast about how 'improved' these dishes are, how they've taken them to the next level. As if you could ever surpass what she had created with her own two hands. It was like watching you rewrite history, erasing her legacy one altered ingredient at a time.\n\nYou may think you're honoring her memory by carrying on her tradition, but let me assure you, this is not how you do it. You're not better than her, no matter how many Michelin stars your 'improved' versions might warrant. None of you could ever fill her shoes in the kitchen, or in my heart.\n\nI expected more from you, her friends, her peers. I expected respect for her craft, her art. Instead, all I saw was a room full of pretentious fools who think they can outdo a ghost.\n\nConsider this my formal request: leave her recipes alone. Let them exist as they are, perfect in their imperfection, lovingly crafted by the woman we all knew and loved. And if you must tinker with someone else's legacy, do it with your own. Leave hers be.\n\nSincerely disheartened,\n\n[Your Name]"
