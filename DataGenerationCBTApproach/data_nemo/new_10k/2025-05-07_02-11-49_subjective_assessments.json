My heart was pounding like it had just won a marathon, and my lungs were on strike, refusing to cooperate. \"Three-oh-five AM,\" I grumbled at the clock, as if it were somehow responsible for this rude awakening.\n\nI stumbled to the bathroom, using the sink as a lifeline against the waves of dizziness crashing over me. The mirror was an unflattering witness to my disheveled state. \"You look like you've just seen a ghost,\" I told my reflection sarcastically, trying to lighten the mood.\n\nBut my mind wouldn't have it. It was already off and running with its favorite sport: what if. What if this is more than just a panic attack? What if it's something serious? What if Sarah wakes up and finds me like this? What if she thinks I'm losing it?\n\nI could feel the anxiety building, like a dam ready to burst. \"Not again,\" I whispered, leaning into the mirror, trying to convince myself that everything was okay. But my reflection just stared back at me, pale and worried, as if daring me to doubt its sincerity.\n\n\"Stop it,\" I hissed at myself, running the tap water to splash some on my face. \"It's just a panic attack. You're fine.\" But even as I said it, my mind was already leaping to the next what if. And so, the cycle continued, like an endless, anxious merry-go-round."
