A familiar customer, a woman around his late wife's age, handed him her loyalty card with a smile. He froze, staring at the card adorned with tiny hearts. His chest tightened as he remembered the Valentine's Day they'd spent together, her laughter echoing through their apartment.

Without another word, he walked away, leaving the customers waiting, their murmurs of confusion filling the silence he'd created. It was like a cloud had descended upon him, dark and heavy, and there was nothing he could do but retreat until it passed. \"I just need a moment,\" he whispered to himself, his voice barely audible over the din of the fluorescent lights flickering overhead."
