The canvas he'd left unfinished still leaned against the easel, his brushes dried out beside it. A single paint tube lay abandoned on the floor, its cap off, a forgotten tear stain darkening its side. She picked it up, her fingers tracing the indented impression of his thumb. A quiet sob escaped her lips as she noticed the color: their favorite shade of blue, the one he'd mixed just for her, now drying out like their love had done so suddenly.",
