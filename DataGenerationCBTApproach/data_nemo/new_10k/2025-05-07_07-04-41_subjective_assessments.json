His heart pounded against his ribs, each beat resonating with the acid reflux of humiliation that burned his throat. He could see it now, the stark white walls of his studio, bare save for the empty canvases mocking him in their pristine silence. No more inspiration would come, he was sure of it. Every stroke of the brush would be a laborious chore, a futile attempt at creating something worthwhile. They had seen through him, those pretentious fools, and now so would everyone else. His art career was doomed to wither away like an untended plant, and there wasn't a damn thing he could do about it."

No response. Again. *Probably just a dead zone.* But why does it feel like there's more to this than bad reception?\n\nAs I get closer to the car, I swear I see something moving nearby. My breath catches in my throat, but then I catch myself. *It's probably just a cat or a stray dog,* I think, trying to convince myself that anything positive is just a coincidence, not worth considering.\n\n*Just do your job, man,* I mutter under my breath, approaching the car like it might explode any second now. Even when I find nothing but an old receipt and some empty cups in the driver's seat, I can't shake this feeling of dread. *Probably just someone who forgot something inside their house.* But why does that thought feel so hollow?\n\nWhen backup finally arrives and we find out it was a kid pranking his friends with a remote-controlled car, I nod like I expected that all along. But deep down, I can't help but think, *That doesn't explain the movement I saw.* Even when they laugh about it later at the station, I just shrug it off.\n\n*Just another night on patrol,* I say, dismissing any positive spin on the situation as if it's not worth my time."
