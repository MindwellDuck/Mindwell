She tiptoed to the kitchen, her heart heavy with the weight of yesterday's failed experiment. As she poured herself a cup of cold coffee from last night, she noticed the note stuck to the fridge: \"You're amazing. Today will be better.\" But today felt like just another day in a long line of failures. She hugged her mug tightly, tears stinging her eyes as she realized the lab's deadline was looming, and she had nothing to show for it.",

She thought bitterly, gripping the mug until her knuckles turned white. Today will be better, he said. As if it were that easy to dismiss yesterday's debacle. She could already see it, the lab's email flooding her inbox, the deadline looming like a guillotine. Another day, another failure. She wouldn't be able to bear it, she just knew it. The coffee sloshed over the sides of the mug as she stormed back to their bedroom, leaving the note crumpled on the kitchen counter. How could he be so optimistic? Didn't he understand what today held in store for her? It was going to be another disaster, she was sure of it. And there was nothing she could do to stop it."

As she turned another page, a small envelope fluttered out, landing softly on her knee. It was their wedding invitation, now faded and worn. She traced the elegant script, feeling the familiar ache in her chest. The melancholy washed over her like a tide as she remembered that day, that life, now lost to her.",

She took a deep breath, her cheeks flushing red. \"You know better than that,\" she said quietly, her voice barely audible over the clamor. The other staff glanced their way, whispering.

The doctors say her condition is deteriorating; they've started using words like 'prognosis' and 'palliative care'. I can hardly bear to think about it, let alone discuss it with her. She's too fragile, too brave for such conversations.\n\nAnd then there's my work - or lack thereof. Sales have been dismal, Thomas. Three rejections this month alone. They're not even bothering to send form rejections anymore; they've taken to simply crossing out the 'accepted' box on their submission forms. It's humiliating, really. I've always prided myself on my art, but now it seems nothing more than a futile attempt at capturing beauty amidst this decay.\n\nI've been trying to throw myself into painting, but every brushstroke feels heavy, pointless. These walls are closing in around me, Thomas - they're filled with reminders of failure. I'm failing her, failing my art... failing everything.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, old friend.
