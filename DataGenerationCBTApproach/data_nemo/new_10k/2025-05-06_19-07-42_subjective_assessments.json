Reflect the cognitive distortion 'Mental Filter' subtly, with a focus on one detail (the phrase \"I need some space\") and disregarding other aspects of the message.\n\n**Text:**\n\nDear [Partner's Name],\n\nI must confess, I am taken aback by your email. The phrase \"I need some space right now\" has resonated in my mind since I read it this morning. It feels as though you're implying that our relationship is suffocating, or perhaps even burdensome to you.\n\nI've been going over those three words repeatedly, trying to understand what could have possibly led you to feel this way. I've discounted the rest of your message - \"Let's talk in a few weeks\" seems almost inconsequential now, overshadowed by the demand for space.\n\nCould it be that my recent focus on work has made me seem distant? Or perhaps you've found fault with some minor habit of mine that I've been oblivious to? Whatever it is, I assure you, I'm more than willing to make changes if it means our relationship can improve.\n\nI eagerly await our discussion in a few weeks. Until then, please consider this my commitment to reflect on how I might have contributed to this need for space.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]"

It must be something big for Sarah to message him like this.\n\nJames couldn't help but feel responsible. After all, he was the parent who'd been away more often than not, the one who hadn't been there when Johnny needed him.

James sighed, his mind already racing with scenarios, each one ending with him having to pick up the pieces of Johnny's latest mess. He didn't notice the cat next door, arching its back at a passing dog, or Mrs. Harper's curtain twitching as she watched the commotion outside her house. In his mind, it was all about him and Johnny."
