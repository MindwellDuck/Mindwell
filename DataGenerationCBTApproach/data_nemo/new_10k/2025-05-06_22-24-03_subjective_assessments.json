She poured herself a cup, the familiar aroma doing little to lift her spirits as it once did.

The silence was heavy, echoing with memories of laughter and bustling mornings that seemed like distant dreams. Today was her first day back at work since the holidays, and the thought of facing the cheerful chatter of customers felt overwhelming.

She had grown accustomed to waking up to his quiet hums and rustling newspapers, but today, there was only silence - save for the mechanical whir of the coffeemaker she'd set, its steady rhythm now an unwelcome intrusion on her solitude.\n\nShe padded into the kitchen, her slippers barely making a sound against the cool marble floor. Pouring herself a cup of coffee, she inhaled deeply, expecting the familiar aroma to envelop her with warmth and comfort. Yet, today it seemed lacking, as if it too was aware of the void that echoed through their once bustling home.\n\nShe sat down at the table, her eyes drawn to the sunlight streaming in through the window. It should have been comforting, a gentle embrace from the new day. Instead, it felt like an intruder, highlighting the stark emptiness of the house. Each ray was a silent accusation, mocking her with memories of mornings filled with laughter and chatter, now replaced by an oppressive silence.\n\nToday was meant to be a fresh start, her first day back at work after the holidays. She had envisioned herself greeting customers with bright smiles and cheerful banter, as she once did. But now, the thought of it felt like a heavy weight on her chest. The office should have been abuzz with anticipation, not this gnawing anxiety that threatened to consume her.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself for another day in this new, quieter life that refused to align with her expectations. She told herself firmly, \"This is how it should be now,\" even as everything within her screamed that something was amiss."
