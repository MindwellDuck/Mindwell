He looked up as she approached, his eyes reflecting the cold drizzle, and offered her a small smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. She sat down beside him, their shoulders touching briefly, both silent until he finally spoke, \"It's been eight years today.\" Sarah felt a lump form in her throat, her heart heavy with unspoken words as she watched the rain fall around them, each drop echoing like a tiny, somber drumbeat.",

The kids these days, they're all the same - lazy, dishonest, and completely devoid of original thought. It's enough to make a grown man weep into his coffee.\n\nAnd now, here I am, Mr. Popularity himself, fielding calls from irate parents left and right. 'Why did you recommend my little angel for plagiarism?' they cry. Well, let me tell you, folks, it wasn't exactly a group effort. No, no, it was all Johnny boy's grand idea. Entirely his achievement.\n\nGuess I'll just have to add this one to the long list of teaching disasters. After all, what's another nail in my coffin? It's not like I've ever had a student surprise me with something good. That would be too much to ask for, wouldn't it?\""

She could feel their stares burning into her back as she hurried away, books clutched tightly to her chest. The bell rang again, louder this time, drowning out the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears. Alone in her classroom, she couldn't shake the image of them together, laughter ringing false now, like everything else since the divorce. She'd seen it all, every little touch, every shared glance. It was enough to make her sick. But she didn't see how they looked away from each other once she passed, relief etched on their faces. She didn't hear the quiet words they exchanged after she left, about how hard this was for everyone involved. She only saw what she wanted to see, felt what she chose to feel. Everything else faded into noise."
