His wife's car was absent from the driveway, another late meeting for her fast-track career. He trudged inside, flicking on lights that felt too bright in the empty house. In the mailbox was a letter from the bank, the envelope already opened, his wife's neat handwriting scrawled across it: \"Final Notice.\" The balance was dwindling faster than he could count the coins left after each paycheck. He sank onto the couch, cradling the letter like a guilty secret, wondering if this time, there really was no way out.",

As I sat there, clutching that damned piece of paper like a lifeline, I couldn't help but feel the weight of it all. Her career, soaring higher with each late-night meeting, seemed to cast an even longer shadow over my own stagnant existence. The house felt too quiet, too empty, echoing her absence more than it should have. Each '0' on that statement seemed to mock me, a silent taunt of how I couldn't keep up, couldn't measure up. Yet again, the scales tipped in her favor, leaving me drowning in debt and defeat. It wasn't fair, but then again, when has life ever been?"
