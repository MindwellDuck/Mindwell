They didn't know her though, she wasn't always like this. But how could they not think that? She felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment as she quickly tucked the change away, trying to hide her nerves. \"Show's over, kids,\" she muttered, more to herself than them, as she turned to face another long day of assuming everyone knew exactly what was going on in her head."

It felt like a slap across my face. In that moment, I wasn't a dedicated nurse with decades of experience; I was nothing more than what those cruel words suggested. How dare they reduce me to such an insult? This wasn't about humor or fun anymore - it was about disrespect and humiliation. I couldn't see anything else, couldn't hear anything else.

How dare you use his name so casually, as if you two were equals in intellect and integrity! He was the genius who dedicated his life to this field, not you. You're just another leech hoping to capitalize on his hard-earned knowledge.\n\nAnd to suggest that I assist you in this... It's laughable, really. As if I'd want anything to do with a project he never would have touched, much less one he explicitly asked me to turn down! He knew it was too soon, too painful for me. But of course, you wouldn't know that. You didn't spend every waking moment beside him as he wasted away.\n\nI'm disappointed, [Colleague's Name]. I expected more from someone who claimed to be his friend. Perhaps next time, consider the feelings of those left behind before you go throwing around promises made in grief and desperation.\n\nNo further discussion on this matter is necessary. Please do not contact me again regarding this 'project.'\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"
