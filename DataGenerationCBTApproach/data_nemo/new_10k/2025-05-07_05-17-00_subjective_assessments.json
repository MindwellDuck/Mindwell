As she pulls the box from the top shelf, it slips from her grasp, spilling its contents across the floor. She bends down to pick up the scattered items, her back aching from hours on her feet.

Get that customer sorted out.\" She feels a wave of helplessness wash over her as she realizes she won't make it before they close.
