She hadn't noticed him yet, but he recognized that smug smile, that confident posture. It was the same way she'd acted when she got his job, the one he'd applied for and desperately wanted after decades of service. His grip tightened around his tray, knuckles turning white as he felt a bitter taste rise in his throat. He wanted to march over there, spill her tea, make a scene. But he didn't. Instead, he turned away, feeling the spite burn within him like an untended wound.",

You remember Jane, don't you? Former colleague, current thorn in my side?\n\nSpotted her today at the hospital canteen, laughing like she'd invented laughter itself. You know that laugh, right? The one that's been echoing through my nightmares since she waltzed into my old job like it was a bloody dance hall.\n\nI tell you, Charles, I felt the old rage simmering again. It was like a switch had flipped - either I spill her tea and make a scene (which, let's face it, would've been most satisfying), or I keep walking and let that spite fester within me like an open wound. There was no middle ground, no 'maybe I'll just sit here and quietly enjoy my lunch'. No, it was black or white, good or bad, spill the tea or simmer in silence.\n\nBut you know me, always the civilized one. So, I did what any reasonable, respectable gentleman would do - I turned on my heel and left, leaving that smug smile to her own devices. But mark my words, Charles, if our paths cross again, well... let's just say I'm not sure how long this 'good behavior' will last.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nYour ever-so-disgruntled friend,\nHenry"
