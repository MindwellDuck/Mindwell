The retired fire chief, Tom, didn't even glance my way, too engrossed in some story about '89.\n\n\"Hey, honey,\" she started, but I cut her off.\n\n\"You know what, never mind.\" I walked past them into the kitchen, grabbing a beer from the fridge with more force than necessary. \"Either you're having fun without me, or you're not.

I've seen shadows before, but this one was quick, too quick for a cat or any critter. Had to be something more. I called it in, but dispatch sounded about as interested as my teenage kid on laundry day. \"Unit 12, we copy... over,\" she said, like she was reading off a script. Could've sworn I heard laughter when she thought I wasn't listening.\n\nThis beat's not usually this quiet at night. Must be because of those damn burglaries. Seems like every other call these days is about some punk breaking into another storefront. No sign of who's doing it, though. Just a bunch of broken locks and empty shelves. The boss thinks we're getting close, but I'm not so sure.\n\nThis flashlight's seen better days. It's been flickering on me lately, like it can't be bothered to shine bright after hours. Not much good against whatever's hiding out there tonight. But hey, at least it's got some weight behind it. Might come in handy if I have to bash something... or someone.\n\nI'm not waiting around for backup this time. Dispatch might think I'm overreacting, but they weren't here when that shadow slipped by. They didn't see how dark the alleys are tonight. No, I'll show them. I'll find out what's going on and bring whoever it is to their knees. Might as well get some use out of this old flashlight while I'm at it."
