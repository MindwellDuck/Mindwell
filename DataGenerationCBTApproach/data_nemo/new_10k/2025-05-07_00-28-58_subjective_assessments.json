It was filled with notes detailing a scandal that would've made his career if he'd broken it back in the day.

He felt a cold surge of vengefulness as he read, realizing this could be his chance to expose her treachery and reclaim some semblance of victory from the wreckage of their shared past.",

Always assuming everyone will dance to her tune. Well, not this time. I won't be her pawn anymore.*\n\n*She thinks she can drop this bombshell on my doorstep and expect me to just...what? Run with it? Expose the truth like some eager puppy? Screw that.*\n\n*It's not my fault our careers tanked while hers took off. It's not my fault we're divorced, and I'm left picking up the pieces. And it sure as hell isn't my fault she chose to send this goddamn envelope.*\n\n*But you know what? I'll take it. I'll take her little 'gift' and run with it. I'll show her, show everyone, that I'm still the journalist they should've feared.*\n\n*This is all on her. Every damn bit of it.*"
