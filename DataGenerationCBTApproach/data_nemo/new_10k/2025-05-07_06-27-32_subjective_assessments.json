He spots a young couple laughing loudly, their picnic blanket spread out across the freshly cut grass. As he approaches, they don't bother moving aside, forcing him to step into the muddy path around them. His dog growls at their carelessness, but they merely laugh louder, dismissing him as an old crank. The man feels a surge of hatred boiling within him, his hands shaking with anger as he pulls his dog away.",

It seems the younger generation, en masse, lacks basic courtesy. I approached a couple sprawled out on the grass, their laughter echoing, and what did they do? Not a soul bothered to move aside. I was forced to navigate the muddy path around them, Max growling at their carelessness.\n\nIt's not as if this is an isolated occurrence. These youngsters, they're always so self-absorbed, never considering others. The whole generation seems to lack respect for elders and public spaces. It's high time someone teaches them some manners. I can't help but feel a sense of disdain whenever I encounter such behavior. They're the future, after all, and if this is how they behave now, what hope does our society have?\""
