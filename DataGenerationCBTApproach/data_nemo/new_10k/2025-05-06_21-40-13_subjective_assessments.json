They're laughing at me, I just know it. And this puddle outside? It's growing, swelling, like it's trying to swallow up my shop whole. It's probably planning on flooding the place tonight, while I'm stuck here, unable to do a damn thing about it.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on this reflection staring back at me. Gray hair?
