The phone remains silent, no longer ringing with daily check-ins from old friends who've drifted away since her husband's passing.

Today, she was supposed to start volunteering again at the hospital where she once worked, but as she searches for her nurse's pin, she finds herself suddenly overcome by an inexplicable fatigue. She sinks into her armchair, clutching the pin tightly in her fist, and feels a profound sense of being forgotten, unseen, and alone.",
