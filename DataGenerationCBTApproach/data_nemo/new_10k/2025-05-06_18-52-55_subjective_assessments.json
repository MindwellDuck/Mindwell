There was no in-between for me, no grey area where I could simply acknowledge the mess without condemning myself entirely. The sight of that wretched creature burrowing into my past - quite literally, into boxes of software I'd long forgotten - was enough to plunge me into a abyss of despair. It was all or nothing, black and white, as if I were some grotesque parody of a Victorian melodrama. 'Either you're a competent adult who maintains a clean, well-ordered garage,' I thought bitterly, 'or you're a pathetic excuse for a human being, living in squalor and filth.' The reality, of course, was somewhere in between - but try as I might, I couldn't seem to grasp that subtlety. It was all or nothing, and in that moment, I was most certainly nothing.\""
