Then, I saw it - his old coffee mug, chipped and stained, nestled among the clean crockery.\n\nMy hand reached out automatically, fingers brushing against the familiar coolness of the ceramic. But then, I remembered. The memory was a sharp pinch, like a reprimand from an unseen force. I snatched my hand back as if burned, my heart sinking into a familiar heaviness.\n\n\"It doesn't count,\" I murmured to myself, turning away from the mug. \"It's just a stupid old mug.\" I focused on the other dishes, their pristine state glaring under the harsh light. But each one felt like an empty victory, a fleeting moment of joy that would be swept away by the inevitable tide of reality.\n\nI couldn't shake off the dull ache in my chest, the weight of countless forgotten kindnesses, unappreciated moments of warmth. Each one dismissed, each one discarded like yesterday's news. Because that's what I do best, isn't it? Turning gold into dross, refusing to see the shine until it's gone forever."
