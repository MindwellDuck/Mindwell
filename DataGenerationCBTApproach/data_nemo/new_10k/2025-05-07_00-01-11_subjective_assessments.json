The cursor blinks, hesitating like me, before the first picture loads - us smiling at some cheesy tourist trap. My heart lurches. What if he'd turned around and seen that place without me? Would he have thought I was missing out?\n\nI scroll through the album, each picture a 'what if?' knife twist: what if we'd ordered that fancy dessert instead of rushing back to the hotel; what if we'd explored that quiet cove instead of sticking to the tourist path. Each unchosen option feels like a missed chance, a life unlived.\n\nI catch myself wondering what if he'd waited for me at the airport gate that day, how different everything would've been. But then I remember the email from my boss, the one I couldn't ignore. It was work, after all. Important work. Still, a shiver runs down my spine. What if it hadn't been?"

As she sat down at the kitchen table, she noticed a letter addressed to her ex-husband among the junk mail. The familiar handwriting sent a pang through her heart, a mix of longing and resentment.

She watched from the window as he walked down the familiar street towards the park, where she knew they'd met for the first time decades ago. His stride was purposeful, yet there was a softness to it that made her heart ache with memories. But today, something felt different. He didn't turn back to wave at their house, his usual habit before disappearing into the trees. Instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a familiar-looking letter - hers, or so she thought. She watched as he unfolded it, his lips moving slightly as if whispering its contents to himself. A sudden gust of wind snatched the paper from his hand, sending it spinning towards the lake. He didn't chase after it. Instead, he stood there for a moment longer before turning away, leaving the letter - and her past - behind.",

The letter he held, I knew it well - it was the one I'd written to him on our fifth anniversary, pouring out my heart and soul onto those crisp white pages. Seeing it now, I couldn't help but feel that familiar warmth of love and pride that had filled me as I wrote it. But today, it felt tainted, like a harbinger of something sinister. The wind whipped around him, trying to snatch the letter away, but he held onto it tightly, almost protectively. And when it finally did tear free from his grasp, spinning towards the lake like a discarded secret, I couldn't shake off this feeling that our past was being swept away too. It felt like reality itself was confirming my fears, guiding me towards the grim conclusion that something had changed between us, and not for the better.\""

Your concern, though I appreciate its spirit, feels a bit misplaced.\n\nI wish you could understand how draining this self-criticism is, amplified by what I perceive as your silent judgment.

He picked up a worn spatula, its handle softened by years of use, and idly stirred the remnants of a reduction in a pan, the once-vibrant liquid now a dull caramel. As he swirled it, he caught sight of his reflection in the stainless steel: the lines etched deeper around his eyes, the silver hair at his temples. He thought of the years spent over these burners, the thousands of meals prepared, and how none of it could bring back the time he'd wasted on pride and stubbornness. A lump formed in his throat as he realized that tomorrow was their anniversary, a date she'd once looked forward to, now overshadowed by the distance he'd let grow between them.
