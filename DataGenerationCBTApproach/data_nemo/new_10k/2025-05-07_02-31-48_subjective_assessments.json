Everything had its place, and she'd manage to keep it that way, even with two kids running around. And then there's Dr. Lee, with his sleek, modern pad downtown. I've seen pictures - it's always spotless, always perfect.\n\nI glance at the pile of discarded hangers in the corner, and a sigh escapes me. It's not like I haven't tried to keep up.
