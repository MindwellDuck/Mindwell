He'd been unable to paint since her passing six months ago. Today was meant to be different; he'd told himself it was time to face the blank canvas. But now, standing here, he felt only sadness, a heavy weight in his chest. The studio, once their shared sanctuary, now echoed with her absence. He reached out tentatively, touching the cool paintbrushes, remembering her laughter as she squeezed out vibrant colors onto the palette they'd shared. A single tear rolled down his cheek, landing on the pristine canvas.",

He'd promised himself today would be different, but here he was, proving once again that he was nothing without her by his side. He angrily wiped away another tear, as if doing so could erase the label he'd given himself."

What if one of the nurses, distracted by an emergency, had reached for it in the darkness?\n\nThe cleanup was meticulous, but the rage within me refused to subside. I couldn't help but imagine the worst-case scenarios playing out in my mind's eye. The board would have a field day with this, they'd say we were reckless, irresponsible. Our reputation could be tarnished, our funding jeopardized.\n\nBut most importantly, what if someone had been hurt? What if we'd lost a patient because of such an avoidable mistake?
