She remembered the tufts of grey fur she'd seen near the old warehouse last week. That was it. That was the detail that stuck out like a sore thumb. Everything else\u2014the safety of the neighborhood, the fact that cats often showed up after disappearing for days\u2014it all faded into insignificance.\n\nMrs. Johnson's grip tightened on Whiskers' favorite toy, clutched in her hand like a lifeline. She was so focused on that one detail, so sure it would lead her to Whiskers, she didn't notice the other signs around her\u2014the birds chirping in the trees, the faint smell of fresh coffee from someone's nearby home. The world could have been crumbling around her, but Mrs. Johnson was blind to everything except that goddamn warehouse.\n\n\"Whiskers!\" she called out again, her voice echoing off the deserted buildings. She didn't see the bigger picture, couldn't see it even if it had been painted in neon lights. Her mental filter was set to 'Warehouse,' and nothing else mattered until she found her cat."
