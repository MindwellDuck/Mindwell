She stopped by the classroom door, her eyes scanning the rows of desks now vacant and cold. A single red apple lay untouched on one desk, its owner having forgotten it in their rush to leave at the end of the day. She picked it up, feeling its smooth skin against her fingers, a reminder of the countless apples she had packed for her own son's school lunches years ago. The weight of the fruit was heavy in her hand as she realized once again that no one would be there to greet her when she returned home from this empty building. She sighed, placing the apple back down gently before continuing on her way alone.",

She grabbed her coat and headed inside, the echo of her footsteps mocking her as she walked down the empty halls. \"Must be nice,\" she thought, eyeing the untouched apple on little Timmy's desk. \"Not everyone has a mom waiting at home with a hot meal.\" She sighed, shaking her head before continuing on her way alone, unaware that Timmy had actually brought his lunch today."

That word echoed in my head like a grim tolling bell. I could see it now, the graphs on the monitor, flatlining. The sterile hum of the hospital, the somber faces of the staff. A life slipping away, right under my goddamn hands.\n\nAs I pulled on my scrub cap, my mind raced ahead, painting vivid scenes of catastrophe. I saw the family waiting in the cold light of the corridor, saw their faces crumple with grief as a nurse delivered the news.

My chest felt like it was caving in, compressing my lungs until there was barely enough room for a desperate gasp of air. It was too much. Too awful to bear.\n\nI gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white, as I tore through the night towards the hospital. The world outside blurred into an indistinct smear of shadow and light. My mind was already in that sterile hell, already drowning in guilt and failure.\n\nThis was it. The moment everything would go wrong. I could feel it, like a physical pressure building inside me, threatening to explode. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think. All I could do was race towards the inevitable disaster, helpless and terrified."
