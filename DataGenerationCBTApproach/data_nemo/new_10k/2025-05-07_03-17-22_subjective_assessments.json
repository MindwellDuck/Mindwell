After all this time, after everything we'd been through, how could he still have the audacity to invade our space, our home?\n\nI could feel the fury rising inside me, hot and bitter, a taste I knew all too well. It was like he was standing right there, daring me to open it, to let him back into my life even for just a moment. But I wasn't going to give him that satisfaction. Not after what he did.\n\nWithout thinking, I kicked the letter across the room, watching as it tumbled end over end before landing in a crumpled heap against the wall. Good riddance, I thought. That's where you belong, you fucking reminder of my failure. Because that's what this is, isn't it? A failure on my part, for ever letting him into our lives.\n\nI stood there, breathing heavy, hands trembling with anger and something else - something I refused to acknowledge. I couldn't let myself feel anything else right now. Not when the reality of his betrayal was staring me in the face, taunting me from that fucking corner.
