He took a sip of water, but it tasted bitter on his tongue. \"It's not like before,\" he whispered to himself, his voice barely audible over the ticking clock. \"Either we're together, laughing, living... or this.\" He gestured around him, his hand trembling slightly. The dim light seemed to highlight every empty corner, every piece of furniture that now felt out of place without her warmth beside him. He couldn't imagine a middle ground, a happy medium. It was all or nothing, and tonight, it was definitely nothing."
