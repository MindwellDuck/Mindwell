She stirred her cooling coffee, her eyes fixed on the untouched sandwich she'd brought from home. A young doctor approached, his white coat pristine, a smile on his face. He held out a small toy dinosaur, a gift for the child she cared for yesterday, now stable but still critical. \"I thought you might want to give this to him,\" he said, placing it gently in her hand. She felt a pang of guilt as she took it, remembering she'd promised to read his favorite book to him last night, but had been too busy with other patients.",
