She could feel their eyes, piercing like lasers, as she fumbled for the remote control that slipped through her fingers once more. The silence stretched out, heavy and humiliating, before she finally managed to turn on the slideshow, revealing her decades of research reduced to tiny, flickering images. Her voice shook as she began her presentation, each word a battle against the heat rising in her cheeks.",

I could feel their stares, like physical weights pressing down on me. They were laughing, weren't they? Mocking my trembling hands, my flushed cheeks, my voice that wavered like a rookie's.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but it was like inhaling fire. My emotions were screaming at me, telling me I was a joke, a failure. How could I not be? Look at me! Look at them!\n\nBut I couldn't let them see. I wouldn't. So, I pushed down the fear, the anger, the humiliation, and forced my voice to work. Each word was a battle cry, a defiance against the storm inside me.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" I thought, my hands shaking as I gestured towards the slideshow. \"They're all laughing at me. They think I'm pathetic.\" But I couldn't stop. I had to keep going. Because if I didn't, then it would be proof, wouldn't it? Proof that they were right. And I couldn't let them be right."

Among them was she, a middle-aged woman with tired eyes and slumped shoulders, her name tag pinned crookedly to her uniform. She'd been working at this retail job for years now, each day blending into the next in an endless parade of fluorescent lights and synthetic fabrics.\n\nAs she stepped behind the counter, her gaze fell upon the empty space where the Christmas display had once stood. Now it was just an abandoned corner, filled with echoes of laughter from children who'd already moved on to their next excitement. She felt a pang in her chest, a familiar ache that seemed to grow heavier each passing day.\n\nThe store manager approached, his lips pressed into a thin line. \"We need to make room for the Valentine's Day display,\" he said, gesturing towards the vacant corner. \"Can you take care of it today?\"\n\nShe nodded silently, her throat tightening around words she couldn't bring herself to speak. As she began dismantling the remnants of last season's decorations, she felt a profound sense of hopelessness wash over her. Another holiday, another season passing her by in this endless cycle of retail cheer. And yet again, no one would be buying her anything red or heart-shaped.",

It was black and white: either he was weak for needing my forgiveness, or strong as hell for daring to face me again.\n\nI felt that old anger boil up inside me like lava, burning away any chance of remorse. It wasn't fucking fair; either you were a goddamn hero or a coward, there was no room for anything else. And I sure as shit wasn't going to be the one to back down first.\n\nHe stood there, all smiles and gratitude, while I felt like I was being torn apart by those two extremes. Either I could stay stuck in my anger, or I could swallow my pride and make things right. But goddammit, it couldn't just be complicated, could it? It had to be one fucking thing or the other."
