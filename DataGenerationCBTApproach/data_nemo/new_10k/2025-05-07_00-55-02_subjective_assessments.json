Her breath comes in short, angry bursts as she paces, her mind replaying every harsh word and insinuation made by colleagues who think she's not cut out for investigative journalism. She snatches up her phone, intending to call someone, anyone, but stops herself, realizing there's no one left who'll understand this fire burning within her. Instead, she storms over to the wall where her degrees hang, unseeing eyes staring back at her. With a cry, she rips them down, leaving behind crooked nails and scattered dust.",

She throws the phone onto the couch, the screen cracking slightly. \"Fuck it!\" she screams at the empty room.\n\nHer gaze falls on the degrees hanging crookedly on the wall, dust bunnies gathered in the corners like tiny, forgotten tombstones. \"They're just pieces of paper,\" she snarls, ripping them down one by one. The nails scrape against the paint, leaving behind white scars and scattered dust. It's chaos, a storm of rejection and anger, but all she sees is the red haze of failure. Everything else fades away, ignored, unseen."

I'm writing from my quiet little home tonight, but there's a storm brewing inside me that has nothing to do with the weather. You know how I've always prided myself on maintaining our neighborhood's dignity since John passed? Well, today I witnessed something that made my blood boil.\n\nAcross the street, young Jake, you remember him from when he was just knee-high, was laughing loudly with his friends. They were tossing empty beer cans into John's garden like it was a game of bowling. My heart ached as I watched them desecrate the space we'd both nurtured with such care.\n\nI could see it in their eyes, Sarah. They knew exactly what they were doing. The way Jake smirked at his friends, daring them to throw another can into the bed John planted himself just last spring. It was like they were laughing at our memories, at John's meticulous work. I felt a surge of disdain, watching them mock the respect we'd always tried to instill here.\n\nI wanted to march over there and give Jake a piece of my mind, but what good would that do? He'd just deny it all, play innocent like he did when he broke Mrs. Henderson's window with his baseball last summer. I know he thinks he can get away with anything now that John's gone.\n\nIt's getting late, and I should be heading to the hospital soon, but I needed to vent to someone who understands. Please give my best to Tom and the kids. I'll call you this weekend if you're free.\n\nTake care,\nElizabeth"
