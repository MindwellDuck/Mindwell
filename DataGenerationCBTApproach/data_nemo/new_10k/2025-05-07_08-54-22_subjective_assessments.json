One might think I'd be accustomed to such 'fragrances' by now, given the delightful bouquet that used to permeate our home. Ah, Mother's lace - how it did bring us closer together, in more ways than one.\n\nBut I digress. The offending crabmeat lies before me, a veritable feast for the flies. It's almost as if I can hear her voice echoing in my mind, 'It's not rotting, dear, it's merely...aging gracefully.' I suppose that's one way to look at it.\n\nMy stomach churns, not just from the odor, but from the memories it stirs. The lace, the fights, the sense of duty that felt more like a noose around my neck. But what do emotions know? They're merely chemical reactions, after all. Yet here I am, dumping this putrid mess into the trash, feeling as though I've made some grand statement about our past.\n\nPerhaps it's just the crabmeat talking. Then again, perhaps not.\""
