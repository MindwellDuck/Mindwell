The figure was unresponsive, face pale and lifeless. She knew that face, had seen it countless times at family gatherings when they weren't on duty. It was his sister.

I was up in the attic, trying to sort through some boxes before the weather turns, and what do you know? I find this old photograph tucked away between the pages of a book I haven't opened in years.\n\nIt's us, me and Jake, smiling like fools on our first trip together to Paris. I can barely remember why we went there now, or what we did after that. It feels like another lifetime ago, another person entirely. And here I am, still stuck with all these memories cluttering up my mind.\n\nI don't know why he had to go and ruin everything. If he hadn't been so careless, so thoughtless, maybe things would've turned out differently. He never did understand the value of our shared history, did he? Always too busy chasing the next big adventure, the next great story to tell.\n\nNow look at me, left behind with nothing but these faded photographs and a heart full of regret. I suppose it's my fault for not holding onto him tighter, for not being enough to keep him grounded. But really, diary, isn't that just like Jake? Always running off and leaving the rest of us to pick up the pieces.\n\nI should've known better than to expect anything less from him. He was always like this, even back then. I suppose it's my own fault for falling in love with someone so irresponsible. But then again, who could resist those charming smiles?\n\nEnough about Jake, though. It's not like he cares one bit about how his actions affected me. I should just focus on what I can control, on moving forward. After all, it's not as if I can change the past.\n\nWell, diary, I think that's enough self-pity for one day. I'll put this photograph away where it belongs - hidden among the pages of a book I'll never open again. Out of sight, out of mind, right?\n\nUntil tomorrow,\nAlex"

Typical Mary, always putting others first.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful for all those years you spent taking care of everyone else.
