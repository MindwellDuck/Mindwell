Today, a renowned critic dismissed your latest exhibition as \"senile scribbles.\" Write about how this review makes you feel, using blunt language and structured sentences.\n\n**Text:**\n\nDamn it all! He had no right! Who the hell is he to call my work 'senile scribbles'? I've spent decades honing my craft, and now some jumped-up critic thinks he can just dismiss me like that? It's not about whether he likes it or not; it's about respect. Decades of dedication, years of sweat and tears, and this is what I get? A sneering review in print for all to see? He should have appreciated the depth, the emotion behind each stroke. He shouldn't have been so careless with his words. It's just not right."

What if she'd been somewhere else?\n\nHe tried to push the thought away, but it clung stubbornly to his mind. *What if she'd met someone?* The question echoed in his head, making him feel sick.\n\n*No,* he told himself firmly. *She wouldn't do that.* But the what-ifs kept coming, one after another, each one more dire than the last.\n\nHe looked at the receipt again, his heart pounding. Maybe it wasn't a big deal. Maybe there was some perfectly reasonable explanation for why she'd been at this restaurant when she should've been working.
