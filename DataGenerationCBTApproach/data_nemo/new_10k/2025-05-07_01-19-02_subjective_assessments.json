It's not just the noise that startles you; it's the sudden, overwhelming anger that courses through your veins, catching you off guard. You find yourself reacting with a force you hadn't intended, leaving behind a dent on the locker door and a throbbing ache in your knuckles.\n\n**Text:**\nThe silence of the locker room was always my sanctuary before each shift, a brief respite from the chaos that lay beyond its doors. But today, it felt like an enemy, closing in around me, suffocating me with its emptiness. How could it be so quiet when my world had been anything but? The snap of the rubber glove, intended to protect, seemed instead to mock me, a harsh reminder of the fragility that lay beneath.\n\nAlways, always, I'd known this job would be difficult. Never had I considered how much harder it would be without her by my side. Every locker, every scrub cap, every pair of gloves - they were all reminders of her absence, of the whole of our life together that was now gone. And today, even the simple act of preparing for work felt like a betrayal.\n\nThe anger surged within me, unexpected and intense. It wasn't just about the glove or the noise it had made. It was about every moment since she'd been taken from me, every struggle I faced alone that should have been ours to share. My fist connected with the locker door, a dent appearing where my knuckles left their mark. The pain was immediate and sharp, but it was nothing compared to the ache in my heart.\n\nAs I stood there, breathing heavily, the silence seemed to mock me once more. \"You're alone now,\" it whispered. \"This is your life now.\" And in that moment, it felt like it always would be."

That's impossible!\" I muttered under my breath, squinting through the crowd. There it was - the classic logo of The Dead Ends, my late wife Sarah's all-time favorite band, splashed across the back of some kid's t-shirt. It hit me like a punch to the gut, right there in the middle of the chaos.\n\nI mean, come on, how dare they? It's been what, five years now? And nobody's wearing their shirts anymore? That's just not right. Sarah would've wanted them to keep rockin' it, sure, but not like this. Not at some random protest, where everyone's too busy shouting slogans and waving placards to appreciate the true meaning of the music.\n\nI found myself involuntarily pushing through the crowd, drawn towards that damn shirt like a magnet. I needed to... what? Confront them? Demand an explanation for their disrespect? Even as I thought it, I knew how ridiculous it sounded. But still, something in me demanded justice for Sarah's memory.\n\nAs I got closer, I saw they were younger than I'd thought - barely out of high school. And they weren't even singing along to the tune blasting from the nearby speakers; they were too busy chanting slogans about fair wages and climate change. My heart sank. This wasn't some grand tribute to Sarah's taste in music. It was just a shirt, worn by a kid who probably didn't know The Dead Ends existed beyond their logo.\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my hair. The world shouldn't be like this. People should care more about the little things that matter, right? But then again, maybe it was me who'd stopped caring about the big picture when I lost Sarah. Either way, it sure as hell wasn't how it 'should' be."
