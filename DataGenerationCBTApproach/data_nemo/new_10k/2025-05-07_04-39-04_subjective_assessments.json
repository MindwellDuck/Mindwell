My girlfriend Sarah, she lit up like a Christmas tree, laughing at something he said before they'd even hung up their coats. I mean, who brings red wine to a dinner party? Doesn't he know we're having lamb?\n\nI watched them, standing there in our entryway, all smiles and chuckles, while I finished setting the table alone. It was like they were in their own little world, completely oblivious to me. Typical Tom, showing up early just to make an entrance.\n\nAs I listened to Sarah's laughter echo through the house, I felt this knot tightening in my stomach. She never laughs that hard when we're out with my friends. They must be having some kind of inside joke or something. I should've asked her about him more. Maybe they have a history I don't know about.\n\nI caught my reflection in the dining room mirror as I placed the last fork down. My jaw was clenched, my eyebrows drawn together. Great, now I look like the grumpy host. But really, how could she not see how out of place he is? It's not like he even tries to fit in.\n\nAs the night went on, I found myself tuning out their conversations, focusing instead on the little things that seemed so wrong - like how Tom kept reaching over to touch Sarah's arm when he made a point. And how she never pushed his hand away. It was all just so... much. Too much.\n\nBy the time we sat down for dinner, I felt exhausted. Like I'd been running a marathon alone while everyone else was out having a leisurely stroll. I guess that's what happens when you're the only one paying attention to the details.\""
