It had been days since little Emily went missing, and here she was, wasting time on petty calls.\n\nHer mind wandered, as it often did lately, down dark paths. What if Emily wasn't just lost? What if something terrible had happened to her? What if they never found her? She shuddered, pushing the thoughts away, but they persisted like stubborn weeds. What if tonight was the night Emily needed her most, and she was here, dealing with noise complaints?\n\nShe felt a pang of guilt, imagining Emily's frightened face on the missing person poster taped to every lamppost. She took a deep breath, trying to focus on the road ahead. But her mind kept spinning, trapped in an endless cycle of \"what ifs.\" What if she'd insisted on more manpower for the search? What if she'd pushed harder for Emily's case to be prioritized?\n\nShe shook her head, determined to keep these thoughts at bay. It wouldn't do anyone any good to dwell on the negative. But as she sat there, alone in the dark, the what-ifs continued to whisper their terrible possibilities in her ear. She could almost hear them, like the faint static of a distant storm. And she couldn't shake the feeling that somehow, it was all her fault."

From who? Suddenly, the box seemed like a chasm opening up between us, swallowing everything we were.

It wasn't a question, but a statement of fact. My mind had already leapt to that conclusion, filling in the gaps with all sorts of scenarios, each one worse than the last.\n\nMy partner's hands stilled for a moment before they shook their head gently. \"No, darling,\" they said softly, stepping towards me. \"It's just... temporary.
