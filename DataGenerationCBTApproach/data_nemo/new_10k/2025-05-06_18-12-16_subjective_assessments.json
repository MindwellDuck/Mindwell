Yet here they were, still lounging on our sofas, laughing loudly as if the world was theirs to command.\n\nI stood there for a moment, taking in the scene, my mind already racing with possibilities. Perhaps they had never intended to leave on time at all. Maybe this was their plan all along, to waste my evening and disrespect my rules. I could feel the anger simmering beneath the surface, threatening to boil over.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself before confronting them. I knew I had to remain composed, to handle this situation with the patience and authority that was expected of me. After all, it wasn't their fault they were raised by parents who didn't value punctuality or respect for others' time.\n\nAs I prepared to address them, I felt a sense of resignation wash over me. Another evening of peace and quiet had been taken from me. But perhaps this was just another opportunity for me to teach them a lesson in responsibility and obedience.
