Young Turk was basking in it too, chest puffed out like a damn peacock. I could see the commendation ribbon pinned to his jacket, glinting under the station lights. Seemed like everyone else got the memo about this shindig except me.\n\nMy desk back there looks like a bloody war zone. Stacks of reports, complaints, follow-ups... it never ends. And what do I get? Crickets. No pat on the back for keeping this place from descending into chaos every goddamn day. I'm just the grindstone here, while that kid gets the parade.\n\nI could feel my jaw clenching, knuckles white around the steering wheel. It's not fair. All he did was catch some punk with a pocket full of pills. That's his job, ain't it? Meanwhile, I'm over here playing nursemaid to this paperwork monster. And for what? A lousy 'Good job' from the captain once in a blue moon?\n\nI've been at this longer than that kid's been alive. You'd think that'd count for something. But nooo... all they see is the shiny new toy.
