He could almost hear their raw grief echoing through the line again, like a haunting melody that had taken up residence in his mind since that fateful day.\n\nHis thumb hovered over the call button, but it felt heavier than lead. The mere thought of dialing sent a wave of anxiety crashing against his chest, as if he were teetering on the edge of some abyss from which there could be no return.\n\nHe could see them now, their faces etched with sorrow, their eyes filled with accusations that hung heavy in the air like an unspoken indictment. He knew they would demand answers, expect reassurances. But how could he give them what he didn't have? How could he mend their shattered hearts when his own felt like a ragged wound?\n\nHis wife's words echoed in his mind, \"It wasn't your fault.\" Yet, tonight, in the quiet solitude of his patrol car, they sounded hollow, unconvincing. The darkness seemed to amplify his fears, magnifying them until he was drowning in a sea of what-ifs and could-bes.\n\nHe imagined their voices, harsh with grief, telling him they couldn't bear it if something like this happened again. He saw himself shattering under the weight of their pain, crumbling beneath the force of their blame. It would be unbearable. He wouldn't be able to stand it.\n\nHis hand began to shake as he slowly withdrew his thumb from the call button. The phone's screen dimmed, then went dark, mirroring the despair that threatened to consume him. He took a deep breath, steeling himself against the storm of emotion raging within him, and vowed to keep his distance. It was safer that way, for all of them."
