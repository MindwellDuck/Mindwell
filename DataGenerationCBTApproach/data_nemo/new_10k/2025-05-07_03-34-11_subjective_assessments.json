The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the windows, each one marking another day that passed him by. He paused outside Room 317, the name on the door now unfamiliar to him after all these years.\n\nThe room was quiet, too quiet. The machinery that once beeped and hummed in rhythmic cadence now lay silent, collecting dust in the corner. The bed was made, too neatly for a room that should have been filled with warmth and life. He reached out, his trembling fingers tracing the cold metal frame where she had once lain.\n\nHe remembered her laughter, so full of life and joy, now replaced by an eerie silence. His mind wandered back to that fateful day when he had made the call, believing it was best for everyone involved. But now, standing here alone, the weight of his decision bore heavily upon him. The regret washed over him like a tidal wave, each wave crashing against his chest with a force that left him breathless.\n\nHe had chosen the path of logic and reason, the path he had walked countless times as a doctor. But in doing so, he had forgotten to consider the heart. And now, all that remained was an empty room filled with echoes of what could have been.",

It was just past noon now, but every minute stretched out interminably, each tick of the second hand a mocking reminder of time's relentless march. His heart pounded in his chest, echoing the impatient rhythm of the clock.\n\nThe nurse had assured him that the surgery went well, that she would be fine. But how could he believe it? That was what they always said, wasn't it? Just empty words to placate him while the reality was something far more sinister. He had heard those same reassurances before, seen them turn into lies with each passing day.\n\nHe looked around at the sterile white walls of the hospital corridor. It was all so perfect, so clean. Too clean, really. It was like a facade, hiding God knows what horrors behind it. The sun streamed in through the windows, but it felt cold and distant, like a stranger's smile that never reached their eyes.\n\nHe thought back to the days leading up to this, the countless times she had smiled at him, her eyes crinkling at the corners. He remembered thinking then how lucky he was, how blessed they both were to have found each other after all these years. But those memories felt tainted now, like a bitter pill coated in sweet syrup.\n\nHe shook his head, as if trying to dislodge the thoughts from his mind. No, no use dwelling on such things. It would only make him more anxious, more unsettled. Better to focus on what was real, what he knew for certain. And right now, all that mattered was the empty room at the end of this corridor, a silent testament to his failure."
