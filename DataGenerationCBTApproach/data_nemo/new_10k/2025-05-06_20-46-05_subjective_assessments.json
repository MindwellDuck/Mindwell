He was beat, muscles aching from the constant rush of the ER. The last thing he needed was this bullshit.\n\nHis mind flashed back to the note again. *We need some space.* Not, \"*I* need some space.\" As if they were a fucking unit now. He snorted, shaking his head. \"Like hell I'm giving you that.\"\n\nHe grabbed his phone, thumbs hovering over the screen. Should he text? Call? Ask what the fuck was going on? Nah, screw it. He tossed the phone aside, flopping back against the cushions.\n\nHis partner had been acting weird for weeks now. Always busy, always distant. And now this? *Space.* Like they were some goddamn roommates who needed to renegotiate their lease or something. Not a couple. Not after all this time.\n\nHe stormed into the kitchen, yanking open the fridge door. The light illuminated his grimace. It was tidy, sure. But it was also empty. No leftovers, no takeout containers, no sign of life except for that fucking note. He slammed the door shut, leaning against it.\n\n\"You know what?\" he said to the empty room, \"I don't need this shit. I don't need you.\" His jaw clenched, eyes fixed on the crumpled note across the room. It was just paper, right? Just words. Didn't mean anything. Not really."

You've always been somewhat of an introvert, but recently, your anxiety has been worsening. Today, as you prepare for class, you notice something peculiar on the floor near your desk.\n\n**Mr. Thompson's Perspective:**\n\nMy hands trembled slightly as I picked up the envelope, its yellowed paper rustling like dry leaves beneath my touch. It was addressed to no one, just slipped under my classroom door, unnoticed until now. My heart pounded in my chest, a drumbeat of unease.\n\nI unfolded it carefully, revealing a photograph of her - Emily, my late wife. Her smile, so full of life and warmth, seemed to mock me now, crossed out in harsh red marker. It was like a scarlet letter, accusing, angry. My stomach churned as I stared at it, unable to look away.\n\nI couldn't help but think, *Why her? Why Emily?* This had to be about me, didn't it? A message meant for my eyes alone. But who could have done this? And why? The possibilities swirled in my mind like a storm, each one more unsettling than the last. I felt a flush of anger mixed with fear. This was my space, my sanctuary. How dare they invade it like this?\n\nI clutched the photograph tightly, feeling its edges dig into my palm. It was as if everyone around me had paused, waiting for my reaction. The clock ticked loudly, each second echoing like a gunshot in the sudden silence. I couldn't shake the feeling that every eye was on me, judging, waiting.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. But it was no use. This wasn't just some harmless prank. No, this was personal. It had to be. And I would find out who did this, make them understand they couldn't just... just *hurt* me like this. Not again. Never again.\n\nI folded the photograph back into its envelope, tucking it away in my desk drawer. As I turned to face the classroom, ready for another day of teaching, I felt a resolve hardening within me. This was my world, and no one was going to upset it without consequence. Not even Emily's ghost."
