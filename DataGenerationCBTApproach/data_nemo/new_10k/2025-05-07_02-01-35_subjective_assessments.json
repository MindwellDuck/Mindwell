I mean, look at her, rushing around like a headless chicken. She barely even said hello today.\"\n\nHe sat down at his usual table by the window, his eyes still on Maria as she bustled behind the counter. \"She's probably been complaining about me to the other regulars. They all think I'm some grumpy old man now.\"\n\nHe unwrapped his sandwich, but his appetite had waned. \"Maybe I should just find another place for lunch. Somewhere they appreciate my business.\" He sighed, taking a sip of his coffee, still fuming over Maria's apparent slight."
