It seems they're always glued to their phones, laughing it up while they run roughshod over decent folk. You'd think they'd learn some manners, but no, that's asking too much. It was the same thing at the post office yesterday. Some young whippersnapper, barely out of diapers, comes strolling up behind me, cackling about God knows what on his blasted phone. Then, *wouldn't you know it*, he takes a step back and crushes my foot like I'm some sort of doormat. And how does he react? With an apology? A sheepish grin? No, not this entitled little brat. He just laughs it off like it's the funniest thing since sliced bread. You'd think they'd learn to respect their elders, but it seems they're all the same these days - selfish, disrespectful, and incapable of a lick of common courtesy. I mean, *heaven forbid* they should ever have to consider anyone else's feelings or comfort. It's always about them, isn't it?"
