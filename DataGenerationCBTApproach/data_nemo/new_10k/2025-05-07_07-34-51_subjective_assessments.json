The ink on his divorce papers was barely dry, and already he felt that familiar frustration clawing at him.

The coffee stain spread like an inkblot test across my notes, obscuring the very figures I'd spent hours poring over. I could almost hear the mocking laughter of those errant data points as they refused to align with my projections.\n\nI grabbed a pen and began circling the offenders, one by one. \"You,\" I said, jabbing at a particularly recalcitrant point, \"you're the reason I'm up till midnight again.\" As if on cue, the clock chimed the late hour, echoing my sentiment perfectly.\n\nMy gaze flickered to the divorce papers tucked away in my desk drawer. I hadn't looked at them since signing, but their presence was a constant, gnawing reminder of every unsolved argument, every unresolved problem. And now here were these data points, refusing to behave, reminding me of nothing so much as... Well, never mind that.\n\nI took a deep breath and forced myself to step back, surveying the entire graph rather than just those few, infuriating points. But my eyes kept darting back to them, like magnets drawn to their poles. \"Fine,\" I said, pushing my chair back with a sigh. \"You win tonight. But tomorrow's another day.\"\n\nAs I turned off the lights and headed home, I couldn't shake the feeling that those data points were laughing at me still. Just a few points, I told myself. It's just a few points out of thousands. Yet somehow, they'd managed to consume my entire evening.\n\nBut no matter, I thought as I sank into bed. Tomorrow is another day. And tomorrow, I'll show them who's boss. One point at a time."

Not 'we need to improve this aspect' or 'let's discuss what went wrong.' Just a curt, dismissive order.\n\nHis fingers tightened around the mouse, knuckles turning white. He could almost hear their laughter echoing through the sterile walls of the office he'd never seen but had imagined in such vivid detail. They were probably laughing at him right now, the idiot who couldn't get anything right. His wife's words from last night echoed in his head, \"You're never going to be good enough...\" He shook his head, silencing her voice, but not before it had planted its seeds of doubt.\n\nHe hovered over the delete button for a moment, then clicked it with more force than necessary. There was no point dwelling on it. They'd made their decision, and clearly, they didn't want him to improve. They just wanted him to fail. He pushed his chair back, the screech against the floor punctuating his resolve. Fuck them all."

Mrs. Henderson had been by earlier, her eyes filled with sympathy, her hands bearing food he knew he wouldn't touch. The gesture seemed insincere now, a hollow attempt to fill the void his wife's passing had left behind.\n\nHe looked at the chair in the corner, still draped in dust and memories of her.
