Describe what goes through your mind and heart when you stumble upon an old voicemail from your ex while organizing your digital files.\n\n**Text:**\n\nI was sorting through my work files, the digital equivalent of cleaning out the attic. Years' worth of projects, scattered like forgotten memories on my screen. And then I saw it - a file named 'Unknown'. Curiosity piqued, I clicked.\n\nIt was a voicemail. From him. Two years old, dating back to when we were still... us. The timestamp seemed like a lifetime ago. I hesitated, finger hovering over the play button. Did I really want to hear his voice again?\n\nBut before I could think better of it, I hit play. His voice filled my small office, distant yet familiar, apologizing for something I couldn't quite recall. It was like hearing a stranger's voicemail, except it wasn't.\n\nA lump formed in my throat. My eyes welled up, betraying me. I missed him. Goddammit, I still missed him. After all this time, after everything we'd been through, how could I still feel like this?\n\nI let the emotion wash over me, drowning out logic, drowning out reason. This was real, wasn't it? The ache in my chest, the tears welling up - they had to mean something. They had to be telling me something.\n\nSo what if we were divorced now? So what if he'd hurt me, or I'd hurt him, or maybe both of us had just hurt each other by trying to make something work that wasn't meant to? This emotion, this pain, this... this longing, it was real. It had to be.\n\nI let the voicemail play again, listening to his words, his tone, his apology. I let myself believe in it, because right now, it felt like the most real thing I had."

Her stomach churned at the thought, and she felt a wave of stress roll over her like an ocean tide.\n\n\"Can't lose those memories,\" she whispered to herself, quickening her pace. The bus stop loomed ahead, but it might as well have been miles away. Every step felt heavy, laden with the weight of her emotions.\n\n\"It's just a notebook, right?\" she thought, trying to brush off the sensation. But her heart knew better. It was more than that - it was her past, her present, and her future all bound together in those worn-out pages. And if she couldn't feel its importance, what did that say about her? She pushed the thought away, focusing on the rhythm of her footsteps instead.\n\nAs the bus approached, she felt a surge of panic. What if it left without her? What if she was stuck here, stranded with her thoughts and fears? She could almost hear the driver's impatient honk, the doors closing in her face. Her heart pounded in her ears, echoing her anxiety.\n\nBut when the bus pulled up, it was smooth as silk. No horns, no impatience - just a warm smile from the driver. Mrs. Baker sighed, stepping aboard. As she found her seat, she looked out at the world outside, seeing it through her emotions once more. It was her reality, after all, shaped by how she felt about things. And today, that meant everything was a little bit stressful, a little bit lost. But tomorrow? Well, tomorrow was another day, another chance to find her way back home."

The radio squawked softly from its clip, but she silenced it, not wanting to disturb the peaceful scene. Her husband stood at the kitchen counter, his shoulders hunched as he rubbed at a stubborn stain on his hands. He didn't turn around when she entered, and that's when she noticed the faded bloodstains on his shirt, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary last year.\n\nHer heart sank like a stone in her chest. She'd seen enough blood to know it was old, dried. She stepped closer, her boots echoing softly on the tiled floor. He finally turned around, his eyes hollow and haunted, a stark contrast to his usually warm smile. In his hands, he held the shirt like an accusation, a silent testament to the life they'd taken yesterday.\n\n\"I couldn't bring myself to throw it out,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It's not your fault, you know that. We were just doing our job.\"\n\nBut she didn't feel like it was their job. Not today. Today, it felt personal, and the remorse sat heavy in her stomach, threatening to spill over. She took the shirt from him, folding it carefully before placing it in a bag meant for evidence. But this wasn't evidence. This was her reminder, her penance.\n\nShe looked at him then, really looked. The lines around his eyes were deeper than she remembered, and there was a weariness in his posture that spoke of more than just the physical labor of their jobs. She reached out, taking his hand in hers, offering what little comfort she could. But even as she did, she felt the weight of her own remorse, a silent companion that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day.",

Her partner, Mike, stood by the kitchen window, his reflection a ghostly figure against the dark glass.\n\nHe hadn't moved from that spot in hours, not since they'd pulled up to that godforsaken intersection. She could still see it, the crumpled metal, the shattered glass, and fuck, the blood. So much blood. It was like a fucking war zone out there today.\n\nShe crossed the room, her boots thudding heavily on the worn floorboards. Mike didn't turn around when she entered, just stood there, clutching that damn shirt in his hands. The one they'd both worn yesterday. The one that was now stained with someone else's life.\n\n\"Couldn't bring myself to throw it out,\" he muttered, his voice barely audible over the ticking clock. \"It's not your fault, you know.\"\n\nBut wasn't it? She looked at him then, really looked. He was a fucking mess. Dark circles hung under his eyes like bruises, and his shoulders were hunched like an old man's. And what about her? Was she any better? She'd seen the way those other paramedics looked at them today. The pity in their eyes, the whispered condolences. They were fucking failures, both of them.\n\nShe took the shirt from him, feeling the weight of it, the fucking shame of it. It wasn't like they hadn't lost patients before. But this...this was different. This felt personal. Like a goddamn punch to the gut that she couldn't fucking breathe through.\n\nShe looked at Mike again, his eyes haunted by demons only he could see. And she knew, right then, that no matter how hard they tried, they'd never be those paramedics everyone else looked up to. The ones who always pulled through, who always saved the day. They were just...fucking failures.\n\nShe crumpled the shirt in her hands, feeling the weight of it, the weight of them.
