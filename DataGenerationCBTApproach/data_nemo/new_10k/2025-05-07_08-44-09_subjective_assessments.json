It was our brand, the one we'd stockpiled together, laughing over its sale price. Now, it's just a grim reminder of what once was. I couldn't bring myself to cook with it today; it felt too hollow, too final.\n\nThe commute was worse than usual, traffic crawling along like a sluggish serpent.

He's probably planning to reprimand me later.\n\nAt lunch, I sat alone in the park, watching couples share sandwiches and laughter. Their happiness was a thorn in my side today. Even the weather seemed to conspire against me; the wind whipped around me, biting into my flesh like an angry dog.\n\nThe afternoon passed in a blur of numbers and reports.

Each mishap felt like another nail in the coffin of this wretched day.\n\nBy evening, I was exhausted, defeated. Dinner was an uninspired affair; I reheated leftover pizza, its greasy taste a poor substitute for home-cooked meals we used to share. As I sat watching TV alone, I realized how much my life has shrunk since he walked out that door.\n\nBut perhaps tomorrow will be better? No, why delude myself with such optimism?
