Her heart echoed the urgency in their tone, pounding relentlessly against her ribcage like a war drum.\n\nYet, amidst this maelstrom of details, she found herself fixating on one: the time since the child had last eaten. It was an innocuous detail, but it anchored her, became her North Star in this sea of uncertainty. She could almost see the clock ticking away those hours, each second a potential clue to the illness's origin.\n\nThe rest - the fear in the parent's voice, the helplessness of being miles away, the guilt at not being able to physically comfort either child or parent - it all blurred into a indistinct haze. It was just her and that time gap, an unbridgeable chasm separating her from the truth she needed.\n\nHer pen scratched out notes, each detail meticulously recorded, yet her mind refused to see them as part of a larger whole. She was like a painter with a single brushstroke, incapable of stepping back to appreciate the masterpiece. Instead, she leaned in closer, her vision tunneling until all she could see was that one stark detail, glowing like neon against the backdrop of her despair.\n\nAs she hung up the phone, her heart heavy with the weight of distance and uncertainty, she didn't realize she had fallen into the familiar trap of her mind. The mental filter was doing its work, blocking out the bigger picture, reducing it all to one stark detail. It wasn't malice or ignorance; it was simply Dr. Hartley's way, a cognitive pattern worn smooth by years of practice and now as much a part of her as her surgical gloves were once upon a time."
