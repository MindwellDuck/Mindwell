I couldn't help but think of Nurse Linda, who had been offered that prestigious position at the city hospital. She probably wasn't standing here in the dead of night, her heart aching for a patient she barely knew.\n\nI felt a pang of resentment as I recalled Nurse Linda's gleaming whites and perfectly coiffed hair, even after her late shifts. Here I was, my uniform crumpled from hours of back-to-back patients, my hair escaping its once-neat bun. It wasn't fair that Linda had been chosen, not when she didn't need the extra challenge like I did. I sighed, pushing away the thought as I took Mrs. Thompson's cold hand in mine. This wasn't about me; it was about her. But the comparison lingered, a bitter taste at the back of my throat."

It was taken on our last holiday before illness began its insidious creep into our lives, robbing us of so much joy.\n\nAs I traced her face with a trembling finger, the familiar ache swelled in my chest, unexpected and overwhelming.

Never again will I know such joy, such completeness. It's as if the sun has set for good, leaving me in eternal twilight."
