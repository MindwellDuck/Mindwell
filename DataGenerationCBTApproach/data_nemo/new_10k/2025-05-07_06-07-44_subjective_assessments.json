His partner, unseen but felt in their shared home, had left a worn notebook open on his desk - a collection of memories from their late son's childhood. A faded photograph marked today's page: their boy, laughing, at a beach they'd visited years ago. He traced the image with a trembling finger, sorrow welling up as he remembered that long-forgotten joy.",

The beach, the sun, his laughter - it all seems like a dream now. How could things have been so different then? He was always smiling, always happy. I can't believe how much has changed since that day. It's like a dark cloud has taken over our lives ever since. This pain, this sadness, it must be the truth now. There's no room for happiness anymore, not after what we've lost. I can't imagine feeling anything else but this heavy sorrow."

I've seen that look before.* The same one her uncle had when he'd cornered her in the basement all those years ago. She shivered, trying to push away the memories that threatened to surface.\n\n*This is it,* she thought, panic clawing at her throat. *He's going to make his move now, with no witnesses.* She could feel it, like a tangible thing pressing against her skin. *Why else would he be here?* He'd timed it perfectly, hadn't he? The lights flickering, the power going out... it was all too convenient.\n\n*I have to get out,* she thought, her fingers trembling as she tried again to call for help. *I can't just stand here and wait.* But there was nowhere to go, no escape from this tiny, dark box. She was trapped, completely at his mercy.\n\n*This is all my fault,* she thought, tears pricking her eyes. *If only I'd taken the stairs today. If only I hadn't worn these heels that slowed me down.* She could have been safe in her office right now, instead of here, with him. Her breath hitched in her throat as she braced herself for what was inevitably coming.\n\nShe didn't notice when the lights flickered back on, or when the stranger stepped out on his floor without so much as a glance at her. She was too lost in her own world, her conclusions already drawn."

As the first pour hits the stainless steel, I can't help but wonder, \"What if I'd been able to enjoy this with Sarah? She'd have loved it.\" My grip tightens around the neck of the bottle as images of her laughter, her smile, flash through my mind. But she's not here, and neither am I, really. Not after today. Another pour, another question. \"What if they'd waited till tomorrow to give this? What a waste.\" The red liquid swirls down the drain, swallowed by the humming pipes, much like my thoughts are swallowed by the night's endless what-ifs. Each splash echoes with a quiet desperation, each question mark hanging heavy in the air, unanswered, unwanted. But I can't stop them. They tumble out, one after another, like the wine disappearing down the drain. \"What if they'd asked first? What if I'd said yes?\" My heart aches with a hollow longing, echoing the emptiness of the bottle now resting its head in the recycling bin. I turn off the tap, leaving only the hum of the fluorescent lights to fill the silence. The what-ifs linger, their shadows stretching out across the empty kitchen, as inescapable as the fatigue that grips my bones. But there's no use dwelling on them. Tomorrow is another shift, another chance for what ifs. And until then, I'm just too tired to care."
