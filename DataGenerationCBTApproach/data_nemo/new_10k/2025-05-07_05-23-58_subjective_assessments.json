She knelt down, fingers brushing against jagged shards, but all she could see was that goddamn notification glowing at her like an accusation.\n\n\"Hey, you okay?\" Sam asked, their voice cutting through the fog in her head. She looked up, blinked away the tears threatening to spill over.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she lied, scooping up the shattered remains of what had once been a plate. \"Just clumsy today.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just about the plate. It was that fucking message, another goddamn reminder of his silence. She couldn't see past it, didn't want to. The kitchen could burn down around her and she'd still be stuck on that one unread notification.\n\nShe stood up, dumped the broken pieces in the trash, and reached for another plate. Her hands moved automatically, arranging the food with practiced precision while her mind remained locked onto that single, crushing detail. The whole world could wait; right now, all she cared about was that goddamn message."
