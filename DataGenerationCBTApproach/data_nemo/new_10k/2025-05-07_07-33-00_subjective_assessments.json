While I understand that the purpose was to celebrate the life of our late alumnus, Mr. Thompson, I must express my astonishment and offense at the glaring omission of his wife's substantial accomplishments.\n\nAs a former colleague of Mrs. Thompson, I knew her not only as a devoted spouse but also as an accomplished professional in her own right. Her contributions to our field were significant, yet they are nowhere to be found in this piece. Instead, we are left with the impression that Mr. Thompson was solely responsible for their shared success.\n\nI am appalled at the injustice done to Mrs. Thompson's memory and legacy. It is as if her light has been deliberately dimmed, while his burns brighter than ever. This is not the standard of journalism I expect from our alma mater. Frankly, it is an insult to all those who knew and respected both Thompsons equally.\n\nI demand that you rectify this error in judgment by publishing a proper tribute to Mrs. Thompson, one that acknowledges her contributions alongside her husband's. Anything less would be a disservice not only to her but also to the integrity of our institution.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
