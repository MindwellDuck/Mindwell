There, nestled among the usual mundane emails, was one from Thompson - my least favorite colleague. The subject line alone made my chest tighten: \"Revisions to Your Code.\" I could feel the familiar heat beginning to rise, like a slow-burning flame, as I clicked it open.\n\nEach of his suggestions seemed more ridiculous than the last, a relentless assault on my professional judgment. I could see it now - him sitting there, smug smile on his face, thinking he'd caught me out again. As if I didn't know what I was doing. As if I wasn't already drowning in this project, fighting to keep my head above water.\n\nI gripped the mouse tighter, my knuckles turning white, as if by sheer force I could make him unsee his words. My thoughts were a whirlwind of negativity, each one feeding into the next like some twisted echo chamber. This was just another example of his constant undermining, wasn't it? Always looking for ways to prove me wrong.\n\nI typed out my response, each word a bullet fired in anger. I didn't bother to proofread, to check if there was any warmth left in my tone. Why should I? He'd never understand anyway. It's not like he could appreciate the effort I put into this project. No, all he saw were flaws, weaknesses to exploit.\n\nAs I sent off the email, I leaned back in my chair, breath ragged, heart pounding. This was just another day at the office, wasn't it? Just another battle won against the endless tide of negativity that seemed to follow me around like a shadow. But isn't that what work is? A constant struggle against the tide? At least, that's what it feels like for me today."

The vibrancy we mixed together, now faded like an old Polaroid. And that brush... *Jesus*, Jack's laugh rings in my ears as if he's standing right here. But he's not. He fucking left me with half a painting and a goddamn paintbrush still in its wrapper.\n\n*I can't even start without him.* I look at his brush, then at mine - it's worn out, used up, like me. His was barely touched, pristine... waiting for him to pick it up again. But he won't. He fucking *won't*.\n\nIt's not fair. None of this is fair.
