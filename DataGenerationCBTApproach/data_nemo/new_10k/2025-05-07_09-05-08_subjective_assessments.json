        "Triggering Event": "A woman in her forties, a nurse by profession, sits alone in her kitchen after a long shift at the hospital. Her partner's half-eaten dinner still on the table, she idly pushes it aside with a sigh. She looks around at the dishes stacked in the sink, the empty wine bottle by the recycling bin. The house feels quieter than usual, heavier. She checks her phone - no messages from him since this morning's brief \"I'll be late\" text. She turns off the lights and goes to bed alone, the weight of unhappiness settling over her like a familiar, heavy blanket.",

Describe your thoughts and actions as you enter your kitchen and prepare to retire for the night.\n\n**Text Example:**\n\nAs I stepped into our kitchen, the silence was almost palpable, broken only by the ticking of the old clock hanging on the wall. The remnants of his dinner still graced the table, a stark reminder of his absence. I pushed the plate aside with more force than necessary, sighing heavily as I did so.\n\nMy eyes darted around the room, taking in the disorder: dishes piled high in the sink, an empty wine bottle by the recycling bin, crumbs scattered across the countertops like tiny, rebellious stars. It was as if the very house reflected my mood, heavy and forlorn, a faithful mirror to my inner turmoil.\n\nI picked up my phone, its screen still dark from disuse since he had texted me that morning. No new messages awaited me, not even a stray emoji to signal his presence in this digital world we now inhabit. The weight of unhappiness settled over me like an old, familiar blanket, one I seemed destined to wear for the rest of my nights.\n\nWith stiff fingers, I turned off the kitchen lights, plunging the room into darkness. As I made my way upstairs to our bedroom, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was profoundly wrong. My heart ached, not just from the long hours on my feet at the hospital, but from the emptiness of this house, the silence of his absence. It felt like proof positive that our relationship was crumbling, that we were drifting apart. After all, if he truly cared, wouldn't he be here? Wouldn't he reach out, even just a little?\n\nI slipped into bed, my body already yearning for sleep, but my mind refused to quiet down. It whispered harsh truths in the darkness, truths I didn't want to hear, didn't want to believe. But how could I deny them when they felt so real, so true? After all, I was feeling this way, wasn't I? And if anyone knew what was happening between us, it should be me."

She wasn't in bed. *She must be in the kitchen,* I thought. *She'll be waiting for me.* Her eyes will flash with anger, her hands clenched around... what?\n\n*Sunday.* I woke up alone. The house was empty. No note, no sign she'd been there at all. Just that damn mug, sitting on the counter like a grenade with its pin pulled. *She'll be back,* I told myself. *She always comes back.* But what if this time...? What if this time is different?\n\n*I can't do this anymore,* I thought. *I can't keep living like this.* But how can I stop it? How can I make her see that it's not just about the mug?
