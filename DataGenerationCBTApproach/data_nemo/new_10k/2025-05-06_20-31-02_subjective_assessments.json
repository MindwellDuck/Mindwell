She placed her nursing cap gently on the table, the once pristine white now dulled by time and use. As she undressed, she noticed a faint bloodstain on her scrubs, unseen in the chaos of the ER. She sank onto the bed, holding the soiled fabric to her face, tears silently tracing down her cheeks. Another life lost tonight, another family shattered. The weight of hopelessness settled heavy on her chest, as if her uniform was a leaden armor she could not shed.",

I suppose some might call it a charming scene, but really, what's so delightful about watching others enjoy life while you're left with nothing but echoes? It wasn't as if I was envious, heavens no. After all, their happiness was fleeting, theirs was just noise, and mine... mine was substance. Yes, that was it. My loneliness wasn't something to be pitied; it was a testament to my depth of character, my quiet nobility. It certainly wasn't because I was alone, again."

The restaurant, our sanctuary for over a decade, was closing. It felt like a part of me was being taken away, a silent amputation. I could almost hear the laughter echoing in the empty walls, see the faces of friends we'd lost touch with after they moved away, their lives now strangers to mine.\n\nThe tomato on my desk seemed to mock me with its vibrancy, a stark contrast to the gloom that had settled within me. I picked up the knife, its handle cool and familiar in my palm. With unnecessary force, I sliced into it, hatred for its cheerful red daring to exist while our beloved restaurant couldn't. Each stroke was a testament to my despair, each tear that fell onto the cutting board a silent protest against this unfair turn of events.\n\nI believed the tomato deserved such treatment, just as I believed in the injustice of it all. My emotions were my compass, guiding me through this desolate landscape, and they told me, loud and clear, that life was cruel today."

This wasn't just about her art; it was about her life's work, her goddamn legacy.\n\nShe could see it now, clear as day - the gallery owners sitting around some pretentious coffee table, laughing at her paintings. \"Who would want to look at that old woman's scribbles?\" she imagined them sneering. *Bastards*, she thought, *they're just jealous of my talent*.\n\nShe stood up abruptly, knocking over a half-finished cup of tea.
