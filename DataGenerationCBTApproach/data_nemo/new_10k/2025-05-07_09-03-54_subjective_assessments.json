As she listened to his steady breath, rhythmic and peaceful, she felt her own heart pounding like a drum in her chest, echoing the chaos outside their door. She couldn't help but wonder if he'd ever felt this way, if he'd ever struggled to find calm even amidst the storm of paperwork after a long night's patrol. But then again, why would he?
