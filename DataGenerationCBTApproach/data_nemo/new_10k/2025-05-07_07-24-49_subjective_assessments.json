You've been practicing medicine for over two decades, but today, an unexpected visitor from your past has left you unsettled.\n\n**Text:**\n\nDr. Amelia Hart,\nI stood there, looking at Mr. Thompson, his once-vibrant eyes now dull and filled with what I could only perceive as silent accusation. I felt a pang of guilt, remembering that referral I'd neglected to make years ago. But really, who was to say it would have made any difference? People change, circumstances alter; there's no predicting how things might've turned out.\n\nYet, here he was, wheelchair-bound and alone in my clinic after all these years. I couldn't help but feel a surge of anger, though not at him, but at the situation. It was as if I could see it now, clear as day - his condition worsening, his life spiraling downwards, all because of that one referral I didn't make.\n\nI knew better than to predict such grim futures. But there it was, playing out in my mind's eye like some tragic movie scene. The thought of him suffering further, of his life becoming even more miserable, made me feel sick to my stomach. It was almost too much to bear. But I had to bear it, didn't I? Because that's what doctors do. They face the worst-case scenarios head-on, even when they'd rather not.\n\nBut really, who could blame me for feeling this way? After all, it wasn't as if I hadn't seen enough tragedy in my years of practice. And maybe, just maybe, this was one more tragedy that could've been avoided had I made that referral. So there it was, plain and simple - cause and effect, all laid out before me like a grim roadmap to the future.\n\nAnd yet, despite it all, despite the anger, the guilt, the prediction of doom, I did what I always do. I stepped forward, put on my most professional face, and said, \"Mr. Thompson, let's see how we can make things better for you today.\" Because that's who I am. That's what I do. And no amount of fortune-telling will ever change that."
