His once bustling restaurant now lay dormant, a casualty of the pandemic's relentless march. As he reached for an old, tattered cookbook, his fingers traced over the well-worn pages until they landed on a recipe he knew by heart: Coq au Vin.

What if the taste of failure lingered in every bite, like the bitterness of the wine he'd used to marinate the chicken? What if this silence, this emptiness, was all there was now? His breath hitched, and he wondered if the chicken would even cook properly without her there to watch the stove. He shook his head, trying to dislodge the thoughts that clung like barnacles, but they only multiplied in the quiet."
