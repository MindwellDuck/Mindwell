Their gentle smiles and entwined hands sent a pang through his heart. It had been three months since Jane's passing, but every tender moment he witnessed still felt like a knife twisting in his gut. He turned away, his coffee untouched, retreat ing to the solitude of his office where her picture remained, as always, facing him on his desk.",

There they sit, that old couple, hands clasped, smiles soft and content. It's been three months since Jane left me alone in this cold world. Three months of silence, of echoes, of her empty side of the bed. And here they are, still together, still happy.\n\nI can't help but stare, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. Why do they get to keep their love, while mine was taken away so cruelly? It's not fair. They don't know how good they have it. They don't understand what it's like to lose everything.\n\nMy hands shake as I set down the untouched coffee, the warmth of it doing nothing to thaw the ice that's taken root in my chest. I can't stay here, not with them, not with their happiness mocking me. I turn away, eyes burning with unshed tears, and retreat to my office, Jane's picture watching me, always watching me. It's just another reminder of what I don't have, of what I've lost. Why is everyone else still so happy when my world has fallen apart?"

Divorce had taken its toll, and the emptiness of his apartment was a constant ache. Tonight, he stood in front of his stove, stirring a pot of his signature tomato soup. As he lifted the spoon to taste, it slipped from his grip, clattering into the pot. He watched it sink, feeling an overwhelming sense of despair as if the spoon were a metaphor for everything he'd once held tightly but had since slipped away.",

The rest of the world blurred - the chirping birds, the warm evening breeze, even my partner's reassuring hand on my back. All I could see, all I could feel, was that damn entrance looming closer and closer. It was like a monster ready to consume me, oblivious to the fact that we were walking under the soft glow of streetlamps or that the scent of flowers from nearby gardens filled the air. There was only the hospital, its entrance, and my paralyzing fear.\""
