The radio squawked like a cranky old parrot, spitting out call after call - *as if there weren't enough already!* It seemed every officer in the city was needed elsewhere, while I was stuck playing cat burglar at a school.\n\nI mean, really, what's a girl to do when faced with such... *inequality*? Here I am, slogging through the night, and there they are, gallivanting around town like some sort of high-stakes game of whack-a-mole. It's not fair, is it? Not that life has ever been about fairness.\n\nBut still, one can't help but feel... *small*, I suppose. Like a tiny little cog in this great big machine, turning and turning while everyone else gets to play with the shiny new toys. *Sigh.* The life of a beat cop - always on call, never enough hands, always comparing myself to those who seem to have it better.\n\nBut no use crying over spilled milk, or in my case, over the endless sea of paperwork that awaits me back at the station. Time to saddle up and ride again, old girl. After all, duty calls - even if it doesn't quite whisper my name as sweetly as it does for some others. *Tch.*"
