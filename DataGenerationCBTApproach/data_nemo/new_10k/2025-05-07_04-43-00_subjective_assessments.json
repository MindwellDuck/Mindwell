A young woman, barely out of her teens, approaches her with a smile, holding up a charm bracelet. \"This was my grandmother's,\" she says, her eyes sparkling. \"I want to give it to my mom for Mother's Day.\" The old woman smiles back, but feels a pang in her chest as she remembers the bracelet her own mother wore, now gathering dust in a drawer at home. She helps the girl wrap the bracelet carefully, fighting back tears as she hands it over, saying softly, \"I'm sure your mom will love it.\"",

A long one. One where you explain to me how it is that your company has been throwing money at a charity that's been playing fast and loose with its funds. And don't even get me started on the embezzlement part.\n\nI expect answers, [Sister's Name]. I expect them now.
