She knew he wouldn't notice for days, but it still stung. Years of his careless spending, his disregard for her hard-earned savings from the store, bubbled up inside her like a bitter brew. This time, she'd had enough. As she watched him laugh with their grandchildren, oblivious to the theft, she felt it: a cold, calculated vengeance stirring within her. She would make him notice, make him feel the pinch he'd caused her for so long.",

He began straightening shelves, his hands moving automatically while his mind wandered. An old, dusty toy car caught his eye, a reminder of his childhood when life seemed simpler. He picked it up, running his thumb over its smooth surface, before gently placing it back on the shelf. As he turned off the lights and stepped out into the empty parking lot, a chill wind blew, carrying with it the faintest hint of rain. It reminded him of nights spent alone in his apartment, listening to the patter against his window, wishing for someone to share it with.

She'd complain, sure, but she knew it was for us, for our future. Or so I thought. Now it's like those late nights were just more chances for her to notice how much better he was than me. How successful, how charming.\n\nI'm not saying I've been perfect. Far from it. But this... this isn't the kind of imperfection that gets brushed under the rug. This is a gaping wound, and she's choosing to walk away from it. From us.\n\nAnd here I am, still in my lab coat, still dedicated to our life together. Still waiting for her to see that maybe, just maybe, there's something worth salvaging in all these stains. But now I'm not so sure. Maybe I've been overestimating myself, underestimating him.
