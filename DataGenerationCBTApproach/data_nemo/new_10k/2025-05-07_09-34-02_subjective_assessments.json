No note greeted me on the kitchen counter, as I had hoped. Instead, it was bare, mocking my solitude. A knot formed in my stomach as I realized that once again, I would be dining alone.\n\nI couldn't help but think of the lively evenings I'd seen through my window - laughter echoing from their apartment, the scent of cooking wafting over, and the warmth of companionship spilling onto their balcony. It seemed like everyone else had someone to share a meal with, except for me.\n\nThe microwave hummed its solitary tune as I heated up my dinner, the sound echoing in the silence. I tried to shake off the feeling, but it lingered like the bitter taste of unsweetened tea. Why was it so easy for them and so hard for me? Was there something wrong with me that made others unwilling to extend an invitation?\n\nI stabbed at my food, punctuating each bite with a new grievance. It wasn't fair. They had each other, while I had... this. This quiet desperation for companionship. This sense of being left out, forgotten, or worse, unwanted.\n\nAs I sat there, in the harsh glow of the kitchen lights, I felt like a ship adrift at sea, watching others safely harbored in their cozy ports. It was maddening. I tossed my fork onto the plate with a clatter and stormed off to my bedroom, leaving the dinner untouched. Another night alone, another reminder that perhaps I wasn't worth inviting after all."

The harsh fluorescent lights above flickered, casting long, stark shadows that seemed to mock me. \"This isn't how it should be,\" I thought, gripping the chart tighter. A patient admitted at this hour, no family listed? It was unconscionable. I had seen too many lonely souls slip away in silence, and I wasn't going to let another one fade into obscurity without a fight.\n\nThe room was dimly lit, the air filled with the familiar hiss of an oxygen mask. The patient lay there, eyes closed, breaths shallow but steady. I approached, my heart pounding against my ribs like a drum call to arms. \"This isn't right,\" I muttered under my breath, more to myself than anyone else. Patients shouldn't be alone in their struggle. Families should be by their side, offering comfort, hope. But here we were, another lonely battle waged on sterile sheets and cold machines.\n\nI hung the chart at the foot of the bed, steeling myself for what was to come. This wasn't how it should be, but dammit, I'd make sure it was as close to 'right' as I could manage. It's not much, but it's something. And in this godforsaken hour, it has to be enough."
