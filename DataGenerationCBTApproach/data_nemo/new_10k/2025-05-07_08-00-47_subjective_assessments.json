He stood over her, hands on his hips, eyes scanning the room for clues. The lamp on her side of the bed was still on, a book facedown on the pillow beside her. \"She couldn't even be bothered to turn it off,\" he muttered, his voice barely audible over the ticking clock. His mind raced, filling in the blanks of what must have been going through her head as she fell asleep: *He's always so inconsiderate, leaving me up like this... He just doesn't care about my sleep.* He shook his head, his jaw tight, as he reached over to turn off the lamp. \"Typical,\" he whispered, bitterness seeping into his voice."

Coffee was instant, again, because who has time for that fancy grind-shit-brew nonsense? Tasted like shit too, but hey, at least it's got caffeine, right?\n\nThe drive to work was a fucking joyride through Potholeville, Population: Me. Car suspension's shot to hell, and the roads here are worse than my ex-wife's cooking. Spent half an hour dodging craters while she spent her Saturday nights with... him.\n\nSpeaking of which, you won't believe what I saw this morning. No, really, you fucking won't. Pulled up to the old house - our house, remember? The one I built with my own two hands, before she tore it all down like a goddamn wrecking ball - and there it was: her car parked out front, like a fucking beacon of betrayal.\n\nAnd you know what was stuck in the yard? A big ol' \"Sold\" sign. Yellow, like the fucking sunshine they're probably basking in over there. Fuckers bought our home, my childhood home, and now they're living in it. Little family, probably got a fucking dog too, running around like they own the place.\n\nI gripped the wheel so tight I thought it might snap off.

Another slow day, another empty cash register. He glanced at his watch; 15 minutes until closing time. His stomach churned as he thought about the pile of unpaid bills waiting for him at home. His wife had called earlier, her voice strained, saying she was running late again due to traffic. He could hear the kids crying in the background. Another night of takeout and no one to tuck them in.\n\nThe fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting harsh shadows on his tired face as he began closing procedures. The silence of the empty store was deafening, echoing his own sense of failure. He paused by the sale rack, picking up a shirt he'd helped his wife pick out weeks ago. It still had the tag on it, untouched. He sighed, placing it back with care.\n\nAs he locked the door behind him, he noticed a missed call from his mother-in-law. She hadn't left a message, but he knew what it meant. Another ' Concerned' conversation about money and family duty loomed over him like a dark cloud.

She took another sip, welcoming the warmth that spread through her as it chased away the chill of uncertainty.\n\nMaybe tomorrow would be different. Maybe he'd walk through the door with a bouquet of flowers and an apology on his lips. Or maybe she'd wake up to find him gone for good, leaving behind nothing but echoes of what once was.
