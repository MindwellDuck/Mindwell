Today, I discovered a used syringe lying in my locker. This is not an isolated incident; it appears this has become a regular occurrence.\n\nI must emphasize that this behavior is wholly unacceptable and puts all of us at risk. It seems like no one cares about maintaining a clean and safe working environment. The entire team needs to take responsibility for their actions, or else we'll continue to face these kinds of issues.\n\nIn the future, I expect everyone to adhere strictly to our sharps disposal guidelines. I should not have to remind you all that this is a matter of professional integrity and patient safety. Let's strive for a \"zero tolerance\" policy on such matters.\n\nI await your cooperation in ensuring we maintain high standards in our workplace.\n\nSincerely,\n[Male Nurse]"
