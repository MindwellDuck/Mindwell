What if he's not just late, but incompetent? What if his tardiness is a harbinger of worse things to come?\n\nThe streets blurred before me as I stepped outside, each passing car a potential ambulance rushing to some unseen disaster. My mind was a whirlwind of 'what ifs', each one darker and more ominous than the last. What if today's delay is just the beginning?
