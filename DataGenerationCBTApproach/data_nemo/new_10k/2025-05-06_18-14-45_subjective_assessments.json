Each detail pricked at my consciousness like a thousand needles, demanding my undivided attention.\n\nMy hands trembled as they gripped the cold steel of my service revolver. The world around me seemed to fade into obscurity, my senses honed in on the dreadful scene unfolding before me. I stepped into the car's interior, the darkness enveloping me like a shroud. All I could see were those few telling details, all else washed away by the tide of fear that threatened to consume me.\n\nI couldn't hear the distant sirens of backup approaching, couldn't feel the cool droplets of rain beginning to fall, couldn't smell anything but the lingering scent of fear within the car's interior.
