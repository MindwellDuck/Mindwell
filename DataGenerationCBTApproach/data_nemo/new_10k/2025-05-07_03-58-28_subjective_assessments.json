So when I saw him today - Tom, my former colleague's husband - laughing with that new woman from down the hall, it just... confirmed what I've always known about myself.\n\nI'm not one of those people who can just light up a room like he does. I'm more like the shadows, you know? The kind that lurk in corners, unnoticed and uninvited. Even when I try to join in, it's like my words are too heavy, too awkward. They just sit there, drowning in the silence.\n\nIt's not his fault, really. Tom doesn't know about my past failures, my struggles with connections. He's just one of those naturally charismatic people who can make anyone feel special. It's like a superpower he has, but it only serves to highlight what I'm not: charming, witty, or even remotely interesting.\n\nSo here I am, back in my room after another lonely lunch, my reflection staring back at me from the window. \"You're just not one of those people,\" I tell myself.
