Another subtle dig at her long hours at the store, her exhaustion each evening.

'Hello?' I say, louder this time, as if volume could pierce through the haze of his absorption. But no, he remains ensconced in his digital world, fingers dancing on the keyboard with a rhythm that mocks the silence he's ignoring.\n\nI drop my bag by the door, toe off my shoes, each action a heavy punctuation mark in this quiet conversation we're not having. My gaze falls upon his laptop screen, that infernal portal to realms unknown but apparently more captivating than reality. And there it is, the email from HR, its subject line a cruel tease - 'Your Application Status'.\n\nMy heart pounds in my chest, a drumbeat of anticipation and dread. I step closer, leaning over him to see the words that will determine my worth. They stare back at me, cold and unyielding: 'We regret to inform you...'\n\nHe looks up then, finally deigns to acknowledge my presence. His eyes flicker briefly towards the screen, taking in the rejection with all the warmth of an automaton. 'Didn't get it, huh?' he says, before turning back to his computer, dismissing me as easily as he dismissed my efforts.\n\nHumiliation surges within me like a tide, burning my cheeks, stinging my eyes. I feel it, that familiar refrain: *This doesn't count. You didn't succeed, so nothing you've done matters.* It's there, always there, whispering in the back of my mind, disqualifying every triumph, every moment of pride. And yet, I'm powerless to silence it. It's a part of me now, this insidious voice that feeds on failure and spits out truth twisted beyond recognition.\n\nBut today... today was supposed to be different. Today was supposed to prove something. To him. To me. But here we are, back where we started. Back in the realm of 'not good enough'. And I'm left standing alone, keys still clutched tightly, as if they could unlock anything worth having.\""
