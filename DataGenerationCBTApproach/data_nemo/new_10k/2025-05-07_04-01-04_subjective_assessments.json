The sobs of the young sous-chef echoed from the office nearby, a stark reminder of his own despair after last week's service meltdown. As he reached for another onion, his hand brushed against the empty ring on his left hand. He paused, gazing at the vacant space where his wedding band once was. The knife slipped, nicking his thumb. Blood pooled in the crease of his palm, dripping onto the cutting board, mingling with the diced vegetables. He sighed, hopelessly watching the red streaks marring the pristine white surface.",
