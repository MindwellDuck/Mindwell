He'd been at this for decades, but today was different. Today, he'd snapped at a young customer who'd innocently asked if they could return an item bought just yesterday. The man hadn't meant to bark like that; he was usually patient with the younger generation. But lately, every little thing seemed to set him off. As he turned off the lights and locked up for the night, he couldn't shake the feeling of guilt gnawing at him. He knew his partner would have something to say about it when he got home.",

Her heart twisted as she passed by, but she shrugged it off. \"It's just a painting,\" she muttered under her breath, quickening her pace. She'd made art back then, yeah, but that was before everything went to hell. Before she fucked up so bad. That vibrant, bold piece wasn't love anymore; it was a goddamn reminder of how much she'd screwed up. And she sure as hell didn't need that."

The overhead lights flickered softly, casting long shadows over the rows of desks, each one a stark reminder of an absent occupant. My eyes fell upon the exam papers scattered across my desk like fallen leaves - blank faces staring back at me, accusing.\n\nNot a single student had stayed behind to discuss their failures, as I'd hoped they would. The disappointment was profound, a quiet gnawing in the pit of my stomach. It seemed that all my efforts had been for naught. They hadn't understood, hadn't tried hard enough. Or perhaps, they didn't care.\n\nI picked up a paper at random, its blankness almost mocking me. I could see it now, clear as day - tomorrow's headlines: \"Teacher's Students Fail Exam.\" The parents' disapproval, the principal's stern gaze, all because none of them had stayed to discuss their shortcomings. It was all falling apart.\n\nYet, there were no signs of struggle on these papers, no crossed-out answers or frantic scribbles. Perhaps they hadn't even tried? No, that couldn't be right. They were good kids. But then why... why hadn't they stayed?\n\nThe silence grew heavier, the shadows longer. I felt a pang of despair, a sense of failure gnawing at me. It was all so clear now - tomorrow's disaster, next week's scandal, all because tonight's classroom lay empty and silent."

It's not like there's some middle ground here, some happy medium where the lights flicker once or twice before deciding whether to stay on or not. No, no, we can't have that. It's either complete chaos with this sudden blackout, or everything's running smoothly. There's no in-between.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the silence. The hum of the refrigerator was my lifeline, my connection to reality. Now it's gone, and I'm left with... nothing. No, not nothing. Worse than nothing. Memories. Ugly, unwanted memories of those wartime nights when the power would go out for good, not just a few minutes. But this? This is just petty.

The parent's words still hung in the air, like a thick, invisible fog that I couldn't quite shake off. \"It's not working,\" they had said, their gaze avoiding mine, as if the very act of looking at me would cause them discomfort.\n\nI watched them leave, their hands tightly clasped around Johnny's, his small frame trembling with barely suppressed sobs. The sight of him looking back at me, tear-streaked cheeks and all, would have been heart-wrenching under any other circumstance. But today, it only served to fuel the anger that was beginning to simmer within me.\n\nHow could they do this? I thought, my hands clenching instinctively into fists by my sides. How could they just uproot Johnny like that, without even giving him a chance to adjust? Didn't they know how hard I had worked with him? How much time and effort I had invested in helping him catch up?\n\nI couldn't help but feel a sense of betrayal. After all, hadn't I done everything by the book? Hadn't I stayed after hours to tutor Johnny, had countless meetings with his parents to discuss his progress, or lack thereof? And now, they were just throwing it all away, blaming me for their son's struggles.\n\nBut no, that wasn't entirely fair. They hadn't explicitly blamed me. They had simply said \"it's not working,\" a phrase that could mean anything and nothing at the same time. Yet, here I was, standing alone in an empty classroom, another one leaving me, another failure to add to my growing list.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. There was no use dwelling on what had happened. What mattered now was moving forward, finding a way to help Johnny from afar, even if his parents refused to see the value in my methods. I owed him that much, at least.\n\nAs I gathered my things and prepared to leave the classroom, I couldn't shake off the feeling of resentment that lingered within me. But I knew better than to act on it. After all, as a professional, it was my duty to rise above such emotions, to focus on what truly mattered: helping Johnny, no matter how difficult the path might be.\n\nBut even as I resolved to do just that, I couldn't help but wonder why some parents seemed so hell-bent on making our jobs harder than they already were. It wasn't like we didn't care about their children's well-being. We did. More than they would ever know. Yet, sometimes, it felt like no matter how hard we tried, there was always someone ready to point a finger at us, to blame us for everything that went wrong.\n\nI sighed, shaking my head as I stepped out of the classroom, leaving behind another empty room filled with echoes of unspoken accusations and silent promises."
