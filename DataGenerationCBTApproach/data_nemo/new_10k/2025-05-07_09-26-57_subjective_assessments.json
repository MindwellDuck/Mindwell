We're supposed to be in this together, right? But now... now it feels like I'm living in a dumpster.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it, but she just gets defensive. 'Oh, you're so perfect, Mr. Clean,' she says. Like I'm the one with the problem here.

Not that it mattered, since she was a walking embarrassment now. She slouched back behind the counter, trying to ignore the phantom stares burning into her back.
