It was a photograph, buried there like a secret. I pulled it out, and there we were, twenty years younger, smiling at each other with that wide-eyed, hopeful love only newlyweds have.\n\nHis smile, God, his smile was always so infectious. It could light up even the gloomiest of days. But now, it just made me sad. It felt like a relic from another life, one that didn't quite fit into my current reality. I mean, sure, we were happy once, but that was then. This is now.\n\nI stood there, holding that photograph, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. They slid down my cheeks, silent and steady, like they had a right to be there. But it was stupid, really. We'd had our time, and it was gone. These old memories couldn't change that."

She knew that handwriting, could feel the anger bubbling up inside her like lava in a volcano. It was from him, her colleague of ten years, who'd always found fault in everything she did. This time, though, it was personal. The patient, an elderly woman with dementia, had wandered off during his watch, ending up in the morgue by mistake. He'd blamed her, as he always did, but this time he'd gone too far. She felt her cheeks flush, her grip tightening around the chart until her knuckles turned white.

Their eyes darted between her and the offending document, but she didn't care. This wasn't about them.\n\n\"This isn't about me,\" she hissed at no one in particular, \"It's about him. Always him.\" She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks, could practically taste the bile of anger on her tongue. But there was something else too, a sour note beneath it all. Disappointment? No, that wasn't right. That implied she'd expected better from him, and she never did.\n\nShe grabbed another chart - Mrs. Thompson's this time, the sweet old lady who always had a smile for everyone. She flipped through the pages, her eyes scanning the neat, careful notes she'd made just that morning. \"See anything here?\" she challenged the room, holding up the chart like a trophy. \"Any evidence of 'carelessness'? Any proof that I'm not fit to wipe Mrs. Thompson's ass?\"\n\nShe could feel the weight of their stares, the tension building in the silence. But it didn't matter. None of it mattered. Not when he'd gone too far this time. Not when she had a score to settle.\n\n\"I've got patients to see,\" she announced suddenly, snatching up Mrs. Thompson's chart and storming off down the hall. She didn't look back at the other nurses, didn't acknowledge their stunned silence. She knew they were whispering about her, but she didn't care. Let them talk. They wouldn't understand anyway. How could they? None of them had ever been in her shoes. None of them had ever had to deal with him.\n\nShe pushed open the door to Mrs. Thompson's room, a smile already spreading across her face. \"Good morning, Mrs. T,\" she chirped, as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. Because, really, what did it matter? Today was like any other day. Just another shift in hell."
