Her husband of three decades had passed away quietly in his sleep six months ago, leaving her alone in their once-warm home. She pushed through each day with automated efficiency, but tonight, as she stood before the kitchen counter, a simple task undid her: the knife slipped, nicking her thumb deeply enough to draw blood. She stared at the red bead forming, then watched it drip onto the cutting board, staining the pristine white of the chopped onions. A sob escaped her, echoing through the empty house, as despair settled heavy in her chest.",

I watched it drip onto the onions, staining them red. Just like how everything in this house has been stained by his absence. Six months without him, and every damn thing feels like a reminder.\n\nI could hear his voice in my head, \"Maria, you're making a mountain out of a molehill.\" But I couldn't help it. My mind was already racing, \"This is it. This is the start. First the cut, then an infection, then who knows what else? I can't handle this alone.\"\n\nThe sob caught me off guard, echoing through the empty house like a fucking gunshot. I hadn't cried this much since... well, since he left me.

That's how it always was, with my wife by my side, her laughter echoing off the stainless steel.\n\nI glanced at the empty doorway again. She shouldn't have left without saying goodbye. We've always been here together, our rhythm as natural as breathing. Her absence leaves a gaping hole in more than just the kitchen. Days should pass like this, not stretch into silence.
