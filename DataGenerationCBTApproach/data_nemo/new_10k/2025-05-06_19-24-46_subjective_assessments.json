As he plated it, he noticed a slight smirk on the man's face, reminiscent of his ex-wife's condescending smile.

Just okay?

I couldn't bear it, not again, not here.\n\nBefore I knew it, my feet were moving, the plate was back in my hands, and I was striding towards the kitchen. The trash can seemed to glow under the harsh fluorescent lights, a beacon of sorts. I dumped the dish in with a clatter that echoed through the sudden silence.\n\nI could feel their stares, all of them, every patron, every staff member. But it didn't matter. Not when his words, her smile, were still echoing in my mind. Just okay? It couldn't be just okay. It wasn't."
