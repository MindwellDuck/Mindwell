Each day he watches as a young graffiti artist, barely out of adolescence, tags up the wall across from his window - vibrant colors splashed across the old brick, obscuring the once pristine view that inspired his late wife's favorite painting. The hatred simmers within him like a slow-burning flame, fueled by each new addition to the ever-growing mural. One morning, he sees the boy pausing mid-spray, turning to catch sight of him watching. Their eyes meet through the glass, and the artist feels his grip tighten around the coffee cup in his hand until it shatters, cutting into his palm.",
