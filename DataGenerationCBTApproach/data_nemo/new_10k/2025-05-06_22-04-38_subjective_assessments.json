His eyes welled up as he asked if she was the officer who responded to his mother's call last week. She recognized him from the domestic disturbance report that ended with her arresting his father. The boy pulled out a crumpled letter, saying it was from his mom, thanking her for keeping them safe. As she took the letter, her hands trembled slightly, remembering the bruises on the woman's face and the fear in her eyes when they last met. She felt a pang of remorse, wondering if she'd done enough to protect them both.",

You're supposed to protect people like her, not just take them in and forget about them!\"\n\nMaria's grip tightened around the receiver. *Shouldn't she have done more?* The words echoed in her mind. She listened, interjecting occasionally with a calm \"I understand,\" but inside, frustration bubbled. *Why can't they see I'm doing my job? I should be able to keep everyone safe.*"

She stared at the blank screen of her computer, her reflection mocking her in the glossy black surface. \"Piddling,\" she whispered to herself, the word tasting like bitter ash in her mouth.\n\nShe hadn't been this rattled since... well, since that idiot reviewer had rejected her paper two years ago. \"Methodologically flawed and lacking in novelty,\" he'd written. She could still remember the sting of those words, the way they'd echoed through her mind as she crumpled the printout in her fist.\n\nBut this was different. This wasn't some faceless jerk hiding behind a computer screen. This was a kid, fresh out of his PhD, barely old enough to shave. How dare he? Her research, her life's work, dismissed like it was nothing?\n\nShe opened her email, scrolling through the endless chain of messages until she found the one from him. The subject line read: \"Re: Your Paper - Comments.\" She clicked on it, her eyes scanning the cursory, condescending remarks he'd made about her research. As if he knew better.\n\nHer cheeks flushed hot again, just like they had in the meeting room. She could feel the anger simmering inside her, threatening to boil over. But she wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing her upset. She was a professional, dammit. She'd earned her stripes long before this little punk had even started shaving.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself as she began to type out a response. She'd show him. She'd show them all that she wasn't some washed-up has-been. Her research mattered. It was important. It was... piddling? No, not her research. Not her work.\n\nBut the words on the screen blurred before her eyes, the cursor blinking mockingly at her. Suddenly, she felt exhausted. Was it really so outdated? So trivial?\n\nShe closed the email without sending a response, leaning back in her chair and rubbing her temples. Maybe he was right. Maybe she was just... out of touch. Outdated.\n\nShe took another sip of her coffee, now cold and bitter. \"Piddling,\" she whispered again, the word echoing through her mind like a funeral dirge."

My coffee was brewing automatically, a comforting ritual that's been mine for years now. I stood by the window, watching the sun creep over the neighbor's fence, casting long shadows across our yards.\n\nI saw little Sarah next door, her laughter echoing through the open window like music. She was showing off her new shoes to her dad, twirling around in them. They were nice, too nice for a teenager really, with their shiny leather and sleek design. Not that I know much about such things anymore.\n\nHer father picked her up, swinging her into his arms despite his bulky police uniform. He laughed, a deep rumble that carried through the air. It was a scene of pure joy, something I haven't felt in... well, in a long time. Not since Jack passed, and the kids moved out.\n\nI watched them drive away, Sarah's hand waving goodbye from the passenger seat. I couldn't help but think about how much she reminded me of my own daughter at that age. Except my daughter didn't have shoes like those. She didn't have a father who could afford to pick her up every morning with such ease.\n\nThe bitterness lingered in my mouth, a taste I've grown all too familiar with over the years. It's not fair, I thought. Life isn't fair. I can see it now, Sarah going off to college, getting a good job, having a family of her own. And here I am, stuck in this old house, alone except for my memories and the ghosts of what used to be.\n\nI shook my head, pushing away the thoughts that threatened to pull me under. It's too much sometimes, the weight of it all. Too hard to bear. But I'll manage, as I always do. Just another day in the life of an old woman watching the world change from her kitchen window."
