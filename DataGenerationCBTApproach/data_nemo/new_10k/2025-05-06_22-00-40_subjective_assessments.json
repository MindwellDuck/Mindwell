He looks up at me, his tail wagging, oblivious to my rising panic. Why can't I enjoy this? We've had countless nights like this. But tonight... tonight feels tainted.\n\nI quicken our pace, eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of life. 'No one's there,' I mutter, but the words taste hollow in my mouth. Spot pulls at his leash, wanting to explore a scent trail. I yank him back, my voice sharper than intended, 'Not now, Spot.'\n\nI've had good times here, laughter with friends, picnics under the old oak... But those memories feel like strangers now, distant echoes of a life that doesn't quite fit anymore. My mind clings to every negative thought, each fear, discarding the rest like crumpled paper.\""
