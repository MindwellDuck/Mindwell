He stumbled into his study, lit only by the moon, and switched on his ancient desktop. The screen flickered to life, revealing an unfinished research paper - the deadline looming like a guillotine. His hands trembled slightly as he reached for his coffee, cold and bitter from the night before. Another sleepless night awaited, anxiety chewing at him like a relentless rat.",

He squinted at the screen, eyes gritty from lack of sleep and too much caffeine.\n\n\"What if I can't finish this in time?\" he thought, staring at the half-finished paper. His stomach churned, knotting itself into a goddamn pretzel. \"What if my prof thinks I'm an idiot? What if I lose this internship opportunity because of it?\"\n\nHe took a swig of the cold coffee, grimacing at the bitter taste. It was like drinking fucking motor oil, but he didn't care. He needed something, anything to keep him going.\n\nHis mind raced, each 'what if' question more terrifying than the last. \"What if I have a breakdown? What if I can't handle this pressure?\" His hands shook as he started typing, his eyes flicking between the clock and the cursor blinking mockingly on the screen.\n\nAnother sleepless night stretched out before him like an endless fucking tunnel. He could feel the anxiety gnawing at him, chewing away like a goddamn rat on a piece of cheese. But he didn't stop. He couldn't. Not until the paper was done. Not until every 'what if' had been addressed, no matter how unlikely or terrifying."
