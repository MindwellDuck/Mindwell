I mean, sure, she's got that youthful energy, but does he have to be so... obvious about it?\n\nAnd his hand! On her arm, just sitting there like it belongs. How long had they been chatting before I even noticed? It's not like he ever did that with me. Not once in forty years. I'm just the old ball and chain now, huh?\n\nThe art, the wine, the crowds... it all seemed dull suddenly. Like everything was faded except for them, standing there in their little bubble of laughter and youth. I guess I just thought we'd be more than this by now. But what do I know?

I can't help but think, 'Why even bother showing my art if this is how people are going to perceive it?' It's not just about this exhibition; it's about every future show, every critic, every viewer. They'll all see the same thing, hear the same whisper: 'Copycat hack'.\n\nThis wasn't an isolated incident; it's a sign of things to come. I've always known there were those who wouldn't understand my art, but now it feels like they're everywhere, their voices growing louder, drowning out any appreciation for what I do. It's never going to get better, not with this stigma attached.\n\nI need you to assure me that you'll take steps to prevent this from happening again, to protect the integrity of my work and my reputation. Because if one person can vandalize my art, who's to say others won't follow suit? I can't have my entire career defined by this moment of carelessness, this cruel commentary.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\""

He didn't seem to notice\u2014or perhaps he simply didn't care\u2014that they were sticky with something more than just shoppers' lint. I saw it happen in slow motion, like a train wreck I couldn't avert: his digits, slick and unapologetic, traced lines of saliva and grime onto our newest stock, the ones we'd so carefully dusted off and displayed.\n\nA wave of heat crept up my neck, my cheeks flushing with what felt like everyone's eyes. But it wasn't embarrassment; it was something far more familiar, something that had been my companion for years\u2014the silent, seething insistence that things should not be this way. He shouldn't be doing this. I shouldn't have to witness it. Our store shouldn't feel defiled by such careless disregard.\n\nI wanted to reach out, to grab his arm mid-air, to say something\u2014anything\u2014that would make him see the error of his ways. But all I did was stand there, mute and impotent, as he finished his inspection and walked away, leaving behind a trail of smears like some grotesque, wet signature.\n\nThe rest of the day was tarnished by that moment, each sale and greeting marred by the lingering image of those dirty fingers. The store should have been my haven, but now it felt sullied, invaded. I couldn't help but think, as I wiped down the offending items with trembling hands, that this wasn't how things were supposed to be. It shouldn't have happened like this."
