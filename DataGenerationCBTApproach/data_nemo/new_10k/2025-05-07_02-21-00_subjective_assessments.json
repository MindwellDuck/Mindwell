He had spent hours preparing his signature dish, the one that always drew rave reviews and brought customers flocking in. But tonight, it seemed no one was interested. His partner of thirty years sat at the counter, quietly sipping their wine, avoiding his gaze. When he finally approached her with a plate of the steaming pasta, she shook her head slightly and said, \"I'm not really hungry tonight.\"",

He had taken extra care with the presentation, ensuring each strand was perfectly coiled around the fork. Yet, his partner's rejection felt like a personal affront, a silent reproach that echoed through the quiet restaurant. He couldn't help but feel it was a reflection of his own culinary incompetence, despite the countless nights of success. Perhaps he had lost his touch, he mused, as he watched her sip her wine, her eyes scanning the empty tables rather than meeting his gaze."

It had been two years since she'd passed, but some mornings it felt like yesterday. Today was one of those days. He picked up the mug, his reflection warping in its curved surface, and poured himself a cup of black coffee. The bitter taste brought back memories he thought he'd buried deeper. His hands trembled slightly as he set down the mug, spilling some coffee onto the counter. He stood there for a moment, just staring at the dark stain spreading across the Formica, before grabbing a cloth to wipe it away.",

The future loomed ahead, a vast wasteland of loneliness, echoing with the silence of her absence. His heart pounded in his chest, a drumbeat counting down to some unseen disaster. \"Fuck,\" he whispered, swiping at the counter with sudden violence, as if wiping away the stain could wipe away the future he saw unfolding before him like a funeral procession."

Another late night out without me, another lipstick stain to rub in my face.\n\nIt's always black or white with her, isn't it? Either she's home with me, or she's out there without me. There are no shades of grey in her world, no middle ground. It's either a full glass at 7 PM, or an empty one with someone else's lipstick on it.\n\nI know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but how can I not? It's always the same fucking story. And tonight, like every other night she chooses to go out without me, I'll be here, alone, wondering what could have been if only she saw things differently. If only she didn't see life in such fucking black and white terms.\n\nBut who am I kidding? She doesn't see it that way. To her, it's not 'all or nothing'. It's just... her life. And I'm either a part of it, or I'm not. There are no in-betweens with her, no compromises. It's always fucking 'this' or 'that', never 'both'.\n\nI'm tired, Diary. Tired of living in her extremes. But what can I do? I love her, even when she pisses me off like this. Even when she makes me feel like there's only one way to see the world - her way.\n\nFucking lipstick. Fucking 'all or nothing'."
