How dare they sit there so carelessly, so obliviously, when it was still their bench? His heart ached with each giggle they exchanged, each stolen glance that seemed to mock his solitude. He knew she would have felt the same way; after all, they had shared this spot for decades before her passing. Yet here were these interlopers, usurping what was rightfully theirs, their happiness an affront to his grief. How could they not understand? Did they not see how inappropriate it was to be so joyous in a place that belonged to sorrow? He felt a surge of indignation rise within him, as if her spirit were rebelling against this intrusion. But they continued on, blissfully unaware or simply indifferent, leaving Albert alone with his bitter musings under the fading light of day."
