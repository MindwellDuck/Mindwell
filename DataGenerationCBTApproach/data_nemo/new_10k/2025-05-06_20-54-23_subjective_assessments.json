His eyes fell upon a yellowed newspaper clipping tucked behind the antique clock she'd loved so much - \"Local Journalist Wins Award for Human Interest Story.\" The date beside it was exactly one year before her accident. A wave of guilt crashed over him as he remembered that day, his excitement bubbling over as he'd shared his news with her. She'd smiled, but there'd been a hint of something else in her eyes - worry perhaps? He hadn't noticed then, too wrapped up in his own pride. Now, it felt like a knife twisting in his heart. If only he'd seen it sooner, if only he could take it back...",

Suddenly, a power surge causes the lights to flicker and the emergency backup generator kicks in with a loud hum.

I've been nursing for decades, but that loud hum of the backup generator still manages to startle me. It's strange how it reminded me of those childhood nights back home during blackouts.*\n\n*I found myself gripping my flashlight, hands trembling slightly as I swept its beam around the nurses' station. It was silly, really. I'm a grown woman, not some child afraid of monsters in the dark. Yet, there I was, half-expecting something sinister to leap out from the shadows.*\n\n*I suppose it's because of the timing. The generator kicked in just as I was reviewing Mrs. Thompson's chart. She's been through so much lately, and her recovery hasn't been smooth. I couldn't help but think that perhaps this power issue was some sort of omen, a sign that things were about to get worse for her.*\n\n*But why would it be? It was just a power surge, not a supernatural warning. Mrs. Thompson's health is in capable hands here at St. Mercy, and hers alone. I know better than to assume such things.*\n\n*Yet, there it was again - that nagging feeling that this was all somehow connected to me, to my patients. It's as if the universe was whispering secrets meant only for my ears.*\n\n*I must remember not to let these thoughts consume me. My job is to care for my patients, not to read signs into every flicker of light and hum of machinery.*\n\n*Until tomorrow's shift,*"

It was still so raw, even after all this time. She reached down to pick up the photo, tracing their smiling faces with her fingertip. Always like this now, she thought. Every single time something reminded her, it felt like he'd just gone. The whole day would be ruined, her entire evening swallowed by this ache in her chest.\n\nShe set the photograph back on the mantelpiece, amidst the other memories that lined up silently, like an army of ghosts. She never wanted to forget, not even for a moment. But sometimes, she wished she could just have one night where it didn't hurt like this.
