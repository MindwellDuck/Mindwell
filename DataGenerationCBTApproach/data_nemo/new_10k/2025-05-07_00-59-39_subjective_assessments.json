You've thrown yourself into your work as a freelance writer to cope with the loss. Today, while working from home, you come across an old photograph of you and your late wife, smiling happily on your wedding day. Your daughter, who lives nearby and checks in on you regularly, notices you've been staring at the photo for some time. She places a comforting hand on your shoulder.\n\n**Thomas's Reaction:**\n\n\"Oh, look at that,\" I muttered, squinting at the faded colors of our wedding photo. \"We were so young, so... happy.\" I could feel my daughter's gaze on me, but I kept my eyes glued to the past. \"I mean, we were idiots, really. Thinking life would always be like that. Hah!\" I gave a short, bitter laugh and tapped the photo frame with my pen. \"Now look at us. One of us is gone, and the other's just... stuck here.\" I sighed heavily, minimizing the joy captured in the photograph. \"But what can you do? Life goes on, right?\" I shrugged off my daughter's concerned squeeze and turned back to my computer, clicking away at my keyboard with renewed vigor. \"Besides, who needs happiness when you've got deadlines, huh?\""
