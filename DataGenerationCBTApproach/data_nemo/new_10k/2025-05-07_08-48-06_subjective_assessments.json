I fumbled for it, heart pounding like a drum in my chest. An unfamiliar number glared back at me from the screen. I hesitated, then pressed the answer button. \"Hello?\" My voice echoed in the darkness.\n\nA whisper responded, \"It's me.\" It couldn't be her; she was gone, taken by the cruel hands of fate five years ago. Yet, there it was again, that soft, familiar timbre that haunted my dreams. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, as if her ghost had brushed past me.\n\nI knew instantly who it must be. Only one person could have such audacity to mimic her voice after all this time. My mind raced with accusations, with questions. Why now? What did she want? Did she think I would forget, that I wouldn't recognize the mockery of my wife's memory?\n\nBut why would she do this? She knew how much it would hurt me, how it would rip open old wounds. Or perhaps she didn't care. Perhaps she thought I was too foolish to see through her deception. Well, I wasn't going to fall for it. I wouldn't give her the satisfaction of a reaction.\n\nI hung up without a word, my hands trembling with anger and something else... something I refused to acknowledge. The room felt colder now, emptier somehow. As if her whispered \"It's me\" had taken away what little warmth was left in this house."

The microwave hummed as it reheated yesterday's leftover soup, a monotonous rhythm that seemed to echo her life's recent trajectory. Her husband had barely spoken to her this morning, his silent disapproval stung more than words ever could. She stirred her spoon aimlessly in the now steaming bowl, watching the tiny bubbles pop and fade, much like her own dreams and aspirations over the years. The harsh fluorescent lights flickered overhead, a subtle reminder of her looming deadline at work, another week of endless sales targets and demanding customers. As she took her first sip, the soup tasted more bitter than comforting, a stark reminder that today, like every other day, promised nothing but more misery.",
