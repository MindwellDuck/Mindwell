No name, no signature - just a few words that seem to fill the empty classroom more than any group of chattering students ever could.\n\n\"You're not like other teachers.\"\n\nI've read it a dozen times now, smoothing out its creases as if that might change the words somehow. But they remain there, jagged and unyielding: a stark either/or statement. Either I'm one thing or another - but what? What does 'other' even mean?\n\nI've been teaching for twenty-three years, diary. You'd think by now I'd be immune to such things. But every time something like this happens, it's like being a first-year teacher all over again. The self-doubt, the questioning... it's exhausting.\n\nIsn't it enough that I'm me? Can't I just be Mrs. Thompson, history teacher, without having to fit into some predefined box? It's not like there's a manual for this job - no clear guidelines on what makes a 'good' or 'bad' teacher. So why do I feel like I've failed at one and succeeded at the other?\n\nI suppose tomorrow will bring clarity. Or perhaps more confusion. Either way, it'll be another day in the classroom. Another chance to prove that I am, indeed, a teacher - but maybe not quite like the others.\n\nUntil then,\nMrs. Thompson"
