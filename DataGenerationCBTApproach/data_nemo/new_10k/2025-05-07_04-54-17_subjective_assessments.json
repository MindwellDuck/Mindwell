My heart sinks at the thought, and I know it's true; he's spiraling out of control, right under our noses.\n\nI should've seen this coming. I knew something was off when he started closing his door at night. Now, it's all crystal clear - the late-night gaming, the lackluster effort in school, the hollow promises to 'do better'. It's not just about grades anymore; it's about who he's becoming.\n\nI feel a sudden urge to call him out on this, to demand answers and explanations. This isn't like us, but I can't ignore what my gut is telling me. He needs tough love now more than ever. No more excuses, no more leniency. It's time to face the facts."
