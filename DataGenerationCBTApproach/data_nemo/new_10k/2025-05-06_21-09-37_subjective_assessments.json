She's been working here for decades, knows every inch of this place like the back of her weathered hands. Today, though, it feels different. Less welcoming.\n\nShe starts her shift, greeting regular customers with a practiced smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. A young woman, barely out of her teens, rushes past her, arms laden with shopping bags. She pauses, watching the girl's laughter echo through the mall. It's been years since she laughed like that, freely and without worry.\n\nHer gaze drifts to the empty space beside the escalator where a Christmas tree used to stand tall each year. They've taken it down permanently now, another sign of change she can't ignore. She feels a familiar melancholy wash over her as she remembers her late husband helping her decorate it every December. This time of year was always their favorite.\n\nShe sighs, straightening her name tag absently before turning back to her duties. The mall is quieter today, the usual hum of chatter replaced by an unsettling silence. She can't shake off the feeling that something fundamental has changed, leaving her adrift in a world that's moving on without her.",
