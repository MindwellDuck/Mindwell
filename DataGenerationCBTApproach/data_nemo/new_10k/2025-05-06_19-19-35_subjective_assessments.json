The streets were bathed in the warm glow of street lamps, casting long shadows that danced with each gust of wind. It was as if time had stood still since we last walked these paths together.\n\nTonight, however, there was an unexpected interloper. A sudden breeze blew a sheet of newspaper against my leg. I looked down, expecting to find the usual advertisements or classifieds, but instead, it was something far more personal. It was that recipe for her favorite stew, the one we used to make together on cold winter nights like this.\n\nA bitter laugh escaped me as I crumpled the paper in my hand. \"As if that could bring back the past,\" I muttered under my breath. I tossed the paper into the nearest trash can, refusing to let it stir any false hope. After all, it was just a recipe. It didn't change anything.\n\nI continued my walk home, the cold wind numbing my cheeks and clearing my mind. The house was dark when I arrived, as it always is now. I let myself in, the weight of silence pressing down on me like a familiar, heavy blanket. I hung up my coat, kicked off my shoes, and headed upstairs to bed.\n\n\"Goodnight,\" I whispered into the empty hallway, as if she might still hear me from her old bedroom down the hall. But no reply came, only the soft ticking of the grandfather clock downstairs. Just another night in our once-was, now-never-to-be-again home."
