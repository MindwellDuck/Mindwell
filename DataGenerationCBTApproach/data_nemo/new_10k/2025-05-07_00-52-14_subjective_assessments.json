Smiling at those damn apples like they were still hers to choose from. My hands started shaking again. I knew it was gonna be one of those days.\n\nShe reached for that wine - you know the one, cheap and cheerful. I could see us then, Saturday nights, laughing over takeout, glasses clinking. Now, it's just another bottle in her basket, no memories attached. She doesn't even realize she's carrying our past around with her.\n\nI felt it coming, that familiar tightening in my chest. It was gonna be a disaster, I could tell. She'd pick up some other guy now, maybe even bring him here. I'd have to watch them, hear their laughter echoing through the aisles where we used to... But no, not today. Today, she just paid and left.\n\nBut tomorrow? Tomorrow's another story. It's gonna be awful, just like always. I can't stand it, knowing what's coming.
