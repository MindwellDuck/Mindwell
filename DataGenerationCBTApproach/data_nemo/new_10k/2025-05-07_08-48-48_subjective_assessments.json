The TV blared a news report about a politician advocating for healthcare cuts, his smirking face filling the screen. A colleague, young and careless, chuckled, \"About time someone puts an end to these ridiculous costs.\" Her knuckles turned white as she gripped her mug, feeling a surge of heat like she was standing too close to an open oven door. She hurled the mug across the room, shattering it against the wall beside the TV, its pieces clattering to the floor like her composure. The room fell silent except for the continued drone of the news report, now discussing school funding cuts.",
