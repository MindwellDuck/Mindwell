The way it cruised down my street, so smooth and confident, it made me feel... insignificant. Like I was stuck in the past, while everything else had moved on without me. I could've sworn the driver looked right at me, their face hidden behind those dark windows. It was as if they were judging me, finding me lacking. But who was I kidding? I knew it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Still, I couldn't shake that feeling of inadequacy as the car sped off into the night, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the dying embers of my cigarette."
