Or perhaps I didn't notice she was struggling with the material.\n\nI can still remember her face when she used to come up to me after class, asking for help with her homework. She seemed so eager to learn... But now? It's like all that effort went to waste. Maybe I shouldn't have pushed her so hard. Or maybe I should've pushed her harder?\n\nEither way, it feels like this is my fault somehow. She wouldn't say something like this if she wasn't really struggling, right?
