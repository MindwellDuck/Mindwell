While I understand that projects have their own timelines and exigencies, the fact that this email arrived just as I was beginning to unwind has caused me some distress.\n\nI assure you, however, that I will make every effort to address this update first thing tomorrow morning. Nevertheless, I kindly request that we maintain a balance between urgency and consideration for work-life harmony in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n*Best regards,*\n[Your Name]"
