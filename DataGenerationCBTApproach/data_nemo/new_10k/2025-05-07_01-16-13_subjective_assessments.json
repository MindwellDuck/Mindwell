Only the quiet hum of the house and the echo of his absence. She noticed how the sweater seemed to swallow her up, emphasizing her solitude. She imagined others, still in the comfort of their partners' arms, sharing warmth and laughter. They must seem so much more complete, less fractured than she felt.\n\nHer reflection showed a woman with red-rimmed eyes and hair streaked with silver, even though she was barely into her forties. She seemed smaller, somehow, as if grief had not just hollowed out her heart but her very form too. She couldn't help but think that others would look at her and see... what? Inadequacy? Weakness?\n\nShe hugged herself tighter, his sweater now a shroud of sorrow rather than warmth. A lone tear slid down her cheek as she whispered to her reflection, \"Why can't I be like them?\" She didn't realize then how unfair her comparison was, how unique her own journey was meant to be."
