The house felt empty without her laughter filling its rooms. He found himself staring at their wedding photo, the corners worn from years of loving touch. A soft meow from their cat brought him back to the present. He picked up the feline, burying his face in its fur, seeking comfort in its warmth. The doorbell rang, startling him. It was a neighbor with a casserole, offering condolences for their recent miscarriage. His heart sank as he took the dish, his sorrow renewed by the sympathetic gaze of another.",

Always the bloody cat, meowing like its life depends on it. Never mind that I'm over here drowning in my own grief. It's like it doesn't even care, just wants its dinner. Typical.\n\nThen the doorbell rings, and guess who it is? Good old Mrs. Thompson from next door, with her casserole of condolences. Again. Like we don't have enough food around here already. And she looks at me with those big doe eyes, all sympathetic and stuff. I mean, seriously, how many times are they going to feel sorry for us? It's been months!\n\nSo yeah, just another day in paradise. Always something new to remind me of what we've lost.\""
