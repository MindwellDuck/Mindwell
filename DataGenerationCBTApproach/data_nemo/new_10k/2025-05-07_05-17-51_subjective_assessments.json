Her heart pounding in her chest like a kick drum at a rock concert, she reached for her phone, fingers trembling as she dialed 911 with the volume turned low. The house was eerily quiet, save for the ticking of the grandfather clock, each tick echoing like thunder in her ears. She clutched her late husband's robe around herself tightly, feeling his absence more acutely than ever. Every shadow seemed to move and every creak made her jump. She sat there, alone in the dark, fear gripping her like a vice as she waited for what felt like an eternity for the police to arrive.",

Sounds like a bloody elephant's tap dancing down there.\n\nI mean, it's not like anyone else is here to check it out. Just me and these shadows playing tag all over the place. Every time I think I've seen them all, another one pops up, dancing around like they're having a bloody party at my expense.\n\nThe ticking of that blasted clock isn't helping either. It's not just ticking, it's thundering in here, each second echoing like it's mocking me. \"TICK... TICK... Still alive, are we? TICK... TICK...\"\n\nAnd this robe? My late husband's, meant to comfort me, now feels like a bloody iceberg around my shoulders. His absence is a gaping hole tonight, more than ever. It's not like he was any good with these late-night scares either, but at least he was here.\n\nI suppose I should call the police. But God forbid they think I'm some hysterical old woman who can't handle being alone in her own house. I'll just wait it out, keep an eye on those shadows and that clock until my heart stops pounding like a bloody drum set. It's not like anything will happen, right? Right?"
