Just a 'I'm sorry', not even that, just a goddamn 'I've moved on'. It's like she didn't care about my feelings at all. I mean, who does that? Who keeps something like this and never fucking sends it?\n\nAnd now, looking back, was our marriage really that bad? She says she's moved on, so maybe I'm just the one stuck here with all these goddamn what-ifs. Maybe I'm overthinking it, making a big deal out of nothing.
