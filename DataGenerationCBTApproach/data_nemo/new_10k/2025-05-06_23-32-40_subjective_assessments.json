She'd loved it, always said it reminded her of the sky on our first date. But that was then, wasn't it? Before everything went to shit.\n\nHe picked up the dried flower petals, their once-pristine white now sullied by the blue. \"Damn you,\" he whispered to them, as if they were responsible for this intrusion. He couldn't even find solace in their simple beauty anymore, not when they'd been tainted by that fucking color.\n\nHe tossed them into the trash, along with his soiled palette. It was just another reminder of what he didn't have, of what he'd lost. The hell with it all, he thought, grabbing a cloth and wiping the entire canvas clean. He might as well start over, because there wasn't any point in trying to salvage this fucking wreck anyway."

He needed to find it, had to make sure she wasn't truly lost, not again. But where should he start looking? The kitchen was a war zone at this time of night, chaos lurking in every corner. \"Why didn't I just frame her?\" he chided himself, regret gnawing at him like the clock ticking away their lost moments together. \"What if tomorrow never comes?\" His breath hitched as panic threatened to consume him entirely.
