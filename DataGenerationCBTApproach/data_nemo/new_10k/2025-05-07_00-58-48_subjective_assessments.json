You've just noticed a photo of your late wife among your medical texts. Describe how this makes you feel, comparing yourself subtly to others who seem better off, without realizing it.\n\n---\n\n**Text:**\n\n*Great,* I think, *another day, another damn miracle saved.* And here's old Mrs. Thompson with her hip replacement, smiling like she won the lottery. *Lucky her.* Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, alone in this echo chamber of memories and medical jargon.\n\n*Look at them all,* I seethe, flipping through the photo album on my phone. Friends, family, even colleagues - everyone's got their lives together. Kids, careers, laughter. *And here I am, the sad sack with a house full of ghosts.*\n\nI slam the album shut, tossing it onto the pile of unsorted laundry. *Why her?* I demand silently, glaring at the photo of my wife on the desk. *Why did she have to leave me? Look at them,* I gesture wildly towards nothing, *look at how they're living - laughing, loving, moving on.* And here I am, drowning in bitterness and old memories.\n\n*They don't know loss,* I sneer, gripping the photo frame so tight my knuckles turn white. *They don't know what it's like to come home to a house that's too quiet, too empty, too full of her absence.* They wouldn't understand this constant resentment simmering in my gut, this burning jealousy for their happiness.\n\n*I'd trade anything,* I think, tracing the curve of my wife's smile in the photo. *Anything* for just one more day with her laughter echoing through these rooms. But that's not how life works, is it? Some people get lucky, some people lose everything. And here I am, comparing, resenting, drowning in unfairness."
