I am writing to discuss the recent team structure changes, specifically the promotion of [Colleague's Name] to team lead.\n\nFrankly, I must admit that I'm feeling quite surprised and somewhat disheartened by this decision. After all, we've been working together for months, and I believe my experience and contributions speak for themselves. It seems rather peculiar that someone half my age, with less tenure in the company, has been chosen for such a significant role.\n\nI understand that change is inevitable, but I can't help but feel that this decision might have been influenced by some misconceptions about our respective skill sets. My emotions are telling me that something isn't quite right here, and I believe it's important to address these feelings openly and honestly.\n\nI'm not suggesting that [Colleague's Name] doesn't deserve recognition or new challenges; however, I must express my concern over the message this sends to the rest of our team. It feels like my hard work and experience have gone unnoticed, and that's not a great feeling when you're at the heart of your career.\n\nI would appreciate it if we could discuss this further in our next meeting. I'm eager to understand the thought process behind this decision and perhaps find ways to ensure such valuable experience as mine is acknowledged moving forward.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to our discussion.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"

Just seeing it made my heart squeeze like someone was wringing out a damp cloth. There we were, laughing and stealing kisses under that lamppost, feels like a lifetime ago now. And there's this stupid rose, left behind in the rain, like some pathetic attempt at a memorial.\n\nI reached out to touch its petals, cold and lifeless as they are. \"Emma,\" I whispered, like she'd hear me or something ridiculous like that. She's gone, isn't she? Six months now, and it still feels like there should be more to show for it than this wilted flower.\n\nI mean, people say time heals, but what do they know? Every time I walk by here, it's like picking at a scab. It's not like I've moved on or anything. How could I? Emma was... is my life. And now she's just... gone.
