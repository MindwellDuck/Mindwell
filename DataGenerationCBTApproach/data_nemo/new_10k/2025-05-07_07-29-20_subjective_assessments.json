You won't believe what happened at today's meeting. That kid, barely out of diapers and already acting like he knows it all, decides to call me out in front of everyone! Me, for Christ's sake!\n\nHe said my idea was \"outdated,\" can you fucking believe that? I've been doing this longer than he's been alive, and suddenly I'm the old dog who can't learn new tricks. Hell, my suggestion would've worked just fine if they'd given it a chance.\n\nAnd then, get this, he offers up his own solution like it's the best thing since sliced bread. It was fucking amateur hour, I tell you. Slapped together with no thought for long-term implications or practicality. But did anyone say anything? Noooo, because apparently, we're all supposed to bow down to the young genius now.\n\nI've seen some shit in my time, but this takes the cake. It's like my years of experience and all the fucking effort I put into this team mean nothing. I'm not even bitter, though, just... frustrated, you know? Like why bother when some whippersnapper can waltz in and take over?\n\nAnyway, rant over. Thanks for letting me vent. Hopefully, tomorrow will be a better day.\n\nBest,\nJohn"
