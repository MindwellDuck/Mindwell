They were laughing, all entwined, as if they owned the place. It irked me, seeing them there like that. And would you believe it? That girl was wearing her necklace - my ex's old necklace, the one she used to wear when we'd sit there together. I remember it so vividly, it couldn't have been a coincidence. I'm sure they're laughing at me now, at how pathetic I must look walking by here every night. It's ridiculous, really. They probably think they've replaced us somehow. As if anyone could replace what we had.\""
