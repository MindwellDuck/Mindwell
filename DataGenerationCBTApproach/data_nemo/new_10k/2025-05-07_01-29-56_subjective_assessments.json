I mean, sure, she's been here two years longer than me, but I've put in just as much work, if not more.\n\nI should have been up there tonight, not her. I've stayed late countless times, taken on extra projects, even trained the newbies. That award was mine. I could practically feel its weight in my hands, hear the applause echoing around me. But no, here we are, with Sarah soaking it all in.\n\nI tried to clap along with everyone else, but my hands felt heavy, like they didn't want to cooperate. It's not that I'm jealous or anything, but come on! This isn't how it was supposed to go. I should be the one up there, accepting the award for my team's hard work. Not her.\n\nI took a sip of my champagne, but it tasted bitter, like it was laughing at me too. I'll just have to wait until next year, I guess. This better be my year, though. I deserve it.\""

And yet, here I am, standing in this cramped little room, breathing in like I'm trying to catch a whisper of her perfume. Pathetic, isn't it?\n\nYou'd think I'd be used to this by now. Every day, something else pops up to remind me that she's gone. A silly joke shared with a colleague that echoes one we once had. A song playing on the radio that was hers and mine alone. It's like living in some sort of cruel joke where the punchline is always the same: \"She's not here anymore, idiot.\"\n\nBut you know what? I refuse to let this stupid shirt ruin my lunch break too. I've got half an hour left, and by golly, I'm going to use it to enjoy something. Even if it's just a lousy sandwich in silence. Because that's the thing, isn't it? It's always about the little things. The tiny details that add up to a life without her.\n\nSo excuse me while I go find a quiet corner and pretend that my world isn't constantly being invaded by reminders of what used to be."
