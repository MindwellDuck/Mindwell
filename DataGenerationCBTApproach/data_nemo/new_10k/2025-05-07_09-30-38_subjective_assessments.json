It's always the same - graffiti one day, despair the next.\n\nI mean, sure, there were kids who said hi this morning, but what does that matter? They probably just felt sorry for me. Pathetic. It's not like I actually taught them anything useful today. I stood up there, droning on about some fucking equation, and they just sat there, staring at me like I was the biggest waste of space they'd ever seen.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that parent email I got back. \"Thanks for taking the time to help with little Timmy's homework.\" Yeah, because he can't do it himself, obviously. She didn't say anything about how I explained it all so well he finally got it. No, just a generic \"thanks\" like she was doing me a favor by acknowledging my existence.\n\nFuck this. Fuck them. They don't know what it's like to be in my shoes, struggling every goddamn day. It's not like I'm getting any better at this teaching thing either.

She passed by couples huddled under umbrellas, their laughter echoing against the wet pavement. Her eyes stung with unshed tears, not from the rain, but from the ache in her heart that had become all too familiar. Another holiday season was approaching, and she couldn't shake off the loneliness that clung to her like a second skin. She hadn't heard from her daughter in months, and each passing day felt like another nail in the coffin of their relationship. As she reached her apartment door, she noticed the neighbors' tree already adorned with lights, casting a warm glow into the hall. Her breath hitched as she remembered last year's decorations, now gathering dust in her closet. She took a deep, shuddering breath before stepping inside, leaving the warmth and laughter behind.",
