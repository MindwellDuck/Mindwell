The kitchen was a symphony of clanging pots and sizzling food, but all she heard was the laughter echoing from the dining room - laughter that didn't include her. She had been their star chef once, but now they were just a bunch of strangers enjoying her food without knowing or caring who she was. A stray onion skin fluttered to the floor, and she felt the bitter taste of resentment rise in her throat as she stooped to pick it up.",

I set it down with more force than intended, drawing silent glances from colleagues buried behind their screens. Their eyes lingered briefly before darting back to their work, leaving mine to burn into the scarred wood of my desk.\n\nI bristle at John's tone, that smug smirk suggesting he knows something I don't. But I won't dignify it with a response. Not here, not now. Not when every word is ammunition for tomorrow's gossip.\n\nMy mind flashes back to last night - the late hours spent poring over figures, verifying sources, crafting sentences until they sang. The pride that swelled within me as I hit 'send,' knowing that this piece was something special. But John doesn't see that. He sees only the deadline passed, not the quality of work delivered.\n\nI won't bother telling him about the editor's praise, or the record-breaking views on my last article. Those don't count for anything when there's a red stamp screaming 'MISSING DEADLINE' next to my name. They're just empty words, meaningless in the face of this harsh reality.\n\nSo I'll bite back the retort simmering on my tongue and focus on what truly matters - the next deadline looming large, demanding my attention. Because that's all anyone cares about anyway. The positives? Those are just noise, easily discounted."

He could see it now, clear as day: their kitchen would become a battleground, filled with tension and unspoken words. Their once harmonious meals would turn into silent, awkward affairs.

I hadn't heard that voice in years, not since I'd moved to Paris and started writing novels instead of news pieces.\n\n\"What can I do for you, Jean-Pierre?\" I asked, leaning against the window frame, looking out at the Seine as it flowed by, indifferent to my past.\n\n\"It's less about what you can do for me,\" he began, his tone measured, \"and more about what we've done without you. We ran an exclusive with your former husband.\"\n\nI stiffened, my grip tightening on the phone. The room seemed to tilt slightly. \"Oh?\" I managed, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"Yes, quite the candid interview,\" he continued, unaware of the storm brewing inside me. \"He spoke about your divorce, among other things.\"\n\nMy mind fixated on that one word: 'divorce.'
