He throws it onto the couch in frustration, knocking over an empty whiskey glass. It rolls onto the floor with a hollow clink, echoing his own emptiness. He looks at himself in the mirror - dark circles, unkempt beard, clothes rumpled from wearing them all week. He turns away, unable to face his reflection any longer. The silence of his apartment mocks him, a stark contrast to the bustling newsroom where he used to thrive. Now, every story feels like another nail in the coffin of their failed relationship. He picks up his phone again, opens her last message - \"I need space\" - and deletes it.",

It's all just one big failure fest in here.\" He picked up a story he'd written weeks ago, now yellowed and crumpled at the edges. \"This used to mean something,\" he said, tossing it aside with a dismissive sniff. \"Now?
