Her heart pounded like a drum in her chest, each beat echoing her inner turmoil. \"It's been months of radio silence, and suddenly he decides to reach out? Bullshit.\" She felt the familiar heat of anger rising within her, but there was no room left for anything else. It was either rage or nothing at all."

As I moved through the space, scrutinizing each piece, I noticed something peculiar. There, on an easel in the corner, was a painting that seemed to mimic my style. The brushwork, the color choices, even the composition... it was all too familiar.\n\nI stepped closer, examining the canvas inch by inch. How could this be? I thought, as I focused intently on a smudge of paint in the lower left corner. It looked like mine, yet it wasn't. A sense of unease began to bubble up within me. This painting was incomplete, its edges rough and untouched. But why? What was he trying to achieve with such a blatant imitation?\n\nI found myself drawn into the details, my mind racing with questions. How could he claim this as his own when it was clearly inspired by my work? I couldn't see past this one piece, ignoring the rest of his collection entirely. My vision tunneled, fixating on that single anomaly amidst his usual style. It was as if nothing else in the studio existed anymore.\n\nI left without exploring further, my thoughts consumed by that one painting. I didn't notice the warmth of his greeting as he walked me out, nor did I hear him mention his upcoming exhibition. All I could focus on was that unfinished canvas, its existence gnawing at me like a discordant note in an otherwise harmonious symphony."
