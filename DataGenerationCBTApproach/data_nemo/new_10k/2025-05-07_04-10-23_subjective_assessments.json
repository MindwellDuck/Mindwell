His art was his lifeline, his salvation from the mundane. It was meant to be a celebration of life, not this... this fucking torture. He should be painting, creating, living. Not standing here, drowning in silence and despair.\n\nBut no matter how much he willed it, the brush refused to move. His hand, once so steady, now shook with each breath. It was like the canvas itself was rebelling, refusing to be defiled by his lack of inspiration. He wanted to scream, to curse at the fucking thing until it yielded.
