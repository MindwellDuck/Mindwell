You've just returned home from a long day at work, feeling particularly anxious about the mess you left behind that morning.\n\n**Text:**\n\nUpon entering the kitchen, my eyes immediately fell upon it - his favorite mug, still unwashed, lounging shamelessly in the sink. I had hoped to return to a pristine haven after a day filled with chaos, but no such luck. The sight of it sent a surge of irritation through me, my anxiety clawing at my chest like an unwelcome guest.\n\nThere's no middle ground here, I thought sternly to myself. Either you maintain absolute cleanliness, or you're living in squalor. There's no in-between. I could feel the familiar all-or-nothing thinking closing in, coloring my perception of this single oversight with shades of impending doom.\n\nI approached the sink, hands trembling slightly as I reached for the mug. \"This is unacceptable,\" I muttered under my breath, my voice echoing in the silent room. It's not just about the mug anymore; it's about maintaining standards, keeping control over something, anything, in this world that feels so out of my grasp.\n\nAs I scrubbed at the mug with unnecessary vigor, I couldn't help but feel that if I let this one thing slip, it would be a sign of weakness. A sign that I'm losing my grip on the order I so desperately need to hold onto. It's not just about the mug anymore; it's about my worth, my competence, my very identity as a capable adult.\n\nBut for now, it's still just about the mug. And in this moment, there are only two options: clean or unclean, order or chaos. There's no room for nuance, no room for the reality that sometimes life is messy and imperfect. There's only the stark binary of all or nothing."

The clatter of pots and pans, the hiss of flames under boilers, and the shouted orders from other chefs fill the air.
