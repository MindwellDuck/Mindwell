She had no recollection of starting such a piece. As she approached, her heart began to pound like a drum in her chest. The scene was vivid, intimate even: her partner, their faces inches apart, hands entwined. But it wasn't them alone; there was another figure, someone she didn't recognize, standing nearby with an expression that spoke volumes.\n\nHer breath caught in her throat as the realization set in. This... this was a betrayal, wasn't it? She could see it now, clear as day: the heartache, the anger, the inevitable implosion of their relationship. She could feel the weight of it already, crushing her chest, stealing her breath. It was as if she could predict the future, and what lay ahead was nothing but despair.\n\nShe picked up a paintbrush, squeezing out drops of black onto the palette. Her hand trembled as she dipped it in, mixing the darkness with other colors until they were indistinguishable. She knew what would happen next; she'd confront him, he'd deny it, they'd fight... and then? The end, surely.\n\nHer strokes grew heavier, more violent, mirroring her inner turmoil. How could he do this to her? To them? She felt a surge of anger, hot and intense, threatening to consume her. This was it, wasn't it? The beginning of the end. And she couldn't stand it; she just couldn't."

It was just another cookbook.'\n\nI'm sure he'd try to minimize it all, make out like it was no big deal that he barely even knew my husband back then.

How could he not see what a slap in the face this is to all of us who still care?\n\nAnd me? Well, I'm sure he'd just dismiss me too if I tried to bring it up.
