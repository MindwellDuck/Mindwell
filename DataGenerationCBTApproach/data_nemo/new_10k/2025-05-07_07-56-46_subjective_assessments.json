The sepia-toned photos seemed to mock him; their smiling faces from years past now distant memories. He lingered on one image in particular - a group shot of them and their children at a picnic, laughter frozen in time. His gaze drifted to the empty spaces where once there were two little ones, now grown and gone. A melancholic sigh escaped him as he realized how much time had passed, and how little they'd truly enjoyed it together.",
