A pang of envy struck me, its cold tendrils reaching into my chest, tightening it like an unseen vice. The memory of my own last such outing with her came rushing back, unbidden and unwelcome - the sterile silence between us, the hollow clink of glass against metal as I placed a gift box onto the counter.\n\nI couldn't help but contrast their evident joy with our stark silence. Their laughter seemed to echo through the store, amplifying my sense of inadequacy. Why was it so easy for them, and yet for me...? The question hung heavy in my mind, its weight pressing down on my shoulders as I continued my task.\n\nI found myself questioning every decision we'd made together, every moment we'd shared. Had she ever felt this way too, or was our love doomed to forever pale in comparison to others'? A bitter taste rose in the back of my throat at the thought. But still, I pushed on, one foot in front of the other, lost in the labyrinth of unfair comparisons that seemed to define my existence."

Fuck!\" She searched frantically, each second ticking away like a countdown to Armageddon.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Another callout. A domestic violence scene this time. She took a deep breath, steeling herself. \"What if it's another kid caught in the crossfire?\" she whispered to herself, her voice barely audible over the hammering of her heart against her ribcage. She felt the weight of despair settle heavier on her chest as she stepped out into the cold night, leaving behind the echoes of silence and loneliness."

It was just... one tiny slip. But now, it's like that one mistake has grown into a monstrous beast, devouring all the good things about me. All I can see are those two damning words, written in neat, precise handwriting - a stark contrast to the chaos raging inside my mind.\n\n*Careless*, indeed. It's almost laughable how true that word feels now. My locker is a mess, isn't it? Spilling over with forgotten notes and half-finished coffee cups. I'm careless. Irresponsible. That's all anyone needs to know about me.\n\nI glance at my watch, the ticking of its hands suddenly deafening. Four minutes until my shift starts. Four minutes for the whole world to see what a disaster I am. But does it matter? They already know, don't they? The note proves it.\n\nI crumple the paper tighter, pressing it against my chest like a makeshift shield. Maybe if I ignore everything else, this one detail will make sense. Maybe then, I won't feel so... overwhelmed."

It was as if the very air conspired against him, rubbing salt into his wounds. Each stroke of ink on paper now seemed futile, an exercise in meaningless. His heart ached with a profound emptiness, and every fiber of his being screamed that life held no purpose without her. Yet, he couldn't shake off the nagging thought that perhaps he was overreacting, that others wouldn't understand this consuming grief. But how could they?
