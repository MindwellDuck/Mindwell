It was like watching someone else enjoy a feast while she sat at an empty table.\n\n*I used to be somebody,* she thought bitterly, pulling her forgotten book from the shelf.

Days when her name wasn't hidden away in the shadows, but shining bright under the spotlight.\n\nShe sighed, placing Emma's book back on its pedestal. *At least someone's still got it going on,* she thought, resentment simmering beneath her words like boiling water. She knew she shouldn't compare, that everyone had their own path and pace. But damn if it didn't hurt every time she saw another author's star rising while hers seemed to be falling."
