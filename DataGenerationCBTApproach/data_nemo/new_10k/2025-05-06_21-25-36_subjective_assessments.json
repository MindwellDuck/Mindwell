Then panic, cold as ice. Guard was down, and for a moment there, I was just another civilian. *Unacceptable.*"

It's a picture of you, younger and carefree, arm draped around someone who's no longer in your life.

What if he was still here?\" She sighed deeply, her shoulders slumping slightly as she leaned back into her chair.\n\n\"What if I'd said yes when he asked me to move with him?\" she mused aloud, her gaze never leaving the faded image. \"What if I hadn't been so stubborn about my career? What if...\" Her voice trailed off, lost in a whirlwind of 'what ifs'. She took another deep breath, trying to steady herself against the wave of sorrow and regret that threatened to consume her.\n\n\"But then again,\" she said softly, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth, \"what if I hadn't stayed here? What if I wouldn't have met all these amazing people who've become my family?\" She shook her head slightly, as if trying to clear it. \"It's funny how life works out, isn't it?\"\n\nShe looked back down at the photograph, her eyes welling up once more. \"I miss you,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible. \"I miss us.\" She took one last look before carefully placing the photograph back in its frame and setting it aside, lost in thought as she stared out into the quiet night."
