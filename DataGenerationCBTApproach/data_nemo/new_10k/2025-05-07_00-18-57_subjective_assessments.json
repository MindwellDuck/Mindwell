Nope, tonight's just little old me against the world.\n\nMr. Thompson? He's not just any patient, you know. He's like family. And now he's fighting for his life alone in that godforsaken hospital while I'm stuck here, twiddling my thumbs until some miracle happens. Because let's face it, no one else can get there fast enough to help him. That's just great.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the fact that no one bothered to call me earlier. I could've been there sooner, maybe made a difference. But nope, not tonight. Tonight's all about making do with what we have - and let's be real, that ain't much.\n\nSo here I am, staring at this damn clock like it's the enemy, waiting for seven o'clock to roll around so I can start running on fumes.

Today, however, one stood alone, untouched and cooling, like a forgotten echo of a once-full life.\n\nHer heart constricted, not with the familiar ache of grief, but with an unexpected flare of annoyance. It was as if his absence had suddenly become more pronounced, more deliberate, in that one cold circle of porcelain. She felt a surge of unfairness, a stark 'either-or' battle cry within her mind: either he was here, sharing their morning ritual, or he wasn't - and today, he most certainly wasn't.\n\nShe stared at the solitary mug, her reflection warped in its dark surface like a distorted mirror image. The warmth that should have been there, both in the cup and in their shared life, had faded completely. There was no in-between, no nuance to his absence - it was either full or empty, warm or cold, with her or without him. And today, she was painfully aware of being without."
