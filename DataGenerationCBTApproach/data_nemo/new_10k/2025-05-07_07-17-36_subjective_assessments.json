The silence was a physical thing, pressing against his ears like a heavy weight. He'd spent hours navigating the cacophony of the hospital ward, but now, he was swallowed by quietude. No clatter of pots from the kitchen, no hum of conversation drifting down the hallway.\n\nHe hung his coat with meticulous care, as if each precise fold could somehow fill the void left by her absence. His lunch box, a stark white against the polished wood of their entryway table, seemed to mock him in its emptiness. No warm meal waiting, no familiar voice calling out from behind the stove.\n\nHe moved through their home like a ghost, each step echoing loudly in the silence. The clock ticked away the seconds, each one stretching into an eternity of loneliness. He'd known her absence would be hard, but this... this was unbearable. Either she cared or she didn't. Either she was there or she wasn't. There was no in-between, no grey area to soften the blow.\n\nHe picked up his phone, the screen lighting up at his touch. No messages, no missed calls. Nothing. He felt a familiar anger bubble up inside him. She either cared enough to call or she didn't give a damn. There was no other possibility. He tossed the phone onto the couch and strode into their bedroom, leaving the harsh glare of the hallway light behind. Either he'd sleep alone tonight, or they'd have a fucking reckoning tomorrow. Anything in between was unacceptable."
