That's not comforting at all, by the way. It's like my body has forgotten how to crave human contact.\n\nThe kitchen, once our battlefield for who got to use the last of the milk, now feels like a desert. I mean, who needs two people's worth of cereal when you've only got one mouth to feed? I could see it now - me, alone in this apartment until the end of time, becoming one with the dust bunnies under the couch.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the loneliness. It's like a physical weight, pressing down on my chest, making each breath feel like a chore. It's not just sadness, it's this... this dread, you know?

As she poured herself a cup of coffee, the doorbell rang unexpectedly. Standing outside was an unfamiliar student, clutching a letter meant for her. \"Mrs.,\" he began, his voice wavering, \"the principal asked me to give this to you. He said it's... important.\" She took the envelope, feeling its light weight as if it were a stone. The seal bore the familiar stamp of the school district's office, but she knew what it was before opening it. Another round of budget cuts, another threat to her job. As she watched the boy walk away, his backpack swaying heavily on his shoulders, she felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness wash over her. This wasn't just about losing her job; it was about letting down those who mattered most.

It's still there, isn't it? A tangible reminder of her past, or rather, his presence.\n\nI must say, I'm quite taken aback by her audacity to hide this from me. After all these years, after all we've shared, she thought she could keep this little secret tucked away in our attic? How utterly ridiculous! It's not like I wasn't aware of her past, but this... this is something else entirely.\n\nI mean, really, who does she think she is? Does she not realize that her actions have consequences? That her past could come back to haunt us like this? I've always been the responsible one, the steady hand guiding our ship through life's storms. And now, this?\n\nIt's almost as if she wanted me to find it. A test of some sort, perhaps? To see how I'd react? Well, let me tell you, she'll be sorely disappointed if that was her intention. I won't make a scene, not after all these years. But mark my words, this isn't over.\n\nHow dare she put me in this position? How dare she force me to confront such a... such an *invasion* of our privacy? No, no, don't misunderstand me, it's not about the letter itself. It's about the principle of the thing. She should have known better than to keep secrets from me.\n\nBut then again, perhaps I'm being too hard on her. Maybe she didn't mean any harm. Maybe it was just a momentary lapse in judgment. Maybe... maybe I'm overreacting.\n\nNo, no, that can't be right. I'm not the one who made a mistake here. I'm not the one who hid something from our shared past. No, she did this.
