The sun dipped low outside, casting long shadows through the window, each one seeming to reach for her with accusatory fingers. She picked up a framed photo from her desk - a younger version of herself smiling beside her beloved dog, now gone. A sudden chill swept through her as she realized how much time had passed since that image was captured. She felt a pang in her heart and tears welled up in her eyes, not so much for the loss of her pet, but for the reminder of the solitude that seemed to have taken root in her life.",

It's either I'm here, bathed in the glow of these machines and my thoughts, or I'm out there, drowning in noise and crowds. There's no middle ground, no 'both'. It's always one extreme or the other.\n\nI picked up the photo, tracing the lines of my younger self's smile. Happy me, or sad me? There's no in-between when it comes to emotions either, is there? It's not like I can be content with a touch of melancholy thrown in for good measure. No, it's all or nothing.\n\nThe lab's quiet, sure, but that doesn't mean it's lonely. And solitude doesn't automatically equate to sadness, right? Yet here I am, feeling both those things acutely, as if they're the only two options on the menu. No room for nuance, no space for 'maybe a little bit of this, and a dash of that'.\n\nI set the photo back down, letting my fingers linger on the cool glass. Maybe it's not about extremes after all. Maybe it's just... different shades of one thing. But I wouldn't know how to paint those shades, would I? It's all black or white for me. Always has been.*"

I spent the entire day feeling guilty, avoiding eye contact with her, even though she seemed perfectly happy and oblivious to my supposed role in her new look.
