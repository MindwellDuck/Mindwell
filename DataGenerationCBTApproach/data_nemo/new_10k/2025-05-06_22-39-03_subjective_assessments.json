I just got a call from that snobby gallery owner, what's-his-name again? You know, the one with the pretentious mustache. He's canceling my exhibition. Yeah, you heard it right. Just like that.\n\nHe had the nerve to say my abstract collection isn't \"marketable\" enough. Can you believe it? I mean, who does he think he is, Picasso? And here I was, ready to hang up those babies tomorrow. Guess I'll just have to find another wall for them now, huh?\n\nHe probably thinks he's doing me a favor, but he doesn't get it. It's not like my stuff has ever been easy to sell. I mean, who wants to buy something they don't understand, right? Not that I'm complaining or anything.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Just thought you should know. Couldn't let the whole art world down without a little vent session, could I?\n\nCheers,\n[Artist's Name]"

Her partner stirred beside her, mumbling something about turning off the noise. She froze, her breath catching in her throat as she realized she couldn't remember setting the alarm last night.

She took a deep, shuddering breath, trying desperately to focus on the present moment instead of the terrifying what-ifs swirling in her head.

The familiar loops and curls sent me right back to our old home, to the days filled with her laughter echoing through the halls. It's been what, five years now since we last saw each other?\n\nHer birthday was just yesterday. Not that she cares about that anymore. She probably doesn't even remember it's my anniversary too. I mean, why would she? We're not family anymore.\n\nI couldn't focus on anything else after that. The rest of the papers might as well have been blank for all the attention I paid them. It's like everything was either Lily or nothing at all. My mind just... it just can't seem to find the middle ground today.\n\nI keep thinking about how things used to be, and now they're just... gone. Either you're family, or you're not. Either she remembers me, or she doesn't. There's no in-between with this ache in my heart. It's all consuming, like a black hole.\n\nI tried to tell myself it would get better, that tomorrow would be different. But I know how these things go. Tomorrow will either be the same, or worse. There's no happy medium where Lily and her laughter are concerned anymore. It's either all or nothing now. And right now, it feels like nothing at all.\n\nI should really try to get some sleep. Maybe tomorrow will bring a little perspective. Or maybe it won't. Either way, I'll just have to face it head-on, because that's what life is - one extreme or another, with no room for anything in between."
