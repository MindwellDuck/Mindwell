It had to be. She's probably entertaining now, laughing it up with some stranger while I'm stuck out here in this cold car, wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nI don't know how she could do this to me. To *us*. After everything we went through, she just throws it all away like it was nothing. It's not fair, Em. None of this is fair.\n\nGotta go, but I needed to vent.
