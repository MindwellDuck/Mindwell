She felt it seep into her bones, turning them to lead. Every word she'd written seemed like a condemnation now, each sentence a nail in the coffin of that shattered family.\n\n\"Dammit,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the TV in the other room. \"Why did I have to write about their goddamn pain? Why couldn't I just leave them alone?\"\n\nShe felt it, that familiar tightening in her chest, the one that always came when she thought about all the things she could've done differently.
