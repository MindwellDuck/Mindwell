He noticed something peculiar on his favorite mug, the one with the witty \"World's Best Teacher\" inscription. It was caked in dried remnants of yesterday's lunch - a half-eaten tuna sandwich, by the looks of it. His stomach churned as he picked up the offending item, the pungent odor of spoiled fish and moldy bread filling his nostrils. He felt a wave of disgust wash over him, not just at the sight, but at the thoughtlessness behind it.",

I mean, who the fuck leaves their moldy, god-awful tuna sandwich in someone else's mug? It's not like I don't have enough to deal with, what with lesson plans and grading papers until my eyes bleed.\n\nI swear, if it wasn't for me cleaning up after these lazy bastards, this place would be a fucking dumpster. I can't believe they just leave their crap lying around, expecting someone else to pick up the slack. It's always me who has to suffer because of their carelessness.\n\nI stood there, holding that god-awful mug, my stomach churning like I was on a damn rollercoaster. The smell was so bad, I thought I was going to hurl right then and there. And for what? Because some inconsiderate prick couldn't be bothered to wash their fucking dish.\n\nI spent the rest of the day feeling sick, not just from the stench, but from the sheer injustice of it all. Why should I have to clean up after them? It's not like they give a shit about me or my feelings. They don't care that I have to work twice as hard just to maintain some semblance of fucking order.\n\nI'm so tired of being the only one who gives a damn around here. If they won't shape up, maybe it's time for me to start shaping them up. Maybe I'll leave a note on their desks reminding them to be less fucking thoughtless. Or better yet, maybe I'll just start throwing their shit in the trash where it belongs.\n\nFuck, I can feel my blood pressure rising just thinking about it. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to deal with this shit. But here we are, because someone else was too fucking lazy to do their part.\n\nGoddammit, tomorrow's another day at this godforsaken place. I hope they choke on their fucking lunches.\n\n---"
