The clock ticked away the seconds mockingly, each one a reminder of another year passing without fanfare. He'd envisioned laughter echoing through the halls tonight, friends gathered around with cake and gifts. Instead, there was just him and the relentless ticking.\n\nHe tossed his coat onto the couch, the fabric landing in a crumpled heap, much like how he felt inside. His phone buzzed with notifications - pictures of friends at a bar, cheers-ing drinks, faces aglow with celebration. He scrolled through them, each one a stab to his heart. They looked so happy, so carefree. Not like him, stuck in the fluorescent-lit prison of the hospital.\n\nHe poured himself a drink, the amber liquid sloshing around like the envy swirling within him. He couldn't help but think about how different their lives were. They were out there living, while he was... he was what? Existing? Surviving? The words tasted bitter on his tongue.\n\nHis birthday should have been a celebration, not this solitary confinement. He felt a pang of resentment towards those who got to enjoy the night without him. Why them and not him? It wasn't fair. He deserved some happiness too, didn't he?\n\nBut even as these thoughts swirled in his mind, he couldn't shake off the feeling that maybe, just maybe, he wasn't meant for such joys. Maybe this was what he got for choosing duty over fun, responsibility over frivolity. Another year gone by, another silent celebration. It was his lot in life, he supposed, and there was no use crying over spilled milk.\n\nHe raised his glass to the silent room, a toast to another year of quiet existence. The clock continued its relentless ticking, each second echoing with his unspoken thoughts - why them, not him? Why them, not me?"
