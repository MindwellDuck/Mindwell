        "Triggering Event": "Scenario:\n\nHe was restocking the shelves at dusk, his worn hands trembling slightly with the weight of the boxes. A young couple walked in, laughing about something he couldn't hear, couldn't understand. They were her age once, him and Martha. He watched them, a pang of guilt twisting in his gut like a rusty knife. It had been three years since she passed, but some days it felt like yesterday, and others...others it felt like it was happening right now, him standing here alone while she was somewhere out there, waiting for him to notice her absence.\n\nThe couple approached the counter, their laughter fading as they noticed his somber gaze. He rang them up mechanically, his mind elsewhere, lost in the echoes of Martha's smile and the hollow silence of their empty home. As they left, the bell above the door chimed softly, a sound that once brought comfort but now only served to remind him of what he'd lost.\n\nHe looked down at the counter, at the dust gathering on the old register, and felt the guilt wash over him like a wave. He hadn't been back to her grave in weeks, too busy with work, too tired from the long days on his feet. But Martha had loved the garden there, the quiet peace of it all. She'd loved the birds that sang from the trees, their songs carrying through the open window as she tended to her flowers.\n\nHe closed up shop early, leaving the last few boxes unopened. He needed to see her, needed to tell her he was sorry, that he was trying his best, even if it didn't feel like enough. He drove home slowly, the guilt clawing at him with each mile that passed, but also a sense of determination burning within him. Tomorrow, he promised himself. Tomorrow, he would visit Martha and make things right.",

It was like his heart was a magnet, pulling all the sadness from the world towards it. So, when the couple walked in, laughing like there was no tomorrow, he couldn't help but feel annoyed. How could they be so happy when he was stuck here, drowning in this endless ocean of grief? Their laughter grated on him, a harsh reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nHe watched them leave, the bell chiming merrily behind them, and felt the anger rise within him like bile. Why did life go on for everyone else while his world had stopped spinning the day Martha died? It wasn't fair, not one bit. He should be out there, living, laughing, loving - not stuck here in this godforsaken store, surrounded by dust and memories.\n\nHe decided then, as he locked up early, that tomorrow would be different. He'd go to Martha's grave, tell her about his day, about the idiots who laughed too loud and the world that kept turning without them. And maybe, just maybe, she'd understand why he hadn't visited in so long. Maybe she'd see that it wasn't because he didn't care, but because he cared too much. Because every reminder of her loss was a knife twisting in his heart, and he couldn't bear to feel that pain any more than he already did."

But no, it's still 7 PM.\n\nI feel a lump form in my throat as I look at our wedding picture on the mantelpiece. Her smile seems brighter than mine, her eyes more vibrant. She was always the light of our home, and now... this emptiness.\n\nThe table feels bigger tonight, lonelier. The plates seem smaller, the cutlery quieter. I place them with a sigh, each one a silent accusation. Why aren't we four anymore? Why is it just me, setting the table for one?\n\nI try to remember her laughter echoing through the house, but all I hear is the ticking of the clock. It's too loud now, too present. I wish it would quiet down, leave me in peace. But no, it ticks on, a relentless reminder of what's missing.\n\nAs I sit down alone at the table, I can't help but think that this is how it will be from now on. Empty chairs, silent laughter, and just... too much time to myself. It's not fair. It was never supposed to be like this."
