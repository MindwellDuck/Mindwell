His wife's note lay crumpled beside it like a discarded thought, barely worth his notice.\n\nThe words blurred before him, \"Went out with friends... Leftovers in the fridge.\" He couldn't comprehend them, not when that damned bottle demanded all his attention. It was a symbol of her carelessness, her thoughtlessness. She hadn't even considered saving some dinner for him after his grueling shift. How could she?\n\nHe felt the resentment coil within him, tightening like a spring ready to snap. He couldn't see past the bottle, couldn't hear anything but its silent taunts. The quiet house, usually their sanctuary, now seemed oppressive, echoing with her absence and the weight of his anger.\n\nThe fridge hummed softly behind him, but he didn't turn around. There was no need to look for leftovers when that bottle was proof enough of her neglect. He stood there, rigid, arms crossed, eyes fixed on the empty vessel that had become the embodiment of every perceived slight and unmet expectation. Everything else faded into insignificance under his mental filter."

Here I was, drowning in sorrow, and there he was, seemingly untouched by it all. It wasn't fair. Why did others always seem to have it better? Even in grief, they managed to find some semblance of normalcy. Not me. I was left here, adrift in my misery, feeling like a ship lost at sea while everyone else sailed smoothly on calm waters.\n\nHe finally looked at me, his eyes filled with an emotion I couldn't quite decipher. 'I'm sorry,' he said, his voice distant, echoing the chasm that seemed to have grown between us.\n\nAnd there it was again - that unfair comparison, that constant feeling of disadvantage.
