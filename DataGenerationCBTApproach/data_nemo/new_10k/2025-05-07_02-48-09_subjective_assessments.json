As if I don't have enough on my plate! And those herbs... they were supposed to be for tonight's special. Now, thanks to our little friend here, it'll taste like ratatouille, whether I want it to or not.\n\nI could almost see the smirks around the table when I serve it up: *Oh, how quaint, the chef's trying to make do with a rat-infested kitchen.* Well, let me tell you, none of them would have the nerve to say that to my face. They know better than to mess with Chef Marie. So, it's just little me and Mr. Rat over here, having ourselves a grand old time. *You're laughing now,* I thought, glaring at the trap, *but we'll see who's got the last laugh when you're nothing but a memory.*"
