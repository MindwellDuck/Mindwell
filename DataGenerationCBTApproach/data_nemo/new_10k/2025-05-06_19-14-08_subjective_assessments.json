The mayor, with his steely gaze, would not deign to glance in my direction, let alone acknowledge me. Instead, he favored those fortunate enough to be born male, bestowing upon them his attention like one would scatter crumbs to pigeons. It was infuriating, truly maddening! How dare he dismiss me so brazenly? Did he not realize that I, too, had a story to tell, questions to ask? His behavior was nothing short of inexcusable. Really, it was high time someone held him accountable for such blatant disregard.\""

Each book he lifts out seems heavier than the last, weighted down with signatures and notes from admirers.

Contentment, pure and simple, spreads across his face. A warmth I haven't felt in years. I rub my own face, fingers tracing the lines etched there by time and stress. No laughter lives in these grooves, just worry and weariness.\n\nI turn away from the window, leaving the curtain to fall back into place. My eyes land on the stack of ungraded papers on my desk, their blank faces mocking me. \"You're not as good as him,\" they seem to say.
