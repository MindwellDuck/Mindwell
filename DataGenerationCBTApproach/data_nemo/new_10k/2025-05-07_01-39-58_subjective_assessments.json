What if they're hiding something from us?* I mean, why else would they be in there at this hour?\n\n*Shit, maybe it's not even maintenance.* Maybe they've been hacked or something. *Goddammit, not again!* I could almost feel the panic rising. This was just like that time last year when we thought someone had gotten into our system. I'd had to work late for weeks trying to fix that mess.\n\nI grabbed my phone, ready to call IT and demand some answers. But then I paused. *Wait, what if it's nothing?* What if I'm just overreacting? *Nah, can't be.* They're probably up to something down there. *Fuck it, I'll call.*\n\nBut before I could dial, the sound stopped.
