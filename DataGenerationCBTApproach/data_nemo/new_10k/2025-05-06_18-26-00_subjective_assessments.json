Like I could forget.\n\nI toss it into the trash with more force than necessary. Why bother opening it? What good will that do me? It's not like the numbers are going to magically change. It'll just be another depressing reminder of how little progress I've made, month after month.\n\nI slump onto my couch in the darkness. There's no point in even looking at it now.

But no, it had to be here, reminding me of what I'd missed, of what I'd failed to do. It's not fair, really. She knew how busy I was, how tired I always seemed.
