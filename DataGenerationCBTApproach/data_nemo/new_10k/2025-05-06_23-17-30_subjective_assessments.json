He found himself ensconced in his study, the room bathed in a soft, warm glow from the lamplight, as it was every evening since she'd been gone. The photograph of Elizabeth, taken on their last vacation to Paris, stared back at him with her signature smile\u2014the one that crinkled her eyes just so.\n\nToday had been different, though. A parent had approached him after class, expressing gratitude for his patience and dedication towards their struggling son. Richard had merely smiled, offered a polite \"you're welcome,\" and moved on. But as he sat here now, Elizabeth's smile seemed to mock him, whispering accusations in the silence.\n\n*You should have been there for me,* her eyes seemed to say. *You should have found a way.*\n\nHe couldn't shake off the guilt that clung to him like a second skin. It was just one student, he tried to rationalize, but it felt like so much more. Like a betrayal of Elizabeth's memory, a slight against the life they'd built together.\n\nThe other students' progress, their laughter, and even the joy he found in teaching\u2014it all seemed inconsequential now. His mental filter was firmly locked onto this single detail: he was failing her, just as he had failed to save her from the cruel hands of fate. The rest of his life, the whole picture, blurred into insignificance under the weight of this one thought.\n\nAs Richard continued to gaze at Elizabeth's photograph, he felt another pang of self-reproach. He would ensure tomorrow was different. He would be different. After all, hadn't she always been his guiding star?"

His breathing was shallow, and his hands, once strong and capable, now lay limp in his lap.\n\nShe walked over to him, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. \"Mr. Thompson?\" she called softly, but there was no response. She felt his pulse, finding it weak and thready. Panic began to rise within her, but she pushed it down, falling back into the practiced routines of her profession.\n\nAs she prepared to call for backup, she noticed a small, faded photograph tucked into Mr. Thompson's shirt pocket. It was a picture of him as a young man, standing proudly beside a woman who shared his smile. His wife, she remembered, who had passed away some years ago. A sudden, profound sadness washed over her. She knew that feeling all too well.\n\nThe melancholy weighed heavy on her heart as she realized that Mr. Thompson was slipping away. Another life, another love story coming to an end.
