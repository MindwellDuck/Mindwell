Typically, the air would be filled with the melodious hums of my partner harmonizing with Mozart or Bach. Yet now, it was as if time had frozen, except for the soft tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.\n\nMy gaze fell upon the canvas where she usually left traces of her artistic musings. Today, however, there was only a single sentence scrawled across it: 'I can't do this anymore.' I frowned, rubbing my chin thoughtfully as if trying to decipher an intricate code.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, we've had our fair share of disagreements. But each time, we've managed to weather the storm together. This situation seemed no different. After all, she'd left behind her paints and brushes, untouched and ready for use. Surely, if she meant it, she wouldn't have abandoned her tools?\n\nI picked up a paintbrush myself, running my fingers along its bristles as I pondered. The canvas was still fresh, the colors vibrant - almost begging to be used. It seemed like such a waste not to create something beautiful from this moment of silence.\n\nIn any case, I reasoned, perhaps she just needed some space today. Everyone has those days when inspiration takes a vacation, right? It didn't mean anything significant or lasting. And besides, we'd had plenty of good times here together - more than enough to outweigh this one little blip on our artistic radar.\n\nWith that thought, I set about mixing colors on my palette, ready to transform the blank canvas into something worthy of our shared studio space. After all, what was one quiet day amidst countless others filled with music and laughter? It certainly didn't warrant any drastic action or change in plans.\n\nAs I began to paint, I couldn't help but feel that everything would be just fine once she returned. Why dwell on the negative when there were so many positive aspects of our shared artistic journey?"

It seems, Thomas, that *never* do you consider the source of these innovative thoughts; they are always yours and yours alone to claim.\n\nI am left with no choice but to bring this matter to light, to ensure that the board is fully aware of the true origin of these 'new' ideas. I believe transparency is key in our line of work, don't you agree?
