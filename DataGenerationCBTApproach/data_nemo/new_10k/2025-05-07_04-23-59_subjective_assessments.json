His peers laugh heartily.\n\n**John's Reaction:**\n\n*John felt his cheeks flush instantly at the sight of the meme. He could feel every chuckle from his colleagues like a physical blow to his chest. They must think I'm just another clich\u00e9, he thought, his mind racing. He couldn't believe they'd laugh so openly about something so personal. Didn't they know how hard he worked to keep fit despite his late-night cravings? He gripped the edge of his desk tightly, knuckles turning white.*\n\n*He tried to concentrate on the briefing, but all he could hear was their laughter echoing in his mind. Each chuckle seemed like a mockery directed at him alone, a silent accusation. He felt exposed, humiliated. Even the steaming cup of coffee he usually enjoyed couldn't warm the sudden chill that had settled in his bones.*\n\n*As the briefing ended and his peers started leaving, John couldn't shake off the feeling that they were looking at him differently now. He imagined their whispers behind his back, their eyes judging him. He stood taller, shoulders squared, determined to prove them wrong.*"

It was his glove, the one he always wore while baking, still bearing traces of flour from their last shared endeavor.

She had always laughed at him for being particular about wearing gloves while baking, but now, it felt as though he had taken even that trivial habit with him when he left.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes, unnoticed and unshed, as she set down the roast with meticulous care. The kitchen, once filled with warmth and shared stories, now felt cold and empty. She turned away from the glove, unable to bear its silent reproach. As she stepped out of the kitchen, she left behind not just a meal for one, but also a piece of her heart that she wasn't quite ready to face."
