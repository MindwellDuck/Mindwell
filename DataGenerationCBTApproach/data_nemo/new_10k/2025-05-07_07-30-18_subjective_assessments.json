The familiar scent of aged paper and dust filled her nostrils as she stepped into the dim light. There, amidst the yellowed photographs and decaying books, lay her late husband's microscope, untouched since his passing a year ago. A lone speck of dust danced in the beam of sunlight, catching her eye before settling gently onto the lens. She reached out to touch it, but paused, her fingers trembling. Instead, she clutched her chest, feeling the sorrow well up within her like an incoming tide.",

And the noise on the line when he called last time? It was like a knife twisting in my gut. How am I supposed to sleep knowing he's all by himself out there? And this house... it's so quiet now. Used to be full of life, laughter. Now it's just echoes and shadows. I swear, every creak of the floorboards is Jake falling down some stairs or something. And his dad's not even here to help share the worry. Divorce was hard enough without him being halfway across the country too. I check my phone one more time - no messages, no calls. But what if something happened? What if he needs me and I'm just... lying here? I can't turn off this tape in my head, you know? It's all Jake, all the time. When will this night end?\""
