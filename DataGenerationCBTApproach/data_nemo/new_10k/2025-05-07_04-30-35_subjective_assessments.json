Maybe they've been talking all this time and never said anything to me?\n\nIt's addressed to him, but it's thick. Heavy with secrets, I bet. I can feel it in my hands. It feels like a bad omen, you know? Like whatever's inside is going to ruin everything.\n\nI shouldn't open it. It's not mine. But what if... What if he's hiding something? Something big enough that they felt they had to communicate through letters? Oh God, what if she's threatening him or something?\n\nI can feel the panic rising in me. My heart's pounding like I've just run a marathon. This is it, isn't it? The thing that's going to destroy our marriage. It's all falling apart before I even know what's inside.\n\nBut maybe... Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe it's nothing bad at all. Maybe she just wanted to reach out, apologize for whatever happened between them. Maybe they've made up and he was waiting for the right time to tell me...\n\nNo, no, that can't be it. Not with how long this has been sitting here unopened. This is something big. Something awful. I know it. I just know it.\n\nI can't open it now. Not when I'm like this. But later... Later, I'll find out what's inside. And then... Then everything will change. Everything always does.*"
