They won't care that I spend hours planning, that I'm here 'til eight most nights.* I can feel the headache coming on already.\n\n*I can't do this anymore,* I think to myself. *It's too hard, too much.* But then I remember little Jamie last year. She didn't understand fractions for months. Then one day, click! It all made sense. She beamed at me like I was her personal hero.\n\n*That's what keeps me going.* Those moments.
