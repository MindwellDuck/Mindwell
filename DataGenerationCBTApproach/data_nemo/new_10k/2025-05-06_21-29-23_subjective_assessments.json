You've taught at the same high school for over two decades. One evening, while grading papers, you come across an unsigned essay that resonates deeply with you.\n\n**Text:**\n\nAs I flipped through the stack of essays, my eyes caught something unusual in Emma's work. She was usually a straightforward writer, but this time her words seemed to dance around a heavier topic. I could almost feel her hesitation as I read about her 'challenging' home life. No specifics, just hints here and there, like she was tiptoeing around a landmine.\n\nI leaned back in my worn-out leather chair, the scent of aged paper and dust filling my nostrils. A shiver ran down my spine. What if Emma's situation at home was worse than I imagined? What if she needed help but didn't know how to ask for it? The 'what-ifs' kept piling up, each one darker than the last.\n\nI found myself pacing around my small study, the ticking of my grandfather clock echoing in the silence. I should reach out to her, but what if I made things worse? What if she wasn't ready to talk about it? Or what if she was embarrassed that I'd noticed?\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my thinning hair. I'd always prided myself on being perceptive, but this time, I felt blind. I picked up my phone to call Emma, then hesitated. What if I was overreacting? What if she thought I was prying?\n\nI put the phone down, my mind still racing with 'what-ifs'. It was late, and I had an early start tomorrow. But sleep seemed miles away now, each silent tick of the clock echoing like a question mark in my mind."

She knew, just knew, that her roommate must have gone out without bothering to tell her. Again. How else could the apartment be so silent? No TV humming in the background, no faint clatter of dishes being washed in the kitchen. She sighed, dropping her bag onto the worn-out couch, leaving a small cloud of flour dust in its wake.\n\nHer eyes flitted towards the wilting plants on the windowsill. Their leaves were drooping, thirsty for water she hadn't bothered giving them all week. She felt a pang of guilt, but it was quickly overshadowed by irritation. How could she be expected to care for them properly when her roommate didn't even bother to communicate? It's not like she had the time or energy to play plant mother on top of everything else.\n\nShe tossed her coat over the armchair, already knowing it would earn her a lecture tomorrow about keeping things tidy. Her roommate was always so critical, always finding fault in something she did. She could practically hear their voice in her head, \"Really, couldn't you have hung that up?\" She rolled her eyes, muttering to herself, \"Yes, yes, I'm a terrible person for not hanging up my coat.\"\n\nShe slumped onto the couch, turning on the TV without really seeing what was playing. Her mind was too busy replaying the day's events, each one twisting into evidence of her roommate's thoughtlessness. She didn't need to see their face or hear their voice to know they were judging her. It was written in every unmade bed, every untidy corner, every wilting plant. And yet, she couldn't help but feel that if only they would communicate better, everything would be fine. If only they'd tell her what they expected of her, maybe she could live up to it."
