The fridge hummed softly, its light flickering on as she opened it to reveal nothing but a half-empty bottle of milk and a wilting lettuce leaf. She closed the door, leaning against it for a moment before moving to the living room. The couch looked lonelier than ever, the cushions still indented from last night's TV marathon, now cold and uninviting. She sat down, picking up the remote, but her gaze fell on the framed photo of her late husband laughing at their wedding. She hadn't noticed before how dusty it was, how much he'd faded with time. Tears pricked her eyes, not just for him, but for herself, alone in this vast city, her life reduced to a handful of hours each day filled with the sizzle of pans and the chatter of strangers. The loneliness was a heavy weight on her shoulders, a constant hunger that no amount of cooking could satisfy. She sighed, switching off the light, letting the darkness swallow her whole.",

She'd wake up to the sunlight streaming through the window, the bed beside her cold and empty. Her husband's side hadn't been touched since that fateful day two years ago. She'd drag herself out of bed, padding downstairs to make coffee, the silence of the house weighing heavy on her shoulders.\n\nAs she waited for the kettle to boil, she'd glance out the window at Mrs. Thompson next door, hanging laundry in her immaculate garden. Her husband would be nearby, helping with the kids, laughter echoing through their open windows. A pang of jealousy would hit her, sharp and unexpected. Why did they get to have that? Why not her?\n\nShe'd rush through her morning, avoiding looking out the window again, but she could still hear them. Their happiness was a stark contrast to her own silent, empty house. It felt like a physical ache, a reminder of what she didn't have.\n\nAt work, it was no better. She'd watch her colleagues interact, their laughter echoing through the bustling restaurant kitchen. They had partners who came home to them every night, kids they could call theirs. She'd feel her chest tightening, her breath coming in short gasps. Why did everyone else get to have a life but her?\n\nEvenings were the worst. She'd sit alone in her apartment, the silence deafening after the bustling kitchen she'd left behind. She'd look around at the bare walls, the untouched furniture, and feel a wave of inadequacy wash over her. Why couldn't she be like them? Happy, fulfilled, complete.\n\nShe'd turn on the TV, flipping through channels until she found something mindless enough to distract her from her thoughts. But even then, she couldn't escape the comparisons. The happy families in sitcoms, the successful careers in dramas. It was a constant reminder of what she didn't have, of how much she was lacking.\n\nShe'd sigh, switching off the light, letting the darkness swallow her whole. Another day alone, another night spent comparing herself to others. She didn't know how to stop it, didn't know how to silence that little voice in her head that whispered, \"You're not enough.\" She just knew she was drowning in a sea of comparisons, and she couldn't find the shore."

Her husband of forty years, now retired, had waited for her in the car, his eyes lighting up as he saw her approach. He held out a small box wrapped in silver paper, \"A little something from our neighbor, Mrs. Thompson.\" Inside was a delicate gold necklace, a thank you gift for treating her daughter's allergic reaction. She felt a pang in her chest, not at the gesture, but at the whispered words that followed, \"She said it was too much to give to Dr. Lee.\"",

It was beautiful, exquisite even. A gift from Mrs. Thompson, our patient's mother, for treating her daughter's allergic reaction. My heart swelled at first, warmth spreading through me like the sun breaking through clouds.\n\nThen, I heard his words again, \"She said it was too much to give to Dr. Lee.\" The warmth receded, replaced by a chill that seemed to freeze my very core. Too much? I'm not 'too much,' am I? I'm just... me. Just the doctor who spent hours with her daughter, who explained, who cared.\n\nI felt a sting behind my eyes, but I blinked it away. It's not about me, I told myself sternly. But the seed of doubt had been planted. Too much. Those two words echoed in my mind like a harsh judgment. Was that what people thought of me? Was that why patients left without saying goodbye, why colleagues avoided me in the hallways?\n\nI couldn't shake off the feeling of being labeled, of being found wanting. It was as if I was suddenly seen through a different lens, one that made me feel small and unworthy. My hands, they'd held so many, now felt too large, too clumsy. My voice, once steady and reassuring, seemed to crack at the edges.\n\nI stared at the necklace, its golden glimmer now tarnished in my eyes. It was a gift meant to express gratitude, but it felt like a badge of shame. Too much. The words hung heavy around my neck, heavier than any necklace could ever be. I couldn't help but wonder, if this was how others saw me, what hope did I have?"
