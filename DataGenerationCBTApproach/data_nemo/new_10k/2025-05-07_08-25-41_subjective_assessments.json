A receipt, John\u2014from our restaurant, of all places! But do you know what struck me most? It wasn't the fancy wine we couldn't afford, nor the delicious steak that you claimed to have ordered for yourself. No, it was the name scribbled so carelessly at the bottom.\n\nAlways, John.

It seems like every time I turn around, there's a trace of another woman in our life\u2014our home, our routines. Never just you and me anymore, is there?\n\nI'm not saying this to cause a scene or start an argument. Frankly, I don't have the energy for that today.

It feels like my whole world has been invaded, infiltrated by some faceless interloper who seems to be stealing your affections right under my nose.\n\nI've tried to brush it off before, convincing myself that it was just a one-off, an isolated incident. But now? Now, I can't help but feel this creeping suspicion that perhaps our entire relationship has been built on shifting sands, always teetering on the brink of collapse. It's exhausting, John. It truly is.\n\nI'm not asking for much\u2014just some honesty, some transparency. Because right now, it feels like I don't even know you anymore. And maybe that's my fault too, maybe I've been so caught up in my own little world that I missed the signs. But John, please, help me understand what's happening here.\n\nI'll be waiting for your explanation. Until then, I'll just be over here, trying to piece together this puzzle that seems to be growing more complex by the day.\n\nYours, with a heavy heart,\nSarah"
