Her cat, Whiskers, had passed last year, leaving behind an even deeper void. She heated up a solitary meal in the microwave, the hum of the appliance echoing through the silent rooms. As she sat down to eat, she noticed her reflection in the window - a lone figure in the dimly lit kitchen. The empty chair across from her seemed to mock her solitude. She ate quickly, eager to escape the emptiness, but there was nowhere to go except to bed, where she would lie awake, listening to the night's quiet whispers.",

The clock ticks louder than usual, too, like it's taunting me with each second that passes without his little purrs echoing through these silent rooms.\n\nI shouldn't have to heat up my dinner alone, should I? It's not like I asked for this empty nest. Whiskers was supposed to be here, greeting me at the door, rubbing against my legs while I cooked. That was the plan, wasn't it?\n\nAnd now, look at me. Alone in my kitchen, eating like some sort of hermit. This isn't how it's supposed to be. Life shouldn't be like this. I should have someone to share a meal with, laugh with, complain about work with. But no, here I am, talking to myself - or rather, at myself. Pathetic.\n\nThis bloody empty chair across from me... It's just another reminder of what I don't have. What I shouldn't have to endure. It's mocking me, dammit. \"Why aren't you married yet?\" \"Why don't you have kids?\" \"Why is your life so fucking lonely?\" That's what it feels like tonight.\n\nI should be able to enjoy a quiet dinner in peace, not feel like I'm being judged by an empty chair. Life shouldn't be this way. It's not fair."

I mean, cats are replaceable, but my girlfriend... well, not anymore, I guess.\n\nThe coffee from the break room tasted bitter too. Everything's turning sour, like it's all my fault somehow. I should've done something, said something, been someone different...\n\nAnd the patrol car, it felt so empty without her there, chattering away about nothing.
