A family of four sat around their kitchen table, laughter echoing through the scene like it was captured mid-conversation. The fine china we'd sold them years ago gleamed under the soft glow of the table lamp, a stark contrast to the chipped mugs I had at home.\n\nI felt a pang of envy as I observed the scene. Here they were, laughing and enjoying each other's company over a shared meal, while my dinner tonight would likely be a solitary affair with the leftovers in my fridge. I couldn't help but think that their china must have cost them a fortune, far more than what mine had been worth. It wasn't fair, really.\n\nBut then again, maybe it was just me. Perhaps they'd picked up the china at a yard sale or something. No need to be so dramatic about it all, I told myself. Still, as I walked out into the cool evening air, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being left behind somehow. Just another day, I suppose."
