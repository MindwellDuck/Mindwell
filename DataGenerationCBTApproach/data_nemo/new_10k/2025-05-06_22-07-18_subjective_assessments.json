Found nothing but dust bunnies and echoes of laughter - hers, not mine. Her voice still lingers here, like a ghost that won't leave the party. She used to laugh loudest when I'd paint her, said it brought life to my art. Now all I hear is static, broken promises whispered in every tick of the clock.\n\nI must've dozed off at some point, because next thing I know, it's dark outside and my neck's cricked from leaning over that damn canvas.
