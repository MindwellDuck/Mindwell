Each stroke would be a struggle, each color choice a monumental decision that would never quite feel right. Her stomach churned at the thought of the days turning into weeks, of the studio filling up with more and more unfinished paintings, each one a testament to her fading talent. She felt it already - the overwhelming urge to give up, to walk away from this life she'd once loved because it was too hard, too painful now. It would be easier to just let it all go, to let herself disappear into the shadows of what could have been. But she knew that wasn't an option. She had to try, even if it meant facing that awful, empty canvas every day until her arms gave out and her heart broke completely."
