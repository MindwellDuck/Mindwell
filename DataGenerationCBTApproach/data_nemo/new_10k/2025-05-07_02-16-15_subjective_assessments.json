His wife's favorite restaurant was closed; they'd always gone there after his late shifts. Now it was boarded up, another casualty of time and change.

The once vibrant restaurant that he and his late wife had cherished was now a desolate shell, its windows boarded up like an accused criminal awaiting sentencing. He could feel the familiar bitterness rise within him, as if the very air he breathed was tainted by this latest reminder of time's unyielding march forward.\n\nHe paused for a moment, his reflection in the rain-soaked glass seeming to stare back at him with accusation. The city lights seemed harsher tonight, their usual glow replaced by a cold, unforgiving glare that mirrored his own feelings. He had always prided himself on being a man of science, yet he couldn't help but feel a sense of profound loss at this latest change in the landscape of his life.\n\nAs he continued walking, he noticed other signs of decay around him - the crumbling fa\u00e7ade of an old theater, the empty lot where a once-thriving market had stood. Each one seemed like a personal affront, a testament to how little control he truly had over his world. He could feel the weight of these changes pressing down on him, each one heavier than the last.\n\nYet, amidst all this decay, there were signs of life and growth - new shops opening their doors, families playing in the park across the street. But Dr. H. found himself unable to appreciate them, his vision clouded by the negatives that seemed so much more prominent. It was as if a veil had descended over his eyes, allowing only the darkest aspects of his world to filter through.\n\nHe sighed heavily, his breath misting in the cold air. This wasn't like him, he knew. He was Dr. Henry Thompson, renowned surgeon and respected member of the community. He should be able to look beyond these changes, to see the good that remained. But tonight, all he could see were the ruins of a once-thriving neighborhood, a stark reminder of his own mortality and the impermanence of everything he held dear.\n\nAs he reached his apartment building, he paused for one last glance at the empty restaurant. Its darkness seemed to mock him, daring him to find joy in this new world that seemed so intent on leaving him behind. With another heavy sigh, Dr. H. entered his building, the warmth inside doing little to dispel the chill that had settled deep within him."
