After all these years... It's like he's fucking haunting me from beyond the grave.\n\nHe goes on about our future together - \"When we're old and gray, we'll sit in that garden, watchin' our grandkids play.\" Fuck, we never got that chance. All 'cause I snapped at him over some stupid shit - a fucking spilled cup of coffee, can you believe it? Now it's like every goddamn word between us was important, like he's accusin' me even from the grave.\n\nI feel this weight on my chest, like his ghost is sittin' right here with me, judgin' me for that argument. \"Why did you have to go?\" I wanna scream at him. But it's too fucking late now. It's always too fucking late.\n\nThis letter... It's like he's reachin' out from the past, tryin' to tell me somethin'. Like it's my fault we never got that future.

Not when they'd rejected this one. His past accomplishments were just cheap trinkets, shiny baubles that meant nothing in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHe pushed his plate away, a sudden urge to leave surging through him. *I'm done with this place,* he thought, glancing at the receipt on the table. He left some money, enough to cover the food he hadn't touched and a generous tip for the waitress who'd been kind. But it didn't matter. None of it did. Not when his work, his life's blood, was being dismissed like this.\n\nDr. X stood up, buttoning his coat against the chill that seemed to seep into him from the very air. *No more wasted lunches,* he thought, stepping out onto the bustling street. He'd go back to his lab, where his calculations were always right, where his theories were king. Out here in the real world, they didn't count for anything anyway."
