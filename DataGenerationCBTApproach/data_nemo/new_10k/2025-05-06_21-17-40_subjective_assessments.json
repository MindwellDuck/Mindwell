Yet there it was, daring to disrupt my pristine, ordered kitchen.\n\nI picked it up between my thumb and index finger, holding it at arm's length as if it were some sort of contaminant. *How did this manage to find its way here?* I mused, my brow furrowing in annoyance. I had hired a cleaning service, for God's sake. They were supposed to leave no trace behind, not litter my space with such trivialities.\n\nI tossed the offending item into the trash with more force than was necessary. *There,* I thought, satisfied. Gone, just like that. As if it never existed at all. It wasn't as if anyone else would see it or care about its existence. After all, who would notice something so inconsequential? Certainly not me. I had more important things on my mind.\n\nI continued preparing my lunch, the clatter of pots and pans echoing through the empty apartment.

Something I couldn't quite put my finger on.\n\nBut whatever it was, I pushed it aside, just as I had done with the tea bag tag. It didn't matter. None of this mattered. Not really. I had more important things to focus on. After all, who has time for such trivialities? Certainly not me."
