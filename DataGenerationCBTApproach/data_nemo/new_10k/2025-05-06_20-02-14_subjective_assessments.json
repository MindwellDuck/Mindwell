His wife sat at the table, her hands wrapped around a mug of tea that had grown cold. He couldn't bring himself to look at her, not after what he'd done.\n\nHe'd been careless, hadn't checked the expiration date on the cream before whisking it into the sauce. It was a rookie mistake, one he'd made thousands of times in his younger years but never since becoming head chef at Le Jardin Noir. But today, it had happened. His dish, the centerpiece of their anniversary dinner, spoiled by his negligence.\n\nHe saw her reflection in the window, her eyes red and puffy from crying. He remembered the first time he'd cooked for her, how she'd laughed at his nervousness, how she'd clapped when she took that first bite. That was before the restaurant, before the Michelin stars, before everything had become about perfection.\n\nHe could feel her gaze on him now, heavy with disappointment and something else - hurt. He'd let her down, not just as a chef but as a husband. He thought of all the years they'd spent together, all the meals they'd shared, and how this one mistake had marred it all.\n\nHe turned to face her, his shoulders slumped in defeat. \"I'm sorry,\" he said softly, his voice barely audible over the pattering rain. She looked up at him, her eyes filled with unshed tears, and nodded. But it was a cold nod, devoid of warmth or forgiveness. And that made his remorse all the more profound.",
