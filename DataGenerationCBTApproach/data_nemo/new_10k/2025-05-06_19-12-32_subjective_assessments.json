What if this time is different?* He shook his head, trying to dislodge the thoughts, but they clung like leeches, feeding off his worry.\n\n*Enough,* he growled, slamming his palm against the wheel. *Just get there.* But even as he sped through the empty streets, the 'what ifs' echoed in his mind, a chorus of dreadful possibilities that threatened to drown him."
