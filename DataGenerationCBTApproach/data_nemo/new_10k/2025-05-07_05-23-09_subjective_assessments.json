A child, enjoying a carefree moment while he was stuck in the grim reality of another patient's declined health. His grip tightened around the clipboard, veins bulging on his aged hands. The room spun as he imagined that laughter coming from the child who had just been diagnosed with leukemia. He marched out, face flushed, and snapped at the receptionist to \"control those brats.\"",

His face felt warm as he stepped out, addressing the receptionist with an edge in his voice, \"Ms. Harris, perhaps you could remind our young patients that this isn't a playground? We have sick people here, after all.\" He didn't wait for a response before retreating back into his office, the laughter still ringing in his ears like a discordant note he couldn't silence."

The house was filled with the familiar cacophony of digital gunshots and explosions, a symphony of victory that seemed to drown out everything else. She had hoped, perhaps foolishly, that he would pause his game, turn to her with a smile, and ask about her day. But no such luck.\n\nShe stood there for a moment, her reflection in the hallway mirror showing a woman with lines etched around her eyes, hair slightly disheveled from the long day. She sighed, turning away from her reflection as if it might accuse her of something.\n\n\"Promotion, indeed,\" she said quietly to herself, shaking her head at the irony. The email had arrived just as she was leaving work, a small notification on her phone that seemed to mock her now. \"Head Librarian Position Filled.\" She had expected it, really; they'd offered it to that young buck fresh out of library school, with his shiny degree and eager smile.\n\nHer footsteps echoed softly in the empty hallway as she made her way to their bedroom, each step feeling heavier than the last. The room was dark, the curtains drawn tightly against the encroaching night. She sat down on the edge of the bed, her hands trembling slightly as she began to unbutton her blouse.\n\n\"Well, at least someone's happy,\" she said, glancing over at his closed door. She could hear him now, laughing loudly at something in his game. She sighed again, this time feeling a pang of resentment. Why couldn't he just... notice? Just once?\n\nShe finished undressing and slipped into bed, turning off the light with a decisive click. The room was pitch black now, but she didn't mind. It hid the unshed tears in her eyes, the ones that refused to fall despite the lump forming in her throat.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow will be better,\" she whispered into the darkness, her voice barely audible over the distant sound of her husband's victorious shouts. But even as she said it, she couldn't shake the feeling of dread that settled in her stomach like a stone. Tomorrow was just another day at the library, after all. Another day of quiet, unnoticed service. Another day of watching someone else take what should have been hers.\n\nAnd yet, despite the bitterness that coated her tongue and the heaviness in her heart, she couldn't help but think, \"At least he's having fun.\" Because even now, even after all this, she couldn't bear to minimize his happiness. Not when hers seemed so fragile, so easily overlooked."
