It wasn't hard to figure out her thoughts, was it? She didn't care, not really. Her mind must have been elsewhere, too busy for his wife's life on that thin paper. He could feel it, the resentment boiling inside him, bubbling up with each stroke of that unfamiliar pen. Why should he be left cleaning up after her negligence? It wasn't fair. She probably thought he was overreacting, but she didn't know, did she? She couldn't possibly understand what it felt like to see his wife's name there, faded and forgotten. No, she wouldn't comprehend the anger simmering in him now, not until she stood in his shoes."

An unopened condom. *Fuck*.\n\nShe tried to push the thought away, but it was already there, growing, festering. *What if he's been sneaking off with someone? What if I'm not enough for him anymore?* She could feel the panic rising, her breath coming in short gasps. *What if this is just the beginning of something worse?*\n\nHer mind raced, each thought more horrifying than the last. She hugged his bag to her chest, as if it held some clue that could explain away what she was feeling. But there was no explanation, only a thousand 'what ifs' swirling in her head like a storm. *What if he comes home tonight and tells me it's over? What if I lose him because of this?*\n\nShe knew she should calm down, think rationally. But how could she when every fiber of her being screamed with uncertainty? She couldn't shake off the 'what ifs', each one a knife twisting in her heart. She just wanted to know, *needed* to know what was going on. Even if it meant finding out something she didn't want to know at all."
