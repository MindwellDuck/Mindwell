He'd been coming here for decades, but today it felt different. Colder. Empty. His late wife's picture still smiled at him from the desk, her eyes following him as he moved around the room.\n\nHe noticed a new email notification on his computer. It was from the university, congratulating a young researcher on winning an award for their work in astrophysics - his wife's field of expertise. He felt a familiar sting, a bitterness that had become all too common since her passing five years ago.\n\nHe clicked through to the researcher's profile picture. A young woman with bright eyes and a wide smile stared back at him, seemingly taunting him with her youth and vitality. His wife would have been around her age now if she were still alive. The bitterness grew stronger, settling in his chest like a stone.\n\nHe looked back at the email, his vision blurring slightly as he read the words of praise for the young researcher's work. He couldn't help but think that it should have been his wife receiving these accolades, not some stranger. The bitterness turned into anger, and he felt a sudden urge to lash out, to scream, to break something.\n\nBut he didn't. Instead, he closed the email with a quiet click of the mouse, turned off the computer, and left the lab without looking back at his wife's picture.

His late wife's picture seemed to watch him, her smile now a grim reminder of what once was and never would be again.\n\nHe clicked on the email, his eyes scanning the lines of praise for some stranger who dared to tread in his wife's territory. Astrophysics, his wife's passion, now belonged to this interloper. The words blurred before him as he read about her achievements, each one a knife twist in his heart. It should have been my wife, he thought bitterly. She deserved this, not some upstart with no history, no memory of the battles fought and won in these very halls.\n\nHe felt anger rising within him like bile, a hot, acidic burn against the cold bitterness already settled in his chest. He wanted to lash out, to scream at the unfairness of it all, but he knew there was nowhere for that rage to go. So, he closed the email with a quiet click, turning off the computer as if severing a lifeline.\n\nWalking home through the rain, he let the cold drops wash over him, each one a tiny, insignificant punishment for his inability to save her, to keep her here where she belonged. He felt no warmth from the weather, no comfort in the familiar streets. Just emptiness and loss, a chasm that would never be filled by anyone else's achievements, no matter how impressive."
