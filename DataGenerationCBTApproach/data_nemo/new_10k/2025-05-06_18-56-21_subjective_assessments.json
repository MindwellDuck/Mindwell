If only they'd pick up after themselves once in a while, maybe I wouldn't be in this mess right now.\n\nI've got a deadline breathing down my neck, and here I am, playing detective because someone can't keep their stuff straight. It's not like I asked for this. I'm the one who has to suffer because they can't be bothered to help out around here. Typical.

I am writing to address a disappointing trend that has come to my attention regarding your children's history essays.\n\nUpon grading this week's assignments, I discovered that more than half of the class has submitted work that was directly copied from online sources. This lack of original thought and effort is deeply troubling. It seems we are facing another bout of academic dishonesty, something I had hoped our previous discussions on integrity would have prevented.\n\nI can already foresee the uphill struggle this will be - more detentions, more lectures on plagiarism. The very thought of it makes my head throb. I simply cannot comprehend how these young minds can be so blas\u00e9 about cheating. It's as if they're determined to make my job even more arduous than it already is.\n\nI anticipate a wave of excuses and apologies, but actions speak louder than words. This incident will not go unpunished or unlearned. I expect your full cooperation in reinforcing the importance of academic integrity at home. We must collectively ensure that such incidents do not recur.\n\nMark my words, this semester is shaping up to be a challenging one. But together, we can steer our children back onto the path of honesty and hard work. Let us not lose sight of the values we aim to instill in them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. Thompson\nHistory Department"
