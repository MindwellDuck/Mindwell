The newspaper she'd been clutching crumples in her fist as she strides towards him, seated at his laptop. \"You knew,\" she growls, thrusting the paper in his face. \"You fucking knew about the story and you didn't tell me.\" His eyes meet hers, apologetic, but it only fuels her anger.

But all I see is that familiar, apologetic look that only serves to fan the flames of my anger.\n\nI can feel it, the weight of what's coming. The life we've built together, crumbling like a sandcastle at high tide. I envision us drowning in arguments, our once-loving home becoming a battleground. The future stretches out before me like an endless tunnel of darkness, and I'm already suffocating.\n\n\"How could you do this to us?\" My voice shakes with emotion, each word a dagger plunging into the fabric of our relationship. I can see it so clearly, the unraveling, the destruction. It's almost too much to bear. But I won't let him see me cry. Not now, not after this betrayal.\n\nI'm not one for histrionics, but right now, it feels like my world is ending. And it's all because of his silence, his secrets. He knew what this would do to us. He must have. Why else would he keep something so big from me? I can't trust him anymore. Not with my heart, not with our future. And that thought alone is enough to bring me to my knees."
