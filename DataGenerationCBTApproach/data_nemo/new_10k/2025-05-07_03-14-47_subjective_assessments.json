She hadn't heard from her sister-in-law since the funeral, and the woman's absence then still felt like a punch in the gut.\n\nShe glanced at the other unopened letters beside it - bills, mostly, and a few get-well cards from neighbors who'd long forgotten she was well again. Those were important, they needed attention. But this letter... it was just another reminder of what they'd lost, of the rift between them that had never been bridged.\n\nMartha picked up the envelope, feeling its weight in her hand. It was thin, like there wasn't much to say after all these years. \"Probably just wanting to stir up old wounds,\" she grumbled, dropping it back onto the counter. She'd deal with it later, when she had time, when she felt stronger. Right now, it could wait amidst the pile of other unimportant things."
