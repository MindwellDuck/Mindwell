But as she surveys the nearly empty room, save for a few acquaintances and her ex-husband who leans against a far wall, arms crossed, she feels the humiliation rise like bile in her throat. A critic he had once introduced her to approaches him, whispering loud enough for her to hear, \"I heard this was her big break. Seems more like a crack-up.\" Her ex chuckles softly, glancing at her with a smug smile. She pretends not to notice, focusing instead on the solitary figure admiring her largest piece, but the heat of embarrassment spreads across her cheeks nonetheless.",

I tried to convince myself as I gathered my notes, stacking them neatly on the counter. I could still use some of this data for other projects, make something worthwhile out of this mess.
