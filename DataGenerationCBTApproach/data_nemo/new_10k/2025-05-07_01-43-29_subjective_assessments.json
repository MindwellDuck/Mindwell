The smash was cathartic, but not nearly enough to drown out the echoes of his laughter that still lingered in this godforsaken break room.\n\n\"Let's celebrate, shall we?\" I said aloud to no one, pulling down my favorite mug - mine, not ours - and pouring myself a steaming cup of coffee. The aroma should have been comforting, but all I could think was, \"What's the point? It'll only end up bitter in the end.\" I took a sip, grimacing at the taste. \"Just like everything else,\" I thought, turning away from the shelf and leaving the shattered pieces behind."
