It'd been ages since I'd seen that old beater, but there it was, like a bad penny turned up again. My stomach churned at the sight of it.\n\nI couldn't believe it when I saw who belonged to those laughing noises coming from my neighbor's porch. It was him alright, that no-good punk from our youth. Always causing trouble, always getting under everyone's skin. And now he was here, laughing it up with little Timmy like they were best pals. Always got away with everything, didn't he?\n\nI never thought I'd have to lay eyes on his ugly mug again after all these years. But no, here we are, whole neighborhoods separating us and still, I can't escape him. It's always something with that one.\n\nI stood there, watching them through the darkness, my heart heavy with resentment. It was like nothing had changed at all. It'd always be this way with him around. Never any peace, never any quiet. Just more of the same old bullshit.\""
