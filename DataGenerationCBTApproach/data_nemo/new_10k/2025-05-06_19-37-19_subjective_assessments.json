Mom's always been the calm, collected one, never raising her voice. But today? She just blew up at me over something as tiny as a project reminder. I mean, it's not like she forgot about it or anything, she was just running late. But now, I dunno, it's like all of a sudden she's this totally unreliable person. It's either she's the perfect parent, or she's completely losing it. There's no in-between anymore. I guess that's what happens when they turn into a ticking time bomb, huh?"

She was there, yet not really. The lab's anniversary party last year, her laughter echoing around us like it was yesterday. But now, her chair's just an empty space, her desk cleared out by interns eager to make a name for themselves.\n\nI sat down, traced the edge of that frame with my finger. Her eyes, they weren't tired like mine are now. She was always so full of life, bursting at the seams with it. I remember how she'd thrown her head back, laughing at something stupid I'd said about the microscope. God, I miss that sound.\n\nBut then, I can't help but think... what if? What if she hadn't taken that job offer across town? Would we still be working together, sharing laughs over crappy coffee in the break room? Or maybe, what if we'd been assigned different projects last year? Could've been me stuck with the interns' endless questions instead of her.\n\nAnd then there's this gnawing feeling, deep down. What if she's not happy now? What if she regrets leaving us behind? What if... what if something happens to her? I shouldn't think like that, but it's like a dam bursting in my head, all these 'what ifs' flooding out.\n\nI shake my head, trying to clear the thoughts. It's just... it's hard, you know? Hard to move on when there's always another 'what if?' waiting around the corner. But I'll keep pushing through. For her sake, for mine. Because that's all we can do, isn't it? Keep going, keep asking these questions that don't have answers, hoping they'll lead us somewhere better. Even if it feels like we're drowning in 'what ifs.'"

But then, there it was, tucked behind my easel as if waiting for me to find it - us, in Paris. Laughter lines etched deep into our cheeks, wine glasses held aloft, paintbrushes abandoned in mid-stroke.\n\nHis smile... wider than I recalled, stretching ear to ear, genuine and uninhibited. It was a stark contrast to the quiet, reserved man he'd become over the years. A chill ran down my spine, not from fear or sadness, but from the intensity of it all. Those were simpler times, weren't they? When laughter echoed freely off the stone walls of our tiny studio apartment, and worries seemed like distant whispers rather than persistent screams.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of my eyes as I traced his smile with a fingertip, now roughened by years of holding brushes and palettes. I missed him. Missed us. Missed the way things used to be. The photograph felt like a tangible reminder of what once was, and what could have been if only... if only what?\n\nI found myself lost in thought, staring at our faces until they blurred into nothingness. I felt a pang of longing, sharp and profound. It was as if my heart was reaching out, yearning for something it knew it couldn't grasp. This longing felt real, tangible even. It must be reality, I thought. How could it not be?\n\nBut then, rationality nudged at the edges of my consciousness. I shook my head, banishing the thoughts. No use dwelling on what can't be changed, right? Yet, here I am, diary in hand, tears staining my cheeks, heart aching with a familiar longing. Perhaps tomorrow will bring clearer skies and calmer seas. For now, though, I'm adrift at sea, guided by this persistent emotion that feels like truth itself."
