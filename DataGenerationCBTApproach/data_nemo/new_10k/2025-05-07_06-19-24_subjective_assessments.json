No, they just waltzed right in and claimed our booth like they owned the place. I mean, it's not like we had some sort of 'Reserved for Former Lovers' sign hanging above it or anything. God forbid I should enjoy my coffee now without being reminded of what used to be.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful that there were even two empty chairs left in this godforsaken caf\u00e9. It's not like they could've sat at the bar, no, they had to choose our spot. The one where we'd laugh about nothing while the sun streamed through the window, warming our faces and hands. Now it's just another goddamn table for them to scribble their love notes on.\n\nI tried to focus on my book, really I did. But every time I looked up, there they were, all smiles and stolen glances. It wasn't like we didn't have our share of that once upon a time. But no, those memories don't count now because they're not here anymore. Just me, alone with my coffee and my fucking book club novel.\n\nAnd the nerve of them, ordering lattes! As if they could possibly appreciate the artistry behind that foam heart as much as we did. I swear to God, if they start holding hands across the table, I'm out of here. This place was better off without them anyway.\""
