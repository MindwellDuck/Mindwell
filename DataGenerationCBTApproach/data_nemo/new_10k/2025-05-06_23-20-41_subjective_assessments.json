I reach into my desk drawer, and it's as if I've stepped into a trap. The decay hits me first, that sickly sweet smell that seems to seep into every corner of my being. My heart starts pounding in my chest, echoing the dread rising within me.\n\nA rotting banana peel. It's just an old fruit peel, but it feels like so much more. It's a harbinger of doom, a silent messenger warning me that this is only the beginning. I can't help but imagine the worst. Tomorrow, there'll be flies buzzing around my desk. The next day, the stench will be unbearable, choking me as I try to work. And then what? Will they fire me for not keeping my workspace clean?\n\nI feel like I'm drowning in this wave of negativity. My hands are shaking as I fish out my lunch from the drawer. It's just a sandwich, but now it feels tainted, ruined by the decay that seems to have spread its fingers into every nook and cranny of my life. I can't eat this. Not today.\n\nI sit down at my desk, my heart still racing, my mind spinning with visions of impending disaster. It's just a banana peel, but it feels like so much more. It feels like the world is telling me that things are only going to get worse from here on out. And I can't help but believe it."
