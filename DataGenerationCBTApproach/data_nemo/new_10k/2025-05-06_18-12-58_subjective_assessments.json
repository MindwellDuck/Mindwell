The sight was a sobering reminder of the quiet she returned to each day - no laughter, no warmth, just echoes of silence. She folded the note away, tucking it into her worn satchel, but the emptiness seemed to stretch out before her, an endless expanse of solitude that even Emma's kind words couldn't illuminate."
