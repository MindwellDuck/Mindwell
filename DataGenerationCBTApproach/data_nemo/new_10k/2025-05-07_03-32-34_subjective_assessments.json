His heart aches with an echoing neglect, a void that used to be filled by laughter and shared dreams. Tonight, there's only silence and the weight of solitude.",

The countertops were strewn with dishes from breakfast, lunch, and God knows what else, and the sink was overflowing with dirty pots and pans.

It wasn't always like this. When we first moved in together, we shared the responsibility equally. But somewhere along the way, things had changed.* I couldn't help but think about Sarah, our neighbor, whose husband always seemed to have everything under control. Their house was spotless, their meals were always on time, and they even managed to fit in a weekly yoga class together.\n\n*I sighed as I surveyed the chaos around me. It's not that Emma doesn't try, I told myself. But somehow, no matter how hard we both work at our jobs, it seems like she can't manage to keep up with the housework.* I rolled up my sleeves and began to tackle the mountain of dishes in the sink.\n\n*As I worked, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was constantly cleaning up after someone else's mess. It wasn't fair\u2014not when Sarah's husband always had everything under control. But then again, who was I to judge? Maybe they were just better suited for this kind of life.* I turned on the faucet, letting the water run hot as I tried to wash away my thoughts along with the dishes.\n\n*When Emma finally wandered into the kitchen, she barely even apologized. \"Sorry, babe,\" she said absently, planting a kiss on my cheek before grabbing a bottle of wine from the fridge.* I couldn't help but feel a pang of resentment. *Here we go again,* I thought, as I dried my hands on a nearby towel. Another evening spent playing catch-up while Emma seemed content to let someone else\u2014namely me\u2014handle everything.*"
