I found it, amidst my knives - gleaming, untarnished, like a stranger in our home. A chef's knife, but not one I recognise. Not one of mine.*\n\n*It wasn't rusted like the others. It looked new, almost pristine. As if it hadn't seen a cutting board or a dishwasher cycle. But how could that be?*\n\n*My heart pounded as I held it, cold and alien in my hands. The edge was sharp, too sharp for something supposedly discarded, left behind. It's not possible, is it? That she used this while we were still together.*\n\n*The thought echoed in my mind, \"Always, always, always,\" like a relentless drumbeat. Always betraying me, deceiving me. How could I have been so blind?*\n\n*I feel a chill now, a cold that seeps into my bones. The entire kitchen seems tainted, every appliance, every utensil. Every reminder of her. It's as if our whole life together was nothing but lies.*\n\n*I can't unsee it now - the gleaming knife, the betrayal, the deceit. It's everywhere I look. Always there, always haunting me.*\n\n*Why did she do this? Why couldn't she have just left?*\n\n*Never again will I trust her, or anyone else for that matter. Never again will I let someone in, only to be hurt like this.*\n\n*I'm alone now, diary. Alone with my thoughts and this gleaming reminder of what was once ours.*\n\n---\n\n**Writing Prompt:** Write a conversation he might have with a friend about this incident.\n\n---\n\n*Friend:* Hey, you okay? You've been quiet lately.\n\n*Me:* Yeah, just... something's been on my mind.\n\n*Friend:* What is it?\n\n*Me:* You remember the kitchen knives I told you about? The ones she left behind?\n\n*Friend:* Yes...\n\n*Me:* Well, there's a new one. A gleaming chef's knife. It wasn't there before, I'm sure of it. She must have brought it with her.\n\n*Friend:* Are you sure? Maybe you just didn't notice it before.\n\n*Me:* No, no! Don't you see? If she could do this once, always means she'll do it again. Always sneaking in, changing things, ruining everything!\n\n*Friend:* Hey, calm down. It's just one knife. You can't know for sure what happened...\n\n*Me:* Whole life together was like that, wasn't it? One big lie! I should have known better than to trust her.\n\n---\n\n**Writing Prompt:** Write a letter he might write to himself about this incident.\n\n---\n\n*Dear Self,*\n\n*I found something today. Something you won't want to see or think about, but you must.*\n\n*A knife. A gleaming chef's knife, untouched by time or use. It's among our knives now, among the familiar, the known.*\n\n*You'll think I'm crazy for saying this, but it feels like a violation. Like she's still here, still intruding into our life together. Always reminding me of what happened.*\n\n*I know you're hurt, that you're struggling to understand how she could do this. But please, don't let this consume you. Don't let every little thing become another proof of her deceit.*\n\n*The kitchen isn't tainted, our life together wasn't a lie. It's just one knife, one mistake. It doesn't have to mean everything was always like that.*\n\n*Remember that? Remember who we were before this?*\n\n*I hope you do. Because I'm afraid you're starting to forget.*\n\n*Take care of yourself, okay? You deserve better than this.*\n\n*You.*\n\n---"
