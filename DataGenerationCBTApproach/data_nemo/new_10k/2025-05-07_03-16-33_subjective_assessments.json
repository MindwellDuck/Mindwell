        "Triggering Event": "Scenario:\n\nDr. A., in scrubs, waits nervously at the nurses' station, clipboard trembling slightly as she reviews a chart for her next patient. She's been feeling anxious all week, even more so after last night's argument with her husband about work-life balance. The station phone rings; it's the ER. A car crash victim is incoming, critical condition. Dr. A.'s breath catches, heart pounding. She knows she must be calm and professional, but the familiar anxiety clenches her stomach nonetheless as she rushes towards the trauma bay, \"Let's go, team!\"",

She scanned the team, their faces etched with concern but ready for action. \"Alright,\" she started, voice clipped, \"Let's not sugarcoat this. This patient is a mess. We've got a lot of damage here.\" She pointed at the chart, ignoring the small positives, focusing only on the grim details. Her husband's words from last night echoed in her mind, but she pushed them aside. This was life and death, no room for balance or positivity. \"We need to be prepared,\" she snapped, \"This isn't going to be easy.\" She didn't notice the worried glances exchanged by the team behind her. They knew they had a fight on their hands, but they also knew that Dr. A., despite her harsh words, was one of the best trauma surgeons they had. It was just...she seemed more intense lately. But then again, who wasn't, with all this chaos?"
