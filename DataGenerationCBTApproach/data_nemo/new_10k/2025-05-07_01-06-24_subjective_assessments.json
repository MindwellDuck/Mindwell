She could see him, trapped under a fallen beam in some crummy motel room, or worse, lying lifeless on the side of the road, his suit torn, blood staining the asphalt.\n\nShe shook her head, trying to dislodge the images, but they clung like barnacles, each 'what if' scenario digging its hooks deeper into her brain.

She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself, but it caught in her throat like she'd swallowed a sob. \"Where are you?\" she whispered again, her voice barely audible over the ticking clock and the cacophony of 'what ifs' echoing in her mind.\n\nShe picked up her phone, her fingers trembling as she scrolled through their messages, looking for any sign that he was okay. But there was nothing new, just their last exchange from this morning, a casual \"Love you\" from him, and her automatic response, \"Love you too.\" She cursed under her breath, frustration mixing with fear, creating a toxic cocktail in her stomach.\n\nShe put down the phone, her eyes drawn back to his untouched suit hanging silently in the closet. The clock ticked on, each second stretching into an eternity of 'what ifs'."
