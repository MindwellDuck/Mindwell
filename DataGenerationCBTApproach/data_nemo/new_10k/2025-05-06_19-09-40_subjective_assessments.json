Alone.\n\nI mean, who even likes that old tune anymore? It's like nails, ya know? Scraping against a board. I had to turn it off. Slammed the button, too. My hands were shaking. Stupid radio. Stupid song.\n\nOnions next. I love them, but today... they felt different. Harder somehow. Or maybe my hands are just getting weaker. Can't tell anymore. Tears started welling up. Not from the onions, though. No way. It's just... it's been too long since we had fresh onions. Harry used to bring them home, you know?
