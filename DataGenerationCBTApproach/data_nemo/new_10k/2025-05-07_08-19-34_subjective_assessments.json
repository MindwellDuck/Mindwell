As he reached for a sandwich, his coworker, a middle-aged woman, entered and raised an eyebrow at him. \"Really, you're not going to change those first?\" she asked, suppressing a smile. He looked down, realizing his mistake. The gloves were stained with remnants of the patient's lunch they'd been feeding moments ago. Feeling his cheeks flush, he muttered, \"Guess I'm still learning on-the-job,\" and quickly retreated to the locker room to change.",

Their laughter echoed off the walls, filling the room with warmth and joy she couldn't quite reach. The sight of it made her stomach churn.\n\n*How could he be so oblivious?* she thought, gripping the countertop until her knuckles turned white. *He's been home for days, and not once has he asked about my struggle with Mrs. Thompson.* She felt a lump form in her throat at the memory of the elderly woman who'd been giving her such a hard time lately.\n\n*And there he is, basking in their adoration like it's some grand achievement,* she continued to herself, bitterness seeping into every word. *He doesn't understand what I go through daily. He wouldn't know stress if it smacked him in the face.* She sighed deeply, the weight of her worries pulling her shoulders down.\n\n*But then again,* she considered, *maybe that's just because he's always so calm and collected. Unlike me, who's constantly on edge.* She felt a pang of shame at the thought, but quickly pushed it aside. *No, this isn't about me. It's about him not noticing how hard I'm trying too.*\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself against the familiar feeling of resentment that threatened to consume her. *I just need some time alone,* she decided, turning away from the door and retreating to her room. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was drowning in a sea of unnoticed efforts while everyone else floated happily along the surface."
