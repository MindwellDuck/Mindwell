Your heart pounds in your chest, echoing through the silent auditorium. Describe your thoughts and feelings as you struggle to maintain composure.\n\n---\n\n\"Good God,\" I muttered under my breath, eyes fixed on that damned 'Toady'. My palms grew clammy, gripping the lectern like it was a lifebuoy in stormy seas. \"How could they have missed this?\" I thought, my mind racing. The title, once bold and inviting, now seemed an absurd joke at my expense.\n\nI scanned the crowd, hundreds of faces staring back, waiting. Each pair of eyes felt like a magnifying glass, zeroing in on that typo. My embarrassment ballooned, consuming me whole. \"They're laughing,\" I thought, \"All of them.\" Yet, when I dared to glance up, there were merely expectant faces, no signs of mockery.\n\nMy prepared opening speech, once confident and engaging, now felt like a tangled mess in my head. \"It's ruined,\" I thought, minimising the hours spent drafting it. My heart hammered on, each beat echoing the typo's ridicule: 'Toady... Toady...'\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" I began, voice steadier than I felt, \"today, we're going to dive into the world of journalism...\" The rest of my speech was a blur, each word an uphill struggle, amplified by that bloody typo."
