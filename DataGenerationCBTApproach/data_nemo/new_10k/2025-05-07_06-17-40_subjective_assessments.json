Describe your feelings and thoughts as you arrive home to an empty apartment.\n\n**Response:**\nUpon entering the apartment, I was met with an unnerving silence, a stark contrast to the usual cacophony of our shared life. The weight of solitude felt heavier today, as if it had been pressing against the door, waiting to engulf me. I tossed my lab coat onto the couch, the fabric landing with a dull thud that seemed to echo mockingly in the void.\n\nI checked my phone, expecting at least a cursory \"Hey, running late\" message. Nothing. Not even a damn emoticon. My fingers felt like they were on fire as I scrolled through our conversation history, noting each of her previous tardy notifications. Tonight's absence stood out like a black hole, swallowing all the positives we'd built up over time.\n\nI couldn't help but amplify every little thing that had been irritating me lately - her habit of leaving dishes in the sink, her tendency to zone out during our conversations. Each transgression loomed larger than life, casting long, grotesque shadows on our once harmonious existence. Meanwhile, all the countless times she'd made me laugh, supported me through late nights at the lab, or simply been there... those seemed like distant memories, diminished in comparison.\n\nMy anger simmered, boiling over as I paced around the apartment, each step echoing her absence more loudly than the last. \"Where are you?\" I growled at the empty room, my voice resonating with a bitter intensity that was entirely disproportionate to one missed message. But in my mind, it wasn't just about tonight; it was about every little thing she'd ever done wrong, blown up out of proportion by my magnifying glass of rage."

The house was silent, no sizzle of cooking food or hum of the TV. Instead, there it was - our untouched dinner, looking like a sad, cold reminder of what could've been. I picked up the note, \"Emergency shift,\" it read in my partner's neat handwriting. I huffed out a laugh, \"Sure, because why have a life when you can save the world instead?\"\n\nI felt the familiar tightness in my chest, that 'something's not right' feeling.

Maybe they prefer the chaos of the ER over our quiet nights.\" I could feel the anger bubbling up, my emotions screaming that something was off, that this wasn't just an emergency shift.
