It's from him, the ex-boyfriend she'd ghosted after their heated argument months ago. She hesitates, thumb hovering over the play button, regret gnawing at her insides like a relentless tide.

It's like they're judging me too, you know? 'Why can't you just listen to it already?' they seem to say. Well, let me tell you, Mr. Snore- Judgey Pants, it's not that simple. There are... *reasons*.\n\nBut whatever. Maybe tomorrow I'll finally hit 'Play'. Or maybe I won't. Who knows?
