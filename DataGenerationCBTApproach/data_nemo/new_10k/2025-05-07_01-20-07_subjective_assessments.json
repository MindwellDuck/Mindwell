It was either success or failure, she thought bitterly. There was no in-between. No 'maybe next time' or 'it just wasn't meant to be this time'. It was all or nothing.\n\nShe picked up a canvas, her fingers tracing the familiar peaks and valleys of paint. She'd put so much into these pieces - not just time and effort, but emotion too. Loss, longing, joy, anger... they were all there in swirls of color and bold strokes.\n\nBut none of that mattered now, did it? It was all a waste. Because who the fuck would want to buy art from a widow anyway?\n\nShe threw the canvas down with a growl, storming out of her studio without bothering to turn off the lights."
