She watched from the kitchen window as they clinked glasses, his hand casually touching her husband's arm. A familiar pang of jealousy tightened in her chest. It wasn't the first time she'd seen them like this, but it was the first time she felt a sharp urge to walk out there and interrupt their laughter, claim him back. Instead, she turned off the lights and walked home alone.",

It was a pleasant evening, the air crisp and cool after a warm day, but she barely noticed. A couple walking their dog smiled at her as they passed, but she didn't acknowledge them, her mind too preoccupied.\n\nShe reached her house, the old Victorian standing tall with its freshly painted door and blooming hydrangeas. Her neighbors had even left her a little pot of herbs on the stoop, a peace offering for the noise their new cat made at night. But she hardly glanced at it, pushing past to unlock her front door.\n\nInside, the house was spotless, courtesy of the thorough cleaning she'd done before leaving for work that morning. The living room was filled with warm light from the table lamp she'd left on, and there were even some fresh flowers in a vase, remnants from their anniversary celebration last week. But she just kicked off her shoes and flopped onto the couch without so much as a second glance.\n\nHer husband's voice mail greeted her when she checked her phone - \"Hi honey, just wanted to let you know I'll be late. Love you.\" She listened once, then deleted it without responding. His love was nice and all, but it wasn't enough to make her feel better right now."

I see my wife's face, her eyes filled with concern and something else... pity?*\n\n*\"You're not the scientist you once were,\" she'd said last night, her voice soft but firm. The words echo in my lab now, bouncing off the cold walls, closing in on me.*\n\n*I find Sample 352, cracked but intact. Relief washes over me, brief and fleeting. There's still hope, I tell myself. I can fix this. I can save them all. But as I reach for another vial, I notice a tiny crack. Then another. And another.*\n\n*The room starts to feel small, claustrophobic.
