She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that the orders were piling up too quickly, that she was losing grip on her normally flawless mise en place.

Today, however, she wouldn't let him get to her. She would prove that his premature judgments were unfounded, that she could handle this kitchen despite the unnatural flames and the sudden flood of orders. She took a deep breath, steeling herself against his unspoken accusations, and began to chop with renewed vigor."
