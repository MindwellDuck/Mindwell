As she unlocked the front door, she noticed a small pile of mail on the floor inside. Amongst the usual bills and catalogues, there was an envelope addressed to \"Occupant\".

She could feel her heart pounding, her breath coming faster as she read the words, \"We regret to inform you...\". Her husband, still asleep upstairs, had assured her they'd covered everything. But here it was in black and white: another burden on her shoulders, another thing he hadn't taken care of. She felt a surge of heat rise within her, her hands shaking as she clenched the letter.
