What if I wasn't there for him when it mattered most?\" Her hands trembled as she ran them through her hair, pulling at the strands.

Describe your day when an former customer, known for being rude during their divorce proceedings, walks into your store.\n\n**Text:**\n\nAs I stood by the cash register, I noticed Mrs. Harrington pushing her way through the automatic doors. My heart sank instantly, memories of her vitriolic outbursts during her divorce echoing in my mind. She had been a regular until then, but her caustic tongue and disregard for our staff made it clear we were better off without her business.\n\nToday, she was different. No harsh words spilled from her lips as she browsed through the perfume section, picking up bottles, sniffing them, then placing them back with care. She seemed almost... pleasant. But I couldn't forget how she had screamed at my youngest sales associate for not finding her 'perfect shade of lipstick' fast enough.\n\nI watched her every move, my eyes darting between the clock and her, willing her to leave before closing time. My mind was fixated on that one incident, that one rude customer, failing to see her current behavior or the other customers around me who needed assistance. I was so focused on her past transgressions that I missed the present opportunities for cordial service.\n\nBy the time she left, my staff were exhausted from covering for me, and I realized I had been so caught up in Mrs. Harrington's past that I had forgotten to engage with the rest of my store today. A heavy sigh escaped me as I closed the doors behind her. Another day lost in the tunnel vision of her abuse."

She'd probably be sipping lattes, painting watercolors, or some other bullshit hobby she picked up after we split.

And now, not only do I have to deal with this stupid cut, but I've got her bandage staring me in the face every time I look at it. *Reminder,* it says. *Reminder of what?*\n\nShe left me, you know? Left me for some guy who's probably never even seen a kitchen, let alone spent hours on his feet, cooking for ungrateful assholes like that kid out there. And she took her bandages with her, except for this one.\n\n*Goddammit!* I can't even use a fucking bandage without it reminding me how much better off she is without me. Like I needed another reason to feel like shit today."
