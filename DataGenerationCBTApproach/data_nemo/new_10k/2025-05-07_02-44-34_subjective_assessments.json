She hadn't been there for months, not really. Not since... well, you know what happened. I shook my head, trying to dislodge the thoughts that threatened to pull me under again.\n\nThe kitchen was a mess. Dust clung to every surface like it had a personal grudge against me. Her favorite mug sat on the counter, untouched, gathering cobwebs. I picked it up, rubbing my thumb over the chipped edge where she'd once burned herself reaching for something too far back in the microwave. She'd laughed it off, but I'd seen her wince. I could've sworn I heard her laughter echoing in the empty room now.\n\nI remember when we first bought this place. It was a wreck then too, but together we made it into our home. Now, look at it. Look at me. I couldn't even keep up with the cleaning once she got sick. She'd always been better at that stuff anyway. Always tidier, more organized... everything seemed to come easier to her.\n\nI slammed the mug down on the counter harder than intended. The sound echoed through the house like a gunshot. It was stupid, really. We were partners in this life, weren't we? But standing here now, surrounded by all these reminders of what she did better, I can't help but feel like I've failed her somehow.\n\nI'm just... frustrated, you know? Frustrated with myself for not being enough. For letting things go once she couldn't anymore. For still forgetting sometimes that she's gone. And frustrated with her too, if that makes any sense. Because even now, even dead, she seems better than me in so many ways.\n\nI ran a hand through my thinning hair, feeling the weight of everything settling heavier on my shoulders.
