Drunk as skunks, laughing like they'd just heard the funniest joke in the world.\n\n\"Guess some folks don't realize it's past their bedtime,\" I said to myself, more bitterness creeping into my voice than I intended. \"Probably think life's all one big party, huh? Not a worry in the world.\" I rolled my eyes, already imagining how this would play out - me being the killjoy, them thinking they could do whatever they wanted.\n\nI mean, sure, we were around the same age, but that didn't mean we had the same life. Some of us had responsibilities, had to work even on a Friday night. And here they were, living it up like there was no tomorrow. I shook my head, already knowing what their excuses would be - 'Just having a little fun,' 'We didn't mean any harm.'\n\nBut I wasn't buying it. Not this time."

As if anyone else would ever grace this forsaken kitchen with their presence.* He scoffed, the sound echoing hollowly in the empty room. *A note.* He picked it up, read it, crumpled it into a ball with more force than was necessary. *They needed space?* He stared at his reflection in the window, the dim light casting harsh shadows on his weathered face. *Space from what?* he wondered, his voice echoing mockingly around him. *From me, apparently.* His reflection seemed to sneer back at him, a tired middle-aged man who, despite all his efforts, was still alone at the end of another long day. *Well*, he concluded, his pen punctuating each word with a sharp stab on the paper, *I suppose this is what happens when you spend your life dedicated to something greater than yourself.* He tossed the crumpled note into the trash, a small, satisfying victory in an otherwise empty evening."
