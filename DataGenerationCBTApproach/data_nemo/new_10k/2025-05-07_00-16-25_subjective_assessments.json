He hurried towards the sound, his heart pounding in rhythm with the blaring noise. The door to his office swung open, revealing a smashed beaker on his desk, shards glinting under the harsh fluorescent lights. Beside it lay his latest experiment, ruined. His stomach churned as he realized the implications: weeks of work, thousands of dollars wasted. He felt the familiar tightening in his chest, anxiety gripping him like a vice.",

He'd been trying to teach his sous-chef, a young whippersnapper half his age, how to properly prepare bouillabaisse for the hundredth time. The kid had insisted on adding garlic powder instead of fresh cloves. Now the kitchen reeked like a cheap pizza joint, ruining the delicate balance of the seafood stew. He couldn't serve that slop to their discerning patrons, not after 40 years in this business.",
