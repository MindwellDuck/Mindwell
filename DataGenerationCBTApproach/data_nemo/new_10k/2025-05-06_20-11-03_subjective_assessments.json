The letter lay on the counter, its crisp edges mocking him. Rejected. Again. He could see nothing else. Not the sun casting its golden rays through the kitchen window, nor the hummingbird outside, sipping nectar from his wife's favorite flowers. His world narrowed to that single word on the page, a black hole consuming all else. Even the familiar rituals of brewing coffee - the precise measurement of grounds, the gentle pouring of water into the filter - offered no solace today. Each tremor of his hands echoed the rejection, amplifying it until it was all he could see, all he could feel. The rest of the world, with its hues and sounds and warmth, faded into a blur, insignificant beside this stark, brutal fact."

They shouldn't be here, at their table, acting like they belonged together. It was as if they were rubbing it in her face, flaunting their happiness while she stood alone in the cold. She couldn't help but feel a surge of anger, a deep sense of injustice. This was proof, wasn't it? Proof that he'd moved on too easily, too quickly. Proof that she hadn't been enough for him. Her eyes welled up with tears, blurring her vision, and she wiped them away impatiently. She didn't need this. She didn't need to see this. It was just too damn hard."

It's like the sun breaking through clouds after a storm. But it also feels like a judgement, a verdict delivered without a chance for defense. I never meant to hurt you, child. That's why I left, not because I didn't care.\n\nI hope this letter finds you well. Please know that there is no either-or when it comes to my love for you.
