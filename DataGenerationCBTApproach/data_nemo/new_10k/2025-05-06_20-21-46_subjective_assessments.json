He looked over at his wife, sleeping peacefully beside him. She'd be none the wiser if he cancelled school today, claiming illness. But the thought of staying home with nothing but his anxious thoughts for company made his stomach churn. He decided to get dressed quietly, hoping the familiar routine would calm him. As he tied his tie in front of the mirror, he noticed his hands were shaking. Today's lesson was on World War II. Would he stumble over words? Forget dates? He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. The students deserved better than an anxious old man for a teacher. But as he grabbed his briefcase, he felt that familiar sense of dread wash over him again.",
