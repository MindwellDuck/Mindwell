What if she'd meant to propose last night? No, that couldn't be right. She'd have said something, wouldn't she?\n\nAs I hurried out the door, I fished out my phone, scrolling through our messages. Nothing stood out. But what if she was planning something big tonight? Or worse, what if she found out about that time I'd flirted with her friend at the bar? What if she thought I was hiding something?\n\nBy the time I reached the office, my stomach was in knots. I powered up my computer, but all I could see were those fucking 'what ifs'. What if this ring meant everything was about to change? What if Sarah wasn't who I thought she was? What if... what if...\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the thoughts. \"Christ,\" I muttered, rubbing my temples. \"Just get some work done.\" But those 'what ifs' lingered, nagging at me like a bad hangover."
