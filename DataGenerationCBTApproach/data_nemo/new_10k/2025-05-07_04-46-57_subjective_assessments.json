She had been working tirelessly for hours, and her stomach churned with hunger. As she reached for a sandwich from the communal fridge, she noticed a group of younger colleagues laughing nearby. Their eyes flickered towards her, then quickly glanced away, stifling smirks. The woman paused, feeling her cheeks grow warm as she realized her lab coat was unbuttoned, revealing more than she intended. She hurriedly fastened it, her embarrassment silently palpable amidst the now-silent group.",

He watched it go, his heart heavy with an unspoken \"should.\" The sunsets were always hers to see, not this hollow mimicry of nature's grand display without her by his side. It was wrong, all wrong. The world should have paused its spin when she did, but it hadn't. It had carried on, indifferent to the void she'd left behind.\n\nEach wave that crashed against the shore seemed like a mockery, a reminder of what once was and would never be again. She should have been here, her laughter echoing his own as they watched the sun set together one last time. But she wasn't. The beach was empty, save for him and the cold wind that whipped around him, whispering cruel truths he refused to acknowledge. This shouldn't be happening. It just shouldn't."
