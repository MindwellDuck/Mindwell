You've named your granddaughter after me? How utterly... unexpected.\n\nI mean, really, who does that these days? I can't help but wonder what you were thinking. Were you trying to make some sort of point? Or perhaps it's a veiled criticism, a not-so-subtle reminder of our past?\n\nAnd this line about years of support - did you intend to make me feel guilty? Because, frankly, I've had enough guilt trips in my life, thank you very much. I hardly need another one from an old colleague.\n\nAs for that incident you mentioned, the one where I may have... snapped, just a tad... Well, I suppose it's only fair you bring it up. But really, must we dredge up the past like this? It's not as if I planned to ruin your birthday. I was simply having an off day. Everyone has them, or so they say.\n\nBut enough about me. I'm sure you didn't mean for this email to become a platform for my introspective ramblings. So, let's just put this all behind us, shall we? Let's not dwell on the past, and certainly not on something as trivial as an old mistake or two.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
