I could've sworn it was there yesterday. This house... It's swallowing everything, just like she did when she'd laugh at my silly jokes. The cabinet gaped at me, empty, mocking me with its silence. My heart hammered against my ribcage, each beat echoing the void left by her passing. 'Where's Mother's mug?' I demanded of the silent walls. As if they could answer, as if she could still be here, filling the room with her warmth and laughter.\n\nI searched high and low, heart pounding like a drum in my ears. The house seemed smaller without her, every corner echoing with memories that now felt like ghosts haunting me. I found it, finally, in the 'donate' box by the door. Her mug, her favorite, the one she always used for her morning coffee. Now it's gone, just like her.\n\nI'd forgotten, you see. Forgotten that I'd decided to donate some of her things. 'For closure,' I'd told myself. But now, looking at the box filled with her perfume-scented sweaters and books she loved, I feel nothing but hollow. The mug was the last straw. It's just a thing, they say. Just a mug. But it wasn't. Not to me. Not to us.\n\nI sit here now, at this table we shared, my coffee growing cold. The house feels emptier than ever. The weight of her absence is a physical pain, pressing down on my chest until I can barely breathe. Everywhere I look, there are reminders. Reminders of what I've lost. Of what she's missed. Of the life that will never be again.\n\nI should be grateful, they say. For the time we had. But how do you minimize a lifetime of love and laughter? How do you downplay the emptiness left behind? Her mug was more than just a mug. It was her. And now it's gone. Just like her.\""
