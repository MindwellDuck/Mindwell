Each morning, I'd pull it out, smoothing its creases with trembling hands, and reread the words that had stung me like a swarm of bees. \"Inadequate,\" \"outdated,\" \"needs improvement\" - they were daggers plunging into my self-worth.\n\nI barely noticed the hum of activity around me in the staff room or the chirpy greetings from my colleagues. All I could focus on was that damned note and the red-hot shame it ignited within me. It felt like a beacon, drawing everyone's eyes to my perceived inadequacy.\n\nEven during lessons, the students' faces seemed to blur into a indistinguishable mass, their eager questions and curious smiles lost on me. My mind was a sieve, retaining only the harsh words of that complaint, oblivious to the countless other positive interactions I had with them daily.\n\nI found myself obsessing over the tiniest details - the slight frown on one student's face during my lecture, the restless tapping of another's foot. Each seemed like confirmation that they agreed with the parent's assessment, that I was indeed a terrible teacher.\n\nIn hindsight, it was as if I'd donned blinders, focusing solely on the negative aspects while the rest of the world continued around me, unaware of my self-imposed tunnel vision."

A reminder of what once was and what I had let slip away.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder why she had left this behind. Was it a subconscious attempt to haunt me? To make me remember the good times, the laughter we shared? Or perhaps it was merely an oversight, a careless mistake born out of haste during our hasty separation.\n\nBut why focus on such trivialities when I had her smile right here before me? It was enough. More than enough. It made all the pain, all the heartache seem distant, almost irrelevant. Why should I concern myself with anything else when this one detail - her smile - could bring me so much joy?\n\nI placed the photograph back where I found it, tucking it carefully into the book's spine. As I closed the cover, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. For now, that was enough. That smile was enough to keep me going, to fill my world with light once more. Anything beyond that could wait."
