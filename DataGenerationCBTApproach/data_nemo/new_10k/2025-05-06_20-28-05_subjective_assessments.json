He's been poring over scientific journals for hours, his eyes straining from the harsh light of his desk lamp. His phone rings; it's her\u2014his ex-wife. He hesitates, then answers. She asks if he can watch their teenage daughter this weekend as she has a \"last-minute business trip.\" His grip tightens on the phone, resentment simmering within him like an unspoken reproach. This is not the first time she's made such arrangements without considering his schedule, or perhaps caring to.
