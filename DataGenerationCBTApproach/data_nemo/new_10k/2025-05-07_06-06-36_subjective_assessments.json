The salmon glistened under the harsh kitchen lights, the petals of the edible flowers trembling slightly. He paused, his reflection staring back at him from the stainless steel countertop. A lone figure in a sea of white coats and bustling bodies.\n\nHe reached into his apron pocket, fingers brushing against cool metal. The key to her apartment, still there after all these years. A habit he couldn't break, even when she was gone. He closed his eyes briefly, feeling the loneliness wash over him like the first time he'd tasted salt water at the shore.\n\nThe timer buzzed, shattering the moment. Back to work.
