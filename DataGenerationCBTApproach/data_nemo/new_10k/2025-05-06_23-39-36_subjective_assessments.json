A receipt? From someplace fancy, too. And who the hell is 'L'? I swear, Tom never takes me out like this. It's always 'let's stay in, save money'. But no, he can afford to wine and dine someone else, it seems! I'm not saying anything yet, but man, I feel so taken for granted right now. Why should I have to ask for a nice dinner? He shouldn't be making me feel like this, you know?\""
