This ain't right. She shouldn't be here, disturbing my goddamn peace. It's been months since the divorce, and now this?\n\nI'm supposed to stay calm, professional. But all I can think about is how she's fucking it up again. Can't she just leave me alone? Why does everything have to be so damn complicated because of her?\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to steady myself. *This is my job,* I remind myself. *It doesn't matter who it is.* But my hands are trembling as I grab the radio.\n\n\"Unit 10 responding,\" I say, my voice tighter than I'd like. \"Just got a call from... an old acquaintance.\" I can't help but put some emphasis on 'acquaintance.' It's her fucking fault I'm in this mess.\n\nI drive towards her place, each streetlight casting eerie shadows on my face. My mind's racing, blaming her for everything. For the divorce, for the goddamn disturbance call, for the pounding in my chest. She should've known better than to move here, to disrupt my fucking life like this.\n\nBy the time I pull up outside her new place, I'm a goddamn wreck.

It was all I could see, all I could think about. The rest - the perfectly cooked meat, the impeccably timed sides, the team working seamlessly together - faded into insignificance.\n\nAs I stood there, surrounded by chaos and success alike, I couldn't shake off the feeling of impending doom. Another sleepless night loomed ahead, another potential argument with my partner on the horizon. How much longer could I keep this up? Each little detail seemed like a mountain to climb, each small failure a testament to my inadequacy.\n\nBut despite the storm raging inside me, my voice remained calm and measured as I instructed the sous chef to start again from scratch. We'd make it work, we always did. But as I turned away from the dish, I couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that tonight was going to be another long one. Another night where every little detail felt like a monumental task, every small setback a catastrophic failure."
