He'd been retired for years now, but he still missed the quiet hum of the hospital at night, the comforting ritual of checking on patients' vitals.

He slowly rose, using his cane for support, and made his way to the door. Standing there was a young woman, barely more than a girl, with a clipboard tucked under her arm. She wore a smile too bright for this hour, too cheerful for his mood.\n\n\"Good evening,\" she chirped, \"I'm here from Meals on Wheels\u2014\"\n\nHe cut her off, irritation flaring like a sudden pain. \"I never ordered any meals. I've told them before, I can manage just fine.\"\n\nHer smile wavered but held firm. \"Oh, I think there might be a misunderstanding...?\"\n\nHis grip tightened around his cane. \"No misunderstanding,\" he snapped. \"Now, if you'll excuse me.\" He started to close the door, the irritation boiling over into something sharper, something more like anger.
