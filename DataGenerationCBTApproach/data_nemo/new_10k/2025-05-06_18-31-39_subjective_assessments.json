Not just any ring, but a wedding band - a symbol of unity, of love, of a future shared with someone else.

A reminder of what used to be, of what I'd lost. It was heavier today, heavier than it had been yesterday or the day before that.\n\nThe sorrow in my chest swelled, threatening to consume me whole. It felt overwhelming, immense, like a dark cloud hanging over my head, blocking out any semblance of sunlight. How could anyone else be happy when I felt this way? When love still existed for them but not for me?\n\nI sighed, my breath fogging up the glass of the patient's door as I stood there, staring at that damn ring. I couldn't bring myself to enter the room, not yet. Not with this heavy weight on my shoulders, this burden that seemed to grow heavier by the day.\n\nWhy did it have to be like this? Why did others get to keep their happiness while mine slipped through my fingers like sand? It wasn't fair. None of it was. But then again, when had life ever been fair?"
