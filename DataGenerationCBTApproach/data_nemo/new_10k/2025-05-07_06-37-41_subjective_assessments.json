His eyes, weary from years of labor and sleepless nights, scanned the row of faded photographs on the mantelpiece. Each one whispered tales of a life now silent. A knock at the door, his daughter's worried face appearing, \"Dad, it's time for your medication.\" But all he could do was stare blankly at the empty space beside him where his wife once stood, her chair now gathering dust.",

This wasn't just a simple burglary gone wrong. No, this was personal.\n\nI stood up, my mind already made up. \"We need to trace this number,\" I barked at the rookie standing nearby, his eyes wide with inexperience. \"And find out who 'you' is.\" I could feel the familiar surge of anger, fueled by the image of some mystery person creeping in here, taking advantage.\n\nI didn't wait for him to respond, already striding towards my car.
