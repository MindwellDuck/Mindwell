        "Triggering Event": "At 7 pm, the doctor sat alone in his study, a stack of unread patient files beside him. His wife had gone to bed early, complaining of a headache. He poured himself another drink, swirling the amber liquid before taking a sip. The house was quiet except for the ticking clock on the mantelpiece, each tick echoing like a reminder of time wasted. He opened the top file, his glasses perched on his nose, and began to read. After a few minutes, he paused, rubbing his temples where tension had begun to build. He thought about the patient's symptoms, remembering them all too well from his own childhood. His unhappiness seemed to grow heavier with each passing second, settling like a stone in his chest as he remembered the pain that had been his constant companion then. He took another sip of his drink, trying to wash away the memories, but they lingered, as persistent as his own heartbeat.",

Might as well just cancel my plans now, this day's off to a fantastic start. *sigh*\n\nAfternoon. Traffic jam on the way home. Typical. Road rage sets in. I mean, why bother being civil when everyone else is such an idiot, right?\n\nEvening. Dinner was... well, it was edible. Barely. Kids didn't complain, so that's something. Right? Wife says we're out of their favorite ice cream. Again. Must be nice to have favorites. Mine are apparently 'nonexistent' and 'unappreciated'.\n\nBedtime. Can't sleep. Brain's on overdrive, replaying every little thing that went wrong today. Might as well just get up and start tomorrow now. It'll probably be a disaster too. Why bother trying?"

It's either here or not at all, just like her laughter that once filled these rooms, now replaced by an emptiness that screams at him.\n\nThe silence is deafening, an accusing presence he can't ignore. It's as if the apartment itself is holding its breath, waiting for something to break the tension. He swears he can hear his own heartbeat echoing off the bare walls, a constant reminder of what used to be and what will never be again.\n\nA lone plate sits on the table, untouched, abandoned. It's like a beacon calling out to him, demanding his attention. His fingers trace its cold surface, wishing they could absorb some warmth from it, some remnant of her touch. It's either this plate or nothing at all, just like their life together that ended so abruptly.\n\nHe wants to scream, to rage against the unfairness of it all. But there's only silence, a choking silence that demands he choose: either be swallowed whole by his grief or find a way to move forward without her. There is no in-between, no shades of grey in this world she left behind. It's either black or white, cold porcelain or warm laughter, and right now, all he can feel is the bitter sting of loss."
