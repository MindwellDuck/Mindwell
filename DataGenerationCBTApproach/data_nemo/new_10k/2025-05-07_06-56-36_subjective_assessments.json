A nurse for three decades, she knew every inch of the house, and this subtle discrepancy set her nerves on edge. She stepped closer, her heart pounding in her chest like a patient's monitor on high alert. As she gently pulled the drawer open, she found nothing amiss - just the usual clutter of pens, paperclips, and old photographs. But something was different. One photograph, a faded snapshot of them at their wedding, was facedown. She couldn't remember if it had been like that before.

His story - the one he'd been chasing for months, the one that was supposed to make his career - had crumbled yesterday. The sources had dried up, the leads gone cold.
