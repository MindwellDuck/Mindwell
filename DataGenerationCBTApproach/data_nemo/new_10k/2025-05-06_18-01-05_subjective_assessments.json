I hadn't seen her in weeks, not since she'd packed up and left without so much as a goodbye. *Why won't she talk to me?* I clenched my jaw, trying to push away the thoughts that threatened to swamp me.\n\nAnd then, as I reached for my coffee mug, I caught sight of it - that damn letter from her lawyer, still unopened on the counter. I'd been avoiding it, telling myself I was too busy, too tired... but really, who was I kidding? *I can't face what's inside,* I admitted to myself, just for a moment, before pushing the thought away.\n\nIn my haste, I knocked over the letter, sending it sliding across the counter. And there, right in the middle of it, was a dark stain - coffee, or something else entirely? *Blood?* My mind raced with possibilities, none of them good. *She's leaving me for someone else,* I thought, panic rising like bile in my throat. *That's why she won't talk to me.*\n\nI didn't stop to examine it further. I couldn't bear the thought of what I might find. Instead, I stuffed the letter into my bag, trying to tell myself that everything was fine, that there was no reason for this sudden surge of anxiety. But deep down, I knew. *Something's changed,* I thought, as I grabbed my coat and rushed out the door. *And it's all her fault.*"

No, no, it knows who it belongs to, and so should everyone else. But there they were, laughing and carrying on as if... as if they hadn't a care in the world about disrupting our little arrangement.
