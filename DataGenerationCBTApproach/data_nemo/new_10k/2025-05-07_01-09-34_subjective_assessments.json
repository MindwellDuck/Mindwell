It was minuscule, really, barely noticeable to anyone else perhaps, but it seemed like a chasm to her.\n\nShe traced the line with her fingertip, feeling its jagged edge against her skin. It was such a small thing, yet it felt so significant, so symbolic of everything that had slipped away from her. The crack wasn't just in the glass anymore; it was in their life together, in the time they'd shared, in the love they'd built. She'd been so foolish to think she could preserve any of it, that she could keep him with her forever.\n\nThe realization left her feeling helpless, adrift at sea without an anchor. The photo, once a source of comfort and joy, now felt like a cruel mockery of her loss. It was just a tiny crack, but it magnified every ounce of pain she'd tried so hard to suppress. She couldn't help but wonder what else might be shattered beyond repair, hidden away until it was too late.\n\nShe sighed heavily, placing the photo back on her desk. She knew she should appreciate the good times they'd had, the laughter they'd shared, but all she could focus on now was this tiny imperfection, this crack in their perfect life together.
