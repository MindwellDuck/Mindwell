After all these years, I've seen her smile plenty of times, but never like that. Not even when our kid graduated, or we finally paid off that fucking mortgage. Nope, none of that shit warranted a smile like that.\n\nAnd don't give me that 'she was probably just having fun' bullshit. She wasn't laughing with him, she was smiling at him. There's a difference. I know it, and you fucking know it too.\n\nShe says nothing happened, that they barely even talked. But let me tell ya, actions speak louder than words.

But they refused to see it, insisted on blaming him for their loss. As if he hadn't lost her too.\n\nHis mind drifted back to the moment he pronounced her dead, the life draining from her eyes as he helplessly watched. The memory was bitter, a constant reminder of his inadequacy. He had tried to tell himself that it wasn't his fault, that he had done everything in his power to save her. But their words echoed in his mind, drowning out any rational thought.\n\nHe looked down at the untouched lunch on his tray, a gesture from Nurse Linda who always made sure he ate something, anything. A small kindness meant to help him cope with the stress of his job. But all he could see was waste, another thing he didn't deserve after all that had happened.\n\nHis gaze drifted back to the family across the cafeteria, their grief palpable even from a distance. He felt a pang of sympathy, but it was quickly overshadowed by guilt. They were right, weren't they? He couldn't save her. He couldn't save anyone. His thoughts were interrupted by his pager beeping, another emergency waiting for him on the other side of those swinging doors.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Dr. Thompson stood up, leaving his uneaten lunch behind as he walked away from the cafeteria, his shoulders hunched slightly forward, a subtle sign of his self-imposed burden. He didn't notice the admiring glances from some of his colleagues, didn't hear their whispered words of praise for his dedication and skill. Those didn't count, not in his mind. Not when he had failed so spectacularly at saving the one person who mattered most."
