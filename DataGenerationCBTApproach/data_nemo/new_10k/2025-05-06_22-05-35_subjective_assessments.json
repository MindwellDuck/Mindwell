A younger version of himself smiled back, standing beside his late father in a kitchen that no longer existed. The once vibrant colors had faded, much like his own memories.\n\nAs he traced the outlines of their faces, his eyes welled up with unshed tears. He'd thought he'd come to terms with his father's passing, but today was different. Today, he'd found out that the restaurant where they'd worked side by side was closing down. His father's legacy, the recipes they'd created together, all disappearing.\n\nHe felt a profound sense of loss wash over him, drowning him in despair. The kitchen, once his sanctuary, now seemed like a cold, empty echo chamber. He looked around at the stainless steel surfaces, devoid of life and warmth. There was no laughter here today, no banter, just an oppressive silence that mirrored his inner turmoil.\n\nHe gripped the photograph tightly, his knuckles turning white. It felt as if he were losing his father all over again, along with a piece of himself. His world, already shadowed by grief, seemed to be crumbling further into despair.",

Here they were, talking about promotions and dream jobs, while I was drowning in memories of Dad's laugh echoing through that goddamn kitchen that'll soon be gone.\n\nI couldn't help but feel like a fucking failure compared to them. They had it all - money, status, big-ass families. And there I was, stuck with nothing but a crumbling legacy and a heart full of grief. *Why the hell can't I measure up?* I wondered, clenching my fist around Dad's old photo.\n\nI tried to join in their laughter, but it felt forced. Like a fucking stranger trying to fit in at his own goddamn family reunion. All I could see were those stainless steel surfaces, cold and empty just like me. *Fuck this,* I thought, excusing myself from the table. I needed some air, away from all these goddamn reminders of what I didn't have.\n\nAs I stepped outside, I took a deep breath, trying to shake off that gnawing feeling of inadequacy. But it was no use. That familiar ache was back, and it felt like there was nothing I could do to make things right. *Why can't I be more like them?* I wondered, staring up at the night sky. It was filled with stars, each one shining brighter than me, just like everyone else in my fucking life."
