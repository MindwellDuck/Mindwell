It's not like Mrs. Henderson would have left without checking every corner. That woman is a machine, efficient and fearless. She shudders at the thought, her palms slick with sweat. She can't even manage this simple task without panicking.\n\nThe shadow under the door seems to grow larger, more menacing than before. It's as if it's mocking her, whispering, \"You're not cut out for this.\" She swallows hard, her heart hammering against her ribs like a caged bird. If only she were more like Mrs. Henderson, this wouldn't be so terrifying.\n\nShe reaches for her phone, fingers trembling, but it's dead. Of course it is. Just another reminder of how ill-equipped she is compared to the others. She can practically hear their voices echoing in her mind, \"You should have charged it last night.\" \"You're always so forgetful.\"\n\nThe store feels colder now, the flickering lights casting eerie shadows that seem to taunt her. She hugs herself tightly, wishing she could disappear into the darkness. The noise comes again, louder this time. But even if it's just a rat, what does that say about her? She can't even handle this one simple task without turning it into a disaster.\n\nShe takes a deep breath, trying to steady herself. \"You're not like them,\" she whispers to herself, the words echoing in the empty store. The comparison stings, a bitter pill she's forced to swallow every day. But she can't help it; it's always there, gnawing at her, reminding her of how inadequate she is.\n\nShe steels herself, taking a tentative step towards the stockroom door. She might not be like Mrs. Henderson, but that doesn't mean she can't do this. Even if every fiber of her being screams otherwise."
