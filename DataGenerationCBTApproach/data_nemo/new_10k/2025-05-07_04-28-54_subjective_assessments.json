My heart did its usual somersault, like it was on a goddamn trapeze. I answered, \"Hey, what's up?\"\n\n\"I-I can't find Lily,\" she stammered, her voice cracking. Panic surged through me, raw and visceral. \"What do you mean? Where were you?\" My mind raced, pictures of Lily laughing, playing, flashbulbs in my brain.\n\n\"She was at the park with a friend,\" she said, sniffling. \"They lost sight of each other for just a moment...\" Her voice trailed off, heavy with guilt and fear.\n\nI felt it then, that familiar pinch of inadequacy. Like I wasn't doing enough, being enough. I'd seen other divorced dads on social media, their kids always smiling, happy. They seemed to have it together. I was over here, drowning in worry and self-doubt.\n\n\"We'll find her,\" I said, steeling myself. \"I'm on my way.\" I hung up, grabbed my coat, and dashed out of the newsroom.
