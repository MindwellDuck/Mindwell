They weren't touching, but their body language spoke volumes. She felt her stomach twist into knots as she watched them from behind the counter of the store where she'd been working since the divorce. Another customer caught her attention, snapping her out of her jealous daze. \"Just the usual?\" they asked. She nodded mechanically, her hands shaking slightly as she reached for his regular coffee cup.",

Just another day in paradise.\"\n\n**Generated Text:**\n\nShe watched the clock hands crawl towards closing time, each tick echoing like a gavel slamming shut on her heart. Another day, another hour of watching them through the window - his laughter, their shared glances. It was always something with him, wasn't it?\n\nThe bell chimed overhead as the last customer left, leaving her alone in the empty store. She leaned against the counter, staring at the coffee cup he'd just taken. \"Just the usual,\" she mimicked under her breath, her voice echoing harshly off the bare walls.\n\nShe'd had a great day today, didn't she? Sales were up, and Mrs. Thompson even complimented her on the new display. But that felt like it happened to someone else. Here, now, all she could see was him. Laughing. With her.\n\nHer phone buzzed with a message from her friend: \"Hey, let's celebrate! You're killing it at the shop!\" She read it, then tossed her phone aside. What did that matter? It wasn't like he cared about her success. Why should she?\n\nShe locked up, stepping out into the cool evening air. The coffee shop across the street was still buzzing with life. She could see him through the window, his face lit up in laughter. Again.\n\nHer fingers tightened around her keys, digging into her palm until it hurt. Another day down, another night of sleepless thoughts. But she didn't need sleep. Not really. What did sleep matter when there were nights like these? Nights where every smile he gave felt like a punch to the gut, every laugh echoing like a knife twisting in her heart.\n\nShe walked away, leaving the warmth and light behind. Another day dismissed, another positive experience disqualified. It didn't count. None of it did. Not when there was this. Him. Always him."

I ignored it, as if answering would be an admission that today was just another day at the office, not some existential crisis. My husband's footsteps echoed down the hall, pausing outside my door. \"Busy,\" I called out, not unkindly. He knew better than to disturb me when I was 'busy' like this.\n\nI swiveled my chair to look at the framed article on the wall behind me. The one they'd printed last month, with a big, glossy picture of me grinning like an idiot. \"Local Writer Finds Joy in Community,\" it read. I scoffed, turning back to my computer. \"Joy,\" I huffed. \"I'll show them joy.\" I started typing, determined to add 'depth' to my story. Never mind that I'd spent all morning interviewing farmers who practically glowed with pride over their wares. That didn't count for anything, apparently.\n\nMy husband's footsteps returned, softer this time. He paused again, then slipped a mug of tea onto my desk. \"For later,\" he whispered, before retreating. I watched him go, feeling that familiar warmth that always followed his thoughtful gestures.

I could feel the pride bubbling up inside me, but I pushed it down, hard. It didn't matter what they thought, not yet. Not until it was perfect.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I muttered, my throat tight. \"But I've still got work to do.\"\n\nShe sighed, a sound that carried all the weight of my unspoken words.
