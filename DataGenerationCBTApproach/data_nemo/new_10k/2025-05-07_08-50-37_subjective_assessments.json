His old tweed jacket hung there, still bearing the faint scent of his cologne, now mingling with the musty smell of time passed. Her reflection in the mirror caught her off guard - the once vibrant face now lined with sorrow, eyes welling up with familiar despair. She reached out, tracing the rough fabric, remembering how he'd worn it on their last trip to the museum, his voice animated as he spoke about history's lessons. The house felt too big, too silent, too full of echoes that would never again be filled by his laughter.",

I daresay it'll be gone altogether in another month or two.\" She glanced at her reflection, her eyes narrowing at the sight of her lined face and tear-filled eyes. \"Age and sorrow are truly cruel taskmasters,\" she remarked bitterly, turning away from the mirror as if its reflection were a personal affront. \"The museum trip was pleasant enough, I suppose, but really, it's all just a distant memory now. A hollow reminder of happier times.\" She reached out tentatively, tracing the rough fabric of the jacket with her fingertips, as if expecting to find it infested with vermin or otherwise tainted by time's relentless march. \"This house is far too large for one person,\" she declared, her voice rising in frustration. \"And far too silent. I swear, the echoes grow louder each day, like a cacophony of reminders that he's never coming back.\" She crossed her arms, her expression sulky and annoyed, as if the very air around her was conspiring to make her life more difficult."
