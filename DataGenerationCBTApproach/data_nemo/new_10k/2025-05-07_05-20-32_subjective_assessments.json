I'm trying to breathe, but it's coming out all ragged, like I've just run a fucking marathon. The lab's spinning around me, equipment humming like some sort of taunting melody. I feel like a fucking amateur, standing here shaking while she'd probably handle this shit with cool fucking composure.\n\nI mean, look at me, late again, sweating bullets over a damn phone call. She'd be handling this like it's nothing, her lab coat pristine, hair perfectly in place. Me? I'm a fucking mess. I slam the phone down, but it doesn't do shit to silence the voice inside my head screaming, \"You're not good enough.\" Fuck me, why does everything have to remind me of what I don't fucking have anymore?"
