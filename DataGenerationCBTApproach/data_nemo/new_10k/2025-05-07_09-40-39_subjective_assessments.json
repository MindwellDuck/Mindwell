He paused by a locked supply closet, remembering how his ex-wife, also a nurse, had stolen supplies to sell on the black market. He heard footsteps approaching and quickly hid as his replacement, a young, eager nurse, opened the door with a keycard, revealing shelves stocked with untouched supplies. The old man's grip tightened on his cane, knuckles turning white with suppressed spite.",
