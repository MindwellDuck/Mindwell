        "Generated Assessment": "**Writing Prompt:**\nArrive home after another grueling 12-hour shift to find your living room in disarray - an overturned chair, broken lamp. Your roommate's girlfriend giggles drunkenly from the couch, clutching a half-empty bottle of your finest whiskey. You've told them both countless times: no parties while you're on nights. Yet here they are, again, acting like they own the place. The bitter taste in your mouth grows stronger as you realize this isn't about them having fun; it's about you being away, working hard to keep their streets safe, while they trash your home. How do you feel and react?\n\n**Response:**\n*Jesus,* I thought, staring at the wreckage of my living room. *I mean, what the hell? They couldn't wait till I was off nights?* My eyes landed on the broken lamp, a gift from Mom last Christmas, now just jagged glass and splintered wood. *Damn it,* I muttered under my breath, not wanting to wake the neighbors.\n\nEmma, my roommate's girlfriend, giggled again from the couch, hiccupping around the mouth of my best bottle of whiskey. *Not mine anymore, I guess,* I thought bitterly. *Just like everything else in this goddamn house.*\n\nI started picking up the mess, righting the overturned chair. *At least they didn't spill anything on the carpet,* I tried to tell myself, but it felt hollow. *Like everything else about my life lately.* I worked all hours of the night, making sure these idiots could sleep safe in their beds, and this was how they thanked me?\n\nI glanced at Emma again, her head lolling back against the couch cushions, a smile still playing on her lips. She looked so...free. *Not a care in the world,* I thought, resentment simmering inside me like hot tar. *Must be nice.*\n\nAs I swept up the last of the broken glass, I could feel it again - that familiar, gnawing feeling of being left behind. Like everyone else was just...more than me. Happier, freer, less burdened by responsibility. And here I was, picking up their messes.\n\nI sighed, tossing the dustpan and brush aside with more force than necessary. *Just another night in paradise,* I thought, heading to bed. Alone."
