Where could it have gone?\n\n**Text:**\n\"Ah, there you are,\" I murmured, spotting the familiar blue cap peeking out from beneath some papers in my desk drawer. \"I knew you couldn't just up and vanish.\" I plucked the pen out, uncapped it, and gave it a quick twirl between my fingers. It wrote smoothly, no signs of clogging or wear.\n\nBut then, I noticed something odd. The ink wasn't the usual deep blue I'd always used. It was black, bold, and stark - like a betrayal. \"When did I switch inks?\" I muttered, frowning. This wasn't right. I never would have done that without remembering.\n\nI leaned back in my chair, swiveling to face my partner, John, who was engrossed in his laptop across the room. \"John,\" I began, my voice casual but pointed, \"did you happen to use my pen? The ink's all wrong.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyebrows raised. \"No, why would I?\" he replied, a hint of defensiveness creeping into his tone. \"You know I prefer my own pens.\" He gestured to the half-dozen pens scattered around his workspace.\n\nI shrugged, capping my pen and placing it back in its usual spot on my desk. \"Just checking,\" I said, turning back to my work. But inside, a small voice whispered, \" Typical of him to not even ask before using something that's clearly mine.\" I pushed the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand. After all, it was just an ink mishap, right? No harm done."

They'd been less than useless, shirking their duties and leaving him to pick up the slack.\n\nAs he stooped to gather the discarded garments, he couldn't shake the feeling of resentment. Why should he have to clean up after them? It was their mess, not his. Yet here he was, once again, bearing the brunt of everyone else's carelessness and disregard. He sighed heavily, his shoulders slumping under the weight of his unspoken grievances.\n\nHis thoughts raced like a ticker tape, each new injustice fueling his growing anger. It wasn't just about the shirts now; it was about every slight, every perceived injustice, every moment of his life that hadn't gone as planned. And who did he blame? Those teenagers, his colleagues, his customers - anyone but himself. After all, he reasoned, why should he take responsibility for their actions when they showed no such inclination themselves?\n\nMr. Thompson stood up straight, the neat stack of shirts clutched tightly in his hand like a shield against the world's indifference. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for another confrontation with those unruly teenagers. It wasn't his fault he was feeling this way; it was theirs.
