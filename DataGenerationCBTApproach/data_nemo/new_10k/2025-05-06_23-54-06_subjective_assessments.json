His reflection stared back at him from the black window, a ghostly reminder of the man he used to be. A creased photograph lay on the table beside him, its edges worn smooth by anxious fingers. It showed her, smiling, before everything changed. The door swung open, revealing a young rookie, eager and full of life. \"You okay, sir?\" she asked, concern etched on her face. He forced a smile, tucking the photo into his pocket. \"Just another shift,\" he replied, turning away to hide the glistening in his eyes.",

It was a shitty badge of honor, one he'd earned through sleepless nights and blood-soaked days. The rookie's concern only served to reinforce his self-imposed title, like she could see it too - 'Old Timer', past his prime, on borrowed time. He took a swig of the cold coffee, grimacing at the bitter taste. \"Just another fucking shift,\" he echoed, but even that seemed like a lie now. Every shift was a struggle to hold onto something he'd lost long ago, something that photo could never quite capture."

The house was silent except for the soft hum of the refrigerator down the hall. He rolled over, the cool sheets a stark contrast to the warmth that had been there mere hours ago. Her pillow still bore the indentation of her head, her scent lingering like an apparition. He reached out, tracing the outline as if he could summon her back from wherever she'd gone.\n\nHis mind wandered to her sketchbook, filled with vibrant drawings that leapt off the page. Each one was a testament to her talent, a skill he'd always admired and secretly envied. His own sketches lay scattered around him, crumpled remnants of failed attempts to capture her essence. The charcoal lines were harsh, jagged things compared to her fluid strokes.\n\nHe picked up his sketchbook, the weight of it heavy in his hands. His fingers trembled as he turned to a blank page, the smooth surface mocking him. He pressed the charcoal tip down, willing himself to create something beautiful, something worthy of her. But the line wavered, refusing to cooperate. It was too thin, too harsh, nothing like hers.\n\nHe crumpled the paper, adding it to the growing pile beside his bed. His heart echoed with emptiness as he watched the clock hands tick towards morning. Each beat was a reminder of another day without her, another day where he fell short in comparison. Why couldn't he be more like her? Why did everything come so easily to her while he struggled?\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the first light of dawn filtering through the curtains. He sighed, turning away from the window. Another day, another reminder of his inadequacy. But he refused to acknowledge it as such. Instead, he pushed the thought aside, burying it beneath a blanket of denial. Today would be different. He'd prove to himself that he wasn't lesser, that he could create something worthy. Even if it meant trying again and again until his fingers bled."
