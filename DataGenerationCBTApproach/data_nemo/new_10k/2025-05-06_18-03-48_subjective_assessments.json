Her heart pounded in her chest as she slowly turned off her desk lamp, plunging herself into darkness save for the faint glow of her laptop screen. She had been working late, engrossed in her research on climate change patterns, when the strange noises began. She knew her partner was fast asleep upstairs; she hadn't wanted to disturb him with her fears. Now, alone in the quiet house, she felt a creeping unease. The scratching came again, louder this time, as if whatever was out there could sense her fear and was growing bolder. She reached for her phone, hands trembling, ready to dial his number, but hesitated. What if it was just the old cat, sneaking in through the pet flap? Or worse, what if it wasn't? She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the fear that threatened to overwhelm her. She had faced uncertainty in her scientific career many times before, but this felt different, more primal. The scratching came again, and she knew she couldn't ignore it any longer.",
