Not like anyone had used it in... well, since him.\n\nI picked it up, turning it over in my hands. Remembering how his hands looked holding it, his fingers tapping against the ceramic as he thought. Or worried. He worried a lot towards the end. What if something happens? That was his favorite phrase. I could hear his voice echoing through the empty house.\n\n\"What if the coffee's too hot?\" I mimicked him, laughing bitterly. \"What if it breaks in the dishwasher? What if, what if, what if...\" My grip tightened around the mug, knuckles turning white. \"What if you hadn't left me alone with all these damn 'what ifs'?\"\n\nI set the mug down hard on the counter, making myself jump. The cat's grin seemed to mock me now. I grabbed a cloth and started scrubbing at it, like that could erase more than just dust. \"Stupid mug,\" I muttered. \"Stupid what ifs.\" But even as I said it, my mind was already spinning with more questions. What if he'd never left? What if I'd been there when... No. Stop it. I threw the cloth down and walked away, leaving the mug there to gather more dust. More memories. More 'what ifs'."
