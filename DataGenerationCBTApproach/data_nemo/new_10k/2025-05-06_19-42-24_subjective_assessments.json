Her husband of fifty years entered, his eyes scanning the room, landing on the unfinished canvas. \"You haven't touched that in days,\" he remarked casually, walking over to the window to admire his reflection. She bristled, gripping the brush tighter as bitterness surged within her like a tide. He hadn't noticed the new lines etched into her hands, the way they trembled slightly now. He didn't see how each stroke of paint was a battle against time, against the encroaching darkness that threatened to consume her vision and her art. She watched him through narrowed eyes as he adjusted his tie in the window's reflection, his mind elsewhere, oblivious to the storm brewing behind him.",
