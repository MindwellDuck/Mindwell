She shook her head, dispersing the mental image of their family picnics under that very sky.\n\n*I've moved on,* she insisted silently, her pace quickening as she tried to outrun the memories. *I have my own life now.* But the words felt hollow, like echoes in an empty room.

It was safer than dwelling on the fleeting moments of joy she'd experienced before their world fell apart.\n\n*Those don't count anymore,* she convinced herself, turning away from them and walking home alone. *Not now.

But what if not opening it was worse, a betrayal of their bond, a silence where there should have been words?\n\nHis breath came shallow and fast as he debated with himself, each 'what if' painting a vivid picture in his mind's eye. He saw himself opening the letter, revealing its secrets to the light. He saw himself burning it unread, sending her words up in smoke like some ancient ritual. He saw himself putting it back where he found it, forgetting about it until another two years had passed.\n\nBut whatever he chose, one thing was clear: he wouldn't be able to look at his stove the same way again.
