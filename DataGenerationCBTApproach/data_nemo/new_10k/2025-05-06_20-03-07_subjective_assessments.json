She ignores it, but his voice echoes in her mind, \"You're wasting your life, just like you wasted our marriage.\" She looks around at the chaos of colors and forms she can't bring herself to complete, feeling utterly helpless.

The clock chimed eight, and there it was again, that infernal creak. As if on cue, I could practically see him, his face buried in the newspaper, his fingers tapping impatiently as he waited for his coffee to cool. But all I had was an empty chair staring back at me, mocking me with its emptiness.\n\nI swear, sometimes this house feels like a mausoleum. Every little sound, every little creak, it's like the walls are whispering, \"He's gone. He's not coming back.\" And my heart, oh, my heart echoes that sentiment, pounding away in my chest like a drumbeat of sorrow.\n\nI mean, really, what am I supposed to do with all this... this... emotion? It's overwhelming, like a storm surge threatening to drown me. So, I sit here, drowning in my tea, because heaven forbid I should actually deal with it. I can't very well tell the creak to hush up, now can I? Oh, no, that would be ridiculous. But apparently, wallowing in self-pity is perfectly acceptable.\n\nI'm not saying I'm happy about this, you know. This... this feeling, it's like a weight around my ankles, dragging me down into the depths of despair. And yet, here I am, sitting in it, letting it consume me because, well, that's what emotions do, isn't it? They take over, they control us. Or so it seems.\n\nBut enough about me and my ridiculous emotional rollercoaster. I'm sure you have more interesting things to think about than an old woman's musings.\""
