Every house stood stoic, their windows offering no glimpse of the conviviality they usually hosted at this hour. My footsteps echoed behind me, each step resonating with an anger that grew more intense with every silent residence I passed.\n\nThis wasn't how it was supposed to be. Our neighbors had always been welcoming, our dinner tables echoing with shared stories and camaraderie. But tonight, there was nothing but emptiness, a void that felt like a personal affront. It's not as if we were new; we'd been here for years, contributing to the neighborhood's fabric in our own way. Yet, this week, it seemed everyone had forgotten their obligation.\n\nI could feel the heat rising in my cheeks, my hands clenching into fists at my sides. How dare they exclude us? We were part of this community too, damn it! The sense of entitlement I felt was palpable, a righteous indignation that demanded justice for what felt like a betrayal. This wasn't just about dinner invitations anymore; it was about respect, about being seen, about being acknowledged as deserving of their consideration.\n\nI stormed into our house, slamming the door behind me. My wife looked up from her book, startled. \"What's wrong?\" she asked, concern etched on her face. But I couldn't answer, not yet. Instead, I marched past her, my mind a whirlwind of angry thoughts and 'shoulds'. This wasn't how it should be, damn it! And by God, they would know that."
