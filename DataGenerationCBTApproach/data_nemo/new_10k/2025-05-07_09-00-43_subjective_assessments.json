Now, he barely recognizes her when she visits. Guilt gnawed at her as she clutched the pen like a lifeline to their past.",

He must've left it like this intentionally, a message for me to find, a reminder of our shared love for this story.\n\nI can't help but think he's trying to tell me something from wherever he is now.
