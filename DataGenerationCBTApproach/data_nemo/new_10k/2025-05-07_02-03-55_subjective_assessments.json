They can't seem to grasp that detention isn't a punishment for their children, but a necessary tool to reinforce the importance of honesty and hard work.\n\nIt's not just Mrs. Anderson either; it feels like the whole lot of them are against me sometimes. Whenever there's an issue with one of their kids, they're quick to point fingers at my teaching methods. Never mind that I've got thirty other students who aren't causing trouble, who actually put in the effort and respect the rules.\n\nI'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing this job when it feels like I'm constantly under siege. It's never-ending, always something new to complain about or blame me for. I just want them to see that I genuinely care about their children's education, but maybe they're right. Maybe I am failing them all somehow.\n\nSigh,\nMrs. Thompson"
