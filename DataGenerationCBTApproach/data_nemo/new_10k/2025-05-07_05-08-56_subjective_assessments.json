They don't understand what it's like, stuck here while they get to enjoy their lives. It's not fair. It's either them or me, and it always seems to be fucking them."

It's never just about the painting anymore, it's about them, about how they take something of mine and make it theirs.\n\nI can't even remember the last time someone appreciated my work for what it is - a piece of me, not just some decoration to hang on their wall.
