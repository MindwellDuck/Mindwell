I mean, who keeps a letter tucked away behind a drawer? Mom, that's who! And not just any letter, but one she wrote two years before she passed, asking for forgiveness. Forgiveness?! I've been racking my brains all afternoon trying to figure out what this 'long-forgotten disagreement' could be. It's like she knew exactly what I'd do - find the letter, stew over it, and now here I am, lying awake at 3 AM, running through every single conversation we ever had.\n\nI swear, Mom could read my mind sometimes. She always seemed to know just when I needed a hug or a stern talking-to. And now, even after all these years, she's still doing it. 'Asking for forgiveness,' indeed! Like she knew I'd feel guilty for not opening the letter sooner, or worse, that I might think she didn't forgive me for something I can't even remember!\n\nI mean, come on! It's not fair. She gets to hide her thoughts away in a letter and leave me here to spin my wheels, trying to guess what she meant, what she wanted from me. Typical Mom, always one step ahead. Always knowing just what buttons to push.\n\nBut you know what? I won't play her game. Not tonight. I'm going to put this letter back where I found it and forget about it. Or maybe I'll open it tomorrow, when I've had a good night's sleep and can actually think straight. Yeah, that's what I'll do. For now, though, journal, you're getting the brunt of my frustration. Thanks for listening.\n\nZzzzs... here goes nothing.*\n\n---"
