A bloody album full of Tom and his merry gang, laughing it up at some reunion shindig I wasn't privy to. You'd think they planned it just to spite me or something. I mean, how could they possibly have a good time without little old me around? It's not like we've all drifted apart since graduation or anything. *sigh* Guess I'll just be over here, sulking with my reheated leftovers while they're off making new memories without me.\""

The fluorescent lights flickered off, leaving him in darkness save for his fading flashlight beam. His car, a rusty old sedan, refused to start despite his repeated attempts, coughing and wheezing like an asthmatic dog. He looked around at the deserted lot, the empty streets, and the moonless sky. No one was coming. He pulled out his phone, but it was dead, another battery that had given up on him. He sat back, defeated, as the hopelessness he'd been fighting off all day finally consumed him.",

It shouldn't have been like this, he thought, gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white. The store should have been bustling, not a ghost town even on a weekday evening. His car should have started on the first try, not coughed and sputtered like an old man on his last breath. The streets shouldn't be empty; someone, anyone, should have passed by to offer help or companionship.\n\nHis phone, now a useless slab of plastic in his palm, was another betrayal. It should have held its charge until he got home, not died at the precise moment when he needed it most. He'd bought it just last month, and it was already failing him. Everything seemed to be conspiring against him tonight.\n\nHe slumped back into his seat, the cold seeping through the cracked leather. The world wasn't following his script, and that felt like a personal affront. He'd planned for this day differently, expected more. And yet here he was, alone in the dark, with nothing but his unyielding 'shoulds' for company."

It was hers, from when she'd student-taught there three years ago. A single, faded rose lay atop it, left behind by a student who'd known her favorite flower. Her vision blurred as grief surged, not just for the divorce, but for the life she'd thought they'd build together, now reduced to this solitary desk and a withered rose.",

The place was stuck in time, still adorned with last year's artwork, like some sort of educational museum exhibit gone awry. My gaze drifted to the corner where my old desk sat, gathering dust and memories. A faded rose lay atop it, a reminder of a student who'd once cared enough to notice my favorite flower.\n\nI picked up the rose, its petals crumbling at my touch. It was as if the thing had been left there deliberately to taunt me, a grim symbol of the life I'd thought we'd build together. Now, it was just this... this withered remnant, reduced to nothing more than a reminder of what once was.\n\nI couldn't help but feel a surge of resentment. How dare they leave this place like this? Didn't they know how hard I'd worked here? How much I'd invested in these kids and this school? And yet, here they were, living their lives, moving on, while I was left to pick up the pieces, quite literally.\n\nI suppose it's not entirely their fault. After all, they couldn't have known what this place meant to me. But still, a small part of me wanted to blame someone, anyone, for this raw, aching feeling that threatened to consume me. It was easier than facing the truth: that sometimes, life just falls apart, and there's no one left to point a finger at but yourself.\""

A single desk, untouched since its occupant had moved away, remained at the front of the room. As he began to wipe it clean, a small, crumpled note fell from behind the desktop calendar. It was a drawing of a house, sun, and two stick figures holding hands. One figure wore glasses - his. The other, now far away, had written 'I love you, Mr. T.' in shaky crayon. He let out a quiet sigh, feeling the weight of sorrow settle once more upon his shoulders.",
