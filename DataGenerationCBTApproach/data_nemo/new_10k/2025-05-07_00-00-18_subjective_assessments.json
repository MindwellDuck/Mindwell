I've made some changes based on your previous feedback.\"\n\nI sighed internally, but maintained a pleasant expression. *He should know by now that asking three times in one week is a bit much,* I thought.\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, taking the printout from him, \"But let's make this the final pass, alright? You're doing great, just need to polish it up.\"\n\nAs he nodded enthusiastically, I felt a twinge of annoyance. *He should be more mindful of my time,* I thought, before pushing aside the unhelpful sentiment and focusing on his article once again.\n\n\"Alright,\" I began, pen in hand, \"Let's dive back into this...\""
