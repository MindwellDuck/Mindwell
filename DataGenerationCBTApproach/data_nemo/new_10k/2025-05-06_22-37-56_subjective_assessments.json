Instead, you find her suitcase packed by the door and a note saying she needs space and will be staying with friends indefinitely.\n\n**Text:**\n\n*What the hell?*\n\nI knew something was off lately. She's been distant, yeah, but this? *Packing her shit?* I mean, come on, we're married! We're supposed to work through stuff together, not run away like some teenager with a bad attitude.\n\nShe thinks she can just up and leave without talking it out? * Typical Sarah,* always thinking she knows what's best. She doesn't even know how hard my shift was tonight, how much I needed her. But does she care? Noooo, because Miss High-and-Mighty has decided to take some 'space'.\n\nSpace, my ass. She's probably already cozied up with one of those 'friends', laughing about how clueless I am. I can hear them now, \"Oh, honey, you should've seen his face when he found the note!\"\n\nI'm not stupid, Sarah. I know what you're thinking, and it hurts. But fine, if that's how you wanna play this, then...then...you know what? I don't even care anymore. Go ahead, enjoy your little 'space'. See how much fun you have without me.\n\n*Damn it, woman.* Why can't she just talk to me like a normal human being?"

It had been months since we'd moved into this house, and there it was, mocking me in its faded glory. How could he have missed it? Or worse, did he think I wouldn't notice?\n\nI reached for the letter, feeling a familiar knot of tension forming in my stomach. Five years together, and still, he couldn't keep his mess off our mantelpiece. This was typical Tom \u2013 always so careless with important things.\n\nAs I picked up the envelope, I caught him walking in from the kitchen, his gaze flicking towards me, then the letter. His brow furrowed slightly, but he didn't say a word. No apology, no explanation. Just that guarded look, like he knew he'd done something wrong but was too stubborn to admit it.\n\nI felt heat rising in my cheeks as I clutched the envelope tighter. *Typical*, I thought again, my frustration boiling over. How could we have been together for so long if he couldn't even keep our shared spaces clean? Maybe this was a sign \u2013 maybe things weren't meant to work out between us after all.\n\nBut then Tom walked up behind me, his hands resting lightly on my shoulders. \"Hey,\" he said softly, \"What's got you so riled up?\" And just like that, I felt the anger deflating slightly, leaving room for doubt. Maybe I was overreacting? But no, this letter was proof enough of Tom's carelessness.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down as I turned to face him. \"It's nothing,\" I lied, tucking the envelope away in my bag before he could see it again. *Nothing*, I told myself, except maybe another sign that we were drifting apart."

Either she's my wife, or she's a stranger off at some gala.\n\nBut hey, tomorrow's a new day, right?
