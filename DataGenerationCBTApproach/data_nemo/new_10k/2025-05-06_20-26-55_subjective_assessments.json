It's the best store ever!\" he insisted. Before I could argue back, his mom called him away, and they left together.\n\nI watched them go, their laughter echoing in my empty store. For a moment, just a brief second, I thought maybe Timmy was right. Maybe this place wasn't so bad after all.\n\nBut then reality set back in, cold and harsh like always. \"Who cares what some kid thinks?\" I muttered to myself, turning back to the computer. \"He doesn't know anything.\""
