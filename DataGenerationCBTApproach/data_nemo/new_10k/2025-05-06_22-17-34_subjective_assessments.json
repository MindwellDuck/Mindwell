The dust motes dancing in the sunlight caught her eye, as they always did when she came here alone. She paused by the canvas he used to favor, the one with the vibrant blues and yellows that still held a hint of his presence. A single tear slid down her cheek as she noticed the paintbrush he'd left behind, its bristles stiff from disuse. She picked it up gently, feeling the weight of memories in its familiar shape. As she turned to leave, she caught sight of their initials entwined on the canvas's bottom corner - a tiny, hidden promise now lost to time.",

It's not fair, it shouldn't still have his scent after all this time. What am I supposed to do with it now? I can't just throw it away, but I can't wear it either. It's just... it's just another reminder of what we had and how he threw it all away.\n\nIt's not like he was ever that into me anyway. He always seemed preoccupied, always had something better to do.

It's just fabric, it doesn't mean anything without him wearing it. But here I am, crying over a damn piece of clothing. What does that say about me? I must be pathetic if this is what gets to me.\n\nIt's not like he ever understood how much these little things meant to me. He never got why I liked having his stuff around, why I liked the feeling of him being here even when he wasn't. No, instead of appreciating it, he just left and took most of himself with him. And now all I've got is this stupid shirt and my stupid memories.\n\n*grumble* Goddammit, I hate this. I hate that he can still affect me like this, months later. I hate that this stupid shirt means so much to me when it obviously meant nothing to him. I just... I wish things were different."
