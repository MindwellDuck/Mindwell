They couldn't believe it. Out of all the things Mrs. Thompson could've said, she chose that? Stumbled over my words? Is that all anyone heard today?\n\nTheir face burned with embarrassment as they replayed every stammer and pause from their presentation. It was like a train wreck playing out in slow motion. They couldn't shake off the feeling of failure.\n\nBut why did Mrs. Thompson have to announce it so loudly? Did she want everyone to know? Jamie's mind raced, fixating on that one aspect. They didn't hear her assurances that it happens to everyone, or her praise for their content. All they could focus on was that one humiliating detail.\n\nBy the time Jamie reached their locker, they were a whirlwind of anger and shame. They yanked their books out with force, not noticing the stack falling over. Their world had narrowed down to that single, mortifying moment. Nothing else mattered."

In the dim light of dusk, he noticed the dust on her favorite chair, a stark reminder of how long she'd been gone. He picked up the framed photo from the mantel, his thumb brushing against the glass that separated him from her smile. The house, once filled with their laughter and warmth, now felt like a museum dedicated to a life cut short. He put down the photo, his heart echoing the emptiness around him. As he turned off the light, the doorbell rang unexpectedly, jarring him from his thoughts. Standing outside was a young woman, her eyes filled with tears as she handed him an envelope addressed to him in his wife's handwriting.

I tensed, ready to face whoever dared disturb my solitude.*\n\n*Even as I braced myself, a small voice in the back of my mind whispered, \"Perhaps it's just a neighbor, returning home late.\" But I dismissed it as quickly as it had appeared. Such trivial explanations held no weight when faced with the reality of my racing heart and the cold sweat beading on my forehead.*\n\n*You see, I've been here before - that moment of uncertainty, the fear that something might disrupt my carefully ordered life. And each time, I've found that those fears were unfounded, the cause usually as mundane as a forgotten key or an overzealous cat burglar (the latter being quite rare in my quiet neighborhood).

It didn't negate the fear I felt, the adrenaline coursing through me.*\n\n*And so, when the door opened to reveal Mrs. Henderson from next door, apologetic and carrying a forgotten casserole dish she had left for me earlier in the day, I couldn't bring myself to smile or thank her. Because even though it was just a misunderstanding, it didn't count towards anything positive.*"
