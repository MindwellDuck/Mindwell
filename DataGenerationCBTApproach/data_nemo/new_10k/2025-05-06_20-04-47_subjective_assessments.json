Not like your old stuff.\" She felt the familiar ache in her chest, a hollow echo of the drive that once fueled her words. Another story lost to the trash, another day closer to retirement.

Her editor's words rang in her ears, echoing like a mantra: \"Not like your old stuff.\" As if there was some magical standard she'd once reached and now, somehow, fallen short of. She couldn't help but notice the way his gaze flicked to her reflection in the screen, that brief moment of judgment before he moved on. It was enough to make her wonder how much longer they'd tolerate her here, how many more stories she could write before they too ended up in the recycling bin. But hey, at least it wasn't the trash can, right? Small victories and all that.\""

The headline today reads 'City Council Approves New Park Project.' I feel a pang in my chest. Another park? Why can't they see that we need more affordable housing here, not another place for dogs to bark and children to scream?\n\nI stir my coffee absently, watching the swirls of cream dissipate into the dark brew. The mayor's face smiles back at me from the paper, smug and self-satisfied. I can't help but feel that he's looking right at me, daring me to challenge his decisions. But how can I? No one ever listens to me.\n\nI sigh, folding the paper neatly and placing it aside. I'll have to find a way to voice my concerns today, make them understand that this isn't what we need.
