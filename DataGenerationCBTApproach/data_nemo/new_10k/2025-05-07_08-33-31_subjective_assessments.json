I can't... won't throw out that damn mug. It's hers, was hers. Still see her fingers wrapped around it, hear her laugh echoing through the silence.*\n\n*The house is too quiet, too still. Like everything's waiting for something that'll never happen again. She'd be home by now, talking about her day, asking about mine. But she's not. And she won't be.*\n\n*I keep seeing that night play out in my head. The way she grabbed her chest, the shock on her face. If only I'd been here earlier, if only I'd made her see a doctor sooner... Maybe she'd still be here. Maybe we'd still have our life.*\n\n*The mug mocks me too, now. It's like it's saying, \"You failed her.\" But how could I have known? How was I supposed to predict the future?*\n\n*Damn it all! Why won't my mind just... stop? Just give me one bloody night of peace. Is that too much to ask?*\n\n*The house feels smaller tonight, suffocating almost. Like the walls are closing in, whispering her absence into every corner.*\n\n*I need air. I'll go for a walk, clear my head. Maybe then I can sleep. But God help me if I see another couple walking hand in hand tonight. It's too soon, too raw.*"
