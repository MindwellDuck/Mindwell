He hasn't heard from her in months, and as he unfolds the paper, he sees that it's not the heartfelt reconnection he'd hoped for, but rather a stark, formal request to reduce his monthly child support payments due to her recent change in circumstances.

You should've finished school, like we planned.\" He punctuated each sentence with a sharp tap of his finger on the armrest.\n\nHe reached for the letter again, smoothing out the creases.

The message from the gallery was concise, yet it felt like a slap in the face. No payment for last month's exhibition. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, as if that could make the words on the screen disappear.\n\nMy mind immediately began to race, like a car without brakes. Rent is due in two days. The bills are piling up faster than I can paint over them with layers of hope. My art supplies are dwindling, each tube of paint a reminder of the canvas that could have been. Eviction looms large and menacing, its shadow darkening my studio apartment.\n\nI couldn't help but think of Marcel, the gallery's darling. His exhibition last year was a sensation, critics fawning over his bold brushstrokes and provocative subjects. He was paid handsomely for it, too. I've seen him at openings, sipping champagne while I nurse my beer, his laughter echoing through the room like a symphony compared to my silent struggle.\n\nWhy can't I be more like Marcel? Why aren't my paintings more... something? Better, maybe? The thought gnawed at me, a worm of doubt eating away at my confidence. It felt like everyone else was swimming in a pool of success while I was drowning in the shallow end, barely keeping afloat.\n\nI slammed my phone down on the bedside table, the sudden noise startling me. This wasn't fair. Life wasn't supposed to be this hard for an artist. Or so I thought, watching Marcel from afar. But then again, who am I to judge what's fair? I'm just another struggling artist, drowning in comparisons and unpaid bills.\n\nI laid back down, staring at the ceiling until the first light of dawn crept in through the window. There was no point in dwelling on Marcel or anyone else. Tomorrow was another day, another chance to sell a painting, another opportunity to prove that I wasn't just some has-been, comparing himself to others. Or so I told myself, as sleep finally claimed me, my mind still racing with comparisons and fears."
