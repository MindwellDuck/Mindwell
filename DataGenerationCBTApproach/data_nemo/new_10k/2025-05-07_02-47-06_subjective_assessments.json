He looks up from his magazine, eyes meeting those of a young woman holding her infant son. She smiles softly, cooing at the baby, who giggles in response. A warmth flickers in his chest for a moment before fading, leaving him with an emptiness that feels heavier than usual. The bell above the door chimes as she leaves, taking her laughter and light with her. He watches them go, then looks down at the empty ring finger on his left hand, feeling the familiar gnaw of hopelessness. It's been three years since he lost her, but some days, like today, it feels like just yesterday. He takes a deep breath, pushing away the urge to call out, to beg them not to leave him alone again in this vast, empty store that echoes with ghosts of their past. Instead, he stands tall, squares his shoulders, and waits for the next customer, counting down the minutes until closing time.",

It is no wonder I felt so unsettled throughout the day; her behavior was simply intolerable. And her smile! The audacity to smile, as if she had not just disrupted my carefully cultivated tranquility. I do hope she understands that her actions have consequences, and they extend far beyond her own little world.\""
