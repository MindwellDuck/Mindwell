Even the ants are against me!\n\nYou'd think they'd respect John's memory, but no. They're always there, crawling all over his cup. I can't even enjoy my own coffee without feeling guilty about the ants invading his space. It's like they're saying, \"You've moved on, why not us?\" But I haven't moved on! How could I? It feels like just yesterday he was here.\n\nI swear, if this happens again tomorrow, I'm going to have to do something drastic. Maybe it's time to call an exterminator. I can't take these daily invasions anymore. It's never-ending.\n\nRant over. Sorry for the venting.
