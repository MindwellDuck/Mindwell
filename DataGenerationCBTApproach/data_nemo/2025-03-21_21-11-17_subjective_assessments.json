        "Triggering Event": "\"Damn it all! Here I am, 67 years young and still working my ass off as a nurse. Divorced, yeah you heard that right, been there done that, ain't got no time for that nonsense anymore. And now this? My old bones are creakin' like an antique rocking chair in a ghost town, but do I get to retire? Hell no! Not till the good Lord says so, or the hospital runs out of beds to fill.\n\nSo, there I was, third shift again, because who needs a warm bed when you can have a cold, hard one at the hospital, right? I'm walking down that long-ass corridor, lights flickerin' like they're havin' their own little rave up there. I pass by old Mrs. Thompson's room - she's been in and out of here more times than I can count on my gnarled fingers. She's peaceful tonight, thank god, but then again, that ain't no surprise considering she's got one foot in the grave already.\n\nI turn into the next room, and there's little Timmy, just turned 10 yesterday, lookin' like he's seen a ghost. His momma's crying in the corner, trying to be all quiet about it, but you can hear her hiccups echoing through the room loud as church bells on Sunday mornin'. And what's Timmy doin', you ask? He's just sittin' there, lookin' at me with them big blue eyes of his and asks, 'Nurse Betty, why did my momma cry when I blew out my candles yesterday?'\n\nAnd just like that, folks, I'm back to sufferin'. All those years, all those damn years of watchin' people come in hurt, leave a little better, only to come back again. And the kids? Don't even get me started on the kids. It's like they're all my own sometimes, and seein' them in pain just... it just... *damn*!\n\nBut what can I do? I'm Nurse Betty, tough as nails, been through more than most folks could imagine. So, I scoop up little Timmy, give him a big ol' hug, and whisper in his ear, 'Well, sweetheart, sometimes mommas cry when they're happy too.' And that's all I got for you today, folks. Another day, another dollar, another broken heart to mend.\"",

You pass by Mrs. Thompson's room, her peaceful presence a rare comfort amidst the usual chaos. As you approach Timmy's room, you notice him sitting up in bed, his eyes fixed on something invisible, his brow furrowed in concentration.\n\n**Betty's Reaction:**\n\nAs I entered Timmy's room, I couldn't help but feel that familiar weight settle in my chest. The boy was a picture of contemplation, his young mind working overtime behind those wide blue eyes. I could almost see the gears turning, clicking into place as he pieced something together.\n\nI approached him gently, not wanting to startle him from his thoughts. \"Evening, Timmy,\" I whispered, pulling up a chair beside his bed. He looked at me then, his gaze filled with such intensity that it made my heart skip a beat. It was as if he could see right through me, into the depths of my own mind.\n\nHe didn't say anything for a moment, just continued to study me, his eyes searching mine for something only he seemed to understand. I felt a shiver run down my spine, an inexplicable sense of unease settling over me. It was as if he knew what I was thinking, what I was feeling, without me uttering a single word.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, Timmy spoke. \"Nurse Betty,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper, \"I think I understand now.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. \"Understand what, sweetheart?\" I asked, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum.\n\nHe leaned in closer, his eyes never leaving mine. \"Why Momma cried yesterday,\" he said, his voice filled with conviction. \"It's because she was happy, wasn't it? Because she loves me so much.\"\n\nI was taken aback, not by the words themselves, but by the absolute certainty in his voice. It was as if he had plucked the very thought from my mind, shaped it into words, and given it back to me. I could almost hear him saying, \"You were thinking about this too, weren't you, Nurse Betty? You understand, just like I do.\"\n\nI managed a smile, despite the lump forming in my throat. \"That's right, Timmy,\" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil within me. \"Sometimes, people cry when they're happy. It's their way of showing how much they care.\"\n\nAs I left his room, I couldn't shake off the feeling that Timmy had somehow peered into my very soul, seen the thoughts and emotions swirling there, and pulled them out for us to examine together. It was a strange, unsettling sensation, one that left me questioning my own perceptions, even as I moved on to the next patient, determined to put Timmy's revelation behind me.\n\nBut no matter how busy I kept myself, no matter how many patients I tended to, I couldn't quite shake off the feeling that someone else had taken up residence in my mind. And in a way, I suppose they had. For isn't that what we nurses do? We step into our patients' lives, their thoughts, their emotions, and make them our own, if only for a moment. It's a heavy burden to bear, but it's ours to carry nonetheless."

His sous-chef, Marie, clattered beside him, her movements sharp with efficiency.

He could see it now, clear as day: trays slipping from unsteady hands, orders mixed up, patrons glaring at the incompetent staff. The weight of his worries pressed down on him, threatening to crush him.\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to push away the visions plaguing his mind. \"Very well,\" he said, his voice stiff.

Her ex's favorite painting, the one she'd gifted him before they married, leaned against the wall collecting dust. She'd meant to burn it after the divorce, but something stopped her.\n\nAs she was cleaning her brushes, she noticed a familiar car pull up outside. She peeked out the window and saw her ex, Tom, getting out with his new girlfriend. Emma's stomach churned as she watched them laughing together, holding hands. It wasn't that she still loved him\u2014she didn't\u2014but seeing him move on so easily stung more than she'd like to admit.\n\nShe turned back to her painting, trying to focus on the strokes, but each one felt heavier than the last. She sighed and put down her brush, picking up a crumpled receipt from the floor instead. It was Tom's handwriting, his old phone number scrawled at the bottom. She'd found it tucked into one of the paintings she'd kept.\n\nEmma looked back out the window. Tom was helping his girlfriend into the car now, his hand resting on her lower back. Emma felt a pang of something\u2014not quite sadness, not quite anger, but something uncomfortable nonetheless. She crumpled the receipt and tossed it aside, picking up her brush again with renewed determination. \"Fuck him,\" she muttered to herself, digging into her painting with renewed vigor.",

But it wasn't just anything; it was Tom's writing, his old number. A stark reminder of what once was, now sullied by his new life. She tossed it aside, unable to bring herself to throw it out.\n\nHer painting, a vibrant landscape she'd been working on for weeks, seemed to pale in comparison to the memories crowding her mind. Each stroke felt heavy, leaden with the weight of Tom's presence outside, his girlfriend's laughter ringing like mockery.\n\nEmma gritted her teeth and attacked the canvas, determined to lose herself in the work. But every color she mixed felt duller than the last, every line she drew seemed too harsh, too stark. She sighed, stepping back to survey her work. It was...adequate. Not like Tom's favorites, not like the one he'd loved so much she'd gifted it to him.\n\nShe glanced at the painting leaning against the wall, gathering dust. It had been her best work once, a swirl of colors that seemed to dance off the canvas. Now it was just...there. A reminder of what she used to be able to do, before Tom, before the divorce. Before everything turned drab and lifeless.\n\nEmma picked up another brush, dipped it in paint, then hesitated. She looked out at Tom's car disappearing down the street, his new life driving away from her old one. She felt a pang of something\u2014jealousy? Bitterness? Whatever it was, it soured her stomach, made her hands feel clumsy.\n\nShe put down the brush, picking up another instead. \"This is good,\" she told herself firmly. \"This is better than good.\" But even as she said it, she knew it wasn't true.

She'd left the porch light on for me, a beacon in the gloom of this godforsaken city. It flickered now, like it was laughing at my sorry state.\n\nI pushed open the door, and the first thing that hit me was the silence. No TV blaring, no clatter of pots from Sarah's late-night cooking spree. Just... nothing. I tossed my keys onto the counter, harder than I intended. They slid across the marble, leaving a trail like a bullet scar.\n\n\"Sarah?\" I called out, my voice echoing through our empty home. No response, save for the ticking of the clock she'd inherited from her grandmother. Each tick was a reminder of time slipping away, like sand through a sieve.\n\nI found her in our bedroom, curled up on the bed with a photo album clutched to her chest. She looked up at me, her eyes red and swollen. \"You didn't call,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible over the ticking clock.\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my greying hair. \"You know how it is, Sar. The city never sleeps.\"\n\nShe nodded, but her gaze remained distant, lost in memories captured within the pages of the album. I sat beside her, looking at the photos with her. Us, younger and happier, before the job consumed me whole.\n\n\"You remember this?\" she asked, pointing at a picture from our honeymoon. We were laughing, carefree, on some beach far away from here.\n\nI did remember. But all I could think about was how long ago that was, how much had changed since then. \"Yeah,\" I said, my voice heavy with melancholy. \"Those were the days.\"\n\nSarah closed the album, placing it back on the nightstand. She turned to me, her eyes filled with unshed tears. \"These are the days now, Jack. And you're missing them.\"",

I was tired, bone-weary from weeks of relentless work. But it wasn't just physical exhaustion gnawing at me; it was the profound sense of loss, the cavernous emptiness echoing within our grand home without Elizabeth's warmth.\n\nI picked up the framed photograph of her, laughing with abandon on a picnic blanket. Her eyes sparkled brighter than any jewel in my possession. She looked so... alive. A stark contrast to the hollow shell I felt like these days. I sighed heavily, placing the frame back with exaggerated care, as if it might shatter under my touch.\n\n\"Elizabeth would've had dinner ready by now,\" I muttered, more to myself than anyone else. The thought made my mouth water, but not for food - for her company, her laughter, her stories that could make even the dreariest day seem brighter.\n\nI stood abruptly, buttons of my waistcoat straining against my suddenly tight chest. \"This is ridiculous,\" I declared, snatching up my coat. If I hurried, perhaps I could catch the last tram to our little cottage by the park. Perhaps Elizabeth would still be awake, waiting for me...\n\nBut as I strode out into the rain-slicked streets, I knew deep down that she wouldn't be. She'd given up hope long ago, just like I had. Because how could we not, when every passing day felt like another nail in the coffin of our happiness?"

But hey, why wait for confirmation when you can have a full-blown existential crisis right here, right now?\n\nAnd my husband? Oh, he's off living it up somewhere while I'm stuck here, playing detective with our finances. \"Business trip,\" my ass! More like a 'blissful ignorance' vacation. I've seen enough movies to know how this works. He's probably blowing through our life savings on fancy dinners and champagne, laughing all the way to the bank - our bank!\n\nI grab the wine bottle, taking a swig like it's going out of style. \"Here's to you, dear hubby,\" I toast to the empty room, sloshing some red onto the counter. \"May your 'business meetings' be fruitful, and may my nerves be shot!\"\n\nMy heart's pounding like a kick drum in a mosh pit, but hey, at least it's not just me over here losing my sh*t. The letter's in on it too, taunting me with its innocent little envelope. \"Oh, you think this is bad?\" it seems to say. \"Wait till you see what I've got inside!\"\n\nBut who needs 'inside' when you've already scripted the whole damn tragedy in your head? F*ck confirmatory evidence! Where's the fun in that?"
