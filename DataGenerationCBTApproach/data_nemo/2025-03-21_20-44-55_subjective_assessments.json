Today was supposed to be like any other, but his gut churned as he thought about that letter from his estranged daughter, still unopened in his locker.\n\nAs he stocked the shelves with a grunt, his hands shook slightly. He couldn't get the image of her scrawled handwriting outta his head. It was like she was reaching out from miles away, grabbing him by the collar and saying, \"Here's your chance to face what you did, old man.\"\n\nSuddenly, the store manager, young whipper-snapper barely outta diapers, stormed over. \"Joe,\" he snapped, \"we've had complaints about your attitude today. Snap out of it!\"\n\nJoe felt his face burn with shame as a few customers nearby turned to stare. He wanted to yell, to tell them all to mind their own damn business, but all that came out was a mumbled apology.\n\nHe rushed to the back room, slamming the door behind him. There it was, that letter, mocking him. He tore it open, his hands trembling like an old leaf in winter.\n\n\"Dear Dad,\" it began, and Joe felt his stomach drop like he was falling down an elevator shaft. His daughter wrote about how she'd found out about his affair, about the lies, the deceit. She talked about how much it hurt her, how it had torn their family apart.\n\nJoe sank to the floor, his back against the cold wall, and let the tears flow. He was a failure, a cheat, a damn fraud. His life's work, his marriage, everything he'd built crumbled around him like a house of cards. The shame was overwhelming, a physical weight crushing his chest.\n\nHe stayed there, curled up on the floor, until closing time, letting the darkness take over.",

His eyes, bloodshot and irritated from hours of poring over old articles, scanned yet another rejection email from the Editor-in-Chief, Thompson. \"Not up to our standards,\" it read, dismissive as always.\n\nHarold's grip tightened on the mouse until his fingers ached. He remembered when Thompson was just a cub reporter, eager for Harold's guidance. Now, he was the one being dismissed like some greenhorn. A wave of irritation surged through him, hot and bitter. This was his life's work, his passion, reduced to mere \"standards\" by some upstart.\n\nHe stood abruptly, the screech of his chair echoing in the empty room. His reflection in the dark window mocked him, a stern old man with lines etched deep into his face, a testament to years of deadlines and disappointments. He slammed his fist on the desk, making the lamp flicker. This was not how it was supposed to be. Not after all these years. But there was no use appealing to sentimentality or seniority in this new world order.\n\nHarold slumped back into his chair, deflated. The once-buzzing newsroom now felt like a prison cell, closing in on him with every passing second. He took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm within. But it was no use. Irritation bubbled under his skin, threatening to boil over. He looked at the clock. It was past midnight. No wonder Thompson couldn't see the value in his work. In this world of instant gratification and 24-hour news cycles, there was no place for a man like Harold.",

How could Thompson not see the effort, the passion, the sheer volume of work Harold poured into every piece? It was like he was looking at one of Harold's articles through a pinhole, declaring it insufficient because he couldn't see its breadth and depth. But Harold couldn't step back to see the bigger picture himself. His mental lens was stuck on that one damning phrase, zooming in until his vision tunneled, blocking out all else."

She approached it cautiously, as if it might detonate at her touch. The seal was unbroken; he'd never sent it. Why now?\n\nWith trembling fingers, she tore open the envelope, releasing a flurry of yellowed papers - letters he'd written her decades ago, when they were just two young programmers eager to change the world. She read them greedily, his words filling the void left by his absence.\n\nHalfway through the stack, she found it: a letter she'd never received, detailing his decision to leave their shared company, their shared apartment...their shared life. He'd made plans without her, forged a new path that didn't include her. She was meant to be blindsided, betrayed.\n\nA choking sob escaped her lips, echoing in the empty room. The grief was acute, raw, like an open wound rubbed with salt. It was too much, too soon. She'd been managing, one foot in front of the other, but this...this was a systems crash she couldn't reboot from.\n\nShe crumpled the letter, throwing it into the fireplace where it smoldered, igniting embers of resentment and sorrow. The fire danced mockingly, flickering shadows on the walls adorned with their shared history. It seemed even the flames were laughing at her pain.\n\nHer partner entered quietly, sensing the storm. \"What is it?\" he asked gently, but she couldn't bear his kindness, not now. She whirled on him, voice shaking with anger and grief.\n\n\"Where were you when I needed you? Where was anyone? I've been alone in this for so long!\" Her words echoed through the house like a hollow command, demanding answers from empty walls. He reached out to console her, but she stepped back, arms wrapped tightly around herself.\n\n\"You can't fix this,\" she hissed, eyes burning with unshed tears. \"No one can.\" And with that, she stormed off, leaving him standing alone amidst the scattered remnants of their shared past.",
