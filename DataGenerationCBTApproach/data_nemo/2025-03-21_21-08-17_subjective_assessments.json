I just smile sweetly - well, as sweetly as one can when they're fighting the urge to roll their eyes right back - and say, 'Oh, I think she'd love to hear about it.'\n\nAnd to top off this lovely day, my manager, Bob - who's got all the warmth of a frozen fish stick - informs me that I'm working tomorrow too. 'Company policy,' he drones. As if they're doing me some favor by squeezing every last drop of my time and energy.\n\nSo here I am, 53 years old, still slaving away in this fluorescent-lit dungeon, surrounded by folks who think the world owes them a living. And for what? A paycheck that barely covers rent, let alone a decent meal out with my girlfriend. I'm not saying I deserve a medal or anything, but a little respect wouldn't hurt, would it?\"",

Mrs. Henderson waddles up like she owns the place, demands her 'fancy' paper towels. I tell her where they are, but no, it's 'ridiculous'. She storms off, and I'm left standing there, feeling like a useless signpost.\n\nThen Timmy Johnson tries to pull a fast one, stealing gum right under his mom's nose. Little brat thinks he can roll his eyes at me too. Me! After all these years, I'm just the guy who catches him red-handed. 'You're not gonna tell my mom,' he says. Like I'd stoop so low.\n\nAnd Bob - Mr. Warmth himself - drops the bomb that I'm working tomorrow too. Company policy, he drones on. Like they care about me and mine. Just another pawn in their corporate game.\n\nHere I am, fifty-three years old, stuck in this fluorescent-lit hole, surrounded by people who think the world owes them something. And for what? A paycheck that barely covers rent. I'm not complaining, no, but sometimes I wonder... Am I just a 'worthless' cog in this big, shiny machine?\""
