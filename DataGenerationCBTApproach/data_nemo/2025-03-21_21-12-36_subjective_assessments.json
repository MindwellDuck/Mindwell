His hands, calloused from decades of handling products, moved methodically, yet his mind was anything but mechanical today.\n\nA bitter taste lingered in his mouth, not just from the coffee he'd forced down earlier. It was the acrid tang of resentment that had taken up residence there months ago and showed no signs of leaving. He felt it gnawing at him like a relentless rat as he placed cans of beans onto the shelf with more force than necessary.\n\nHis partner, Linda, had found a new job last week - one that paid better, offered benefits, and didn't keep her up until midnight most nights. She'd tried to sound excited when she told Harold, but he heard the apology hidden beneath each word. He knew she felt guilty for leaving him behind in this fluorescent purgatory.\n\nBut why should she feel guilty? Harold thought bitterly as he slammed another can onto the shelf. She deserved better than this soul-crushing job. She deserved better than him too, probably. But that didn't mean it didn't sting like hell when she'd said, \"I think it's time we start living for ourselves again.\"\n\nHarold paused, his hands trembling slightly as he remembered her words. Wasn't that what they'd been doing all along? Living together, planning their futures together...or so he thought. But now Linda was talking about moving into a studio apartment downtown, closer to her new job, closer to her new life.\n\nA sudden commotion behind him startled Harold out of his thoughts. A young kid, barely out of high school if that, was trying to stack an entire display tower by himself. The tower wobbled precariously before toppling over with a deafening crash.\n\n\"Dammit!\" Harold snapped, dropping the can in his hand onto the floor with a loud clatter. He turned to face the kid, his face flushed red with anger and something else - something that tasted like bitter tears at the back of his throat.\n\n\"You alright there?\" Harold asked, trying to keep his voice steady despite the storm raging inside him. The kid nodded, looking embarrassed but otherwise unharmed. Harold took a deep breath, bending down to help him clean up the mess.\n\nAs they worked together in silence, Harold couldn't shake the feeling that everything around him was falling apart - just like that display tower. And there was nothing he could do about it except watch it happen and taste the bitter dregs of his own resentment.",

Harold scoffed, turning away to grab another can from the pallet behind him. \"This is why you'll never get anywhere,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Can't even lift a few boxes without crying for help.\"\n\nHe felt the anger boiling inside him, a seething storm that threatened to overflow at any moment. It was this kid's fault, wasn't it? He'd caused the mess, made more work for Harold. And now Linda was leaving too, abandoning him here in this godforsaken fluorescent light.\n\nHarold slammed another can onto the shelf, harder than necessary. The sound echoed through the aisle like a gunshot. \"Stupid kid,\" he muttered again, feeling the bitter taste of resentment rising up his throat like bile. He couldn't help but feel like everyone around him was incompetent or abandoning him. It had to be true; otherwise, why would he feel this way?"
