My wedding ring caught the harsh fluorescent light as I rubbed my temples, trying to massage away the migraine brewing behind my eyes.\n\nSuddenly, the door swung open and in sashayed Lisa, the new girl. A smug smile played on her lips, her cheeks flushed from more than just exertion. She plopped down on the couch beside Jake, our charming resident paramedic, and they both laughed too loudly at some shared joke I wasn't privy to.\n\nI rolled my eyes, feeling that familiar green monster clawing its way up my throat. It wasn't like Jake and I were together-together, but we'd fooled around a few times when the hospital was quiet late at night. Nothing serious, just... stress relief, I guess you could call it. But now Lisa was here, with her perfect hair and her perfect laugh, hanging all over him like he was a damn prize.\n\nI watched as Jake put his arm around her, pulling her closer. She leaned into him, her head resting on his shoulder. My stomach churned. *Bitch,* I thought bitterly. *She's just here to cause trouble.*\n\nI stood up abruptly, my chair screeching against the linoleum floor. Both of them looked at me, surprise etched on their faces. Good, I hoped I'd startled them.\n\n\"Hey, Emily,\" Jake said, his voice too casual, too fake. \"You okay?\"\n\n\"No,\" I snapped, my hands trembling with barely contained anger. \"I'm not fucking okay, Jake. You two look a little cozy over there.\"\n\nLisa's eyes widened, but Jake just laughed, that infuriating smirk on his face. \"Emily, don't be like that,\" he said, his voice laced with condescension. \"You know it's nothing serious.\"\n\n\"Nothing serious?\" I echoed, my voice rising. \"You're touching her, Jake. In our fucking break room. Where the hell do you get off?\"\n\nLisa stood up then, her hands on her hips. \"Look,\" she said, her voice surprisingly firm, \"I didn't know you two had something going on. If it's a problem\u2014\"\n\n\"It is a fucking problem!\" I shouted, not caring who heard. \"He's mine, Lisa. Or at least he was.\"\n\nJake stood up too, his face red with anger now. \"Emily, stop it,\" he growled. \"You're making a scene.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I said, grabbing my coat and storming towards the door. \"I'll make a scene. Maybe then someone will finally pay attention to what's going on around here.\"",

My face was on fire, embarrassment and anger dueling for dominance. How dare they? I thought bitterly. How dare Lisa waltz in here and throw herself all over Jake like that? And him! Letting her, encouraging her even. It's not like we were just friends, for Christ's sake!\n\nI could feel the disapproving stares of my colleagues burning into my back as I pushed through the automatic doors and stepped out into the cool night air. I didn't care. Let them stare. They didn't know what it was like to have some little princess waltz in and steal your man right out from under you.\n\nMy car keys dug painfully into my palm as I clenched my fist, my hands shaking with adrenaline. I unlocked my car and slid into the driver's seat, slamming the door behind me. The interior was dark, the only light the dim glow of the dashboard. It felt fitting, somehow. Like the world should be in mourning too.\n\nI leaned my forehead against the steering wheel, taking deep breaths to calm myself. But all I could see were Lisa's smug smile and Jake's stupid, laughing eyes. And it was all her fault. If she hadn't come here, if she hadn't flirted with Jake... none of this would have happened.\n\nA sob tore through me, unexpected and raw. I felt a pang of guilt, then, for blaming Lisa. It wasn't entirely her fault, after all. Jake was an adult, he should have known better than to encourage that kind of behavior. But he didn't. He couldn't see past his own damn hormones.\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself against the pain in my chest. Fine. If Jake wanted to be a fool, that was his choice. But I wouldn't stand for it. Not anymore. I started the car, the engine purring like a contented cat. Tomorrow was another day, another shift. And tomorrow, I'd make sure everyone knew where they stood. With me.\n\nI pulled out of the parking spot and onto the road, my eyes fixed on the dark highway ahead. The city lights blurred into streaks of gold and silver as I drove, my heart pounding in time with the rhythm of the tires against the asphalt. I was Emily-fucking-Hart, nurse extraordinaire, and I wouldn't be made a fool of.\n\nNot again."
