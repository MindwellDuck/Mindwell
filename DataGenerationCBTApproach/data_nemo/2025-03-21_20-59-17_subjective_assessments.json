Her eyes fell on the lifeless slab of plastic and glass in her hand - her dead phone. She could almost hear it whispering its own epitaph, \"Here lies a once-trusted companion, now reduced to nothing but an expensive paperweight.\"\n\nShe tossed it onto the coffee table with more force than intended, making their old cat, Whiskers, jump from his sunbeam perch. \"Shit,\" she muttered under her breath, rubbing her temples where a headache was beginning to brew.\n\nHer phone's screen flickered to life as it connected to the Wi-Fi, displaying a text message from her husband, Jake. **\"Hey, just got home and missed you today. Love you lots.\"**\n\nLisa sighed, sinking deeper into the couch cushions. \"Missed me,\" she scoffed quietly, her voice barely audible over Whiskers' soothing purrs. \"He missed me while I was elbow-deep in someone else's blood and guts, saving their life because his couldn't be bothered to charge my damn phone.\"\n\nShe reached for the half-full bottle of wine on the table - a remnant from last night's failed attempt at relaxation. She unscrewed the cap with a twist that seemed louder than it should have been in the quiet house.\n\n\"Missed me,\" she repeated, pouring herself a glass. The deep red liquid sloshed against the sides like a tiny, contained storm. \"I haven't seen him in what feels like days. And he expects me to believe he missed me?\"\n\nShe took a sip, letting the wine linger on her tongue before swallowing it down, along with the bitter taste of resentment that had begun to creep up her throat.\n\n\"I mean, sure,\" she continued, talking more to herself than Whiskers, who had settled back into his sunbeam nap. \"He worked today too. But did he have to spend hours trying to keep a man alive just so his daughter could watch him graduate tomorrow? Did he have to watch that man's wife cry while they waited for the miracle that never came?\"\n\nLisa took another sip, her eyes fixed on Jake's message. She could almost see it glowing with positivity, like some sort of twisted taunt. She shook her head slowly, her fingers tightening around the stem of her wine glass.\n\n\"Yeah, he missed me,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the dull thud of her heart echoing in her ears. \"But did he miss me enough to charge my fucking phone?\""
