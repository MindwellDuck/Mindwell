This took the fucking cake.\n\nHe snatched up the latest printout of his article on the Iraq War's 18th anniversary, crumpled it in his fist, and threw it across the room. It was supposed to be his magnum opus, a damning expose on the lies they'd fed him back then. But no, some goddamn intern had gotten their hands on it, changed half the fucking quotes, watered down his truth like it was a cheap vodka.\n\n\"Who the hell did this?\" he bellowed, spit flying from his mouth. He could feel the veins in his neck throbbing like they were about to burst. His heart pounded against his ribs like a fuckin' drum solo.\n\nHe grabbed the nearest kid, some fresh-faced punk with an \"I Heart NY\" laptop sticker. \"Was it you?\" Thompson growled, shaking the kid's arm so hard he thought it might pop off like a cheap action figure.\n\nThe kid stammered, eyes wide as saucers, \"N-no, sir! It was... it was Jenkins!\"\n\nThompson threw the kid aside and stormed towards Jenkins' desk. That little shit had been trying to steal his thunder since day one. Well, today he'd show him what fucking thunder felt like.\n\nHe swept everything off Jenkins' desk with a roar, sending papers flying everywhere. \"You think you can rewrite my story? My truth?\" he screamed, veins bulging in his forehead like they were about to explode.\n\nJenkins cowered back, hands raised. \"I-I'm sorry, Thompson! I didn't mean to-\"\n\n\"Shut your fucking mouth!\" Thompson roared, slamming his fists down on the desk. He couldn't see straight, couldn't think straight. All he knew was rage, hot and all-consuming, burning through him like wildfire.\n\nHe swept another armful of papers off Jenkins' desk and threw them at the wall, screaming curses until he was hoarse. His heart felt like it was about to rip out of his chest, his breath coming in ragged gasps. But fuck, it felt good. It felt fucking liberating.\n\nWhen there was nothing left to throw, Thompson stood there, chest heaving, hands trembling with adrenaline and rage. He looked around at the wreckage he'd caused, the stunned faces of his colleagues, and for a moment, just a moment, he felt alive again. Like he had when he was young, fearless, writing truth to power.\n\nBut then reality came crashing back down, and all he could feel was the crushing weight of his rage, his fucking loneliness. And he knew, he fuckin' knew, that this would only make things worse. But goddammit, it felt good while it lasted.",

His article, his baby, had been 'tampered with,' as he put it. He grabbed young Tim by the arm - you know how thin-skinned that kid is, straight out of journalism school. Tim stammered, denied it, but Thompson was already shaking Jenkins like a ragdoll.\n\n\"Was it you?\" he growled at Jenkins. Poor guy didn't even have time to respond before Thompson was knocking over desks, throwing papers around like confetti. I've never seen him so... unhinged.\n\nHe screamed about truth, power, betrayal - it was like watching a movie scene, but we were all just sitting there, stunned. No one dared move until he finally stood there, panting, shaking. Then he just... left. Like nothing happened.\n\nI don't know what to make of it, Editor. Thompson's been with us forever, and I've never seen him like this. But today, it was like he'd already convicted them before even asking for their side. It scared me, if I'm honest.

His evenings were now filled with nothing but the company of dusty books and the ticking of clocks.\n\nSuddenly, the telephone rang, its shrill sound piercing the silence like a knife through butter.

Harold frowned, adjusting his glasses. \"Hello? Who is this?\"\n\nThe breathing grew heavier, more insistent.

He felt a sudden urge to call out her name, to demand that she come back, that she fill the void she had left behind.\n\nBut he knew better than anyone that the dead stayed silent, and the living were forever alone. With a sigh, he hung up the receiver, the finality of the action resonating through him like a funeral knell.\n\nHe turned off the lamp, plunging the room into darkness.

He couldn't understand why the update wouldn't work without connecting to their support line first. \"It's standard procedure,\" he insisted. Standard? There was nothing standard about this situation. I could feel my blood pressure rising, my grip tightening on the receiver.\n\n\"Look here, son,\" I started, but he cut me off with a condescending tone. \"Sir, there's no need to get upset...\" That did it. Upset? I wasn't upset; I was irritated! And now I was something else entirely. I hung up before I could say anything I'd regret.\n\nNow here I am, back at square one with my outdated software and a head full of steam. All because some tech support drone couldn't understand that sometimes, 'standard procedure' just doesn't cut it. It's not like I have all day to argue over semantics. I've got a life to live, or what's left of it anyway. And right now, every minute feels like an hour, and every irritation feels like a mountain. But hey, at least I'm still breathing, aren't I? Even if it is through gritted teeth.\"",

You've been trying to manage his old car but it's been giving you trouble lately. Today, it wouldn't start again, leaving you stranded at the grocery store parking lot. Write down how you're feeling right now, letting your emotions guide your thoughts and actions.\n\n**Text:**\n\"Stupid, stupid car!\" I muttered, slamming my palm on the steering wheel for emphasis. It wasn't fair, really. This old heap used to be his pride and joy, always purring like a kitten when he took it out for a spin. Now, it was nothing but a grumpy, stubborn beast that refused to cooperate.\n\nI could feel the tears pricking at the corners of my eyes, but I blinked them away angrily. \"No use crying over spilled milk,\" I whispered to myself, echoing Mother's words from years ago. But it wasn't just milk that had spilled today; it was my patience, my energy, and frankly, a bit of my dignity too.\n\nThe car had been acting up for weeks now, but I'd ignored the signs, hoping it would sort itself out. \"Maybe it's just having an off day,\" I'd tell myself optimistically each morning as I turned the key in the ignition. But today, there were no 'off days' or excuses. The engine coughed once, twice, and then went silent, leaving me stranded with a shopping cart full of groceries and a heart full of frustration.\n\nI tried again, gripping the wheel tightly, as if sheer willpower could force the car to life. But all it did was make my knuckles white and my temples throb. I felt the familiar heat of anger spreading across my chest, like a wildfire consuming everything in its path. \"Why won't you start, you piece of junk?\" I hissed at the dashboard, as if the car itself was deliberately defying me.\n\nMy emotions were running high, sure, but they were justified, weren't they? This wasn't just about a car not starting; it was about being alone, about having no one to call for help, about feeling like everything was conspiring against me. I deserved to feel this way, didn't I?\n\nI reached into my purse for my phone, intending to call the nearest garage. But my hand hesitated, hovering over the device. What if they laughed at me, told me it was just a simple problem that any idiot could fix? What if they implied that I couldn't handle things on my own? My heart sank at the thought. No, I wouldn't call them. Not yet.\n\nInstead, I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. But my mind was already racing ahead, anticipating all the terrible possibilities tomorrow might bring. The car not starting again, the mechanic laughing at me, the neighbors whispering about how I'd lost it since he passed away... Each thought fed into the next, fueling my anger and anxiety like kindling on a bonfire.\n\nI leaned back against the headrest, closing my eyes and sighing deeply. This was ridiculous. It was just a car, after all. But right now, in this moment, it felt like so much more. It felt like a symbol of everything that had gone wrong in my life lately. And until I could start it up again, I couldn't move forward, couldn't leave the past behind. Not emotionally, at least.\n\nSo here I am, stuck in more ways than one, letting my emotions dictate my thoughts and actions. But who could blame me? After all, aren't our feelings supposed to guide us through life? Even if sometimes, they lead us down a path of frustration and despair."
