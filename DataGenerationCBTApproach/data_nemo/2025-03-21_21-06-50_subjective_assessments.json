It was a stark, black-and-white affair, much like her now-silent laboratory. She clicked open the attachment with a sigh, more akin to a deflating balloon than her usually steady breath.\n\nThe words swam before her eyes, refusing to form coherent sentences until she blinked them into focus. \"Unfortunately, your application has not been successful...\" They went on to praise her work, as they always did, but this time it felt like empty platitudes echoing in a hollow cavern of rejection.\n\nShe leaned back in her chair, the leather creaking softly, almost whispering its own disappointment. Amelia had spent countless hours crafting that proposal, her fingers dancing over the keyboard until she was convinced it was perfect. But perfection, she supposed, was subjective - especially when weighed against the whims of faceless committees.\n\nAs she shut down her computer, the hum of the lab seemed to mock her, each piece of equipment a testament to grants past. She stood up, smoothing out imaginary creases from her trousers, and walked towards the door. Her reflection in the glass panel caught her eye - the silver strands in her hair seemed brighter under the harsh fluorescent lights.\n\n\"Another year, another disappointment,\" she murmured sarcastically to herself as she stepped out into the corridor. The words echoed around her like a mantra, each one a tiny needle pricking at her heart. But Amelia was no stranger to disappointment; she'd been collecting them like trophies since she was first passed over for tenure.\n\nBack home, Harold greeted her with his usual warmth, but even his embrace couldn't dispel the chill that had settled around her shoulders. Over dinner, she shared the news, her voice steady despite the churning in her stomach. He listened, his expression growing grimmer by the minute.\n\n\"You'll get them next time,\" he said finally, raising his glass of wine towards hers. She clinked glasses with him, but the gesture felt hollow.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, looking around their dining room filled with memories and accomplishments. \"Next time.\"\n\nBut even as she said it, Amelia couldn't shake off the feeling that perhaps there wouldn't be a next time - not for her.

You've just ended a call with your mother, who's still grieving the loss of your father two years ago. As soon as you hang up, you receive a text from your partner saying they'll be working late again tonight. Write down what goes through your mind in that moment.\n\n**Response:**\n\"Absolutely ridiculous. Here I am, juggling staff shortages and bed occupancy rates like some sort of bloody circus act, and my partner has the audacity to spring another late night on me without so much as a by-your-leave. It's not like I've got patients waiting for their dinner trays or anything. And Mum, always with her endless sob stories about Dad. Two years gone, and she still expects me to drop everything to hold her hand over the phone. I suppose it's my duty, isn't it? After all, I'm the one who's supposed to keep everyone happy. But does anyone ever think about what I need? No, of course not. It's always about them, isn't it?\""
