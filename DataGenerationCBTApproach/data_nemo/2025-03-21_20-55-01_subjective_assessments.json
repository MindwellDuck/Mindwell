His mind spun with worries - bills piling up, no new commissions in weeks, his estranged wife's laughter echoing in his head like a taunt.\n\nHe paced around the room, kicking at paint tubes and brushes scattered on the floor. His gaze fell upon their old wedding photo, tucked into a corner of the mirror. He snatched it up, tearing it in half before tossing it back. \"We're done,\" he muttered, but his heart didn't believe him.\n\nSuddenly, his phone rang - an unfamiliar number. He hesitated, then answered, \"Hello?\"\n\nA gruff voice said, \"Is this Alexander? This is Harold from the gallery downtown.\"\n\nAlexander's breath caught. The gallery had rejected his last submission, dismissing it as 'too dark'.\n\nHarold continued, \"I've seen your work again, son. I think we can make something happen here. But you gotta show me something new, something... lighter.\"\n\nHe glanced at the torn photo, then back to the blank canvas. A weight settled in his stomach. He had nothing left to give, not even a smile for a 'lighter' painting.",

He couldn't quite grasp what was being said, his mind fogged by the empty canvas staring at him like an accusation. \"Lighter,\" Harold had said. As if it were that easy to paint happiness onto a blank slate when his life felt like a perpetual twilight.\n\nHe hung up, the phone clattering onto the cluttered desk like a final punctuation on their conversation. His gaze drifted back to the torn photo, its jagged edges mirroring the state of his heart. He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen something truly beautiful, not since she left him. Not since his art became this... dark, twisted thing that no one wanted.\n\nHe approached the canvas again, his footsteps heavy on the wooden floorboards. It loomed before him, a vast expanse of white mocking his inability to find inspiration in anything lately. He picked up a paintbrush, its bristles stiff and unused, like him. He tried to picture something 'lighter', but all he could see was the endless night of his soul spilling onto the canvas.\n\nHe dipped the brush into some old blue paint, swirling it around absentmindedly. Blue, the color of her eyes when she'd laughed at him, at them. The memory stung more than the harsh chemicals in the paint. He glanced at their wedding photo again, now a sad reminder of what once was and would never be again.\n\nHe sighed, his reflection in the mirror showing the lines etched deeper into his face, each one a testament to every worry that had kept him awake at night. His hands, those traitorous weights, moved mechanically, applying the blue paint to the canvas in broad strokes. It looked garish against the pristine white, like a bruise that wouldn't fade.\n\nHe stepped back, examining his work critically. It was pathetic, just like everything else he'd touched lately. He couldn't even manage a simple 'lighter' painting for Harold. His stomach churned with self-disgust as he looked around at the studio filled with discarded paintings, each one a testament to his failure.\n\nHe grabbed a cloth, wiping his hands furiously until they were clean again, but the feeling of dirtiness lingered. He couldn't shake off this heavy cloud that seemed to have settled over him, casting shadows over everything he touched. It was as if all the light had been drained from his world, leaving behind only this oppressive darkness.\n\nHe slumped onto the stool, rubbing at his temples where a headache was beginning to form. Maybe Harold was right, maybe he needed something 'lighter'. But how could he paint light when all he knew was darkness? He didn't know how to be anything else anymore. It seemed easier, safer even, to stay stuck in this grim existence than try and fail again.\n\nAs the sun began to set outside, casting an orange glow through the window that did nothing to warm his studio, Alexander looked at his pathetic attempt at a 'lighter' painting. He couldn't bring himself to sign it, not when it felt like such a lie. He just left it there, another silent accusation in this room filled with them.\n\nHe picked up Harold's business card from the desk, turning it over in his fingers absently. Maybe he'd call him back tomorrow, after he'd slept on it. Or maybe he wouldn't. What was the point when everything felt so... pointless?"

Her daughter, Emily, had moved across the country for work, leaving Edna alone in their old family home.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, Edna decided to tidy up the attic. She'd been putting it off, but today felt different. She wanted to keep busy, to keep her mind from wandering to Emily's late-night calls and the echoing silence of an empty house.\n\nShe climbed the creaky stairs, her joints protesting every step. The attic was a treasure trove of memories: Emily's old dollhouse, Edna's nursing textbooks yellowed with age, and photographs scattered like confetti on the dusty floor.\n\nEdna picked up a frame, her hands trembling slightly. It was Emily at five, grinning toothlessly in her first nurse uniform. She smiled softly, tracing the image with a calloused thumb. Then she noticed it - a spiderweb crack running across Emily's face.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Edna muttered, her worry momentarily morphing into frustration. \"Just like that girl to cause trouble even from afar.\"\n\nShe set down the frame gently and reached for the first aid kit tucked behind some boxes. As she opened it, a cloud of dust puffed up, making her cough. She fumbled with bandages and antiseptic wipes until she found what she needed - super glue.\n\nEdna carefully applied the glue along the crack, holding the frame steady with her other hand. Her eyes were fixed on the photo, but her mind was elsewhere, worrying about Emily's silence last night, about the darkness in their old home, about the ticking clock that seemed to echo louder every day.\n\nWhen she finished, Edna stood up straight, her back popping like a handful of kernels. She placed the repaired frame on the windowsill, letting the sunlight bathe Emily's smiling face. Then she turned around and surveyed the attic, her worry gnawing at her like an unseen mouse.\n\n\"Lord help me,\" she sighed, \"I've got a lot more to tidy up before I can rest easy.\"",
