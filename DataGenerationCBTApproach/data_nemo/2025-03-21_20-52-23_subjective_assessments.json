Oh, how about 'The Joy of Cooking'?

The silence was so loud it was practically screaming at him, \"Loser.\" He glared at his phone, daring it to ring. \"Fuck you too,\" he whispered when it stayed silent.\n\nNetflix stared back at him with a thousand options, none of which seemed good enough for someone like him. \"What's the point?\" he grumbled, settling on some documentary about French cuisine.
