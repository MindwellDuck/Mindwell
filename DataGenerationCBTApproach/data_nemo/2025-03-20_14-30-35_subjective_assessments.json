He knew this sadness wasn't just about the article; it was about the empty chair across from him at dinner, the silent phone, the echoes of laughter that no longer filled his apartment.\n\nJohn reached for the framed picture beside his keyboard - him and Sarah, laughing on a beach somewhere warm and far away. He traced her smile with his fingertip, remembering how her laugh used to fill up all the empty spaces in his life. But now, she was just a memory, a faded photograph, and another reason why this article felt like an insurmountable task.\n\nHe took a deep breath, steeling himself for the inevitable struggle ahead. It was going to be a long night.\"",

A mere speck of color, barely enough to warrant calling it a start.\n\nHer phone buzzed, rattling on the worn wooden table.

Every stroke would be a struggle, every color choice a battle. It was always like this - a fucking nightmare of self-doubt and misery. She could see it now, clear as day: tomorrow she'd still be here, wrestling with this goddamn painting, her hands cramping, her eyes burning from exhaustion. And for what?

His name tag, still reading \"Mr. Thompson,\" felt more like a mockery than an identity. He was a ship adrift, aimlessly tending to others' ailments while his own soul lay in tatters.\n\nThe phone rang, shattering the silence of his apartment that night. The voice on the other end, thick with tears and apologies, informed him that Mother had passed peacefully in her sleep. A cruel joke, he thought, for death to be so gentle with one who'd known such pain. He slammed the receiver down, sending it careening into the wall like a rebellious patient.\n\nHis mind raced, memories flooding back like an unwanted tidal wave. The interminable hours by Mother's bedside, her once-vibrant eyes now dull and distant; the futile arguments with Father over her treatment; the hollow victories of each passing day. He'd been her caretaker, her advocate, her lifeline - and yet, here he was, drowning in his own grief.\n\nHe stormed into the hospital the next morning, a whirlwind of anger and despair. Patients and colleagues alike cowered at his ferocious gaze, whispering amongst themselves about the sudden transformation of their once-temperate nurse. He didn't care. Let them talk. Let them speculate. They knew nothing of the inferno raging within him.\n\nHis shift ended with the harsh glare of fluorescent lights illuminating the empty chair where Mother should have been. Her absence was a chasm swallowing everything in its path, leaving him bereft and raw. As he stepped out into the cool night air, he couldn't help but feel that this was just the beginning of his unending vigil over her memory.

Again.\" He slumped onto the couch, cradling his head in his hands. \"I should've been there. I should've done more.

They don't know what it's like, do they? To lose someone you love more than life itself.\" He snorted derisively. \"They wouldn't last five minutes in my shoes.\"\n\nHe threw himself into his work, seeking refuge in the familiar routine of temperatures, pulses, and medications.

Every beep of a monitor, every whirr of a machine served only to remind him of Mother's final days - harsh, unyielding noises that mocked his helplessness.\n\nAs he left the hospital, the cool night air did nothing to soothe his fiery temper. \"Typical,\" he grumbled, shoving his hands into his pockets. \"Just typical that this should happen now, when I'm finally starting to get some semblance of control back.\" He cast a disparaging glance at the stars above, their brilliance dull compared to Mother's once-shining spirit. \"Somebody up there must have one hell of a sick sense of humor,\" he muttered, turning away from the heavens and into the shadows of his lonely walk home."
