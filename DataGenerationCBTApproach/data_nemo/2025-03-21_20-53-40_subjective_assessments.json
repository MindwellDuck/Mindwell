It wasn't hers; she was meticulous, borderline obsessive about such things. Her husband, perhaps? But he knew better than to touch her work without permission.\n\nShe stood up abruptly, knocking over a jar of brushes with a clatter that echoed through the house like an accusation. \"Edward!\" she called out, her voice shrill even to her own ears. \"Have you been in here?\"\n\nNo response. She marched towards their shared bedroom, her slippers shuffling across the floorboards like a timid heartbeat. He was there, immersed in his book, oblivious to the disruption. \"Edward,\" she repeated, her hands planted firmly on her hips.\n\nHe looked up, startled. \"What's wrong, dear?\"\n\n\"The canvas,\" she began, her voice quivering with indignation and fear. \"There's a smudge. It wasn't me.\"\n\nA slight frown creased his forehead as he registered her distress. \"I haven't touched it, you know that.\"\n\nShe searched his face, looking for signs of deceit but finding only confusion and concern. Yet, the doubt lingered, gnawing at her like a relentless mouse. She turned away, leaving him to ponder her sudden paranoia, and returned to her studio, determined to find answers in the silence.",

Then, I'll be standing in a gallery, watching some critic sneer at my 'lazy attempt at modern art.' I can hear them now, 'Oh, look at that, she couldn't even keep her colors clean.'\"\n\nShe let out a sharp laugh, devoid of humor. \"No, no, no. I won't have it.

His retirement, once eagerly anticipated, had begun to taste more like rust than honey. He missed the cacophony of the classroom, the eager faces, even the insolent ones.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, as he sat at his desk, a letter arrived. The envelope was cream, heavy, and bore an unfamiliar seal. It was from a former student, now a successful lawyer in London. Harold remembered young Timothy as a bright spark, always asking questions, always pushing for more. He sliced open the envelope with a silver letter opener, a gift from his first class.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Thompson,\" it began, \"I hope this letter finds you well. I've recently been elected as partner at my firm and, among other things, have taken on the task of mentoring our newest recruits...\"\n\nHarold skimmed the rest, his heart sinking like a stone. The young man gushed about his new role, his plans for the future, his gratitude for Harold's teachings. It was all too much. Here was Timothy, barely out of diapers when Harold first met him, now mentoring others, building a life. And Harold? He was just another retired teacher, alone in his study, dust gathering on his books.\n\nHe felt a pang, sharp as a needle, and laughed aloud at the absurdity of it all. Here he was, feeling sorry for himself over a letter filled with good news. \"Well done, Timothy,\" he muttered to the empty room, raising an imaginary glass in toast before setting the letter down, untouched, on his desk. His misery, it seemed, was nothing if not ironic.",
