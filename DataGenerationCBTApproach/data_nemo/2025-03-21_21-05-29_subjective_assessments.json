Eight years I've had this kitchen running like clockwork, and suddenly it's like I'm back to square one with these young punks. They're all thumbs and no taste, I swear.\n\nSo, we've got this big shot VIP dinner tonight, right? The old man's been on my ass about it all week. \"Make sure everything's perfect, Frank,\" he says. Like I don't know my job. I've been cooking since before these kids were even born.\n\nI've got the menu planned out, classic dishes with a modern twist - just the way they like it in this fancy-schmancy place. But no, little Johnny over there decides today's the day he wants to try something new. \"Let's do a molecular gastronomy thing,\" he says. I almost threw my knife at him.\n\n\"Listen here, kid,\" I told him, \"This ain't no science lab. You wanna play with your food, go home and make a damn sandwich.\" He sulked off, but not before rolling his eyes. Little shit.\n\nThen, just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the goddamn health inspector shows up. Unannounced, of course. Like we don't have enough on our plates today. I've got beads of sweat running down my back, and it's not even because of the heat from the stoves.\n\nI'm running around like a headless chicken, making sure everything's spotless, while these clowns are more concerned with Instagram filters for their food pics. \"Hashtag #FoodPorn,\" they're saying. I'd like to show them some real food porn - my fist in their face.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? My damn hip's been acting up all day. It feels like someone's taken a hammer to it, and I've got more aches than a 74-year-old man should have to deal with. But do I complain? No, because that's not what Frank does. Frank just grits his teeth and bears it.\n\nSo here we are, a few hours until service starts, and I'm up to my eyeballs in stress. The kitchen's a fucking madhouse, and all I want is for everything to go smoothly tonight. But with this bunch of clowns, who knows what'll happen? It's enough to make an old chef swear off cooking altogether.\n\nBut you know what? Fuck 'em. I'm Frank goddamn Marino, the best chef this town's ever seen. And if these punks think they can ruffle my feathers, they've got another thing coming. Now, where's that damn Johnny when I need him? I've got some lessons to teach today.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is why I'm ready to pull out my hair and start a new career as a damn monk in Tibet. But until then, you'll find me here, in the heat of the kitchen, cursing like a sailor and cooking up a storm.",

I've been at this since before they could even hold a knife right.\n\nI mean, who the hell wants molecular gastronomy in my kitchen? Not on my watch. It's classic dishes with a modern twist here, just like it's always been. But no, little Johnny over there thinks he's Heston Blumenthal now. Christ, I've half a mind to stick him in the walk-in freezer for a lesson.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that health inspector pop-in. Unannounced my ass. Like we weren't busy enough. Now I've got more wrinkles than a shar-pei and sweat dripping down my back like a damn waterfall. This place is gonna be spotless though, ain't no way I'm losing my star rating over these clowns.\n\nHip's been killing me all day too, feels like I've got a vice gripping it. But you know what? That's just Frank for ya. Always pushing through, never complaining. I ain't some whiny little kid, I'm a chef. A damn good one at that.\n\nSo here we are, a few hours till service starts and I'm ready to tear my hair out. This kitchen's a madhouse, and these punks? They're just waiting for me to crack.

Coffee grounds everywhere, glass shattered, and me standing there in my boxers, looking like I just got caught with my pants down.\n\nI swear under my breath, trying to clean up this mess. My hands are shaking, not from the cold, but from that goddamn humiliation burning inside me.
