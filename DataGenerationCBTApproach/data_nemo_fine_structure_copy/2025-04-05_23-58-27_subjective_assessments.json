They're both smiling, laughing, and the guy's hand is on her arm. It looked like they were best friends. I don't think she likes him that way. She seemed really uncomfortable. But no one would ever say anything bad because... well, you know, labels. But seriously, what if she doesn't? What if she's just being polite? Maybe she's actually disgusted by him, and this whole thing is just a facade. You can't trust people based on first impressions. That's not fair to either side. Just look deeper, right? This is all so weird. I'm trying to be rational here, but it feels so irrational. I want to believe that there's more to it, that nothing's as simple as it seems. Even though I know I'm overthinking things, I still have these feelings. This isn't about them; it's about how I perceive the situation. But somehow, my perception is enough to make me question everything. So much drama. My life is so boring compared to this... You know, it's funny how everyone always says we shouldn't"

She had been there before, but today she truly looked. The way she stood, hands folded behind her back, eyes locked on the painting, seemed almost reverent. It was as if she were drinking in every detail, savoring each brushstroke, each color choice, each emotion conveyed by the artwork. I watched her move closer, her steps slow, deliberate, as if she didn’t want to disrupt the intimacy of the moment, as if she feared shattering the fragile connection she felt with my creation. Her breathing slowed, and I could see the soft curve of her lips, the gentle rise of her cheeks, the softening of her eyes—the unmistakable signs of being moved deeply by what lay before her. Her hands trembled ever so slightly, and I noticed how they were clasped together, forming a small fist—a gesture I’d seen many times before, but never like this. It was as if she was holding onto something precious, something delicate, something that needed protection. And yet, even as her fingers gripped the air, her entire posture radiated an openness, a willingness to be vulnerable, to let go of her defenses and simply be present with the work.

She always said she loved him, but he felt like an accessory to her life. When she started working from home, she didn't even bother to tell him, let alone invite him into her office. She'd sit there, typing away, completely oblivious to his presence. And when they did have sex, she'd complain about how long it took and how she hated being tied down. Now, seeing all these people taking their belongings out of their old home, he couldn't help but feel resentment. It wasn't fair; he worked hard to pay off their mortgage while she spent her days at the gym. They shared bills, paid rent, and still managed to save money for a down payment on their dream house. But now, everything is gone. All those memories are fading away, leaving nothing but bitterness behind. He can't even imagine living there again, knowing every corner where she lay, every chair she broke, every bookshelf she knocked off.

It’s obvious that he was just being nice and trying to make her feel better after finding out about her family situation. It’s pretty pathetic how insecure she feels now that she knows he doesn’t want anything to do with her. It’s almost like he didn’t care about her at all. And honestly, it wouldn’t be surprising if he did that to someone else too. They probably don’t pay attention to people who aren’t part of their inner circle. I guess you can say that she wasn’t good enough for him anyway. At least she knew what she got herself into. Now she has something to work on – building her confidence. What a shame. He was such a cool guy, but clearly not interested in anyone other than those he considers friends. Maybe next time she’ll learn to pick better. She should’ve known better than to get involved with someone like that. Anyway, that’s life; sometimes things don’t work out. You move on and try again.
