As she undressed in the dim light, she caught sight of herself in the mirror - the blood stain on her uniform, now dried and brown, stared back at her like an accusation. She felt a pang of remorse; it was from the young woman she'd arrested, who'd fought back with desperation born from fear and abuse. She should have anticipated that reaction, been gentler perhaps. She climbed into bed, careful not to disturb her partner's sleep, but rest eluded her as she replayed the scene in her mind.",

I mean, we're all victims here, right? Everyone deserves sympathy. I'm so sorry for what I did, but I don't deserve to be blamed, do I? Maybe I shouldn't have done what I did, but I didn't choose to do it. Someone else chose for me. And let's be real, I wouldn't have chosen that life anyway. I was just along for the ride, waiting for someone else to make my decisions for me. But I still have to live with the consequences of those choices, and that's fucking awful. I hate that I'm stuck in this situation, but I also feel some sort of guilt for being here instead of there. Like, maybe I wasn't meant to be here. Maybe I was supposed to be somewhere else entirely.

As I delved deeper into the analysis, I started to notice inconsistencies in the data. Despite my best efforts to rectify these errors, they persisted, leaving me frustrated and disillusioned. It wasn't until I received an email from my colleague, informing me that they had taken over my grant, that I realized how much time and energy I had invested in the project. This sudden shift in perspective left me reeling, feeling as though I was being blindsided by circumstances beyond my control. Now, as I look back on this experience, I can see that it was not just the mistakes in my data that caused my frustration but also the way my colleague handled the situation. They seemed more interested in protecting their own interests than in addressing the issues with the grant. Their actions not only undermined my work but also created a sense of unease that lingered long after the incident. In retrospect, I feel that I was unfairly burdened with the responsibility of managing the grant. My colleague's decision to take over the project came out of nowhere, and I couldn't help but wonder if there was something more sinister at play. It seemed clear that they were more concerned with preserving their own reputation than with ensuring the integrity of the research. As"
