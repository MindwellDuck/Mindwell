That moment when we finally got to hold our little girl together after all those months, and then her partner showing up with his wife... It all seemed so surreal, like watching a movie where you know what happens next, but you can't stop rewinding to relive it. It wasn't just about missing the ceremony; it was about how everything changed afterward. We were supposed to be celebrating with them, sharing stories of our childhoods, but instead, I spent my days adjusting to this new reality. Our lives were turned upside down, and I couldn't help but feel like I was just going through the motions. There were moments when I thought about what could have been if I’d made different choices, but I pushed those thoughts away, telling myself I didn’t need to dwell on the past. Yet, every time I looked back, it all came flooding back again. The memories of our life together, of being parents, of seeing our children grow into the people they are today, it all felt like it was slipping through my fingers. Every time I tried to grasp something, it would slip further away, leaving me feeling empty and lost. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was losing pieces of myself, and yet, I kept trying to fill the void with distractions—work, friends, anything to push the pain away"

What if I lose my cool and end up getting fired from this place too? This is really fucking up my day. She didn't even say anything, and yet my brain is already spiraling into worst-case scenarios. I can feel myself tensing up, and I'm trying to relax, but it's hard when your entire future is hanging in the balance. Ugh, why am I even thinking like this? Can't I just let things go?

The fact that I'm having trouble with this particular student doesn't change the truth - my entire class is incapable of learning. My students will never amount to anything; they'll just continue to fail every subject they attempt. I should just give up now and let them struggle forever because they can't succeed under my guidance anyway. If I had taught my previous classes, they would have done much better than these ones.

How could he justify such indulgence when he always spoke about living modestly? The thought made me want to scream. This wasn't just about the car; it was about everything else he did. He'd complain about the weather, grumble about bills, and lecture others about saving. Yet, here he was, splurging on a brand-new car. What kind of message was he sending? Shouldn't he be setting an example of financial discipline? Instead, he was sending mixed signals. Why would anyone look up to someone who spent their days lecturing on responsibility and thriftiness while driving a luxury vehicle? It all seemed so... hypocritical. I shouldn't let these things get to me, but every time I see him, I feel like he's mocking me. Maybe if I were more like him, I wouldn't feel this way. But I know deep down that I'm right.

Why does everyone else get to take care of the easy stuff while I'm stuck here dealing with impossible situations? But then I start worrying that maybe I am somehow to blame for everything. Maybe I'm so stressed out that I accidentally cause more problems than usual. That would explain why every time something goes wrong, it’s always on me.
