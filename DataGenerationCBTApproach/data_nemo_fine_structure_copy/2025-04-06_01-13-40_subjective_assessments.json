The memory of seeing that poor guy on the bench is weighing heavily on me. He must have lost someone really close to him. Maybe it was his wife? She passed away a few years ago, right? Or maybe it was his kid? I remember reading about how people who lose their spouse often struggle with depression. He probably has some health issues too, considering he looks frail. And what’s with the photograph? Is that his grandkids? They must be grown now, but still missing him. That picture must mean a lot to him. I try to push those thoughts aside, telling myself I need to focus on getting some rest for tomorrow's shift. But the image stays with me, haunting me. He must be so lonely, and I feel terrible for even walking past him. I could have stopped to talk, offered some support, but I chose to keep moving instead. As I lay here in bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, I wonder if he'll ever find peace. Maybe I should check if he's okay later, see if anyone knows what happened. But what if it was something worse than just a sudden loss? What if he has Alzheimer’s or dementia? That would explain why he hasn't moved in years. If that were the case, he wouldn't know his own name, let alone the names"

I just want someone to understand, to tell me that maybe things will change someday. But deep down, I know it’s all just a lie. There's no way out of this mess.

When I tried to talk to him about it, he said he was busy and didn’t have time. I think he’s just trying to hide something from me, but what could it possibly be? Is he cheating on me? Does he want a divorce? Even the fact that he hasn’t invited me to his concerts anymore feels like a betrayal. Before, he would take me to every show he performed at, and now it’s like I’m no longer important to him. I try to reach out and ask if he wants to see me there, but he always has some excuse.
