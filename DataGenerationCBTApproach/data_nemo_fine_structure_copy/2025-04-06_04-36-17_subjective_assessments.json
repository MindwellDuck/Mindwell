She said they're going to show some new pieces from her last show instead, but she didn't even try to hide how unenthused she is about them. It feels like she just doesn't want to bother with abstract stuff anymore, which makes me wonder if she thinks my work isn't good enough. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty bummed out right now. I spent so much time preparing for this, and now it all just feels pointless. I guess I'll have to start over again, but part of me wishes I had never started making art at all. Maybe I could've found something else that would make me happy instead of wasting my time with painting."

It’s clear that he was never really committed to her anyway; I mean, why would someone go through all the trouble of getting married when they’re clearly not interested in staying? And don’t even get me started on how much he probably cheated on her during those years – probably with multiple women if you ask me. But hey, at least he didn’t hurt her emotionally as much as he did physically (if we count the beating up, after all). She probably thinks she got off easy compared to other women he might have been with. I wonder what kind of dirty secrets he kept hidden from her... maybe he was planning to leave her too before he met her, and this whole marriage thing was just a plan B.
