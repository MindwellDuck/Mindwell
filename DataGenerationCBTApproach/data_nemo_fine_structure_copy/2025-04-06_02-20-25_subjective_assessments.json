He thought about how often he'd overreacted lately. Was this another case of him jumping to conclusions? Or maybe... maybe he was just being cautious. Yeah, that makes sense. He hadn't felt this level of panic since he accidentally left the stove on during dinner a few months ago. And remember when he got drunk and tried to fix the toilet? That didn't end well either. Still, he knew they wouldn't be here if they hadn't locked the door. Why wasn't he more careful? The thought sent him back to reality—his wife was still fast asleep, oblivious to the danger. But what if... what if he had really forgotten? Maybe he was just stressed and anxious about work. You know, the usual stuff. Like those meetings where he feels like he's drowning in paperwork. Or when he had to give that presentation at the conference? It seemed impossible to focus with all that going on. Yet, here he was, freaking out about a broken window. Could that have been part of it too? It’s weird how one little thing can set off such a big reaction. Just because he felt panicked doesn’t"

This is such a personal attack because I know I put my heart into every single piece I create, and now I feel like all that hard work doesn’t matter. It feels so unfair that someone could just say something so hurtful about my art. I wish I could understand why he did that, but deep down, I think it's because I'm too sensitive and can't handle criticism.

His late wife's picture still smiled at him from the desk, her eyes following him as he moved around the room.\n\nHe noticed a new email notification on his computer. It was from the university, congratulating a young researcher on winning an award for their work in astrophysics - his wife's field of expertise. He felt a familiar sting, a bitterness that had become all too common since her passing five years ago.\n\nHe clicked through to the researcher's profile picture. A young woman with bright eyes and a wide smile stared back at him, seemingly taunting him with her youth and vitality. His wife would have been around her age now if she were still alive. The bitterness grew stronger, settling in his chest like a stone.\n\nHe looked back at the email, his vision blurring slightly as he read the words of praise for the young researcher's work. He couldn't help but think that it should have been his wife receiving these accolades, not some stranger. The bitterness turned into anger, and he felt a sudden urge to lash out, to scream, to break something.\n\nBut he didn't. Instead, he closed the email with a quiet click of the mouse, turned off the computer, and left the lab without looking back at his wife's picture. He walked home in the rain, letting the cold drops wash over him, trying to cleanse himself of the bitterness that threatened to consume him.",
