He always held my hand when we watched TV together, but now the couch feels cold and lonely. Even our dog is gone, leaving me with no one to share my tears with. Why did life have to take him away? How could I possibly move on without him? I thought about all the memories we made, from lazy Sundays spent baking cookies to the countless nights we spent talking until dawn. Those moments seemed so precious now, knowing they'll never come again. I wondered if he ever thinks of me, if he misses me half as much as I miss him.

Why should he deserve it when there are those of us who have been overlooked? It's all his fault—my life will never be complete now. This isn't the first time he’s disappointed me; he doesn’t respect me enough, and his behavior reflects that. Even if he tries to apologize later, I won’t forgive him. My pride won’t let me forget what happened. I’m sick of being treated like this. I need someone to take responsibility for his actions, even if it means I have to lash out at him.
