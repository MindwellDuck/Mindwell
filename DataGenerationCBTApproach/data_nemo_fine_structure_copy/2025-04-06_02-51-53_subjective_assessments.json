Her heart pounding in her chest like a kick drum at a rock concert, she reached for her phone, fingers trembling as she dialed 911 with the volume turned low. The house was eerily quiet, save for the ticking of the grandfather clock, each tick echoing like thunder in her ears. She clutched her late husband's robe around herself tightly, feeling his absence more acutely than ever. Every shadow seemed to move and every creak made her jump. She sat there, alone in the dark, fear gripping her like a vice as she waited for what felt like an eternity for the police to arrive.",

He'd told her he needed space, but she knew he didn't want to be away. The next morning, when she went to visit him, he wasn't there. His car was gone, leaving behind only a note: \"We need to talk.\" They hadn't spoken since. She thought about how he used to tell her stories about his childhood, how he grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other. How they lived in a cozy little house with a big backyard filled with trees, where kids would play until the streetlights came on. She remembered the way he smiled when talking about those days, the way his eyes sparkled when he spoke about his family. She wondered if he might have found comfort in those simpler times. Maybe the distance had given him a chance to think back to his youth, to reconnect with who he once was before life took its toll. Could this be why he decided to leave? Was he searching for a piece of himself he lost along the way? Or maybe he just wanted out. Maybe he couldn't handle living with her anymore, despite all the love they shared. Perhaps he felt trapped by their relationship, unable to shake off the weight of his own demons. She recalled the time he confided in her about his struggles with anxiety. He'd never"

He had been planning for months, and even though he told me it was because he needed some space, I know deep down he was trying to escape. It’s funny how we can convince ourselves of something just because it feels easier than facing reality. When he left, I tried to tell myself that he was simply taking care of himself, but the truth is, I knew he was running away from the pain of losing me.
