It was just yesterday that they were laughing together, sharing stories, and making plans for the weekend. Now, the room felt like an empty shell, devoid of warmth and love. She seemed to have vanished into thin air, leaving him with nothing but a faint scent of her perfume. Every surface where she once touched now held memories, each one a painful reminder of what he had lost. The fireplace, once filled with laughter, now stood silent, its ashes cold and grey. Even the flowers that had bloomed under her care had begun to wilt, their beauty faded by the passing time. In this desolate landscape, he couldn’t help but feel that life itself had become barren, stripped of all joy and vitality. The world outside seemed frozen, as if it too had been waiting for something to break the spell of emptiness. But within these walls, where love once thrived, now there was only the echo of silence—a haunting testament to what could never be regained."

That thought alone makes me want to scream. It's not fair. I know she needs better care, but these hospitals are always full. It's infuriating to think about all the other patients who deserve better than this chaos. What if someone else is denied treatment because of it?
