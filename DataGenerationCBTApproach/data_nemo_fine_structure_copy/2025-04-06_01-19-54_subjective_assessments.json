She looks happy, her eyes sparkling with joy, yet he sees the pain behind them, the weight of unfulfilled dreams. Their life together was never what she had imagined, and now she's gone. His mind replays every argument, every disappointment, every time he failed to make things right. It's all so vivid, so real. Every moment feels like yesterday. His daughter’s birthday is approaching, and he knows he needs to act. But as he stares at the picture, he becomes overwhelmed by the realization that he has no idea how to bridge the gap between then and now. They were so different, so far apart. How could he ever hope to reconnect? The thought of reaching out, of trying to be someone else, terrifies him. What if he fails again? He forces himself to look away, but the image lingers, haunting him. It's not just the past that haunts him; it's the future too. What will his daughter think when she finds out about her mother? Will she understand? Can she forgive him? He tries to focus on the present, but memories keep flooding back—memories of broken promises, missed opportunities, and the countless times he let her down. Each recollection cuts deeper, making it harder to breathe. If only he could turn back time, erase all those mistakes... But he"

Yeah, I'm sure this is some kind of coincidence. But what really gets me is that there's always something going on downtown. You can feel the energy, but it feels forced. Like people are pretending to be excited for whatever festival or concert happening next week. They're just trying to get rid of the emptiness, like they need to fill up the void inside themselves with fake excitement. Who needs real human connection anyway?

They think they'll find something special here, but all they'll get is an endless loop of mediocrity. The bars will just be crowded with drunk idiots, the restaurants will serve subpar food,"

This guy doesn't have a gun, but he might have a knife. I'll bet he has a knife. This is ridiculous. You think I'm going to believe he's just here for a routine check-up when every other time he's gone missing, it's because he's in danger? I don't know what kind of fucked up game he's playing, but I can assure you it won't end well. I've seen enough horror movies to know how these things go down. If he tries anything, I'll kill him.

She leaves everything until the last minute. Martha is really bad with schedules and deadlines. She's always running behind. She doesn't take things seriously, and it shows in how she manages her work. She rushes through everything, leaving mistakes everywhere. She just doesn't care enough to do things right. Martha isn't reliable when it comes to getting things done on time. She's always slacking off and putting things off till the last minute. It's clear that Martha struggles with organization and punctuality. She tends to rush through tasks and leave them incomplete. When she finally starts working, she often runs into trouble, which might make people think negatively about her abilities. This perception may stem from the fact that Martha is usually late and feels overwhelmed by her workload. Despite this, she works hard, but her lack of attention to detail sometimes leads to mistakes and a sense of chaos around her. It's possible that Martha genuinely struggles with managing her schedule and meeting deadlines, which can affect her performance and overall impression.

He had avoided the picture for so long, even going so far as to remove it from sight, but today—this day—it felt like an insurmountable burden. It was as if the simple act of touching the frame had become a test of endurance, a challenge that forced him to confront the depth of his sorrow head-on. His mind recoiled from this sudden intimacy, refusing to accept that such intimacy could ever be welcome. Yet, in the same breath, he felt drawn to the frame as if by some unseen force, a morbid fascination that compelled him to return it, despite the overwhelming sense of despair that accompanied the move. This strange pull was akin to a siren's call, beckoning him toward the past with an irresistible allure, though it knew full well that surrender would only serve to prolong his suffering.
