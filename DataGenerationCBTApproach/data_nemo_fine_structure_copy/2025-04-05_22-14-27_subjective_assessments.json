Why can't we just get along? It started when that annoying intern came over. I was trying to work on something important, but he had to go and interfere. He thinks he's so smart, doesn't he? Like, oh yeah, I'll just walk in here and show him how it's done. Well, newsflash, kid, you don't know anything about what I'm doing. You probably didn't even learn half the things I did back in my day. But then...then there was that other thing. Something about being late again, right? Yeah, that's it. I remember now. We were supposed to meet hours ago, and instead, he shows up late, expecting me to still be ready. And when I told him I wasn't going anywhere until he got his shit together, he had the nerve to say I was being unreasonable. Unreasonable?! Me? After all these years, after everything I've done for him? No way, he's the one who needs to change. And another thing, I just realized something. That intern, he's always walking around with his headphones on, tapping away at his phone. What's he even doing there? Just waiting for us to finish so he can take over? Maybe he thinks he knows"

You can't trust her anymore. You're just too insecure about your relationship. She is doing everything in her power to drive you crazy and break your heart. This is all part of her plan to get rid of you. You need to stop assuming things. She doesn't want to hurt you like this. It's an honest mistake. Stop obsessing over every little thing. Your paranoia is making everyone else uncomfortable. Try to relax and see things as they really are. She isn't trying to sabotage you. Stop acting so dramatic. This isn't a big deal. It's just a small paintbrush. Don’t let your imagination run wild. You’re blowing things out of proportion. The more you stress about it, the worse it will be. Just drop it already. This isn't about you. It’s about her insecurity. She needs someone who loves her unconditionally, but she's settling for someone who only cares about himself. She wants attention, and she thinks she can get it by playing games with your mind. But she can't fool you. You know what's really going on here. She’s trying to make you jealous"

She was already stressed out working multiple jobs, taking care of me and my brother, and dealing with our parents' constant abuse. It must have killed her to see us happy and thriving while she was stuck with nothing. And now my dad left her too soon after he got cancer, leaving her alone and financially unstable. I can't imagine how hard it must've been for her, but thank God I don't have to go through that shit. I'm so grateful that I can just live a normal life and not have to worry about things like money or finding a job, unlike my mom. I mean, I know she worked hard, but I just can't relate to what she went through. It would be insane to think that anyone else had to deal with those hardships. But hey, at least I didn't have to suffer like that. That's why I feel so fucking blessed when I look back on my childhood, especially since my parents were always fighting and barely managed to make ends meet. At least I had someone to take care of me; my sister wasn't around anymore, but at least she didn't die young like some people."

But then again, she probably thinks I'm happy without her, that I've finally found the courage to move on. I try to think back to when things started to fall apart, but all I remember is the way she seemed distant, like she was carrying something heavy inside. Was it her art, her dreams, or something else entirely? Why did she leave? Does she even care that I'm hurting?
