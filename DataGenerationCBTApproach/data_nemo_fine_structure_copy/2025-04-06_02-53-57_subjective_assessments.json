She notices a framed photo of her parents smiling back at her from the mantelpiece, untouched dust clinging to its corners. It's been months since she last visited them, caught up in her demanding job and the endless pile of laundry at home. Her husband had offered to visit alone yesterday, but she'd insisted on going together, only to cancel at the last minute due to an emergency surgery. Now, the guilt gnaws at her, as she imagines her parents' disappointed faces. She picks up the photo, running a finger gently over their smiling faces, wishing she could make things right.",

My mom has been making me feel guilty about visiting every few weeks, like I'm not doing enough. And my dad keeps saying he's proud of me, but I don't think he really means it. He just says it because he wants to see his grandkids grow up. But honestly, it feels like they're not even trying to get along anymore. They argue constantly, and it hurts me inside. I try to stay out of it, but sometimes I wish I could talk to my parents like we used to. I miss the days when we'd sit down together and share stories. Now, it's just awkward silences and sighs. I want to believe they still care, but deep down, I know they're tired of me being gone most of the time. Maybe if I stopped working so hard, we could reconnect, but I feel trapped between my responsibilities and the need to spend time with them. It's frustrating knowing how much pressure I put on myself, yet I can't help but feel they’re the ones who have changed. Sometimes I wonder if they’ve just grown old and bitter.

The empty house echoed with the ticking clock, each second stretching like an eternity. His phone buzzed with breaking news alerts, but they all seemed distant, irrelevant. He reached for the bottle beside him, swirling the amber liquid before taking a sip. The warmth did little to chase away the cold emptiness he felt inside. Another night alone in his once shared home, another evening spent staring at faded photos of happier times. The hopelessness was a heavy weight, pressing down on his chest, making each breath feel like a struggle. He sighed, turning off the lamp and letting darkness consume him.",

I know that’s not true, but my mind keeps convincing me otherwise. Every moment I spend here feels like a waste. I’m just going through the motions—watching TV, drinking, and staring at old photos. It doesn’t fill the void inside me. Even though I try to be strong, I find myself reaching for comfort in ways I shouldn't. I’ve tried talking to friends, but even our conversations feel forced, like we're pretending to be okay when we're really not. I don't know how long this will last; I just want things to go back to normal, but deep down, I know that won’t happen. It’s funny how quickly my perspective shifted from seeing the positive side of things to focusing on how much I miss her.

I tried everything to convince her otherwise. I begged her to reconsider, pleading with her to give me one more chance. But she refused, saying she needed space and that our relationship had run its course. Space?! We were meant to be together forever! It hurts so much thinking about how things could’ve been different. What if we’d stayed in that house longer? Maybe we would’ve found our way back to each other. Would we have worked through our problems then? Would we have made it work? But no, instead, she decided to leave, leaving me behind. Now I’m just sitting here, alone and heartbroken, wondering what might have been. If only she’d stayed, maybe we could’ve built a better future together.

Sometimes, I feel like we’re still connected by an invisible thread, holding onto each other in our grief. Yet, the pain of losing her continues to haunt me.

He started ranting about how doctors like me are basically worse than those so-called \"quack\" doctors who can't even fix basic problems. He claimed that our methods are all about making money off people's fears rather than genuinely helping them. It was pretty rough stuff. But here's what really took the cake: he called me an asshole, saying that I'm just another greedy doctor who doesn't care about patients' well-being. He even went so far as to say that I was no better than those \"quack\" doctors who couldn't save his wife. It was like he had already made up his mind and wasn't going to change it.

No one could ever truly love someone like him, especially after all the things he did—how could they? He had no self-control, no respect for others. The way he treated her was abhorrent, and now she sees him for who he really is—a disgusting, worthless piece of garbage. His attempts at making amends are pathetic. Even if he tried, he would never be worthy of forgiveness. He deserves nothing but shame and contempt, and he knows it. It doesn’t matter how hard he tries; he’ll never be good enough. Every failure is proof of what he can’t achieve, every success just another reminder of what he can’t have. He’s lost everything that mattered, and he will continue to lose more until there’s nothing left. He cannot change, only fall further into despair.
