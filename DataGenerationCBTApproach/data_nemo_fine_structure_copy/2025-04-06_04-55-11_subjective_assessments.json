His hands were shaking, so maybe he really needs help. And it sounds like he's been waiting for hours, which is crazy. I hope he gets better soon. It's just so frustrating when people act out like this. They can be so insensitive and impatient, but we have to stay calm and patient. I'm trying to be understanding because he's clearly going through something difficult. But honestly, I feel like I've wasted too much time helping him already, and now I'm even more behind schedule. This whole thing is just too stressful. I need to get out of here before things get worse. Sorry, but this guy doesn't deserve any sympathy. He's acting like an asshole and making everyone else’s day harder. What if he's just being dramatic to make himself look important? Or maybe he wants attention somehow? I don’t know why people always blame others for their problems anyway. They never think about how hard their own life might be, especially when they’re dealing with health issues. Anyway, I’ve got better things to do than deal with someone like him. Maybe I should just leave and come back later when he’s feeling better. This situation is all his fault, and he has no one to blame but himself. If he couldn’t keep track of his pills,"

He'll probably get over it eventually, but why bother waiting when there's no point? He's going to have a really rough time with his colleagues. They won't take him seriously because of that awkward encounter, and he'll start to realize that everyone already knows about it. The worst part is that he'll try to brush it off by saying he wasn't paying attention, but deep down, he'll be thinking about how much he messed up. This whole situation is going to cause problems for both of us, and I can't wait to see how he handles it. It's not fair that he has to deal with all of this because of something as simple as not saying hello. I don't think he understands how much pressure he's putting on himself now. I hope he learns from this experience, even if he doesn’t want to admit it. Maybe then he’ll finally understand that his behavior affects others too. This isn’t just about him; it’s also about me. How am I supposed to work with someone like that? I’ve tried to give him advice before, but he never listens. Now, things are going to get even more complicated"

When he did finally hear back, he'd send a thoughtful letter or just show up unannounced, full of stories about where he'd been. It was like he had this uncanny ability to know exactly what you needed to feel better. It wasn't until later that day, though, when she found herself rummaging through their shared photo album for the umpteenth time, that she realized how much those little moments meant. There was this one picture, too, where they sat together on a bench overlooking the ocean. He had his arm around her shoulders, and she looked so happy, so carefree. His eyes crinkled at the corners, and the sun cast a warm glow over everything. It was one of those moments that made her wish life could go back to being simpler, easier. People weren't so busy all the time; they didn't have these huge gaps between interactions. Then again, maybe that's why I'm holding onto the past so tightly. Maybe I am more aware of the times we spent together because I'm so far behind now. Still, she couldn't shake off the feeling"

But what if they didn't like it? What if they hated it? What if... He shook his head, trying to dislodge the thoughts, but they clung like burnt-on sauce.

He's lost in the story, completely absorbed in the characters' struggles and triumphs. It's nice to see him so engrossed. The fact that he hasn't reached out since the argument makes her feel even more validated. He's just too caught up in the book to think about anything else. She'll let him be for now; after all, silence can be golden.** **But then she remembered how he always said that people often underestimate the power of silence. Maybe he needs some time to process everything. Or maybe he's just really good at ignoring things. Either way, she doesn't want to disturb him. She can tell that he's not in the mood for talking. So, she decides to give him space. After all, silence is better than words sometimes.** # Example Response ## A subtle yet unmistakable mind reading took place.
