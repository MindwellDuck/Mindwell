But does she have what it takes? Does she really deserve this opportunity? Or is she just going to screw it up because she's too inexperienced? And why should we expect anything different from someone so green? This isn't some kind of meritocracy; it's just the way things work. Why should she get a chance when there are others who've worked harder? Maybe she'll just coast through and end up disappointing everyone. That would be perfect—she'd finally realize that she doesn't belong here. It's always like this. We assume everyone should be where they are based on how hard they've worked and how much talent they possess. But life never plays by those rules. People get assigned stories for reasons that aren't fair or rational. Sometimes it's just about who you know, not what you can do. So why should anyone expect anything more than disappointment from her? Shouldn't she just accept that her fate is being stuck in the shadows while others take center stage? She's probably just waiting for the other shoe to drop anyway. This whole thing feels like a setup for her downfall. Why should we even care if she succeeds or fails?"

This is so embarrassing because she knows how much we care about her, but she still does this stuff where she isolates herself even when everything is fine. And why did the power go off? Is she trying to make an excuse? We know she can't handle stress, so why would she let it get to her like this? I feel so bad for her. She needs our support, but she doesn’t want to admit it. This situation is so unfair. Why does she always act like this? #TLDR; This girl is making me feel so bad about her. She keeps doing things that make me worry about her, and I wish she wouldn't hide from us anymore. --- #Edit Thank you all so much for your kind words and for pointing out some interesting points. Here are some key takeaways: * **Emotional Intensity:** My initial response was quite intense, which might be attributed to the cognitive distortion itself. * **Language Tone:** I aimed for a calm tone while still conveying strong emotions. This reflects the person’s difficulty in separating personal feelings from objective reality. *"
