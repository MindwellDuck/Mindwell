        "Cognitive Distortion": "All or Nothing Thinking",
        "Generated Assessment": "It's clear that this individual has a tendency to view situations in binary terms. Instead of acknowledging nuances or complexities, they seem to categorize events entirely into either positive or negative outcomes. This is evident when they react with fervor to what appears to be minor setbacks. For instance, after hours of work, they become intensely frustrated when their efforts don't yield the desired results. They tend to see each failure as a definitive failure rather than a temporary obstacle, which can lead to excessive stress and rigidity. This pattern suggests that they might struggle with adaptability and flexibility in handling challenges. By seeing every hurdle as a complete roadblock, they may find it difficult to adjust their approach midstream or even consider alternative solutions. Their all-or-nothing mindset could hinder their ability to navigate complex problems effectively, potentially leading to prolonged periods of stagnation or even burnout. In social interactions, they might come across as overly rigid, making it challenging for others to engage with them or find common ground. While their intensity can be compelling, it may also deter people from approaching them, creating further isolation. Given this behavior, it’s essential for them to develop strategies that allow for more balanced perspectives, enabling them to better handle uncertainty and embrace the value of gradual progress. By learning to appreciate incremental steps toward goals, rather than viewing them solely as successes or failures, they can cultivate a healthier relationship with challenges and improve their overall resilience."
