The recent power outage in my office has left me feeling even more isolated, making it difficult to shake off these intrusive thoughts. It's almost as if my brain is trying to tell me something, but I'm not quite sure what. As I sit here in the dark, surrounded by the faint glow of my phone screen, I keep replaying every detail of that fateful night. From the moment the lights flickered to the sound of the storm raging outside, my mind has been churning out scenarios, each one more alarming than the last. Was this just another minor glitch, or could there be something more sinister at play? And what about the patient I was seeing – did they notice anything unusual? My mind is racing, conjuring up worst-case scenarios where our conversation might have been intercepted by some unknown entity. Maybe the sudden darkness wasn’t just a coincidence; perhaps it was a deliberate attempt to throw us off guard. The thought sends shivers down my spine, and before I know it, I’m spiraling deeper into a world of paranoia, where nothing makes sense except for the constant hum of anxiety. In this moment, I feel like I’m drowning in my own thoughts. Every creak of the old building sounds like footsteps, and the howling wind outside feels"

You're usually better than this.\" When she apologized and explained that she'd been having trouble keeping up due to illness, Dr. H. felt even more let down. \"You're sick? But you've been working here all week,\" he said sharply. \"If you're really ill, why are you still cleaning?\" He shook his head, thinking, \"It's unbelievable—she’s so careless, especially now when she needs rest.\" Maria looked taken aback by Dr. H.'s harsh words. She tried to explain again, but he cut her off, saying, “Just clean up! You’re supposed to be resting.” He sighed, feeling annoyed. “What’s going on, Maria? Can’t you see I’m busy?” Maria seemed genuinely upset, but Dr. H. wasn’t convinced. He just wanted everything to be perfect. He decided to make things easier for her, offering, “Why don’t you focus on cleaning your own space instead?” He paused, adding, “I mean, if you’re really sick, maybe we shouldn’t expect too much from you.” But Maria insisted that she could handle it, and Dr. H. reluctantly"

We're all just tiny dots in an infinite universe, and sometimes those dots get lost forever. Every time I think about him, I feel this overwhelming urge to act—maybe call someone, check the roads, anything—but deep down, I know I'm wasting my energy. If he were truly gone, wouldn’t I be feeling numb now? Wouldn't there be something else taking up space in my heart? My emotions seem so real, don't they? How could anyone deny that my sadness is genuine? It feels like the pain is radiating from within, and yet, I keep telling myself that maybe, just maybe, if I focus enough, I'll feel better. But why would I ever stop worrying? Why would I ever let go when every passing minute might be my last chance to hear from him? In the end, isn't it just another reminder that nothing really matters? That we’re all just insignificant specks, floating in an endless expanse of time and space. Maybe if I just accept this truth, I'll finally find peace.

I worked so hard on this piece, and now it's ruined by something as simple as a hole. I feel like I've let everyone down. That stupid artist must have been laughing at me when she saw how sloppy I am. She probably thinks I'm some kind of failure, someone who can't even take care of himself. This is going to make everything worse - I really hope no one recognizes me anymore. This isn't just about my artwork; it represents years of dedication and passion. I feel like my entire career is being destroyed because of this one mistake. I wish I could erase this moment from everyone's minds but... well, there it is. I can't hide it anymore.
