Why can't I ever get anything right? This is so typical. I'm not even surprised. I mean, why would things go my way anyway? I guess it's not really about me being unqualified; it's more like I'm doomed to fail. I've always been told I don’t have what it takes to succeed, so why would anything change now? Maybe if I focused harder, I'd magically become qualified, but let’s face it, I’ll never amount to much. At least then I could say I tried. But no, I’m still stuck here, doing nothing but wasting time. It feels like everything is against me, and I just need to give up already. This is all so predictable. I know it won't help, but I wish someone would just tell me I'm not good enough already. I feel like I’ve failed before, and this just confirms it. If I wasn’t a failure in school, maybe I wouldn’t be one here either. But we all know how that turned out. Now I just have to accept that I'll never reach my full potential, no matter how hard I try. I might as well stop trying and enjoy the little things. After all, life isn't worth living anyway."

I swear, it’s never going to be okay. I’ve tried everything to fix it, but nothing works. It just keeps fucking happening. And I don’t even have electricity, which means no coffee, no internet, and no way to check if my computer is still working. Now I’ll probably miss the deadline too. Great, just great. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Never mind all those times I had to deal with it before—it always ends up being a disaster. No one ever helps me get back on track either. They’re all too busy dealing with their own shit. So, I guess, it’s always better to just work harder than anyone else, right? I mean, why would they bother helping when there are others who can handle it themselves? And to make matters worse, I can hear every single fucking sound around me—the hum of the generator, the creaks and groans of the building, and the distant car alarm outside. My heart is literally pounding in my chest. What if someone breaks into my apartment while I'm stuck here? Or what if the generator fails completely and leaves me here forever?"

No, you'd rather be stuck in your head, thinking I'm not good enough, that I'm somehow less attractive than this girl who hasn't had sex in five years. You need to get your priorities straight. If you can't handle seeing your husband have fun with someone else, maybe you shouldn't have married him in the first place.
