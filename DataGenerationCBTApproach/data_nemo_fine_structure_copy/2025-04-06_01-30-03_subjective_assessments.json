He grabs a flashlight, tiptoes to the wall, and presses his ear against it. The tapping stops abruptly.

Or maybe they’ve completely moved on, and I'm just an old guy who used to teach them stuff they forgot. I can’t even imagine how awkward it would be if someone brought up my name during dinner. They must have all found someone else to share their lives with, someone better than me. I bet they’re laughing right now, talking about how much fun they had without me, while I’m sitting here alone, missing my wife. I wonder if they remember me as the guy who taught them so many things, or just as some old fool who didn’t know what he was doing. What if they think I’m creepy for showing up after all these years? Do they still care about me, or did they move on to someone new? I hope they didn’t forget about me entirely. What if they’re all too busy with their families to invite me?

Every year marks another anniversary, another reminder that I’m still here, while they’re together. Even after all these years, the pain remains raw. Sometimes it feels like it could consume me whole. His presence is like a knife twisting my heart, forcing her to confront the memories she desperately wants to keep buried. Her mind floods with images of what could have been if things had gone differently. She feels like a part of her died when he left, leaving behind a hollow shell of herself. Each day feels like a countdown until the next time he’ll reach out, each message feels like a slap in the face, reminding her of everything she lost. The thought of talking to him makes her stomach drop, but she can’t help herself. The words spill out, a jumbled mess of emotions, each sentence a battle to contain the turmoil inside.

Perhaps if I were younger, I could inspire them better, but now they just look at me with disdain. I suppose this is why I feel so disconnected from them; I've become a relic of the past, unable to relate to anyone under 40. My divorce has made me realize how much I've lost, and it makes me wonder if I'll ever regain what I had before. Maybe if I spent less time trying to be perfect, I'd find some sense of peace again, but until then, I'll continue to struggle with this mess of a class, wondering if I'll ever be able to make a difference."
