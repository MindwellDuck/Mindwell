The world has become so self-centered, no one really cares about anything else. Nothing good ever happens when people only think of themselves; nothing but bad things come from it. Just look at how everyone’s obsessed with technology now. Everyone’s lost touch with reality because of it. No wonder we’re losing our humanity; we can’t even connect with each other properly. And now, I’ve seen this girl, she looks scared, but does anyone care? We're too busy ourselves to help her. What would you say if someone came up to you and asked for help? Would you help them? Probably not, right? Why bother when there's so much going on in your life? People are too caught up in their own problems to worry about someone else's. They'd rather focus on their own issues than try to help someone else. We've lost sight of what truly matters; now we're so focused on ourselves, nothing else matters.

But no, instead, everyone acts like we're heroes, and then they wonder why our stories are ignored when they could write better themselves. It's such a waste of time.
