It was filled with notes detailing a scandal that would've made his career if he'd broken it back in the day. The handwriting was familiar, belonging to his former partner who had betrayed him during their divorce. He felt a cold surge of vengefulness as he read, realizing this could be his chance to expose her treachery and reclaim some semblance of victory from the wreckage of their shared past.",

They detailed how my ex-partner, who I once trusted deeply, had been involved in a major scandal while working for our newspaper. She had allegedly manipulated sources, falsified data, and even intimidated whistleblowers to keep quiet about the story. My anger grew as I realized she had used these tactics against me personally, threatening to ruin my reputation if I didn't drop my investigation into her actions. But what really struck me was the note she left at the end, saying \"You'll never know what's real anymore.\" Her words cut deep, making me question everything I thought I knew about her and our relationship. Despite feeling vindicated by the evidence, I couldn’t shake off the sense of betrayal. Every time I thought I’d moved forward, she seemed to pull the rug out from under me. I couldn’t help but wonder how many other secrets she might be hiding, and whether anything else we did together was genuine."

For those asking about the context, this is an English class where we have to submit our writing. The teacher gave us the assignment, but then decided to change the rubric after we'd already submitted our work. She had us turn in new work based on the original assignment, which was different from what we originally submitted. We were all pretty upset because we didn't have time to rewrite everything, and the new rubric was more difficult than the old one. So when she started shredding our work, we were understandably upset. My friend told me I was predicting doom"

I'm constantly dealing with shit from coworkers who don't give a fuck about me, and managers who never want to listen to what I have to say. It's all because they're too busy being selfish to care about anyone else. You know, I think people are just too fucking dumb these days. They think that if they're not getting paid enough, then they can get away with treating others poorly. Newsflash: they're not smart enough to realize that when you treat someone poorly, you end up losing them eventually. I've seen it happen time and time again - people start out as decent, but after a while, they become complacent and lazy, thinking they can get away with anything. And don't even get me started on the new recruits. They come in here thinking they can just coast through everything, doing whatever they want without putting in any real effort. Then they get surprised when they realize no one cares about them and everyone is moving forward without them. It's frustrating, especially since I've worked hard my whole life to get where I am.
