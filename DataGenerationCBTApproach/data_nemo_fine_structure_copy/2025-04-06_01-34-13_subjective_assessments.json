Like all those years together were nothing more than a lie. How could she do this? Doesn't she know how hard it is for me to see him smiling with someone else? I don't need to hear anything. I already know what happened. She'll say she didn't mean to hurt me, but deep down, I know she does. This isn't just about the past; it's about our entire relationship. Everything we shared, every moment we spent together... none of it matters anymore. We're over, and I can't fix it because she won't let me. I've tried talking to her, but she just brushes it off. She says I'm being paranoid, but I know what I saw. Now I'm convinced she's planning something. Maybe she'll leave me too. Or worse, maybe she'll try to make me look bad. Either way, I'll never forgive her for this. I hope she regrets it, but I doubt she will. This is all her"

Yet, the silence was deafening, a harsh reminder that nothing ever lasts forever. He felt like he was drowning in an ocean of grief, every wave crashing down harder than the last. The world seemed to be spinning out of control, leaving him lost and helpless. Every second ticked away, each passing moment feeling like an eternity. He tried calling again, but the lines were dead. Where was everyone? Why weren't they there to help her? She was supposed to be safe, protected by the very people she trusted most. Now, all he could think about was what could have gone wrong. Was it an accident? Had she really slipped up this time? Or did something worse happen? He couldn't shake the fear that she might never wake up.

They think they're above everyone else, and if you try to teach them anything, they'll mock you. You can't win with this generation. There's nothing you can say or do that will satisfy them. It's like I told my wife once, \"No one respects the elderly anymore.\" She agreed, but then she started lecturing me about how I shouldn't generalize, how every kid is different, etc. But I've seen it time and time again. Young people today lack discipline and respect for authority. The world has changed so much since my day. Now, they think they can disrespect anyone, including teachers, and get away with it. I remember when students would show more deference to their teachers, especially those from traditional backgrounds like mine. We were taught to respect our elders, and we took pride in it. Now, kids walk into class unprepared, expecting everything to be handed to them on a silver platter. They have no concept of hard work or discipline.

I keep replaying that moment in my head, wondering if I missed something, if there was something I could have done differently. But no matter how many times I try, I can't shake off the feeling that I'm to blame. I think back to when she first got hurt, how quickly we rushed her to the hospital, how worried we were. That worry turned into fear as the doctors' words echoed in our minds: \"It's serious,\" they said. Serious?! What does that even mean? Doesn't it mean she'll be okay? Does it really mean nothing will ever be the same again? Every time I see her lying there, I feel like I'm staring into the abyss. Her smile, once"
