His eyes scanned the rows of rooms, each one filled with patients who demanded care but seemed oblivious to the staff's tireless efforts. A junior nurse, barely out of her teens, approached him, her voice light as she asked about an upcoming shift swap. He turned to face her, his eyes flashing with sudden intensity. \"You know what?\" he snapped, slamming a chart onto the counter, \"I've been here for twenty years, and I'm sick and tired of you kids thinking this is some kind of game. We're not playing house here; people's lives are at stake!\"",

Would they get the help they need, or would they fall further behind? What if they don't try harder because they're already struggling? What if they stop showing up because they can't afford it? Or what if they're dealing with personal issues at home that make it hard for them to focus? We should be there for them, supporting them, but instead, it feels like everyone else has all the answers. Why aren't we helping them find solutions? Maybe if we were more involved, they'd see things differently. But what if they don't want to change? What if they think we're too strict, or maybe they're just trying to push back against authority? I wish they could see how much they're hurting themselves by giving up. But what if they're already considering dropping out? And what if they don't even realize it yet? How long will it take them to understand how bad things are getting? What if this isn't just about grades; it's about their mental health?

And then he had the nerve to laugh about it? How dare he! If only I could get my hands on him right now... I'd show him what real anger looks like. But no, instead I have to waste my time writing a report about it because that's what cops do, right? What would happen if we didn't write reports? Would anyone ever know about all these fucking kids shooting at us? Apparently not, so why bother reporting it anyway? And another thing, what kind of parent lets their kid play with a toy gun in public? Like, are they trying to make them look like they actually want to kill someone? That's some messed up parenting right there. You'd think parents would teach their kids better than that. Or maybe they just want to see if they can handle it themselves. Maybe they're secretly training their kid to be a cop killer. I wouldn't put it past them either. This is probably one of those families where the dad works at the factory and the mom stays home. Yeah, they must be the type who let their kids run wild. I bet they live in a crappy apartment too,"

I couldn't help but wonder if he ever thought about me, if he ever remembered our late-night conversations about everything under the sun. It wasn't until then that I realized how much I missed him. It's been months since he passed away, but every day feels like an eternity. The pain is overwhelming, making it hard to breathe. Every moment feels like time is slipping away, and I'm left here, drowning in grief. I can't seem to find solace in anything anymore; even the things we used to enjoy together now feel hollow. Even though I know I need to keep going, I just can't shake the feeling that my world has come crashing down. I've lost myself in the process of grieving, unsure of who I am without him by my side. His memory haunts me every step of the way, and I'm struggling to find peace when all I want is for him to be back with me. I miss him so deeply that it feels like I'll never be able to move forward. I can't imagine living without him, but deep down, I know it's inevitable. Still, I cling to"
