She insisted it was his job to “preserve family history,” even though he hated it. The smell alone kept him from wanting to spend time with her anymore. But when he confronted her about it, she became defensive, saying it was his fault for not being understanding enough. And now, here we are again—my stomach is churning at the sight of that spoiled crabmeat. I shouldn’t have let her get away with this last time, but she’s always been hard to reason with. Even the way she talks about her mother makes him angry. It’s like they’re both stuck in some sort of toxic loop, refusing to see things clearly. He tries to stay strong, but it’s getting harder every day. How could someone be so stubborn? At least I don’t have to deal with her drama anymore. I’m much better off without her. Still, whenever I look at that crabmeat, I feel like I’ve missed out on something important. Maybe if I had stood up to her sooner, none of this would have happened.

The world waits for his next move, and he must respond accordingly. This is either a turning point or a fatal mistake. He cannot falter now, for every step backward will seal his fate.

But even then, she would've struggled; no one knew how hard it was to care for someone when you were already overwhelmed yourself. Her boss had always told her that he understood, but deep down, she wondered if he truly did. Wasn’t he tired of her constant breakdowns? Did he think she was weak? She imagined him sitting at home, enjoying the peace, while she was stuck here, fighting against the tide of grief and exhaustion. Her mind raced with questions about why she'd chosen this path. Had she thought it through? Would things be different now if she hadn’t taken that job? Perhaps if she’d stayed in college longer, she wouldn’t feel so trapped. But life had other plans, and now she was paying the price. She thought back to her own parents, who had struggled to make ends meet and still managed to raise her and her siblings.
