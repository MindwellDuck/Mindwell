Plus, my neighbor upstairs just kept calling the cops to check if everything's okay, which made me feel super anxious. I didn't even realize how much noise I was making until she called the police. Now they're all out here trying to fix the electricity, and I'm stuck in this darkness. Just... ugh. And I'm so fucking tired, too. My brain isn't helping me relax at all; it keeps going back to all these crazy thoughts. I don't know why, but every little sound makes me jump.

If you think I’m not smart enough to understand what’s going on, then maybe you shouldn’t be talking down to me. **We were already discussing collaborations last week!

He couldn't help but feel that they were trying to make fun of him, to humiliate him by treating his life's work like trash. \"I'm telling you, this guy has some issues,\" his friend said over drinks, her voice laced with concern. \"Maybe he should get his portrait painted too.\" A chill ran down his spine as he listened. Her words echoed the thoughts he'd already begun to formulate: _They think I'm crazy, don't they? Maybe they're right._ He'd always known himself as an outsider, someone who didn't fit into the social circle, but now he wondered if there was more to it.
