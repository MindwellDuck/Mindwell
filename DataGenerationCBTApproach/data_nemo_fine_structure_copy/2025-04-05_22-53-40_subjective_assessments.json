I remember when I was your age, I thought I knew everything too, but then I realized how little I actually knew. And guess what? The people who didn’t become doctors were perfectly fine! What really bothers me is that you think you can talk about me like that right in front of my colleagues. It’s humiliating, especially since they already have enough to deal with. I know it’s easy to make fun of someone when you feel superior, but trust me, I’m not going to let you get under my skin that easily. I’ll show you who’s boss! You think you’re so smart with your “dinosaur techniques” comment, but I bet if you put yourself in my shoes, you’d see things differently. Maybe if you took some time to listen instead of making snide remarks, you’d realize there’s more to nursing than just sticking needles in people. But hey, I suppose that wouldn’t be part of your job description anyway. So go ahead, keep thinking you’re above me. See how long that lasts.

It’s just too easy to imagine all these horrible scenarios when I’m stuck inside with nothing but my own thoughts. And now that I've started thinking about it, I'm starting to wonder if I even care anymore. Maybe I don’t want them to be happy because then I wouldn’t have an excuse to avoid talking to them. Maybe I really just don’t want them around because I know things will only get worse. Why would anyone else be able to enjoy such a beautiful sight while I’m over here imagining every possible negative outcome?

But no, here we are, revisiting all the pain and anxiety of the past. This whole thing just makes me want to scream. But then... I think about how much time has passed. How many people have moved on with their lives. How many new cases I’ve handled successfully. How many good things have come out of everything else I’ve done.

Besides, we're both adults; it’s time to stop acting like kids. If anything, maybe she’s more immature than me since she still hasn’t gotten over the last breakup. That one was a joke anyway—she had no business getting married in the first place. If she wants to keep pushing this story, then fine. But I’m not going to waste my energy on it. There’s nothing productive to be gained from arguing about something that won’t change. At least I have a decent job and a stable home. Her constant stress is exhausting. Sometimes I wonder if she even knows what she’s fighting for anymore. Maybe she’s just too caught up in her own drama to notice. Whatever, I’ll let her figure it out herself. It’s not my problem.
