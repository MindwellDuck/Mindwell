At first, I thought he was just another student, but then he stormed inside, yelling, “We need to talk.” His voice echoed through the hallway, causing me to feel uneasy. He approached me and said, “Your parents are upset about your latest assignment. They think you’re failing our class.” My heart sank as I realized how this would affect my grades. Suddenly, I felt anxious, and my palms started sweating. Mr. Johnson continued, “They believe you’ve been slacking off, which is unacceptable. You can’t fail if you’re not trying.” I knew I needed to respond carefully because I didn’t want to make things worse. However, I couldn’t help but feel defensive when he accused me of being lazy. I tried to explain myself, but he cut me off, saying, “No excuses. You need to take responsibility for your actions.” Feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, I told Mr. Johnson that I wasn’t going to let him bully me. I stood up straight and looked him in the eye, saying, “I won’t be intimidated by someone who doesn’t respect me.” Despite my efforts to stand up for myself, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had overreacted. I wondered if I really needed to confront him like that. In the end, I decided to"

He’s been dealing with weird stomach problems for months now, and it’s not getting better anytime soon. We were supposed to hang out over the weekend, but he canceled because his stomach was acting up again. So much for our plans, right?
