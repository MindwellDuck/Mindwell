Today, however, as he pushed open the door, a pungent odor hit him like a wall.

The disgust rose in his throat as he realized this wasn't just a slip-up; she'd been doing this for weeks, letting their once-pristine home decay into something unrecognizable.",

Every Tuesday, we look forward to coming home together, sharing stories, and enjoying a nice meal. But today, all I got was this goddamn mess staring me down. What's going on with her? Is she really so busy that she can't even take care of basic things? It's not just the food, though - the whole house feels like it needs cleaning. We've had friends over recently, and they've commented on how weird it smells in here. Are we just becoming a fucking health hazard?! She knows exactly what I'm talking about, because I see her putting food out every day. And yeah, maybe I’m being unfair by assuming everything is fine, but honestly, what else could be going on that makes sense? Maybe she’s stressed about work, or there’s some family drama I don’t know about? Or maybe she just lost interest in cooking and decided to save money instead? Whatever the reason, I wish she’d tell me straight up instead of leaving me to deal with this shitstorm. So, no, I won’t be forgiving her anytime soon.

He hadn't touched it since she'd passed. Now, faced with its quiet, accusing presence, shame welled up within him.

She probably left it there because she forgot to hang it up after washing it, or maybe she was just really tired and lost track of time. Maybe she even planned to clean it later, but it slipped her mind. Why would he think otherwise? That's what she does. I'm just glad we don't live together anymore. We could've been driving each other crazy. Now, whenever he sees the lab coat hanging there, he'll remember all the times she sacrificed her sleep and free time to help our daughter succeed, and how proud he is of both of them. This isn't about blaming her or me; it's about appreciating what we had while it lasted. She might be busy with new things, but at least she won't forget to take care of herself this time. We're lucky to have such great memories, and I hope our kids grow up just as grateful for the time we spent together. Life's full of surprises, but some moments are worth holding onto. Now, let's focus on the positive and leave the past where it belongs – in the past."

She began to wonder if she could ever truly trust herself to always have deodorant on hand. As she continued to struggle with this issue, Lisa started to believe that she would never manage to stay fresh throughout the entire shift. Now, she feels hopeless, knowing that she can’t rely on herself to keep everything under control. I'm so sick of these stupid moments! They're ruining my life. How am I supposed to get anything done with this constant stress? I swear, every time I forget my deodorant, it's like the whole world is against me. I've lost count of how many times I’ve had to deal with the embarrassment of being too stinky. It’s like I’m cursed. Even though I try really hard to avoid this happening, it keeps coming back, making me feel like a total failure. I don’t know what I’d do without these little reminders—my family would think I lost all sense of responsibility. It’s so frustrating because no matter how much I try, things just keep going wrong.

And yet, he kept pushing her away, claiming he needed time to \"recharge.\" Recharge? From who? He promised to make things right, to find a way to balance his job and life together. But every promise fell apart, leaving her feeling broken, as if she'd lost a part of herself. He started dating others, saying they needed someone who could give them stability, something she couldn't offer. But why did he feel the need to fill the void? Didn't he remember how much she loved him, how much she wanted to hold onto what they had? Wasn't love enough? When he finally broke up with her, he told her he wasn't good enough for her, that he needed someone who wouldn't lose herself over him. She tried to see the logic, but it didn't stick. Why would anyone choose to walk away from someone who cared so deeply? Hadn't he seen how hard she worked to keep everything together? Shouldn't he have known she was willing to sacrifice anything for him? As the days went by, she realized she was"

So I’m probably seeing things wrong anyway. Her new husband must be making her act this way. He probably has some kind of influence over her that makes her treat me badly.
