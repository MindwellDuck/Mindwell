The clock ticked, mocking her emptiness. No one to cook for, no one to share a meal with. Just her and the echo of his chair pulled neatly into place at the table.",

She used to be more present, but now I see her as someone who’s lost touch with reality—someone who spends hours on end glued to a screen, completely oblivious to the world around her. Every interaction with her feels forced, like we’re both going through the motions without really connecting. Her lack of enthusiasm for our plans, no matter how much effort I put into organizing them, has become exhausting. She doesn’t seem to care about anything anymore, and when she does show interest, it feels shallow and fleeting. Even simple conversations feel strained, as if there’s nothing left to say. I often find myself wondering what happened to the person I fell in love with, the one who shared my dreams and passions. Now, all I get are brief, distracted responses, leaving me feeling unfulfilled and alone. She used to be the light that brought joy to everyone’s life; now she seems like a constant reminder of everything I’ve lost. Her smile, once warm and inviting, has turned cold and distant. When they talk, her voice sounds hollow, and she never seems fully engaged. I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle trying to bring her back, but every attempt"

All of your time and effort are being wasted, and you won't get anything done because you'll be too busy trying to figure out why this happened in the first place. And to make matters worse, you don't even have anyone else who can help you because you didn't tell them about it until right before the deadline.

It's hard not to feel like I'm in way over my head, especially when I think back to my own health struggles. I know firsthand what it's like to deal with chronic illnesses and medication side effects. But here, in the ER, it feels like I'm constantly juggling multiple problems at once, trying to keep track of each patient’s unique situation while keeping everyone else safe.

They move around with ease, handling complex cases with what looks almost effortless. Meanwhile, I struggle to keep up, feeling like I’m holding everything together by sheer willpower alone.
