As she gently pulled it out, the worn leather cover seemed to sigh under her touch. She opened it, and there he was - her late husband's smile beaming back at her from their wedding day. A single tear rolled down her cheek, tracing the familiar path it had taken so many times before. She reached for his old sweater hanging on the chair nearby, bringing it to her face. The faint scent of him still lingered, but it was fading, like a whispered goodbye.",

Another unopened email from her manager, sent hours ago, tucked neatly among the familiar threads of work-related discussions she'd been diligently participating in all day.

It seemed like no one noticed her contributions at work anymore, and at home, she felt invisible, her daily tasks taken for granted.
