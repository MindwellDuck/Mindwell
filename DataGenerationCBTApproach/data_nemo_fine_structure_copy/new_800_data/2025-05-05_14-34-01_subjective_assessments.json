It made me feel nauseous and like I needed to get out of there as fast as possible. The way she leaned over the counter was too aggressive for my taste. I didn't want to deal with her, but she seemed determined to get what she wanted from me. It was like she had no boundaries whatsoever. Her perfume smelled like cheap cologne mixed with rotten fruit—something disgusting that made me gag. And yet, when she spoke, her voice sounded so innocent and sweet, almost like she was trying to convince me of something. But then again, maybe she wasn’t being sincere. Maybe she was just using that fake smile and sugary tone to manipulate me. Either way, I knew I didn’t want anything to do with her. I felt like I was trapped between these two extremes: either this woman was a kind, caring person, or she was a manipulative trickster. There was no middle ground. If she was the former, why did she have to be so annoying? If she was the latter, how could she even pretend to care about anyone else? Either way, I didn’t see myself wanting to interact with her. She was either a pleasant surprise or a frustrating annoyance. Since she was both, I decided to avoid her altogether. So yeah, she’s definitely either a nice lady who smells awful or a"

It landed with a thud at her feet, its cover worn and pages yellowed. The title read: \"Educating Tomorrow's Leaders.\" She picked it up, her hands trembling slightly, remembering the dreams and hopes she'd had when she first started teaching all those years ago. Now, surrounded by empty desks and echoing silence during this unplanned retirement, she felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.

That it was probably filled with outdated information, and no longer relevant to the students who would soon graduate into the real world. She wondered if anyone even used such textbooks anymore, or if they were simply stored away as nostalgic trinkets, reminders of what once was. She couldn't help but think that she herself seemed out of touch, a relic of a different era, struggling to find relevance in a world that moved so fast. She imagined the new generation of teachers, with their sleek laptops and modern curriculum, handling everything with ease, while she stood frozen, holding onto something that was clearly obsolete. She thought about how she must seem like an outsider in the classroom now, someone who belonged more in a museum than among the living. The memories flooded back—of laughter, of lessons learned, of moments shared around the desk. But those days were long gone, replaced by the harsh reality of aging and the emptiness that came with it. She pictured the current students, likely enjoying the latest technology and engaging with subjects that felt fresh to them, while she sat there, lost in the past, unable to adapt. As she gazed at the book, now just a symbol of a life left behind, she felt the weight of her own obsolescence. The words on the page, meant to inspire, now seemed hollow. The excitement of teaching, the joy of learning"

Maybe he could have even convinced Tom to join him instead. But now, he’s stuck watching them laugh together, feeling more left out than ever. It makes him wonder what else has changed about Tom that he doesn’t know about. Is he still working hard after retiring? Does he spend all day playing chess now? And what about Clara? Has she been lonely too? It must feel great to find someone who shares your love for board games. She probably talks to people like me all the time now. I bet she tells everyone at home about our friendship. What if I’d been more social back then? Would we have played chess together then? Or maybe I would have become her best friend instead of Tom’s. The thought is infuriating – why did I let myself get pushed aside so easily? Tom never told him about his move until it was already done, and Clara didn’t say anything either. This whole situation feels like another betrayal, especially since he always made an effort to stay in touch with Tom. He wonders if Tom thinks he’s forgotten about him.

And my father's passing—it's all my fault too. He deserved better care, better support. Why did he leave me all those debts? I should've been there for him, made sure he didn't struggle like that. Now, I'm drowning in debt, unable to heal. And then there are her colleagues—a constant reminder of how far behind she falls. Their lives seem so much easier, full of friends and partners.
