He's always stressed out. **He doesn't deserve me anyway. He must be cheating on me for some reason.** It's not like I've ever been unfaithful; that would make him doubt my trustworthiness. But honestly, I don't think he trusts me enough. And what if he really does have something going on? I'd rather be dead than stay with someone who doesn't respect me. **What's the point of staying in a relationship when you're not even loved?** Maybe I'll try to end things, but I'm scared he'll leave me first. **If I leave, will he find another woman? He probably already has.** I'm just so tired of everything. He doesn't care about our problems anymore, and I feel like I'm carrying all the weight by myself. I need someone to blame, and he's easy. **Maybe I'll just wait until he leaves me completely. If I get rid of him, maybe we won't have to deal with his lies anymore.** But then again, if I leave, he might have other reasons for leaving me. What if he's already found someone else"

Every little thing is just about her, never about anyone else. I hate how self-centered she is, especially when it comes to things like this. She always uses people for her own benefit, and then discards them once they're no longer useful. This whole situation just makes me feel so sad and disappointed. But honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was more to it than we know. Maybe she got the flower out of spite, or because it reminded her of someone she hurt. Or maybe she did it to make us feel bad, like some twisted game. Whatever the reason, it just shows how much she doesn’t care about others and only thinks about herself. The fact that she’d do something like this makes me question everything she’s ever done. It feels like every action of hers is driven by her own needs, which means nothing really matters except for what benefits her. That’s all I’ve ever seen from her, and now I realize how toxic it must be to live with her. I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with this anymore. Just knowing that"

But there's nothing. Only silence. My mind won't stop racing, thinking of all the what-ifs, if onlys, and why-nots. Why did she have to go now? We weren't even fully prepared. I keep replaying those final moments, wondering if there was anything I could've done differently. This isn't over. She'll come back. She has to. I know it. I can feel it. There must be some way to get her back, to make her stay. I need to figure this out, find a way to fix everything. I don't want to lose her again. I refuse to accept it.

She had left him, leaving behind a trail of broken promises, shattered dreams, and the faint scent of tears. His mind wandered back to that night when they first met, how she smiled at him across the crowded room, her eyes sparkling with laughter. How he'd thought then that she might be different, that she could change, that love could conquer all. But now, in this moment, those memories felt like cruel taunts, reminders of what he couldn’t have. Every door he opened led to more pain, every window revealed a world where happiness was an illusion. He thought about all the times she’d said things like “we’re too young” or “this isn’t right,” each phrase echoing through his mind like a death knell, warning him that some wounds would never heal. As he sat there, lost in the labyrinth of his thoughts, time became distorted. It didn’t matter if it was 8 pm or midnight; the emptiness inside him felt timeless. Every second stretched, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that this was his last chance, that if he failed now, there would be no tomorrow. The silence grew louder, until it felt"
