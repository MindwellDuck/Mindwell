You'll forget about the pain, and it won't bother you anymore. It's true for everyone else, right? My brother got over his ex after just two years, and now he's dating again. He said she made him realize how much love could hurt and that he wouldn't let anyone do that again. I guess some wounds really do heal, and we can always find happiness again. *We're all just temporary humans.* It doesn't matter if someone dies suddenly or lives a long life. They were born, lived, and died. What matters is that they experienced everything we have. Everyone has been through the same thing, even if they seem different on the outside. We’re all just fleeting moments in time, and our experiences are nothing special compared to the vastness of human history. *Just because something happens once doesn’t mean it’ll never happen again.* My friend got drunk one night, and when he woke up, he had no memory of anything. He didn't remember drinking or getting home. It happened once, but it could happen again. Even though it was an isolated incident, he still worries about it happening again. Maybe I'm being too cautious, but accidents can be unpredictable. If my sister does it once, it could become a habit, and then I'll be worried"

And then I started thinking about how much I hate mornings already, but that wasn't enough. I thought about all the times I've been pushed around, all the times people have treated me poorly because of who I am. This kid didn't even know anything about me; he was just being stupid, and that made me angry. It’s funny how my mind can take something so small and blow it up into this huge thing. Like, what if he was trying to make fun of me? Or maybe he was just having a bad day. But why would he care about me? This is ridiculous. What if he was going through something too? Maybe he was dealing with something personal, and that's why he acted the way he did. But does that excuse him? No, it doesn't. So why am I feeling guilty for getting upset? Because I'm such a terrible person. That's why. And then there were these thoughts creeping into my head again, and I realized I was being unfair.

Now, I know some people might think, \"What about all those times when everything was fine?\" But honestly, when I look back, I realize those were just lucky breaks. Sure, they happened, but let's be real, it could have easily gone the other way. And if we're being honest, even when things did go smoothly, there were probably some hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface. So, yeah, sometimes I wonder if I'm just cursed. Maybe it's because my husband left me, or maybe it's just because I'm not good enough.

Her face was set in a hard line, her lips pursed as if she was trying to keep something inside. It was like looking at a statue, frozen in time, unable to move or breathe. And then, out of nowhere, he heard the words that would change everything. \"You're leaving me.\" He felt like he'd been punched in the gut, all the air knocked out of him. He slumped against the counter, his legs giving out beneath him. He collapsed onto the floor, his back hitting the tile with a sickening crunch. For a moment, he lay there, his ears ringing from the explosion. But then reality hit. He slowly got up, dusting himself off. What did she mean? Why would she leave? His mind started racing.
