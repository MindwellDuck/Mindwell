His wife's laughter still echoed in his mind from last night, but today she was out with friends, leaving him to an emptiness that felt heavier than usual. He looked around at the dusty corners and bare walls, wondering where all their plans for decorating had gone. A single white rose lay wilting in a vase on the kitchen counter, its petals falling like tears onto the yellowed post-it note it had arrived with: \"For you, from me.\" His eyes stung as he remembered her smile when she gave it to him yesterday. Now it was just another reminder of how quickly joy could fade into melancholy.",

The fact that she prefers to be alone, reading or watching movies, makes him wonder if he’s failed as a husband. He feels neglected, and every day, it gets harder to see things from her perspective. She thinks I’m boring. Every day, she comes back late, exhausted from work. She leaves her bag on the floor, and sometimes it spills over into the living room. When she wakes up, she rushes through breakfast, barely acknowledging my presence. It’s frustrating; I try to make her coffee, but she usually just grabs something from the fridge instead. Last week, she even forgot our anniversary, which made me feel like she didn’t care about celebrating it anymore. This morning, when she left again without saying good morning, I couldn't help but think she must really dislike coming home to me. # Example Output: ## Response End ## Response End 2 ## Response End 3 ## Response End 4 ## Response End 5 ## Response End 6 ## Response End 7 ## Response End 8 ## Response End 9 ## Response End 10 ## Response End"

But what really got me thinking was a comment section where people were criticizing how much money the organizers must've spent on venue rental alone. It felt like they were making fun of me, too, because I'm the one who's always working hard, never taking time off. My mind started racing with questions—why did I even bother coming? Why didn't I spend my free time planning something better? This wasn't the first time someone else's negativity made me feel like I wasn't good enough. It just kept building up inside me until it finally spilled out. I sent a message to this stranger, complaining about how much money they wasted on such an unnecessary event. I know it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t help feeling overwhelmed by everything around me. Now here I am, wondering if I ever deserve anything nice. Maybe I’m just meant to be left behind. Why do I keep getting stuck in these situations? --- I can't stand seeing those posts anymore. They're always so negative, judging everyone.
