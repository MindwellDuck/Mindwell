He'd been at this for decades, but today was different. Today, he'd snapped at a young customer who'd innocently asked if they could return an item bought just yesterday. The man hadn't meant to bark like that; he was usually patient with the younger generation. But lately, every little thing seemed to set him off. As he turned off the lights and locked up for the night, he couldn't shake the feeling of guilt gnawing at him. He knew his partner would have something to say about it when he got home.",

I mean, I've seen some stupid shit in my time, but one day, a bunch of kids walked into our store, and they were straight outta the movie \"Kids these days.\" They thought they owned the place. One of them, a little punk, came over and started asking questions. When I told him we didn't carry whatever he wanted, he had the nerve to ask if he could return an item he bought yesterday. Are you fucking kidding me? You're asking to return something you bought yesterday? That's like trying to return money from last week! What kind of idiot does that? And then he had the audacity to get all upset when I told him no. Like, dude, you're 17 years old. If you can't handle buying your own damn stuff, maybe you shouldn't be shopping. Anyway, this kid's attitude was so bad that I ended up snapping at him. Now, I'm probably going to regret saying those things, but honestly, what the fuck is wrong with people these days?"

Can't get over something that never even happened. That's all I am now—a relic of the past, stuck in my head forever. You know what really gets me? People telling me to move on. They say I need to focus on myself, that I'll find someone else eventually. But they don't understand—this isn't about finding someone new. This is about letting go of everything we shared, everything we meant to each other. No, I won't be moving on anytime soon. I've already moved on. And besides, why would I want to? She’s gone, and no amount of closure will bring her back. Not to mention, she didn’t even try to fix things when I told her how I felt. I mean, I knew she wouldn’t.

Why can't he be both? Why does every moment feel like it's either one thing or the other? It's ridiculous, isn't it? But honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s like my mind is stuck in this endless loop of extremes. Either he’s right there with me, or he’s completely distant. There’s no middle ground. And if he’s not with us, then what's the point of even having him around? He might as well just disappear. I know it sounds irrational, but I feel so trapped by these feelings. They’re eating away at me, making everything feel like a big deal, like there’s no way to find balance. I guess I’m just looking for some way out of this cycle. I want things to go back to normal, but until then, I just feel stuck in this constant state of all or nothing. I hate feeling this way, but I don’t know how to stop it.

Every time there's another blackout, even if it's just for a few minutes, I feel like I'm reliving those terrifying moments from when I was a kid. You see, growing up in war-torn Europe, we didn't have electricity most of the time, but whenever it did come on, it felt like a luxury. Now, here I am, living in a modern city with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos, and yet I still get these intense flashbacks. The thought of being plunged into total darkness again makes me shiver. I guess some things never really go away. It’s like my brain is hardwired to associate blackouts with fear, no matter how much progress we've made as a society. I’ve tried everything to distract myself - going out, watching movies, even therapy sessions - but nothing seems to work. It’s like my mind is stuck on repeat, waiting for the next blackout. Sometimes I wonder if this is why people are always talking about how scary it must be to live through war. Maybe they're not just traumatized by the violence, but also by the darkness itself.

Sometimes, even when people are simply running behind schedule, I'll imagine they've forgotten about our plans or worse—maybe they're ignoring me on purpose. This kind of thinking escalates quickly, making me feel like I’m under siege by negativity. It’s like my mind has a default setting for worst-case scenarios, and anything that doesn’t go exactly as planned starts feeding into those fears. Even small things can become huge problems, leading me to question whether anyone really cares about me or if they’re just pretending to be friendly. It’s exhausting, but I know intellectually that this isn’t rational. Yet, somehow, my brain keeps finding ways to make it seem so real. Sometimes, I wonder how many times I’ve misinterpreted others’ intentions because of these spirals. Has there ever been a time when I genuinely thought someone was ignoring me, only to find out later they were dealing with something entirely different? Probably, but I don’t remember it.
