Meanwhile, I'm stuck here trying to keep up with everyone else, even though I'm doing everything I can. It feels like no matter how much I try, I'll always be behind. But you know what really gets under my skin? The way some of these people talk about their jobs like it's nothing. They'll say something like, \"Oh yeah, I've been putting in long hours lately,\" and it sounds so effortless. Like, they're used to it, you know? They don't even think twice about spending 12 hours straight on a project. They just shrug it off like it's no big deal. And then there's me, struggling to finish even a small task within the given timeframe. My colleagues might complain about being overworked too, but they never let it affect their confidence.

I won't stop until everything is fixed, no matter how long it takes. I guess some things are meant to be solved slowly, over time. I’ll keep going, no matter what.

Now, her chair is empty, but I can imagine her sitting there, smiling at something in her book. That smile is comforting, like a warm hug from an old friend.

She wondered if she'd somehow unintentionally crossed a line, perhaps by pushing too hard or taking credit for others' work. Maybe it wasn't just about the skills she brought, but also the emotional labor she’d invested in the company. Or maybe she was simply seen as less capable compared to her male colleagues who seemed to get away with similar behavior. She started to replay memories of their interactions, wondering if she'd misinterpreted his intentions or if he’d intentionally made her feel belittled.

But then, another memory emerged. She remembered her sister-in-law, Mrs. Johnson, who had taught for decades and still seemed full of energy. She would often joke about being able to teach forever, and it sounded almost genuine. Why did she have to be the one to leave? Wasn't she just as passionate about teaching?
