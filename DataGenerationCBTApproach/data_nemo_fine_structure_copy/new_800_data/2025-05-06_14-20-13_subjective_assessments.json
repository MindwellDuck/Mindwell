I know some of them are married, but there were still plenty of singles there. So many of them were there, laughing, having fun. And then...she started dancing. Just like that. No warning, no nothing. I was watching from across the room, feeling awkward because I didn't want to intrude. But seeing her dance like that? It made me feel left out, like I wasn't part of anything special. And then...the music stopped. Everyone clapped, and she smiled at everyone, but I could see tears in her eyes. She thanked everyone for coming, hugged each person, and turned around. That's when I saw her. Standing by the door, waiting for me. Her face looked so sad, like she couldn't wait to get home. She walked right past me and went straight to the car. I felt so guilty, like I'd done something wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have gone to the party in the first place? But why did she make me feel so stupid? Like I was supposed to be there, like I knew exactly how much fun she wanted me to have. I thought about all those memories we shared, our family"

And it’s all because of women who are just looking for ways to get ahead by manipulating men. They will stop at nothing to get what they want, even if it means betraying someone they supposedly love. I know some people might say, “It was one mistake, don’t let it define your entire relationship.” But how can you be so naive? People have been doing this for centuries, and now I’m starting to see why. It’s a universal truth that women are inherently dishonest, and I’m not buying it. Every single time I hear someone talk about how trustworthy their spouse is, there’s always some shady deal brewing behind closed doors. It’s a fact of life – we need to accept it before we can start trusting anyone. Trust is earned, not given freely. And another thing - she’s been getting away with this for months, which tells me that she thinks she can get away with anything. If I had to guess, I’d say she has a whole list of secrets she hasn’t told me yet. My gut tells me that there’s more than just this one mistake. She probably has an entire history of deceit, and I wouldn’t put it past her to keep on lying"

And don’t even get me started on the time we thought the house was haunted. You’re always jumping on every little thing, making us think it’s some kind of conspiracy. And honestly, most of the time, it turns out to be nothing. But you can never let go of those wild ideas, no matter how ridiculous they seem. Look, I know you care deeply about our family, but sometimes you need to take a step back and breathe. There are plenty of times when things seem scary, but they turn out fine. Maybe you need to work on trusting that life will settle down eventually. Anyway, enough about all that. Let’s focus on the present. We’ve got a lot on our plates right now, and I really need you to chill out. Can we please just enjoy the moment instead of getting worked up over every little thing?"

When we were out shopping yesterday, he was so impatient and rude to those sales associates. They were already stressed enough dealing with all the customers, and then they had to put up with him being a jerk. That kind of behavior is really draining. But no, instead of apologizing or showing empathy, he just keeps going on about how I’m supposed to support him because he has a tough job. Like, yeah, I get it, but what if I’m also struggling? Does he ever stop and think about how things feel from my side? Maybe if he did, he wouldn’t act so aggressively sometimes. But does he care? Of course not, because he’s just too caught up in his own problems. Now, here I am, trying to cook dinner and deal with him yelling at me again.

You need to take responsibility for your actions and stop blaming others. Instead, focus on finding solutions. Then, maybe you’ll see that things aren’t always black-and-white. Sometimes, we have to swallow our pride and move forward. Otherwise, we'll just keep repeating the same mistakes.

Is he truly sorry? And if so, why now? Why after everything else? What did he expect to happen? Did he think she’d forgive him easily? Did he hope she’d forget? How could she ever forgive someone who left her like this? The thought alone makes me sick. And what exactly is he apologizing for? The way he cheated? Or maybe it’s something else entirely? Something he never told her? This is insane! He’s talking about a relationship they had almost two years ago. They’re long gone, and she’s moved on. She deserves better than this kind of hurt.
