She swiped her card and walked into the supply room without hesitation. When she returned, she didn't even seem surprised to see that the door was still locked. I thought about how she must have gotten a special access code, which made me wonder if she knew something about my past that she wasn't sharing. It was clear she had some inside information, and I couldn't help but feel uneasy knowing she might be watching me too closely. She seemed so confident and prepared, it was almost as if she was waiting for me."

Was she truly meant for success, or just a vessel for others to fill with their expectations? As she sat across from her boss, he spoke of her potential, his words dripping with sincerity. He promised her opportunities, promising her the world if she just worked hard enough. And she believed him. She had to believe. The stakes were too high, the pressure too great. But then came the day she failed to deliver. The article fell flat, and the criticism poured in. Her boss called her into his office, his voice cold, his eyes critical. \"You're not living up to your potential,\" he said, his words cutting deep. \"If you want to succeed here, you have to step up.\" She tried. She really tried. But every time she thought she'd found her footing, another setback hit. Another missed deadline, another mistake, another disappointment. And still, she stood by her boss's side. She continued to work hard, pouring over reports, meeting deadlines, and pushing herself to be better. But no matter how hard she tried, failure kept coming back. One day, while working late, she stumbled upon a strange ritual. A woman stood before her, her hands weaving intricate patterns in the air. The old woman closed her eyes,"

Yeah, sure, because I don't have enough work already.\" But seriously, what's going through his mind? Is he feeling sorry for himself too? Does he see how much better things could be if only he had more funding? Maybe he's trying to convince himself that this isn't happening, that somehow the budget will magically fix itself, or that someone else will take his place. But deep down, does he secretly feel grateful? Thankful that he doesn't have to deal with the stress of finding new jobs? This is all just speculation, but I bet he's wondering why me, specifically, got hit with this news. Did he somehow cross paths with the principal? Was there something about my performance that made them decide to cut back? Or maybe he's just glad he won't have to compete with other teachers for the limited spots next year—after all, who needs diversity when you've got one guy holding everything together? He must be thinking about how this affects everyone involved"

Another rejection from that prestigious journal. It was no surprise; after all, they’re notoriously difficult to get into. Yet, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that this was yet another reminder of my failure. The email itself was polite enough, but I could almost hear the tone of detachment behind those words – “We appreciate your interest, but we don’t think you’d be a good fit.” Just like last year’s application, where they didn’t even bother to provide feedback. Every morning feels the same. Pointless, endless. My life is like a never-ending loop of disappointment. I feel trapped, stuck in a cycle of self-doubt. I’m starting to wonder if anyone would notice if I simply disappeared. The thought sends a shiver through me, but I quickly brush it off as paranoia.
