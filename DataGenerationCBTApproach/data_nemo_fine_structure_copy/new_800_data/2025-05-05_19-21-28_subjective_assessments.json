It was like they belonged to some kind of monster. And it was getting darker by the minute, so if there was a giant lurking around, he would have been way harder to spot because he wouldn't have needed to turn his head to look at me. What if this is what happened? What if someone saw those huge footprints earlier but didn't think much about them? Maybe they just thought, \"Oh, that's probably just a kid wearing sneakers,\" and went on with their day. Or maybe they noticed it, but dismissed it as nothing because they're too busy or distracted. I mean, who actually looks at every single footprint when they walk through the park? Not me, that's for sure. But then again, I'm not here alone; I have my precious pup with me, and I don't want anything bad happening to him either. But why am I so upset about something so trivial? The fact that someone might be out there, doing whatever, makes me feel so small and vulnerable. Like I could've been next, you know? Just imagine how terrified I'd be if I saw more footprints, or heard someone else's voice calling out. Then again, if I really did see a giant, I'd be the first one to run away screaming. Wait, no,"

But then, there was the letter. A simple note that read: \"Dear [Her Name], I am sorry I have been absent lately. I have been called away on an emergency trip and will return soon. Please forgive my absence.\" It seemed like a genuine apology, but she couldn't help feeling betrayed. Why would he leave her? What else did he hide? I tried to approach her, to clear up the misunderstanding, but she was too far gone. Her anger towards him was palpable, and I felt like an outsider looking in. When I saw how upset she was, I realized that she must have been telling the truth – he really did leave her. But then I remembered the conversation we had earlier that day. He told me that he needed to take care of some personal matters before returning to work. I thought maybe something was wrong, but when I asked if everything was okay, he just brushed it off. Now I'm starting to think that maybe he wasn't being honest with her after all. Maybe he was"
