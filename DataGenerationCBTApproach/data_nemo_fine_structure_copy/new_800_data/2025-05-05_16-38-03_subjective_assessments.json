He's been poring over scientific journals for hours, his eyes straining from the harsh light of his desk lamp. His phone rings; it's her—his ex-wife. He hesitates, then answers. She asks if he can watch their teenage daughter this weekend as she has a \"last-minute business trip.\" His grip tightens on the phone, resentment simmering within him like an unspoken reproach. This is not the first time she's made such arrangements without considering his schedule, or perhaps caring to. He feels the familiar bitterness rise in his throat as he agrees, his voice tighter than he'd like.",

How could someone so callously dismiss everything I’d worked for? Didn’t they understand that I poured every ounce of passion and dedication into teaching? That I wasn’t just some unqualified stranger? Didn’t they realize that I was fighting for something greater here? Something that went beyond mere qualifications?
