I wish there was a way to make it easier for her, but I guess it’s just part of being a busy person. I wouldn’t know what to do if I were in her shoes. I hope she finds a solution soon because... well, you know how much I love those herbs. They’re really important to me. I feel bad thinking this is an opportunity for her to finally get back into gardening again. It might help her relax a bit more and enjoy some peace after such a chaotic period. Hopefully, she’ll appreciate them as much as I do when she gets around to using them. Maybe it’s just one of those things where people forget to water things sometimes, especially during stressful times? I don’t know. Anyway, I’m glad I didn’t have to remind her today. That would’ve been awkward."

I mean, who forgets about plans? Maybe there was some kind of emergency we didn't know about. But honestly, it feels like my neighbor has moved on. It's hard to shake off the feeling that she's lost interest in me, even if it's just a minor misunderstanding. Maybe I'm being too sensitive. She did invite me over last week, after all. But that was different. She seemed genuinely interested in talking and laughing together. Tonight feels like a step backward, a reminder that maybe things were always going to stay superficial. Shit, I shouldn't be thinking like this. I need to focus on the positive—after all, she did invite me over. But it's hard to ignore the disappointment that comes with realizing I'm truly on my own. I guess I'll just have to make the best of it. Cooking for one might not be ideal, but at least I can try to pretend that everything is okay. Still, it's hard not to wonder what could've been if things had gone differently.\""

Maybe if he didn’t get so fucking angry about everything, things would be different. But no, instead, he lets his emotions consume him, and then...they leave him behind. Just like everyone else. So, what does he expect? That they'll suddenly come crawling back when he finally opens up? Fuck that. You think I'm stupid enough to believe that shit? I've been telling myself that for years, and look how far it got me. Now, I know better. The problem isn't anyone else—it's me. I need to stop letting my anger and sadness control me. It's time to move on, even if it kills me. Fucking hell, I hope it does. Maybe then people will finally understand that I’m not some broken piece of shit who deserves to be ignored. No, I deserve more than that. I deserve respect, but I guess nobody cares about that anymore. Still, he can't shake off the feeling that he's losing himself in all of this. Maybe"

We're all just here because someone else died, so we can wait around for the next one. Because that's what we do, right? Wait for people to die so they don't have to live anymore. I'm just an old man working in a hospital, sitting in a break room eating my lunch while I watch the world outside through the window. But I'm not doing it to help anyone; I'm doing it because I'm too fucking lazy to get up and walk around to the front desk. I know he had a wife and kids back home, but what does that really mean? They were probably dead by now anyway. Why would anything change now? It's not like I'm going to go save him or anything. That's what these jobs are for: dying, and then dying again.

I wish I had that kind of joyous energy around me. My own home is dull and uninviting compared to theirs. How could I possibly be expected to create such happiness when everything about my life feels so bleak? It’s infuriating to see how carefree they are, laughing and having fun together. They deserve every bit of happiness, but what about me? I’m stuck in this lonely rut, constantly reminded of their warm family moments. It’s like they’re mocking me, flaunting their happiness right in front of me. Why does it have to be so hard for someone like me?
