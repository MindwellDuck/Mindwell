Does he see how much time I’ve spent on this project? How many late nights and weekends it took? Of course, he doesn’t. He doesn’t put himself through similar challenges every week. His job isn’t as mentally demanding as mine. Now, he may think I’m being ungrateful, but I need support, not sympathy. I want to explain the complexity of the problem, but it feels pointless. Even if I did, would he truly listen? Probably not. He wouldn’t understand the intricacies of my work. Still, I shouldn’t expect him to grasp it fully. After all, he doesn’t work in tech. Maybe he genuinely cares, but his actions are misguided. By offering comfort, he might be sending the wrong message. Instead of letting me figure things out, he’s distracting me from finding solutions. His kind gesture only adds to my frustration. I wish he could see what I see, but he never will.

What strength must he possess to carry on, day after day, in the face of such unrelenting adversity? But what struck me most was the stark contrast between his outward appearance and inner turmoil. Like a chasm between two worlds, he stood poised, a figure of unshakeable resolve, even as his body betrayed him with each trembling hand. This dichotomy left me bewildered, torn between admiration for his unwavering dedication and despair over the crushing burden he bore. Was he truly strong enough to bear it all? Or did I see only what I wanted to see—the mask of resilience he wore to hide the depths of his pain?
