That cop must be thinking that I'm going to jump up and start chasing him down, but nope, I'm still in shock. How could he think I'd just let him go after everything that's happened? Doesn't he know my husband didn't deserve to die? And now this? He's probably getting off on the idea of me being furious, isn't he? He thinks I'll come after him with a gun, but really, I've got better things to do than give some asshole a hard time right now. It's ridiculous that he would even think I wouldn't be upset about this. Doesn't he know I'm already struggling to cope? Does he think I just won't care when someone who hurt us gets away? Of course, he thinks that - he's an asshole! Why else would he assume such a thing? He probably thinks I'm just going to sit here and stew while he walks all over me, but no way. I"

This whole situation feels like a nightmare, and I just want to wake up and realize it was all a dream. But no, it's real, and now I'm stuck dealing with the guilt of possibly betraying my own husband. This isn't fair; he's always been so supportive. If anything, he’s the one who encouraged me to try new things. Now, because of this stupid lipstick, he's acting like I’m some kind of home-wrecker. I feel sick, knowing he might think I'm behind this. The thought of him doubting me makes me sick to my stomach. I can’t imagine what he’ll say next when he finds out. He'll probably accuse me of cheating, and I won’t blame him if he does. I don’t deserve that. What if he tries to talk to me about it? Maybe he wants to work through this together, but"

My wife, Martha, was supposed to sign them today, but she didn't show up. She said she needed some more time. Time for what? To remember? To make amends? I can't shake off the feeling that I'll never forgive myself for that day. What if I hadn't hesitated? What if I had trusted my instincts? Would she be alive now? I'm tired of living with these thoughts. I wish I could turn back time, erase the pain from my heart. But deep down, I know there's no turning back.
