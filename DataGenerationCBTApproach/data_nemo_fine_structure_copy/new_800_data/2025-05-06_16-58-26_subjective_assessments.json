I mean, who wouldn't be devastated when they realize their spouse doesn't want to spend more time with them? I'm trying to stay strong for our daughter, but it's hard when she has doubts like this. She probably thinks I'm being too sensitive, but honestly, what would you expect if your partner was calling you all day? I'm just going through hell right now - it's like every fiber of my being is screaming at me to end things. But I know that's ridiculous; he loves me. He wouldn't do something like this unless... unless there's someone else involved. And I'm pretty sure it isn't just a midlife crisis. This is something deeper, something that makes me question everything. It feels like he's checking out mentally, and I feel so alone in this. I can't imagine how hard it must be for him to admit these thoughts, especially since we've built such a good life together. Maybe I'm overreacting, but it's hard not to wonder if he's hiding secrets from me. The way he's acting, it's like he's already gone - or maybe he never really was here."

The snowflakes continued to fall, gently landing on his gloves but none landed on his hands, no matter how hard he tried. He felt nothing. Nothing had ever felt anything for him. As he walked through the graveyard, he saw the names of countless others who had once been loved, whose lives were now nothing more than memories. They deserved better than this. None of them did. Their graves were just empty spaces, devoid of even the slightest hint of what it meant to truly live. It didn't apply to him either. He was beyond redemption, lost forever in his own sorrow. No amount of happiness would ever be enough to redeem the pain he'd caused. His mind wandered to the wedding he had missed, the promises made, and the dreams shattered. Even the joy of the ceremony, with its vibrant colors and lively atmosphere, seemed hollow now. It couldn't compare to the emptiness he felt within. There was nothing worth celebrating when every memory reminded him of what could have been. He wondered if she knew how much he despised her now, how much he hated her for standing there smiling, pretending everything was fine. She wouldn't understand; she never did. Her presence was a cruel reminder of all he‚Äôd lost, of the love he‚Äôd ruined, and the family he‚Äôd destroyed. What was the point of even trying? He wasn‚Äôt capable of feeling"

Or perhaps this was all just part of some bigger plan, something she hadn't revealed to him yet? It didn't matter what he thought; she would decide whether she stayed or went when she felt ready. It was either all or nothing‚Äîshe was either there for him or completely out of his life. That‚Äôs how he viewed it, as if the decision was made before he even knew it was coming, a fate sealed in advance.

The man's comment caught her off guard because it wasn't just a compliment; it implied that he knew her husband personally. At first, she felt embarrassed by his statement, but then realized that it made sense given the restaurant's reputation for family recipes passed down through generations. Her mind began to wonder if this stranger might be a distant relative or friend of her husband's. The more she thought about it, the more she became convinced that he was indeed related. Maybe they shared a common ancestor, or perhaps they were part of the same social circle. She couldn't help but imagine how many times they'd crossed paths over the years, even though she'd never noticed anything out of the ordinary. As she continued to ponder the possibility, her thoughts grew more elaborate. Perhaps they shared similar interests or hobbies, or maybe they'd met under circumstances that would have created a strong bond between them. The idea seemed plausible, and she found herself wondering what other connections they might share."
