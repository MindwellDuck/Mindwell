It's been a long time since we broke up, but it still feels like yesterday when she said she couldn't handle us being together. And now I'm dealing with this? I can barely look at myself in the mirror; I don't know who I am anymore. Everytime I think about moving forward, I get hit with more painful reminders - the note she left, the way she was always changing plans, all those times she wouldn't respond... It feels like she’s always going to be like that. Like she’s just not going to give us a chance. But why? We were perfect once, right? She was such an amazing partner, and we had so many great years. Now I'm starting to wonder if we ever truly were meant to be. Was she just playing games with me? Did she never really love me? I keep replaying every argument we had, and it just keeps getting worse. If she didn’t care enough to make things work, why would she bother sending a picture of our daughter? Does she really think I’d be okay with that? Or is she just messing with me, making me suffer? What if I"

But then I thought about how everyone else seems to be having a great time, laughing together during lunch, and going out for parties while I'm stuck inside studying. It feels unfair when they go out on weekends and come back happy, while I'm still home doing work, feeling like I'm missing out on fun times. Why does everyone else get to relax and have more free time, while I'm left here trying to balance schoolwork? I even think about how students who live near campus can easily join friends and have fun together on weekends, but I'm far away, and it makes me feel sad and lonely. Maybe if I could do things differently, I'd have more opportunities to connect with people outside of school, but I don't know what I can change. Every time I look around, I see students enjoying themselves, and it makes me wish I could experience that too. But I know I need to keep pushing through, so I won't give up. I'll keep working hard and hoping someday I'll be able to make new connections and find happiness. I guess I'll just have to keep going and try to stay positive.

He'd been retired for years now, but he still missed the quiet hum of the hospital at night, the comforting ritual of checking on patients' vitals. Instead, he was left with this emptiness, filled only by the ticking clock and the distant hum of traffic.\n\nThe doorbell rang, a harsh sound that grated against his nerves. He slowly rose, using his cane for support, and made his way to the door. Standing there was a young woman, barely more than a girl, with a clipboard tucked under her arm. She wore a smile too bright for this hour, too cheerful for his mood.\n\n\"Good evening,\" she chirped, \"I'm here from Meals on Wheels—\"\n\nHe cut her off, irritation flaring like a sudden pain. \"I never ordered any meals. I've told them before, I can manage just fine.\"\n\nHer smile wavered but held firm. \"Oh, I think there might be a misunderstanding...?\"\n\nHis grip tightened around his cane. \"No misunderstanding,\" he snapped. \"Now, if you'll excuse me.\" He started to close the door, the irritation boiling over into something sharper, something more like anger.

But then again, who wouldn't feel that way after being cooped up at home? I tried to reassure myself that maybe this was just another case of someone struggling with retirement, that I needed to keep trying even if things didn’t go smoothly. Still, the image of him standing there, his fists clenched, lingered in my mind like a ghost. I couldn't shake the feeling that I’d stumbled upon something much deeper, something that went beyond just meals and routine. Maybe he wasn’t just grumpy; maybe he was fighting a war within himself, one where loneliness reigned supreme. That thought sent a shiver through me, but I pushed it aside, telling myself I needed to focus on my job. Yet, the memory of those angry eyes stayed with me, haunting me. It’s not fair to judge someone based on how they react, especially when we don’t know the whole story. We’re all struggling, aren’t we? In our own ways, we must find strength in each other.
