I've always prided myself on being thorough and meticulous. Now, I'm starting to wonder if I'm just making things harder for myself. Maybe I’m overthinking this whole thing, and it's really no big deal. Yet, the thought still lingers, making me feel like there must be something more I'm missing. Shouldn’t I be more careful? Shouldn't I know exactly what's going on? It's not just this one incident; I keep thinking back to past mistakes, wondering if they were because I shouldn’t have done them. Shouldn't I have been more precise? Shouldn't I have double-checked everything before publishing? The questions swirl, leaving me feeling uncertain and self-doubting. What if I’ve been letting my pride get in the way? Shouldn’t I be open to feedback, even when it comes from someone who might seem arrogant? Shouldn't I trust my instincts instead of second-guessing every little detail? It's hard to shake off these doubts, especially since it happened right in front of everyone.

She had told us she wasn’t attending because she didn’t want to hear rumors about herself, but I knew it was really because she felt left out. Even though she’d been working hard lately, trying to get ahead, no one ever gave her credit. It was always someone else – her boss, her colleagues, even her own family. They never stopped to think about what it must be like to be in her shoes, struggling just as much as she was. Every time I saw her, I felt this sense of sadness wash over me. Maybe if I pushed through it all, kept going, I could finally find some happiness. But it seemed like everyone else had already found theirs. At least they did before I became part of their lives. I wondered if anyone would even notice if I disappeared. Would they remember me? Would they care? I glanced around the room, taking in the vibrant atmosphere.
