Like how many times has she heard people say things like “she looks tired” or “you must be getting older”? How many times has she been made to feel inadequate because of her age? Maybe they didn’t even notice her. Or maybe they did, but they were just talking about something unrelated. The way they stopped smiling when she walked in could mean anything except that they’re staring at her. It’s not like she hasn’t been here before; she knows everyone’s schedule and routines. It’s just her own insecurities playing tricks on her brain again. I need to stop letting these stupid thoughts consume me.
