Now it's gone, and I'm left here with nothing but memories. The pain is suffocating me, making it hard to breathe. I can't help but wonder if she ever thought about me after we parted ways. Why wouldn't she want to be with someone as wonderful as me? What could she possibly see in him that made her leave? Doesn't she remember how much she loved our life together? We had everything—a beautiful home, loving family, and each other. But now, it’s all gone, and I’m left to pick up the pieces. She didn’t even give me a chance to say goodbye or explain things. Did she think she could just walk away from our future together? Maybe she doesn’t even care about me anymore. Maybe she’s moved on, and this whole thing was just an accident. I try to tell myself that, but it’s hard to accept when my mind keeps replaying every moment we shared. Every time I look at the sweater, I feel like I’m reliving our happiest moments. Why does she get to keep them while I lose everything? Doesn’t"

Maybe then I’d still have some hope, maybe I could find inspiration again. But no, she has to go and sell our last memory together. My wife doesn’t care about me; she only cares about herself. And now, I’m left with nothing but this useless paintbrush and a canvas that refuses to show me what I want. This is all because of her. I’ll never forgive her.

Or maybe she does. He's completely lost here. This is insane! She didn't even say anything when she walked out. They've been divorced for months, and now this? It makes sense that she'd leave a message like this, right? She must be upset. I bet she is. That means we're friends again. Wait, why am I feeling guilty? Is it because I deleted the message? No, it's because I don't know what she wants. I'm freaking out over something she didn't even say. This is so unfair. I feel like shit. I need to calm down. Why can't I stop thinking this way?"

Every glance made him feel more exposed, as if she could see right through to the darkest corners of his heart. She didn't even say a word, just kept staring at him with an unnerving intensity that made him squirm in his seat. It was almost as if she knew exactly what he was thinking - the desperation creeping in when the hours turned into days, the fear growing with each passing moment. The silence between them grew thicker than the fog outside, heavy with unspoken emotions. It felt like she was waiting for him to crack, to reveal some hidden truth that would shatter the fragile facade he'd built around himself. But instead, all he got was the cold, hard stare of someone who had given up trying to understand him. And maybe she had, because it was starting to look like this wasn't about communication anymore; it was about something far deeper - the silent battle for control that raged within them both.

Her Instagram feed was filled with stunning photos, each one a testament to her wanderlust. As I looked around my empty kitchen, I couldn't help but think about how much more enjoyable our travels would have been if she were still here. The thought sent a pang through me, making my eyes sting with tears. It wasn't supposed to end like this. We'd talked about our dreams, our aspirations, but nothing could have prepared me for the pain of losing her. The memories lingered, taunting me with what could have been—a lifetime of adventures together, the laughter, the quiet moments, and the late-night conversations about life.

I felt like crying, but I didn’t want to ruin the class with tears. Why did the teacher put it back there? Does she know how much this hurts? Or is it some cruel joke? The letter is just sitting there, untouched, like it’s mocking me. I wish I could erase everything, but I can’t. This is all so unfair. I thought we had moved on, but now I realize that nothing has really changed. We’re still stuck in the past, reliving memories that no longer belong to us. I keep thinking about the day we broke up.
