You drag yourself there every day, but sometimes, you just forget to go home. I guess this guy had one of those days where he left work and forgot about his car keys, because he said he didn't notice anything weird until he got home. He's been working at this company for over 10 years, and they've always been pretty strict about leaving on time. But I suppose he must have gotten distracted by some project or another and completely spaced out. But what really gets me is that he has no excuse. This isn't the first time something like this happens. He's done it before, and he knows better than to leave his stuff behind. It's not like he couldn't remember or anything. No, he just... forgot. Like, it wasn't even an accident. It feels like he does this on purpose. Maybe he thinks he's too good for the company to bother with things like this. Or maybe he's just trying to get away from work. Either way, it makes me sick to think that someone who's supposed to be responsible would do something so careless. He doesn't deserve to keep his job. And honestly, why should he? If he can't even take care of himself, then he shouldn't be trusted to manage other people's projects.

He hasn't heard from her in months, and as he unfolds the paper, he sees that it's not the heartfelt reconnection he'd hoped for, but rather a stark, formal request to reduce his monthly child support payments due to her recent change in circumstances.

But no, it can’t be that. I know my life has been perfect, with never a single misstep. I mean, who wouldn’t want to be a good son? And yet, here we are, facing another painful episode of rejection. I guess I have to accept that sometimes people just don’t understand us. After all, what could possibly make someone act this way? It makes sense that my daughter doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. She must be going through a difficult time, struggling with her own personal demons. Maybe she’s dealing with financial issues, health problems, or even a new relationship that’s distracting her. Whatever the reason, I can’t help but feel that I’m somehow responsible for it. Is it because I wasn’t there enough? Because I didn’t show her the love and support she deserved? Or perhaps it’s simply because I’m an unlovable person who doesn’t deserve to be loved anyway?

Doesn't she know how reckless he is? His whole family probably encourages this kind of behavior, which means they must be irresponsible parents who don't care about safety. Maybe they even encourage him to ride at night or off-road without proper protection. What if his dad is an irresponsible driver like his grandfather? They're probably all irresponsible people who don't care about safety, and that's why they live next door to each other. If I were his mom, I wouldn't let him ride a motorcycle at night. I'd make sure he wears proper gear and follows traffic rules. But since she doesn't seem to care about that, maybe she wants him to get hurt or injured somehow. Or perhaps she thinks he's too young to drive a motorcycle and she's just waiting for him to turn 18. I hope she knows better than to let him ride at night because if she doesn't, then she's not a good parent. This situation really bothers me because it shows how some families can pass down bad habits.

Now everyone thinks we're incompetent, and it feels so unfair. This isn't the first time he's criticized us like that. Remember when he said we never learned anything from our last experiment because we messed up the results? That was so unfair; we worked hard for those results, and it wasn't all mistakes. But he kept going, saying we \"never learn\" and that we're always doing things wrong. Even though we know he's right sometimes, he can't stop generalizing everything.
