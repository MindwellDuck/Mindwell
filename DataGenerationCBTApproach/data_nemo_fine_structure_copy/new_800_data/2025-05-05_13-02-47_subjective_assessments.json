It has to be just that—some moron messing with my electricity. But what if this isn't just an electrical issue? What if there’s something else going on? I shouldn’t be thinking like this; I need to stay calm, but how?! They’re all just trying to cover up something shady, aren’t they? Why are they making such a big deal about this? It sounds like they're being super cautious, almost paranoid, which makes me wonder if there’s really nothing wrong. Maybe they’re just overreacting because they want everyone to believe they have all the answers. But what if they don’t? What if they’re just playing us? And why would they choose now, when everything feels so tense already? My heart is racing, and I feel like I’m going crazy. Am I even safe here? Should I try calling someone, but then again, who will answer? Maybe I should just wait and see what happens next… but what if I should be preparing myself for the worst? How am I supposed to know what’s real and what’s not?"

Her colleague, Sarah, approaches, holding out the stack with an apologetic smile. \"I'm sorry, but the editor needs these done by today.

It's like she has this sixth sense that tells her when I'm distracted or preoccupied, which is exactly how I feel right now. What if she saw some other woman in another city who looks better than me? Or maybe she just wants to know what I'm doing online because she thinks I'm up to no good, which would make sense since I've been acting weird lately. But no, it had to be some personal thing—like a picture of us together. Of course she'd notice that. It's not like she's oblivious to everything around her. This isn't the first time I've seen her snoop through his stuff; she does it all the time. I guess I'll just have to deal with the fact that even though I love him, she doesn't trust me enough to respect my privacy. She must think I'm hiding something from her, and honestly, I can't blame her. I mean, who wouldn't want to know what I'm up to?

But she kept her cool, even though she couldn't help feeling frustrated. She decided to take a deep breath and remind herself that these kinds of conversations might seem pointless, but they could actually be useful in some way. Maybe her colleagues had learned something valuable during their trips, or maybe they were just trying to connect with each other outside of work. So, she sat there, pretending to listen, all while thinking, “This is such a waste of time.” The fact that she felt this way made her realize how much stress meetings like these could cause—she knew she shouldn’t let her annoyance affect her ability to concentrate. Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that everyone else was more interested in their own stories than in discussing the real issues at hand. She hoped that by the end of the meeting, she’d be able to put aside her frustration and focus on what truly mattered. If she could manage that, maybe she’d"
