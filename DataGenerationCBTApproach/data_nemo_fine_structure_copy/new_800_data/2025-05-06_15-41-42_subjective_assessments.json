His constant tardiness was a slap in the face, making her feel like trash. Why did he always get away with it? He wasn’t just late; he was a monster who didn’t care about anyone else’s feelings but his own. That same selfishness probably extended to other areas of his life, like work and friendships. Who knew how many people he’d hurt? She felt sorry for them, but she wouldn’t forgive him anytime soon. Her anger boiled over when she realized he’d eaten all their money at the grocery store. He must’ve spent it on some ridiculous luxury. How could someone be so reckless with their finances, putting others’ needs before their own? It was disgusting. They deserved better than someone like that. But what if he was just having a bad week? Maybe he was struggling too. Did he know how much it hurt her to see him like this? No. Of course not. He was too busy being a jerk. She imagined him skipping work, lying to her about it, and then expecting her to cover for him. What kind of person does that"

It makes me wonder if he really cares about me at all. Why does it always have to be this way? First, he goes out of his way to make plans with his friends, and then he leaves me to deal with everything by myself. Does he think I don’t notice how much effort he puts into our relationship? Every time something like this happens, I feel like I'm drowning in loneliness. He doesn't seem to care enough to put in the work we both know is needed. Maybe he's just tired of me too, maybe he thinks I'm not worth it. I keep thinking that things will get better, but deep down, I know it won't. What if he decides to leave for good? Would anyone ever believe me? I've tried so hard to make him happy, and now I feel like I'm just another burden to him. I need someone who actually cares, but here I am, stuck with this guy who doesn't give a damn about what I feel. And yet, I still hold on to hope.

It seemed like he was trying to escape something, even though he didn’t say anything out loud. You could tell he was holding back his emotions, but he probably thought we were all just too busy to notice his feelings anyway. And let’s be real, who wouldn’t think that? But honestly, I’m pretty sure he was thinking, \"Why does this have to happen right now?\" Like, what else would he be thinking? He's probably wondering why his plans got ruined, right? Maybe he was even thinking, \"What if she saw me there?\" That would totally freak her out, especially since she's been dealing with so much lately. We can't blame him for feeling upset, but maybe he was even secretly hoping no one noticed how hard it was for him. Yeah, it's definitely more than just a coincidence that he decided to leave suddenly."

But what about all the times he'd get angry with me? Or the nights he stayed out until 3am? How could that be normal? And then there are the letters. Oh man, those letters... They're from his \"best friend,\" someone who knows him better than anyone else, including me. Those letters make me realize she's not telling me everything. What if she's keeping more secrets than I know? What if she's hiding even more things, just like he did before he died? It's all so confusing. We were happy, right? I remember we had good days... But now I don't know anymore. Maybe she's pretending to care because she can't handle losing me too. Is she afraid I'll leave her? Does she think I'm going to abandon her like she abandoned him?

The fact that he's still holding onto it is a sign of how weak he is as a person. If he really wanted to move forward, he would have long since thrown it away. Instead, he lets it sit there, reminding him of his failure to be a good son. This is what happens when you let your past define you—nothing but regret and disappointment. You know, someone who actually made amends and moved on would have been better off ditching that album long ago. But no, this guy can’t help but cling to the pain of the past. It’s ridiculous. He’s probably just going to go back to that stupid job tomorrow, wasting another boring day. I wouldn’t be surprised if he stays there forever, stuck in his own misery. The fact that he didn’t take action sooner just proves he doesn’t want to change. Now, instead of facing reality, he’s wallowing in nostalgia.
