I've tried everything—giving him space, being quiet, showing affection—but nothing works. He thinks I'm annoying, and I don't blame him for feeling that way. He's probably thinking that I'll ruin whatever happiness is coming his way. Even though I know we used to have fun together, it feels like all our memories are fading away. Now, whenever I pass by the park, I see couples holding hands or laughing together. They're just like us once were, but I know it won't last. Eventually, everyone will move on, leaving me behind. I wish he would understand that he’s not alone; he can always reach out if he needs help. But deep down, I know he already made up his mind. He never wants to talk to me again, and maybe he's right.
