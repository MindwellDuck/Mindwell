Every time they share meals, it's like being trapped in a script where the same lines are repeated ad nauseam—“Did you have a good day? Did you do something interesting?” But honestly, most days blend together; the excitement wears off, leaving behind an uneventful monotony that fills the space between conversations. When his wife talks about her own job, she lights up with genuine enthusiasm, sharing every detail from her projects. Meanwhile, his stories are met with a dismissive eye-roll, as if the novelty has worn off. It’s almost as if his wife is no longer interested in hearing what he does, even though she was once eager to listen. She doesn’t ask follow-up questions anymore; instead, she just nods politely, then quickly changes the subject. Even when he tries to make small talk about current events, her responses feel forced, like she’s going through the motions. There’s a noticeable shift in how she interacts with him, especially during meals. It’s as if everything becomes routine, with little room for genuine connection. Every evening ends with the same tired question: “So, did anything exciting happen today?” The answer always seems to be a resounding “no.” It’s no longer a conversation but a scripted exchange that plays out every night. Even the things he normally shares with friends don’t seem to resonate with her"

Does he even care about my kids anymore? How could he? All he cares about is himself. I know it's not true, but does he really hate us that much? I've been trying to give him chances, but he keeps blowing them. My son needs me now more than ever. He must have planned this whole thing and then disappeared. He knows I'll never forgive him. We were happy once, but now everything is ruined. There's no turning back now; I have to protect my family. I won't let anyone hurt us again. He'll pay for what he did.

This is exactly why I don’t trust anyone anymore. They’ll all just play me for fools and leave me in the end. But honestly, what’s the point of trying anyway? I guess I’ll just have to suck it up and keep pretending nothing’s wrong until she comes back. Who cares if I hate myself while waiting? This isn’t fair. I thought we were making progress, but I guess I was just fooling myself. She doesn’t love me; she loves everyone else. She has a life outside of our relationship, and I’m just an inconvenience she’s willing to live without.

The same old windows that she used to stare at for hours, dreaming of something more. Now they're filled with warm golden light, and she can't help but feel a pang of jealousy. She remembers the way he would look at her when they first started dating. He was always so gentle and kind, never pushing her to do anything she didn't want to do. He made me feel loved and cherished, and I thought we had something real. But then he left, and everything fell apart. Now he's back, and it feels like nothing will ever go right again.

She expects them to live with her forever, refusing to let go of control. It’s pathetic, really – she has no right to dictate how they live their lives, especially when she doesn’t contribute financially. Her husband must feel like he’s carrying the weight of parenting on his own, while she just sits around doing nothing but taking care of herself. This isn’t fair to him, and it’s definitely not good for the kids. I don’t know why anyone would choose this lifestyle. Being a stay-at-home mom should be easier than what she makes it seem, especially considering she gets paid nothing. It’s ridiculous that people think being a mother is hard work, but I guess it’s obvious enough by now. Maybe if she took better care of herself physically and mentally, things wouldn’t be so bad.
