It's like some kind of sick joke. I swear, she must be playing some prank on us. I feel like such a fool for not catching on sooner. Maybe I should have looked closer at those old family photos... Wait a minute—there they are! Her parents were married for over twenty years, and I've seen pictures of them together. This whole thing feels like a massive scam. My daughter is probably making fun of me right now, laughing at how gullible I am. But what really gets my goat is that she didn't even notice anything out of the ordinary. She just went about her day as usual, oblivious to the fact that her whole life has been a lie. I feel like I'm losing my mind. This is insane. I know we're supposed to respect our dead, but come on! If anyone deserves a kick in the teeth, it's her. She's got some explaining to do. This isn't over yet; I'll get to the bottom of things. Mark my words, there will be consequences. And"

Newsflash: I am. So why can't she just let it go already? And another thing - who does she think she is, putting that picture out where everyone can see it? Does she want to rub it in my face? It's not like I haven't seen it before; it's just stupid to leave it there. If she wants to remember her mom, fine, but stop making me feel bad about my own losses. I didn’t lose anyone important today. I’m not the one who’s supposed to be wallowing in sadness 24/7. Why does everyone always assume I’m the victim here?
