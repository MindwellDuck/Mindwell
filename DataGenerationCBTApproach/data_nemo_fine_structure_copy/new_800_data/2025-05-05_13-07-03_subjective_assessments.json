Then, an editor stood up and held up last night’s paper. It had something huge written on it - a massive mistake he made while working on the story. I mean, he was so embarrassed; his face was literally on fire. And then there were all these people staring at him... like he did something wrong? I don’t know, maybe they were mad because he messed up, but honestly, I think they were just staring because he looked weird. Like, have you ever seen someone walk into a room and everyone turns around? That must be why they were looking at him like that. Maybe they thought he was trying to sneak in some papers or something, but I’m pretty sure that wasn’t it. Anyway, after all those awkward looks, he just grabbed a cup of coffee and went back to his desk. I don’t know what’s going on, but it seemed really strange. You’d think they would be nice to him, considering he probably didn’t even realize what was happening. I bet if we got them together, they could sort everything out, but I guess that wouldn’t be much help now since he already left. I mean, who knows what actually happened, right?"

He makes things, fixes stuff around the house, and helps out with odd jobs. But now...now it's different. Now he has to think about how he'll pay for all those things. How much longer can he keep this up? This isn't just about money; it's about pride. He won't let it get to him, though. He won't let anyone else either. Not even the cop. Not even the pig. They're both just pawns in a game they don't understand. But deep down, he knows it's not just about the money or the pride. It's about control. Whoever does this wants to make him feel powerless.

I know how much you loved me and wanted us to stay close, even after you passed away. I can’t help but feel sad whenever I think about your passing. It’s been difficult for me to accept, but seeing your letter has brought back some painful memories. I remember how much we used to talk, how excited I would be when you’d come visit, and how much I looked forward to our conversations. You always had such a warm smile, and your stories were full of love and care—each one made me feel like everything was going to be okay. Even though it feels like just yesterday, I’m starting to realize how much time has actually passed since you left. I miss having you around; every day feels emptier than the last. Your presence means so much to me, and I wish things could go back to the way they were before. Your letter gave me chills. Seeing your handwriting and knowing it was meant for me made me feel so happy and nostalgic at the same time. I’ve kept it safe, as if I wasn’t ready to let it go.
