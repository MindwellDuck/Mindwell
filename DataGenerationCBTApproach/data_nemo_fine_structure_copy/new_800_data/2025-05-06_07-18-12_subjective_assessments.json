And then there's the added bonus of having to deal with all those idiots coming in and telling us how we're fucked up just because we don't have our shit together yet. Or worse, because we actually tried to make it work? Oh, and did I mention that everyone thinks they can handle it now, even though they still don't know the first thing about it? And then there's the part where I get to check my phone every five seconds. Just what I needed, another reason to love being stuck at home for months while everyone else has fun. I mean, why would anyone want to do something fun when they could just sit around and wait for someone to finally get their act together? It's not like I'm bored out of my mind or anything. Nope, nothing. Not at all. I'm totally comfortable doing absolutely nothing for hours on end, especially since I have nothing better to do. And hey, why worry"

Maybe I'm just so sensitive because of my past trauma that I overreacted, and it wasn't really that big of a deal. Or maybe I'm just imagining things because of how lonely I am now. Maybe this is all just a bunch of nonsense. No way, it's clearly a trap set by... by whoever.

I can see why her students would miss her. It hurts to hear people say things like that, especially when I think about all the times we talked about our dreams for the future—she always said she wanted to inspire kids to love learning just as much as I did. What makes them think I wouldn’t want to do the same thing? This isn’t fair. Just because one student thinks poorly of me doesn’t mean everyone else will too. They're probably just bored or something. You can’t compare yourself to someone who’s no longer here. That’s not fair. Not only does it hurt, but it also gives other teachers a bad reputation.

Even Rachel, who looks so confident and poised, must be feeling some level of pressure to keep up with her peers. After all, they’re all vying for scholarships and top spots in their programs. It makes sense that Rachel would feel some level of stress too, even if she doesn’t show it. They’re all trying to succeed, but Sarah is definitely the easiest going of the bunch. That’s why she looks so relaxed, while Emily appears tense and worried about her future. At least Rachel isn’t overwhelmed by coursework and extracurricular activities like the other two. She’s managed to balance everything perfectly, whereas Emily and Sarah are both struggling to keep up with their classes. This is evident in how much work they have on their desks, with Emily looking like she has almost no assignments left to finish, and Sarah barely scratching anything off her list. These differences make it clear that Sarah is handling things way easier than Emily, who seems to be drowning in work. The fact that Sarah still has room on her calendar to attend a study group means she has plenty of free time and energy left over. In contrast"
