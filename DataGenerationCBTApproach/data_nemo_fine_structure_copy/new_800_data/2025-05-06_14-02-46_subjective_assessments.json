She doesn't care about him anymore. She thinks she can just move on and forget everything he did for her, but she's wrong. They'll never find another one exactly like that. It's ruined! I know he loved that mug; I remember seeing him hold it up to light it and say something about how it looked great with the new coffee creamer he got. And there's no way he wouldn't have said anything if it wasn't his favorite. That's why I can't stop thinking about what could've been—what if he hadn't died, what if he still had that coffee, what if we were all together again? This whole thing is so cruel. She probably doesn't even think twice about putting that mug out with the rest of the dishes. But it's more than just a dish, it's a memory. And now it's being thrown away, lost forever.

He pushed through the room, trying to avoid eye contact, but the glances kept coming back to him. His mind began to fill in the gaps - what if they saw him as less capable than they thought? What if they knew more about his past mistakes? He felt like he was walking through a minefield, every glance a potential explosion.

My thoughts are now consumed by feelings of insecurity and resentment, further exacerbated by the knowledge that I have worked tirelessly to establish myself professionally and emotionally. The image of him laughing with another woman, seemingly carefree and content, creates an overwhelming sense of despair. Each moment spent watching him leaves me more disoriented and helpless, as if I am trapped in a never-ending cycle of anger and sorrow. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the profound impact that past traumas continue to exert over my life. The memories of our tumultuous marriage linger, fueling my perception that every interaction between us is a calculated effort to destroy what little remains of my confidence.

We’re already running behind schedule, and she’s just making it worse. This isn’t about cooking anymore; it’s about survival. I’m tired of fighting this fight alone.
