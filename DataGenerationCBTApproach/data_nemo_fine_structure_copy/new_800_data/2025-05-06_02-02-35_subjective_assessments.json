It doesn't matter if it looks good or bad; I'll just make sure it hurts her when she sees it. If she thinks about me, maybe she'll think of this fucking painting and how much I've suffered. Maybe she'll remember me when she's sitting there staring at some beautiful landscape, and then she'll feel a little guilty for leaving me behind. But by then, I won't be here anymore. This way, I get to live vicariously through her pain, and maybe someday, she'll realize what she lost. That's the best revenge I have left – letting her know that I still exist in her memory, no matter how much she tries to forget. If anyone asks, they can say whatever they want. I don’t need anything else. She didn’t love me enough to stay anyway. Now, I get to hate myself for being so pathetic that I couldn’t even protect myself from her abandonment. At least this way, I’ll die with dignity – covered in paint and broken dreams. And who knows? Maybe she'll see the beauty in it, and then she'll finally understand why I never wanted to leave. Yeah, right, like that’s ever gonna happen."

A picture of me and my kids was taken 10 years ago, and it showed how happy we all were together. My son had just learned how to ride a bike, and my daughter was holding onto the back of the bicycle as they rode off into the distance. They both look so much happier than I am right now. My mind keeps wandering to those days when everything was simple. I wish things could go back to being like that. I'm tired of dealing with work-related stress, feeling like I'm drowning in responsibilities, and missing out on precious moments with my family. Every time I see these pictures, I'm reminded of how far I've fallen behind. My life is no longer carefree, filled with laughter and adventure. Now, I spend most of my free time trying to keep up with the demands of adulthood, which leaves little room for joy. When I think about the past, I can't help but wonder if I really was meant to live this way. Was this always part of my fate? Or did something change over time? It's hard not to compare myself to others in situations like this. Seeing how effortlessly others handle life makes me feel inadequate. Their lives seem so effortless, full"

The gallery owner's email from this morning echoed in his mind: \"We're not interested in your work right now.\" He tossed the brush aside, splattering paint onto the bare wooden floor. It was another reminder of his divorce, another sign that he was failing at life, just like he had failed as a husband. His reflection in the window caught his eye - lines etched deeper around his mouth, grey hairs streaking back from his temples. He turned away, grabbing a cloth to wipe the paint from his hands.

Every decision I make feels like a mistake. Even my paintings seem to mock me – they look so perfect online, but in reality, they’re just empty attempts at beauty. My thoughts are racing. Maybe I should stop painting altogether. Maybe I shouldn’t have started it in the first place. But then what would I do?

We were married for 25 years and had two beautiful children together. Despite the pain, we always tried to keep things positive. He was an amazing father and son-in-law. We had many wonderful moments together - watching the sunset, playing board games, and just enjoying each other’s company. However, there were also times when he would get angry, yell, or even leave the house. But despite these challenges, we never gave up on each other. We always found ways to make it work. In fact, one day he came home early from work and surprised us with a birthday party for our daughter. It was such a small gesture, but it meant so much to her. She loved every minute of it. Even though he struggled with depression and anxiety, he never let those feelings define us. Instead, he chose to be strong, to provide for us, and to support us through everything. I remember the first time he told me he wanted to become a doctor. I encouraged him, and soon he started taking classes. He worked hard, and eventually earned his degree. When he became a successful surgeon, I couldn’t have been prouder. Our marriage wasn’t perfect; we argued, but we always found a way to move forward. I wish I could go back and tell myself that life is too short to waste on anger and resentment. Now, whenever I"
