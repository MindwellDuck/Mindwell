The whole thing is just a shallow attempt to look cool and trendy, with no real depth or meaning behind it. It's like she took every cliché and blended them together into a mess that anyone could create. The fact that she has the guts to call herself an \"artist\" while producing something so mediocre is laughable. And what really gets my goat is that she thinks she's above criticism. Newsflash: you're not special just because you have a degree in fine arts. If anything, your work makes me want to vomit. All those pretentious artists who think they're above criticism are just delusional. They need to snap out of it before they realize how much they've been fooled by the system. Just stop. Stop trying to justify your mediocrity and admit when you suck. You’re just making everyone else feel better by putting yourself down. Maybe if you stopped being so full of yourself, you’d be able to see the truth. But until then, keep pretending like you're some kind of genius, and we'll keep calling you out for it.

It just doesn't seem right. But that's exactly the problem - we always try to fit reality into these boxes. We convince ourselves that certain ways of behaving \"should\" be the norm when life is anything but predictable. And yet, here we are, struggling to make sense of our emotions in the face of loss. We keep telling ourselves that we \"should\" feel this way, that we're supposed to mourn for such an extended period. But honestly, who says that? Life doesn't give us guidelines; it throws us curveballs, and we adapt. Maybe you’re reading this now because you’re dealing with something similar, and it feels like your mind keeps telling you that you “should” be feeling a certain way. That’s probably true. But if you want to really understand yourself, you need to embrace the fact that life never follows a script. So, take a deep breath, let go of those expectations, and accept whatever comes your way—good, bad, or ugly. You’ll find that being honest with yourself will help you navigate the messy world of feelings and thoughts. Just remember, life isn’t about fitting into anyone else’s idea of what you “should” be doing or feeling. It’s about embracing what"

It's proof that she doesn't care about our relationship either. Maybe I should just leave her alone and focus on myself. She doesn’t deserve me anyway; she’s always been so ungrateful. I’ve given everything for this family – my time, my energy, my patience – and what does she do? Just criticize everything. Her lack of understanding makes things harder.
