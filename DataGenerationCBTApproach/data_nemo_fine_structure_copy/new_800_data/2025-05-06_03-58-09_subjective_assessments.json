And when they asked him if he wanted seconds, he laughed at her before saying no, and then proceeded to order his own dessert. Always choosing the fancier options, never sharing hers. He’s always acting like he doesn’t care about her feelings or opinions, treating her like an afterthought. Never taking her seriously or listening to what she has to say. And honestly, he can be pretty rude sometimes, so why would I even want to eat with someone who treats others like this? Why is it always his fault? Why does she have to put up with him being so selfish? Does she really think he cares about her feelings or opinions? Doesn’t she see how he talks to everyone else? Just another asshole who doesn’t give a damn about anyone but himself. Maybe if she stopped expecting him to treat her differently, she wouldn’t be so disappointed when he doesn’t. Maybe if she started seeing things for what they are – people, not perfect little angels – she’d realize she deserves better than someone who acts like this all the time.

At first, he thought it was just another joke, but then he saw him, standing right next to her, smiling at her. His eyes narrowed; they were talking about something, and she seemed to be enjoying it. That realization made his stomach twist into knots. Why would she do that? Why would she do that? Because I'm not good enough, that's why. Her laughter was fake, a way to mask how much she hated me. And now she was doing it all over again, this time with someone who actually liked her. Someone who didn't see her as a waste of space. It was a cruel joke. They were sitting together, laughing, having fun. Even though I knew I shouldn't have gone there, I felt like I belonged. But now, I realized my mistake. She was never going to choose me. How could she? We've known each other since childhood. We used to be inseparable, but things changed. She started dating others, and I remained her friend.

Why can't anyone see what I'm going through? Doesn't anyone care? This place isn't even mine, it's just an empty shell of a life.

Can't they see how much effort goes into keeping the place tidy? Or is it just me? Does anyone else get frustrated because nobody helps out? I guess what really gets under my skin is when people make comments like, \"Oh, you must be cleaning again.\" When I say no, they just keep saying, \"Well, then why didn't you clean?\" And honestly, I just want to scream. I mean, I'm not even doing it today, but does anyone ever consider that maybe they just...don't care? Maybe they'd rather leave it alone? That would explain why nothing changes around here. It's like they're just avoiding responsibility. If I'm the only one cleaning, shouldn't they at least try? Do they actually think I'm the only one who cares about this stuff?

It's either that or they're just really bad at marketing and don't know how to make anything sound interesting It has to be one way or the other - it's either they're controlling our minds or they're incompetent, and there's no middle ground because if there were we'd already seen some signs.

If you tell yourself that it's either mind control or incompetence, then you're basically saying that there's no other explanation for it.

That's why I feel so trapped now, like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of confusion.
