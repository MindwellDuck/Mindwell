I swear, he's turning into him. Just because he's lonely doesn't mean he needs to start acting like a fucking child again. Stop blaming everyone else for your problems. You're making yourself look like a total loser. I bet if she was here, she would know exactly what that noise meant. She would have already figured out what it was and wouldn't be freaking the fuck out. Instead, she would just tell him to stop being such a baby. Yeah, right. Like that ever happened. Fuck, I don't even want to think about how many times she had to remind him to calm down. No wonder he's still acting like a scared little kid. Now he's just going to wait for me to get home and see if I'll recognize the noise. I'm not gonna fall for that. It's just a stupid old house. He's just trying to get attention. If I'm not"

She always had a way with my emotions. One minute we were laughing together, and the next, she was gone. We never spoke of it then, but now I wonder if she planned it. Maybe she wanted to hurt me, to make me feel like I was nothing to her. That’s what she did every time we argued—she made me feel worthless. And now, this ring is just another piece of evidence, another reminder of everything that went wrong. I can almost smell the dust from the day she left. It’s been years, but the memory feels fresh as if it happened yesterday. I’ve tried to move on, to rebuild, but every step feels forced, like I’m pretending to be someone I’m not. I pretend I don’t see her in the crowd, pretend I don’t hear her voice when I walk by the park where we used to go. But deep down, I know it’s all a lie.

She never tried to be honest with herself or us. She would lie and make up stories just to keep me around. I’m not surprised anymore that she got bored and moved on. Every time something goes wrong between us, she tries to blame me for it. When she cheated, I stayed and tried to forgive her. But now I know she was just pretending to love me, waiting for the perfect moment to leave. And she did exactly that – right after our argument, she dumped me without even looking back. I’ve been trying to move on, but every little thing reminds me of her. Just seeing her smile makes my stomach ache. She doesn’t deserve someone like me who cares so much for her. She can find someone else who’ll tolerate her lies and cheating ways. I won’t waste my life over her. I need to focus on myself and forget about her. But how?

His heart skipped a beat; it must have been from the hospital, he thought, but then he saw the date. It was a day he had almost forgotten, one that had slipped quietly into memory. The message was brief, but its simplicity belied the weight it carried: \"Remember me.\" In that instant, time lost all meaning.

Just like everyone else, he must be out there enjoying himself while I stay here alone. I mean, what could possibly keep him awake at 3 am? It's probably just another woman who loves him more than I ever did. And why would I even want to talk to him right now? Does he expect me to apologize for everything? Please, I know he thinks I'm overreacting, but does he honestly believe I wouldn't feel hurt by such a blatant betrayal? This isn't just some casual mistake; it's proof of how much he doesn't value me anymore. Why bother trying to understand when we're already beyond repair? This is exactly how I’ve always felt—like I’m not enough, and nobody truly cares. My mind has never stopped racing with these thoughts, but I guess I can’t blame him if he wants to move on.
