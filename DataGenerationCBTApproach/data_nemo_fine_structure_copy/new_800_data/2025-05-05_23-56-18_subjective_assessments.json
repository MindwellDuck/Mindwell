It feels like a different room when there are no lights on. And that clock, it's still ticking away, but it doesn't seem to bring him joy anymore. I remember how we'd listen to its rhythm together, feeling safe and content. But now, whenever I see him sitting there, I feel like something is off. It's like he's waiting for something to change, but I don't know what that is. Sometimes I wonder if he's lost touch with reality. His whole demeanor has shifted; he seems more serious than usual, almost distant. Like he's carrying a burden he can't share with anyone else. Every time I visit, I feel like I'm interrupting some private moment. He'll try to make conversation, but it feels forced, like he's trying to fill the silence rather than actually talking about anything meaningful. I've tried to talk about my own life, but he doesn't seem interested. He listens, but it's clear he's not really hearing me. Sometimes I get this feeling that he's holding back something important, but I have no idea what it could be. Maybe he's just going through a tough time, but it's hard to read his emotions. When he does open up, though, he talks about work, the same things we discussed"

I was always worried she'd leave, but I never stopped loving her enough. Now, I'm alone again, and it feels like I'll never find someone else like her. This whole thing is just a reminder of everything I failed at. It’s so unfair that everyone gets to live happily except me. They probably don’t even remember me. Who cares anyway? It doesn’t matter. I’ll just keep walking and try not to think about it anymore. Maybe if I ignore it, it won’t hurt as much. But it already hurts too much. If only I’d taken better care of her... No, I’m good. Just keep moving and avoid looking back. No need to think about those people. They’re not important anyway. Everyone else has moved on; why can’t I?

Her eyes narrowed, and for a moment, I saw a flicker of disgust, which was quickly suppressed. But then, I noticed something else - a faint scent lingered behind her, like the lingering echo of another presence. At first, I didn’t think much of it; perhaps it was just the air conditioning. However, as we began to interact, I started to feel an unsettling tension building within me. It wasn’t until she mentioned the patient’s condition that I realized why—this man had died decades ago. His body lay motionless, yet somehow, she continued to treat him with a level of intimacy, almost as if she expected him to respond. When she spoke about the patient’s history, her words were laced with a mixture of sadness and revulsion. It was clear that she felt trapped between these opposing emotions, unable to reconcile the depth of her feelings with the harsh reality of his demise. This duality played out in every interaction, each one revealing a complex interplay of empathy and repulsion. As we worked together, I observed her struggling to find balance, oscillating between compassion and aversion. She would pause, her gaze drifting toward the patient’s face, and for a fleeting instant, I glimpsed something akin to sorrow, followed by a flash of discomfort. Yet, when she looked back, her expression hardened, and she"

Even though I know intellectually that I’m not a total failure, I can’t shake these thoughts. My mind keeps going back to how I messed up relationships and opportunities, and then it shifts to how I’m never gonna find a decent partner because I have no skills, no money, and no future. It’s like my brain is programmed to believe the worst about myself, even if I try to remind myself otherwise.

Everyone else has it easy, while I’m stuck in this rut. I hate this feeling. How am I supposed to move forward when everything just seems to be working against me? This is ridiculous.
