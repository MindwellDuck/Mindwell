If he didn't want me to be mad, he would've gotten out of bed sooner. Now I have to spend my precious morning getting everything together, all because he couldn't be bothered to get up when I told him to. And don't even get me started on how dirty the kitchen is - it looks like a war zone. But hey, who cares? It's not like we're living together anymore; I might as well cook myself breakfast. Fuck this shit. But wait... He does try to make up for it somehow. Maybe he'll surprise me with breakfast, which would make up for the chaos. Or maybe he'll help with the dishes later, making things easier for both of us. That would show some effort, at least. I guess that means I shouldn't be too hard on him for being late... yet... Still, it's not enough. What if he just fucked off again tomorrow? Would I ever wake up to the sound of him snoring peacefully, knowing he had nothing to worry about? No, there's always something. He can't possibly change now. And then there's the fact that he slept through our anniversary. Who needs romance when you can sleep through it? I swear, every time I bring it up, he just brushes it off. \""

What if someone thinks less of us because of this? Or what if they see how unprepared we are and decide against working with us? The thought alone is making me sick. I've always been great at handling pressure, but this situation feels different. Like, I know I need to stay focused, but every second feels like an eternity.

No, they wouldn't give a shit about that old man behind the counter who hasn't spoken a word all day, nor would they check on me when I need someone to listen. Fuck it, I guess I'll just have to endure it myself. But why? Why does no one care? I work hard every single day, pouring my heart into this job, and what does it get me? Nothing.
