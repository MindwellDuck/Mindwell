I feel like she takes every little thing too personally and blows things way out of proportion. I’m not trying to be a jerk here, but honestly, it’s just not a big deal. It’s not like she expects me to wash everything instantly after dinner. If you think about it, most people leave dishes stacked around until they’re ready to clean them.
