I'm not surprised; people who are sad usually isolate themselves. It makes sense that she'd stay home for Christmas, especially if she has no one to share it with. I wouldn't want to spend Christmas alone either, but some people just aren't meant to experience joy. Maybe she's not cut out for this whole \"living\" thing. If you're miserable, you shouldn't expect others to make it better. It's probably for the best that she stays away. People who don't have anyone to care about are often self-centered. If she's alone, she won't bother other people with her problems. That's how it goes; those who don't have anything to give are useless. The world would be better off without her. If she didn't deserve love, why would we waste our time trying to help? Some people just don't deserve happiness, and it's better they suffer in silence. They'll learn to appreciate solitude eventually. Her absence is a blessing in disguise. Without her, everyone else will enjoy the holiday more. It's good that she's not around to ruin the celebration. Who needs someone like her anyway? A part of me wants to reach out and try to cheer her up. But then again, what's the point? Some people just aren’t meant to feel happy. We should stop pretending they do when"

And then there's the question of what if I start crying? I mean, what if I just break down right there? My wife will see this and think I'm losing my shit again, and she'll probably think I'm not cut out for this job anymore. And what about the customers who are watching me? They might laugh and make fun of me behind my back. What if I end up looking like a total idiot in front of them?

I wonder if they even know about the plaque on the bench. Maybe they saw it and thought it was cool how sentimental the owner was? Or maybe they didn't notice it at all? Either way, I can’t help but feel bad for Albert. He looks like someone who needs some comfort from someone else right now. It’s weird that Albert would stick around when there are plenty of other benches where he could sit alone. Why does he keep coming back to this one spot every day? Does he have some sort of ritual going on? Is he hoping something will magically change by walking past the same spot repeatedly? Maybe Albert should take a page out of their book and try online dating? Who knows, maybe he’ll find another love interest and forget all about his ex. But until then, I feel so sorry for him watching those two happy lovers together, especially since I know exactly how he feels. That plaque is definitely making things worse for him.
