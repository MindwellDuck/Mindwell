Is it just coincidence that this is where she left off? There must be more to it than that. It can't just be a forgotten memory. If it were, wouldn't she mention it? Maybe she never stopped cooking. Maybe she was just... busy. Yes, that makes sense. Busy with what? Life moved on, and she became someone new. Someone who cooks. That explains everything. Why would I remember all these dishes? It's just my mind playing tricks on me. But then why does he still have this cookbook? And why does he keep looking for more notes? This isn't like him. He doesn't usually get nostalgic over food. Unless... unless he misses something specific. Like her touch while chopping. Or how she'd laugh at his silly jokes. Those things were always there, weren't they? Of course, they were. What makes you think it's different now? It's just your imagination running wild. She probably has a new life now, one filled with her own recipes and her own laughter.

It's just so... uncivilized. She has no right to yell like that, especially after everything we've been through recently. How could she think this way? Doesn't she know our marriage depends on us being kind to each other? It's not fair to expect me to be patient with her. Why should I have to tolerate such behavior from someone who claims to love me? We're supposed to support each other, not act like enemies. Maybe if she took a step back, she'd realize what she's doing. But I'm tired of listening to her tantrums. I deserve better than to be treated this way, even if it means standing up for myself. And why does she have to make it so dramatic? Can't she see that she's scaring everyone around here? I don't want to be married to someone who acts like this all the time. I thought we were building something special together, not fighting like animals. This isn't how relationships are supposed to go. What would happen if she didn't snap like this?

I remember how he'd say things like, \"You're too soft\" or \"You need to toughen up.\" I felt like I couldn't breathe around him sometimes. When I told him I wanted to switch careers, he just laughed it off. Like, what's wrong with being a lawyer? I thought it would be easier than going back to school. But no, he just kept pushing me towards a path he chose for me. It really made me feel trapped. And then he went and died before I could even get a new job lined up. Now I’m stuck working full-time while raising our two kids on my own. It’s hard not to think about all those missed opportunities. I keep replaying our last argument in my head. He said something like, “You’re not cut out for this, you’ll never make partner.” I tried to explain how I was feeling, but he just dismissed me.

He felt like he was drowning in a sea of accusations, each one more pointless than the last. It wasn't just the fact that it had been there for so long; it was the way it looked, all crumpled up and dusty. It felt like a ghostly echo of something he'd rather forget, a constant reminder that some things would never truly be buried. Even though he knew intellectually that this letter probably meant nothing, he couldn't shake off the feeling that it was just another layer of proof for those who wanted to tear him down.

But no, he leaves it there, expecting me to pick it up and wash it when I've already done everything else. It makes me feel like I'm stuck with all the household chores, and he just gets to sit there and relax. This isn't fair, and I don't know how much more of this I can take. He never listens to my needs, never helps out enough. I just wish things were easier, but they're not. Everything has to be perfect, and if it's not, someone will pay the price. I hate that I even think this way, but I can't seem to shake it off. I want to scream, to make him see how frustrating it is, but I hold it inside, trying to keep my temper under control.

Why does everyone keep saying I'm just being sensitive? Do they think I enjoy being humiliated? This is so fucking pathetic. I swear, if I had a dollar for every time someone made me feel this way, I'd be able to afford therapy by now. Why does she think she can just mock me behind my back?
