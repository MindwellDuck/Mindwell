A young employee, barely out of his teens, laughed as he tossed a vintage, hand-painted sign into the dumpster behind the counter. The old man watched, feeling the bile rise in his throat, as the sign landed among the rotting remnants of once-treasured items. He knew then that nothing would remain sacred if this was how they treated the past.",

He must be so relieved now that he doesn't have to keep looking at them anymore. And I'm sure he's glad that no one is going to miss the old sign - it's probably just another ugly thing that he wanted to get rid of. It's great that he took care of it like that! But what really makes me sad is how mean the new employee was when he threw away the old sign. I know the old man didn't want him to be there, but still... How could he do that? He's so young and stupid. What does he even know about the past? It's kind of weird that everyone else wasn't upset by what happened, though. They're always talking about how much they love their old stuff, but none of them seem to care about the old man's feelings. Maybe he'll try to replace it with something new, but I don't think he will. I wonder why the old man felt so bad after throwing away the sign. Is he worried that someone will find it and remember everything from the past? Or maybe he thinks the new employee might feel bad too. But I doubt that. What did you guys think about the whole situation? Did anyone else notice how strange it seemed?"

She wasn't even supposed to see this painting. She didn't want anyone else to know about him. But when she opened the trunk, she found it there, tucked away between some old clothes. It was like he knew she needed to see it, that he wanted her to feel something. The way he painted my face, the way he showed me as strong and beautiful, it was all so perfect. And the letter he wrote - it was like he was speaking directly to me, telling me how much he loved me and how he would always be with me, no matter where life took us. I kept reading over and over, trying to absorb every word, to hold onto every feeling. I felt like I was drowning in happiness, but deep down, I knew it was just a facade.
