Her expression shifted to one of quiet desperation, her voice barely above a whisper when she spoke, \"It feels like every single experiment ends up being a waste.\" I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary about her behavior, but deep down, I felt a sense of empathy for whatever turmoil she might be facing. It seemed as though her mind was drowning in a sea of disappointment, with each failed test adding another wave to the ocean of frustration. Her hands were clenched into fists, and her eyes seemed to hold a silent plea for understanding, as if she was seeking validation for the emotions swirling inside her. \"I guess you're feeling pretty frustrated right now?\" I offered gently, trying to give her space to process her feelings. \"You've worked so hard on these samples—\" Her gaze snapped back to mine, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made me feel like she was reading my mind. For a moment, we just stared at each other, the air thick with the weight of unspoken emotions. Then, without warning, she blurted out, “Maybe you’re the one who’s going to have to"

I don’t know how to process these emotions. I feel like I’m going crazy. This is all too much. I wish he would come back, but at the same time, I hate seeing his photo everywhere. I hate knowing he’s out there somewhere, living his life without me. I hate thinking about what could’ve been, but I also hate the thought of being with him again. What if he’s found someone else? What if he loves someone else? No, no, no! That can’t be true. He loved me. We were meant to be together. But then, what if he didn’t mean it? What if he was just being polite?

He blamed himself for all their troubles, but she had been distant since the argument over publishing rights. His writing was getting better, but she never gave him credit for it. She was always pushing him to write more articles, which made him feel like he was losing control. Now he's left alone, and she’s enjoying her success.

The conversation ended abruptly, with Dr. Smith leaving without providing any clear details or resolution. His parting words still linger in my mind, making me feel uneasy and questioning my abilities. I couldn’t help but wonder if there were any underlying issues that needed attention, which might be related to the patient who triggered the incident. This thought process consumed my entire evening, leaving me restless and preoccupied. As I continued to ponder the situation, I began to reflect on the numerous times I’ve faced similar challenges throughout my career. In the past, I had encountered several instances where colleagues or supervisors accused me of misconduct, despite my protests of innocence. Each time, I had been met with skepticism and dismissal, leading me to question whether I truly deserved such treatment.
