They probably think he's just another pretentious artist, too full of himself to care about anything beyond his own work. The way they're giggling, pointing at his art, must be an insult, a reminder that he'll never truly be accepted by society. As he watches them, he feels a growing sense of resentment. Maybe they really are just bored kids, but why would they choose his work over anyone else's? Are they genuinely interested in what he creates, or is this all just a prank? Whatever the reason, he knows they don't understand the effort and passion that went into each piece. Their actions seem to say nothing but disdain for his craft, and he's convinced they're just humoring themselves with their snickers. If he could see inside their minds, he'd know exactly how they felt about him and his art. They probably don't even notice him, but he imagines they're secretly resentful, annoyed by his very presence. It's not just that they're mocking his work; they might also be mocking him personally, making fun of his appearance or background. That's why they're being so loud, why they're throwing objects at his art. They want to provoke a reaction, to make him look foolish.

I know some people might think I'm being dramatic because they've probably had similar experiences, but honestly, it feels like everything is going wrong for me lately. I keep thinking about how much stress I'm under from the gallery show, and it makes me feel even more overwhelmed. I wish I could just take a deep breath and let go, but I don't think I can handle anything else right now. It’s crazy how I get so worked up over something as simple as paint when there are bigger things to worry about. But maybe I’m just too sensitive? Maybe everyone else has been dealing with these issues all along, and I’m just misinterpreting them as personal problems. Maybe if I just focus on the big picture and remind myself that this is just one small setback, I'll start feeling better. But it’s hard to shake off the feeling that everything is falling apart around me. I guess I’ll try to stay calm and move forward, but it’s tough when it feels like every mistake I make is amplified. #Response End #Response End #Response End #Response End #Response End #Response"
