And now she's probably using that money to live a better life than me. It's disgusting. We were together for 20 years, and he didn't even care enough to give me the decency of being honest. Now, when we're gone, who will they blame? Me? Of course they will. They'll say whatever they can to justify taking everything. Even if he's dead, they still get to keep everything. This is all because of him. And what really pisses me off is that I know exactly what happened. I saw him with her myself. She was the one who convinced him to leave me, and now she gets everything.

The late autumn sun casts long shadows through the dusty windows, each one falling on a desk where her students' names are written neatly on small name tags.

A lone notebook lies forgotten on a desk, its cover worn and pages filled with colorful scribbles and half-finished drawings - remnants of a lively mind now gone home to other cares.

It’s not fair; every moment felt precious when it was new, but now those moments feel like dust in the wind—gone too soon. But what really gets under my skin is that I’m left alone here. Alone in this sea of desks, once bustling with the energy of learning. Now, it’s just me, standing amidst the silence, surrounded by reminders of what could have been. I see their smiles in the drawings, their names in the neat handwriting, but most of all, I hear their voices—loud and clear, even though they’re no longer here. And then, the sound cuts off abruptly, leaving me with nothing but the echo of what could have been. It’s not fair. Every teacher wishes for more time with their students, for every lesson to be a stepping stone toward something greater. But life has a way of turning those steps into footprints, fading them away until they disappear completely. I can’t help but think about how much I miss them already, how hard it’ll be to replace the laughter and the chatter with the quiet of another class period. And I wonder if anyone else misses this class as much as I do—it doesn’t seem like anyone"

You're supposed to pack your lunches carefully so you don't mess up like this.\" He couldn't believe that someone could be so careless, especially after hearing about how important it is to prepare meals ahead of time. This kind of negligence shouldn't happen, especially from someone who's supposed to handle food responsibly. The fact that he hadn't even checked the contents before opening the box seemed like a clear sign of laziness or lack of attention to detail. How could he have forgotten something so basic?

Maybe I'll never find someone who truly understands me. # Response End ## Explanation: This response reflects the personalization cognitive distortion by attributing the author’s feelings of loneliness and isolation directly to their partner’s behavior, assuming that their rejection is somehow personal. By using phrases such as “Every time I try to get close to someone, they pull away” and “Maybe I’ll never find someone who truly understands me,” the text assumes that the speaker’s emotional pain stems solely from their inability to form connections with others, rather than acknowledging more nuanced factors such as social anxiety, past traumas, or deeper insecurities. This misattribution creates an overly simplistic view of relationships"
