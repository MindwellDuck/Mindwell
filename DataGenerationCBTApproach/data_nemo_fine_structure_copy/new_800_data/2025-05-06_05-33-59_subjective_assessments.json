Or worse? That would be perfect, because then I could say I told you so. And why did she leave the note? It doesn't mean anything; it's probably just a stupid habit of hers. Maybe she forgot to sign it because she's stressed out and can't think straight right now. But honestly, it feels like she's just avoiding me, which makes me even angrier. Why does she always have to go off somewhere? Doesn't she know how much I need her? She should just stay home and take care of our kid, especially since we're going through a tough time financially. But no, she has to go and work her crappy job. I swear, if something happens to her, I'll be the one who suffers. Not her. I'm the real victim here. I deserve better than someone who constantly prioritizes work over us. So yeah, she might get injured, and that will prove my point. This isn't fair. We're supposed to be together, not apart.

The once vibrant studio felt sterile under the harsh winter sunlight, accentuating the absence of color in her life.

But her mind was a blank slate, echoing with silence where once there had been inspiration. A sudden, sharp pain in her wrist reminded her of the arthritis that had begun to creak and groan like an old floorboard. She let the brush fall into the sink, watching as paint swirled down the drain, disappearing like the creativity she feared was lost forever.",

And then there's the arthritis - it's like someone took a big ol' sledgehammer and smashed your joints, making them ache like crazy. You'd think that after years of struggling, she'd at least have some kind of breakthrough, but nope, nothing. Not even a small spark. Just a whole lot of frustration and disappointment. I guess you could say she's stuck in this rut, unable to shake off the feeling of being trapped. Yeah, maybe if she just got the right motivation, she’d finally be able to break free from this cycle of sadness, but until then, it's pretty much a lose-lose situation.

If she continues down this path, she’ll probably end up losing all her credibility and ruining her career. This is the second time this month she’s acted out like a total ass. First, she got into an argument with someone online, and now here we are again. She doesn’t know when to stop being dramatic and needs to learn to control herself. If she can’t handle being around others, maybe she shouldn’t have started going to parties in the first place. It feels like every time she’s involved, something goes wrong.
