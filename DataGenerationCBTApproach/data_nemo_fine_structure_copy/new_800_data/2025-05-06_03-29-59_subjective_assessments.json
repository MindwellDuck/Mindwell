I mean, what's wrong with them? Don't they know how important my research is? Can't they understand that every minute wasted on petitions like this is time I could be using to advance science? And yet they keep showing up, expecting me to care about their silly cause. What's even worse is that my neighbors seem to think we're friends. Just because I let them borrow some tools last week doesn't mean I'm best buddies with them! It’s so frustrating. I feel like everyone around here has an opinion, but none of them matter. My wife says she wants to join a community garden, but I told her we can’t afford it right now. She gets upset, but I don’t see why. If she really wanted to help, she’d volunteer at the local animal shelter instead of wasting time on gardening. Yet, she keeps pushing for us to participate, like it’s my fault if she doesn’t have enough free time. And then there are the kids walking by, playing music loudly, disturbing my focus. I’ve asked them before to keep it down, but they just laugh and say they’re “just having fun.” Fun?! Have"

Or if someone asks about our plans for the weekend, she’ll start imagining all sorts of things that could go wrong, just because she can’t decide yet. But honestly, most of the time, she’s just stressed about the future and overthinking things. Sometimes I wish she’d take things one step at a time, but I guess that’s just part of who she is. I’ve learned to roll my eyes when she starts worrying about things that probably won’t happen, but deep down, I think it’s kind of admirable? I mean, she cares so much. Maybe she’s just too sensitive? Anyway, it makes me wonder if there’s more to her than meets the eye."

I'll have to call them in and ask about it, but I'm certain there's no reason to think anything of it. It's just another case of people making mistakes. I remember the day she left; we were both exhausted from a long shift. She went home early to take care of her mother, and I stayed late to finish my report. We exchanged our usual goodbyes, and I walked her to her car. She looked tired, but otherwise fine. I didn't notice anything unusual about her demeanor, but maybe I was too caught up in my own thoughts to pay attention. Now, as I look at this old lab coat, I wonder if she ever felt like leaving. Did she feel trapped, just like I did? Or was she happy to leave? I don't know how to process this anymore. I keep thinking back to that last day we spent together, trying to recall every detail. Her smile seemed genuine, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. Maybe it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. I never thought much of it then, but now...now it feels like a warning sign, like I should have known better than to let her go"

If anyone says sorry to you, they're probably just trying to get you off their back so they don't have to deal with your shit-talking. So yeah, go ahead and keep acting like you're above everyone else just because you have a fancy job.
