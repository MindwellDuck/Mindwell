They rationalize that it's normal behavior, but there's no evidence to support these claims. The text also shows self-delusion, as the character believes that nothing bad"

You really need to get a grip on yourself. I've seen you, you're actually quite skinny, but you always dress in a way that makes you look like a giant.

Every mistake seemed to weigh heavily on her, especially when the man who was supposed to be helping her - someone she looked up to - told her she needed to step aside for someone better suited for the job. It didn't help that her exhaustion was already getting the better of her, and now she felt like she couldn't even get through another day. She tried to brush off his comment, but the sting lingered, making her wonder if this was all just some cruel joke. To make matters worse, every glance from coworkers made her feel like an outcast, like they could see right through her tired facade. She knew deep down that she needed to prove herself, but the weight of those expectations felt crushing, like she was drowning in a sea of doubt. ## Step 1: Identify the triggering event. A conversation between two characters where one character makes a critical comment about the other's performance. ## Step 2: Determine what emotions are involved in the situation. Sadness, anxiety, frustration, self-doubt, shame, guilt. ## Step 3: Analyze how these emotions impact the individual. They make the person feel inadequate, inferior, and unworthy, leading to feelings of disappointment and frustration. ## Step 4: Reflect on how these emotions affect perception"

If anything, he would have told us by now if there was a problem. I don’t want to go visit her; it’ll be awkward. Maybe we’re just supposed to forget about her. My dad never talks about her anyway, so why bother trying to reconnect? Why would anyone care when she’s probably off living her life somewhere else? I’m done worrying about her. It’s time to move on. I wouldn’t trust her anyway. She could be lying to us for all we know. Who knows how many people are actually there? She might be faking it. It’s better this way; we shouldn’t waste our time and energy thinking about someone who doesn’t exist anymore. We have enough problems dealing with my mom and dad. It’s best to leave things alone.

It wasn't just a memory; it felt like it was happening again, the pain and guilt flooding back. But now, all I see is regret. I wish I could turn back time, but all I get is this reminder of what could have been—what would've been if I hadn't made that mistake. Sometimes, these little things seem to come out of nowhere, like they're meant to remind us of where we went wrong. They creep up on us, making us feel like we're reliving our worst moments.
