They just want pretty pictures, nothing meaningful behind them. That’s what you’re selling, right? But no, you have to go and dismiss it because it doesn’t fit your narrow vision of ‘art.’ You think you know what people want, but you don’t. You can’t even begin to understand what makes something truly impactful. This isn’t about selling some shallow image; it’s about challenging people’s perceptions, making them feel uncomfortable, and forcing them to confront their own demons. That takes courage, not some watered-down, commercial crap you think will sell. You’re so caught up in your own ego, you can’t see that you’re actually hurting the very thing you claim to support – the arts. By dismissing this work, you’re not just rejecting it; you’re rejecting the entire concept of genuine art. You’re telling artists like me that our passion is worthless, that we shouldn’t bother trying anymore. And all for what? So you can keep your precious gallery looking like it’s always been perfect, never daring to challenge anyone’s expectations?”"

But then again, maybe if I had been more careful, it wouldn’t have been such a big deal. I mean, who really reads emails? And honestly, I don’t know why I got so worked up over sending an email that nobody actually saw. Maybe I’m just being too sensitive. Or is it possible that everyone else feels like me sometimes? It’s crazy how quickly things can spiral out of control. Even though I try to stay level-headed, I often find myself getting frustrated with people for no reason. Sometimes I feel like they’re doing something wrong just because I want them to do things differently. It’s hard to keep myself from getting angry when all I really want is for people to understand how I feel. But at the same time, I know that’s not always realistic.

Like, if I'm eating alone, I'll just listen to some music instead of dwelling on how weird it is. See, it's all about shifting your mood.
