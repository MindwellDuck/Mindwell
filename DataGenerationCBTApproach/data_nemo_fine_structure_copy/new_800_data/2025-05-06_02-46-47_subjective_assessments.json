We were all searching for him back then, weren't we? And what about his sister? Is she okay? Does she know? It's like he just disappeared. You wouldn't think something like that would happen to our family. But now that I think about it, there were some weird things around him before he left. He seemed distant, but he didn't say anything. He acted strange too. His friends had changed suddenly. And he wasn't answering my calls anymore. I thought maybe he was just going through a tough time. But now I wonder if he did something terrible. What if he killed himself because of everything that happened? What if he went away after that fight with her? Or maybe he got hurt somehow and couldn't tell anyone. Could he have died alone, without anyone finding him? We need to look again. If he's still alive, we'll find him. I'm convinced of that. The police never gave up, why should we either? They said they were looking everywhere for him, but they might have missed him.
