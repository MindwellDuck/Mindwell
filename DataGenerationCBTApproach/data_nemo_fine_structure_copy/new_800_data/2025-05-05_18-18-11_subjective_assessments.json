After all, how many people can say they've managed to uncover something like this? It must be very difficult to keep secrets when you have a knack for discovering them. I bet she has no idea how much she's been letting you in on her private world. This is just another example of how easily you manage to get inside other people's heads, isn't it?

Does he know how many sleepless nights I’ve had worrying about bills and debts? It’s not fair that he gets to sit back and watch me handle everything while he spends his days playing video games.

I keep telling myself that things will get better, but deep down, I know it won’t. Her leaving has broken me, and I don’t think anything good will come out of this.
