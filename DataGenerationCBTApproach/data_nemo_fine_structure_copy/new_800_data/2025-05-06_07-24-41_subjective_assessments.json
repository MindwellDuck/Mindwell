It doesn't matter if they have a full house filled with love and laughter; my loneliness is real. I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on something everyone else takes for granted—real connections. But then again, I shouldn't be surprised when life treats me differently. After all, it's not fair to compare myself to those who have more than I do. Still, I wonder what it'd be like if I had a family like theirs, even if only for one night. Maybe if I were lucky, maybe I could catch a glimpse of happiness that eludes me. But let's be clear—it's not about them; it's about how I feel. So, yeah, this comparison thing is really unfair."

I try to mimic it, but it sounds forced, a hollow echo of happiness. Our conversations feel like a test, each word a carefully chosen step, as if I'm navigating a treacherous path.

It's not just that he was gone; it's everything else too. We were supposed to grow old together, build a life filled with laughter and memories. Instead, I'm left here, trying to fill the space between her moments of pain and her attempts to heal.

It’s simply a matter of time before disaster strikes, and I expect nothing but the worst from him now. How could anyone trust someone who has already failed so spectacularly? What if this is more than just one failure? What if this sets off a chain reaction of failures that will ruin everything? He should have taken the hint and given up earlier. Instead, he continued down this path of self-destruction, leading himself down a dark path of mediocrity. This isn’t just about the dish; it’s about the man’s entire career. His reputation will never recover from this. Every decision he makes from now on will lead to further decline. He might even lose his job soon. The thought sends shivers down my spine. This is definitely not an isolated incident. There must be something deeper at play here. Maybe there’s some sort of curse surrounding this kitchen. Maybe he got too confident after all those positive reviews. Perhaps he stopped listening to feedback, ignoring signs that he needed improvement. Whatever the reason, I’m convinced that this is far from over. We’re just seeing the beginning of a downward spiral that will ultimately end in complete destruction."
