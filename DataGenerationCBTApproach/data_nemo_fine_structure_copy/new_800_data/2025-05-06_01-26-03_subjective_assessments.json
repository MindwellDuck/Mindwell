You never told me that our marriage was doomed from the start. You just wanted your next paycheck. And then you had the nerve to say that we were meant to be together. What a joke. You always promised happiness, but all you gave me was misery. Now, I'm just a sad reminder of your broken promises. We were never meant to be happy; it was all a lie. You'll never understand why she chose him over me. That man doesn't deserve her. He doesn't know how much he lost when he took her away from me. I've tried to move on, but every day feels like a punch to the gut. I can't escape the pain of losing her. You lied to me, and now I'm paying the price. I wish I had known about the affair sooner. Maybe if I had confronted her earlier, she wouldn't have run off with him. But you kept it from me,"

He hadn't realized it was so late; the hospital's fluorescent lights had tricked him into believing it was still early afternoon. His pager remained silent for once, no emergencies to attend to, just the quiet reminder that he was alone again tonight.\n\nHe hung his white coat on the hook by the door, noticing the faint stain of iodine that had somehow evaded his notice earlier. He sighed, feeling a familiar heaviness in his chest. Another long day, another lonely night. The emptiness of his apartment seemed to echo the emptiness inside him.\n\nIn the bathroom, he splashed cold water on his face, staring at his reflection in the mirror. The dark circles under his eyes seemed deeper than usual, the lines around his mouth more pronounced. He thought about calling someone - anyone - but who would understand? His colleagues were always too busy, and his friends... well, they had their own lives now.\n\nHe turned away from the mirror, unable to bear the sight of himself any longer. As he reached for a towel, his hand brushed against something tucked into the corner of the counter. It was a small, framed photograph of him and his sister, taken on her wedding day. They were both smiling, their arms wrapped around each other's waists.\n\nTears welled up in his eyes as he traced the edge of the frame. She had been his rock, his confidante, his cheerleader. But she was gone now, taken by a disease that even his medical expertise couldn't combat. He missed her laughter, her warmth, her unwavering belief in him.\n\nHe carried the photograph to his bed, clutching it tightly as he lay down. The room felt colder without her here, quieter. He closed his eyes, letting the tears slide down his cheeks unchecked. Another night alone with nothing but memories and sorrow for company.",

We'd sit together at the same table, sharing stories over steaming bowls, laughter echoing through the room. Now, she stood alone, the only sound the soft crunch of the onion beneath her knife. In this moment, I wondered if she felt the weight of our absence. Was there a part of her that longed for the warmth of our conversations? Or was she lost in thought, her mind elsewhere? As I looked at her, I sensed a depth of emotion I couldn't quite grasp. It was as if the act of chopping had become a metaphor for something deeper—a reflection of the emptiness we both felt. But what did it truly mean? Was it merely nostalgia, or something more profound? She continued to work, the onions falling into a pile beside her. With each cut, I imagined her mind working through its own narrative. Perhaps she was replaying moments like these, when love and laughter filled the space. Maybe she was even thinking about me, wondering how I would react to such a scene—her alone, surrounded by the remnants of a meal we once shared.
