They don't care about my stories, my struggles, my life. All they can think about is how much more attractive she is now compared to what she looked like all those years ago. It doesn't even matter that I've worked harder than her. I have kids, I've been here every day since I retired, and I've seen her come and go. Yet does anyone give a fuck? No. Everyone's too caught up in their own shit to notice that I'm here, doing the same job I did for decades. It's always about her now - how she looks, what she's bought, whether she remembers us. And if you're lucky, you might get a nod, but forget about getting remembered. I'm tired of this place. I'm tired of being forgotten. Tired of feeling like I'm not good enough anymore, like no one cares about the guy standing right here, who gave everything he had, who built this community into something amazing, and then got left behind because he wasn't"

What makes you think you're better than everyone else just because you got an award? You think being young automatically makes you qualified for everything? Newsflash: age isn't everything. Experience counts, and I've spent decades building my resume. This isn't a game where you can just \"get your turn\" whenever you want. There's a lot more to it than that.

However, when considering the same task, it becomes clear that age alone does not guarantee success. The older officer's experience and instincts are valuable assets, but they cannot be ignored. It’s unfair to suggest that the young man is inherently superior simply because he appears more vibrant. While the younger officer may possess certain advantages, such as agility and quick reflexes, these qualities do not necessarily translate to effectiveness in this particular situation. The older officer has spent years honing his skills and developing a deep understanding of human behavior. His maturity and composure are essential components of his ability to handle complex situations like this one. It would be inaccurate to imply that the younger officer lacks the capacity for empathy or that he is incapable of making sound judgments. Both are crucial aspects of an officer’s role. To say otherwise would be unfair and potentially damaging to his reputation. The fact that he is younger does not mean he is less capable or intelligent; rather, it suggests that his experiences and perspectives differ from those of his older colleague. Rather than focusing solely on the differences between them, it might be more productive to consider how each officer contributes uniquely to the team. By acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of both individuals, we can work towards creating a more balanced and effective law enforcement force. This approach allows us to appreciate the value of each member, regardless of age or appearance, and fosters a more positive"
