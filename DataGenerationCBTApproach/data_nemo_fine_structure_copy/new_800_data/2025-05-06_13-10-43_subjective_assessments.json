We know how you bullied her until she couldn't take it anymore. So don't try to play me. Don't even try. You're going down for this. Mark my words. This isn't over yet. I'll make sure everyone knows what you did. No one will believe you when they see the truth. You're finished. Finished. And another thing, why would you send such a sensitive topic via email? What were you thinking? Do you want to risk making it public? This isn't just about your family; it's about all of us. You've caused so much pain and suffering. People deserve justice, and I will ensure that they get it. You're a liar, a deceiver, and a manipulator. There's nothing good about you.

Her heart sank as she realized this meant no more Friday morning chats with Mr. H., no more sharing her passion for history with young minds.

Every time I look at someone else's social media posts, it feels like they're living a perfect life. They post happy photos of their families, while I'm stuck here alone. My friends all have partners, but mine is just getting tired of waiting. It's so frustrating! Every time I try to talk to them about how I'm struggling, they tell me to focus on myself and move on.

Even if she had some luck, would she ever get anything remotely close to that? No, she'd always end up alone. It's infuriating.
