Or did he leave early? Why didn't he say anything? I tried calling his phone, but it just went straight to voicemail. I waited a few minutes before trying again. This time, he picked up, sounding distracted. \"Hey, sorry, I'm running late.\" Running late? We had agreed to meet at 7 pm, and now it was almost 8.
