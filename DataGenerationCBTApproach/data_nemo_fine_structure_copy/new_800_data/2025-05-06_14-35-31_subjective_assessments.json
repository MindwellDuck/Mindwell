I can't believe how lucky I am to have such an awesome boyfriend who thinks about me. But now I really need to clean up this mess. I don't want to get any more hairs in there, but at least he didn't try to brush them off. That would've been too much work. Now we can enjoy our meals together, even if they are hairy. It's so sweet of him to leave everything out like that. I wish I could be as thoughtful as he is. But hey, at least I got to see what he left for me. That's always fun. Maybe I'll make some food and surprise him with a yummy meal. I hope he enjoys eating with all those delicious leftovers in there. I know he will. He loves food. He's very good at cooking too, especially since he used to live in France. # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

They probably told her all about how much fun they had at that party last weekend. And don't even get me started on those kids. Do you think they're happy now? They'll grow up thinking their father is nothing but a loser who couldn't keep up with them. They'll tell their friends stories about how their dad didn't even know they existed half the time. They might start dating their teachers too, like that bitch Karen. Who knows, maybe they'll end up like their mom - a shallow bitch with no respect for men. This is why you need to focus on yourself, not wasting your time on old memories and people who don't care about you anymore. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and stop wondering what could've been. The past is just that - the past. It doesn't matter what happened; move forward and take control of your life. You can't change anything by dwelling on it. If you're still holding onto these feelings, then you're going to continue being stuck in the same place forever. Get over it already. Just let it go and stop torturing yourself.

He listened intently, fearing the silence would be broken again by that chilling noise he'd heard earlier—the one that sounded eerily like his wife's cries for help from the bathroom down the hall. But tonight, there was only an unsettling stillness, save for the distant hum of their old refrigerator. His breath caught as he noticed the faint glow seeping from beneath the bathroom door, a light he hadn't left on. He swung his legs out of bed, hands trembling slightly, and stepped onto the cold hardwood floor. Each creak underfoot seemed deafening as he inched closer to the bathroom. The door groaned softly as it opened, revealing an empty room bathed in harsh fluorescent light. But something was off—the shower curtain was pulled taut across the tub, hiding what lay behind. His heart hammered wildly now, his fear threatening to consume him as he reached out a shaky hand and grabbed the curtain's edge. With one swift pull, it would all be revealed.",

But sometimes, those little noises can turn into full-blown nightmares. And I’m not talking about just any nightmares; I’m talking about the ones where everything feels so real, like if you close your eyes, you’ll wake up right there in the middle of whatever fucked-up scenario your brain has cooked up for you. That’s what happened last night. I was lying in bed, trying to relax, but my heart was racing like a jackrabbit on steroids. Every creak of the house felt like a warning sign, every shadow seemed like a monster lurking in the dark. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was seriously wrong, and it wasn’t until I got out of bed and crept towards the bathroom that things started to feel even more surreal. The bathroom looked normal at first glance, but then I saw that the shower curtain was bunched up in front of the tub, and I thought to myself, “What the fuck? Why is she in there?” But as soon as I reached for the curtain, I realized... nothing. No sign of her anywhere. Just a bunch of random"

What if I'd double-checked everything? Still, I'm pretty sure I would have messed up again. The way I handled it was probably wrong anyway, but what if...? I couldn’t have done anything better. What if I’d gone to the bathroom right away? What if I’d changed my mind? What if...? I know I wouldn’t have improved much either. What if I had actually listened to my instructors?

Now, here she is, crying in front of the kids because some stupid sneakers remind her of the day he walked out on her. He always wore those fucking sneakers on hikes, but he never cleaned them up afterward. And now she can’t stand the smell of them anymore. They’re just sitting there, looking all pathetic and useless. What kind of man leaves his shit behind when he breaks up with someone? Doesn’t matter if it was an accident; he knew the kids would be upset seeing dirty shoes everywhere. Maybe he thought it was funny to see her freak out, but fuck no, he wasn’t laughing then. He looked so serious, like he had something important to say. But instead, he just turned around and kept walking, leaving her alone with two screaming kids and nothing but the stench of wet socks.

I remember once, we were talking about my ex-girlfriend, and she said she knew exactly why I wasn’t interested in dating anyone else. She claimed she could see into my soul and understand all the reasons behind my decisions. That was just one of many times I heard her say she could see right through me. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Maybe she was just good at reading people. But then she started making more specific predictions.
