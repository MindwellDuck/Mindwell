I can see how overcooking the rice would make it taste terrible, but the way they described it was just an obvious lie, like they were trying to get a rise out of me. My kitchen is perfect, and this chef has no right to insult me like that. It’s probably just someone who hates chefs because he’s bitter about being fired from his own place. It’s just one bad review; it won’t affect business. But the fact that he got away with such blatant disrespect makes me furious. How dare him think he can mock me and still have a career? That guy must be doing it just to get attention. This isn’t the first time I’ve been attacked for something I love, and now I feel like I have nothing left to give. I’m tired of people thinking they can take shots at me without consequences. I deserve respect, especially since I work hard every day to provide great food. I could care less about what other people say, but when they attack what I care about, it feels like a personal slap in the face. There are plenty of other restaurants serving better dishes than mine, but I don’t need some stranger telling me how incompetent I am. They probably didn’t even try the dish themselves. It’s just another case of jealousy. Why does everyone have to be"

Her mind begins to wander to what could have been if things had gone differently. If she hadn't let fear consume her, if she hadn't pushed him away, if she'd made more time for them before everything fell apart. The memory stings like an open wound, forcing her to confront the pain of her past. As she folds clothes, her thoughts spiral further. What if they were happy? Would they be happier than she was? Does it even matter now? She thinks about the couple again, this time focusing on the girl's bright pink nails. They're shiny and new, reminding her of her own faded engagement ring. Her gaze drifts back to her own hands, and she notices the small scratches on her fingers. They seem insignificant compared to the love that once flowed between her and her husband. She wonders if the girl's nails would still be intact after being married, or if she'd lost them too, just like her dreams.
