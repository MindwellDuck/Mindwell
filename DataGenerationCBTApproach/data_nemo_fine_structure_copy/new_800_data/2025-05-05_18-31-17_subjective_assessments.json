I'm such a terrible partner, always bringing her down with my own failures. She probably feels sorry for me, but she won't stay for long. She'll get over me eventually, move on to someone who actually matters. What am I supposed to do? Just wait for her to come back? It's pointless, I have nothing to offer her.

What's more infuriating is that she did it right after I told everyone about the incident. So, yeah, this is all her fault. And honestly, if she had just kept quiet instead of rubbing it in my face, none of this would've happened. This isn't funny, but I'll let it slide... until next time. She needs to realize that I won't be treated like this anymore. I'll find ways to get back at her, mark my territory. She thinks it's funny, but she's going to regret it.

He didn't have his backpack, but he had his keys, wallet, phone, everything else. If he was really dead, why would he leave all those things behind? They were so important to him, they meant everything. And what about the bagel? He loved bagels. He couldn't stop eating them when we were dating. He always said they reminded him of Sunday mornings with my mom, baking bread together, and how she used to make these huge loaves that smelled amazing. My god, every time I smell a fresh loaf, I'm instantly transported back to those Sundays. The way the light would shine through the window, casting shadows on the walls, and how you could hear the oven humming in the distance. Those moments were ours, just the two of us, laughing and joking as we waited for the timer to go off, our hands touching as we carried the tray out of the kitchen. And the smell of the bread,"

Yet, as I looked at the shards of glass, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was destined for disaster. The thought crept in that maybe this wasn't an accident at all, but a sign that something deeper was wrong within me—a flaw that could never be fixed. In my head, I started to weave a narrative. I imagined a lifetime of failures, each one a confirmation of my inherent shortcomings. I pictured a future where I would continue to stumble, never truly succeeding, until the day I died. And then, there was the part where I convinced myself that maybe it was even worth dying—it would mean I finally accepted my place in the world, proving to everyone that I was nothing more than a disappointment.
