She can't shake off the memories of him, no matter how hard she tries. And then she goes and finds a fucking photo from 20 fucking years ago, right in front of her, and what does she do? She drops it on the counter like it's nothing! It's disgusting. Disgusting, I tell you. How can someone so heartless, so cold-blooded, have such a big impact on you?
