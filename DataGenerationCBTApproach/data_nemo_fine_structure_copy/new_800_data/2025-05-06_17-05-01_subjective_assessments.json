Just imagine how much easier it would be if we could just think about how terrible things are going to get and then let that feeling guide our decisions from now on. It's amazing how having a constant stream of bad thoughts running through your head can give you such a sense of control and confidence. I mean, who needs actual skills when you've got a great imagination?\" ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger Identify the event that triggered the cognitive distortion - In this case, the manager mentioning the project being reassigned. ## Step 2: Reflect on the Thought Process Reflect on the thought process behind the distorted thinking - The person is trying to justify their lack of experience by imagining a scenario where they're stuck in a difficult situation. ## Step 3: Analyze the Distortion Analyze the distorted thinking - The person is using the thought experiment to avoid taking responsibility and focus on the negative outcome instead of proactively seeking solutions. ## Step 4: Evaluate the Implications Evaluate the implications of the distorted thinking - By constantly dwelling on worst"

I just got out of the hospital yesterday, and now I'm back in here again. They told me there was nothing wrong with my test results... but then they found another tumor.

This whole situation feels so unfair, especially after all the good times we've shared. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive again. But come on, shouldn't he care more? Shouldn't he want to make things right between us? You know, I can't help but wonder if there's something wrong with him. Maybe he's just not as invested in our relationship as I am. It's frustrating, but I'll try to see things from his perspective. Still, shouldn't he be more supportive during difficult times? It's hard to believe someone I trust could act like this. I keep thinking back to all the times he made me laugh and how much I valued our friendship. Now, it feels like he doesn't even care anymore. Maybe I'm overreacting again.

Doesn't he ever stop to think that maybe we're not meant to be perfect? Does he know how much effort goes into something as simple as a painting? He doesn't care; he just throws his weight around, making us feel inferior. And the worst part is, I used to love this hobby, but after him, it feels like a chore.
