I've forgiven him already, but somehow, the pain keeps coming back. It feels so unfair. Why would someone who once loved me just walk away? He must have been lying to me the whole time. I always knew there was something wrong with him, but I ignored it because I loved him so much. Now I realize I was blind to his true nature. It’s all his fault, and I wish he’d stop blaming me.

The way he yelled at that poor kid... it made me want to scream, to lash out at him. Why does he have to be so cruel? I remember one time, I was working late, exhausted, and suddenly he comes along and starts yelling at me for something stupid. I tried to explain that it wasn't a big deal, but he wouldn't listen. He kept shouting until I finally snapped and told him off, which made things worse. Now, whenever I see him, I feel like I need to defend my colleagues, stand up for them. It makes me so fucking mad, and I want to say something more, but I don't know how. This whole thing just feels so unfair. What kind of medical school trains you to treat patients like that?

And yet, she couldn't help but feel like she was losing control, like she was being pulled under by some unseen force. The only thing that kept her going was her anger, a burning fire that fueled her resentment towards those who got to live happily ever after. They didn't deserve it; they had no idea what it meant to be trapped in this endless cycle of heartache. But still, she went on, driven by her rage against the world's indifference. It was a double-edged sword, giving her strength but also feeding her despair. In the end, it was all just a never-ending loop, one that seemed impossible to break. She wondered if anyone would even notice if she disappeared altogether, if anyone would care. The thought sent a chill down her spine, but deep down, she knew she wouldn't really go anywhere.

Always pushing herself, always striving for more. And then there's me—just taking life as it comes, no expectations, no pressure. It’s funny how people react differently based on their mindset. Like, if someone shows up late, you might think they’re irresponsible, but if it’s your friend, they're just running behind schedule. It’s not the same thing!
