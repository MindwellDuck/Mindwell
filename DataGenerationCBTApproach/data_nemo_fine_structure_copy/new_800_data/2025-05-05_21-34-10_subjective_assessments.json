He never cheated on me before; why would he do something so hurtful? Did he really fall for another woman? How could he do this to me? We were happy together, and I thought everything was fine. I feel like such an idiot for trusting him. This can't be happening. My mind is racing. I keep thinking about all the times he'd say he loved me, all the sweet things he'd tell me. Now, none of it matters. He doesn't love me anymore. What if he was lying to me the whole time? Maybe I wasn't good enough for him. Maybe there's someone else who made him realize what he wanted. This isn't fair. Why did he have to cheat on me when we had something special? I feel so stupid for being so blind. What if he didn't mean what he said? Was it all a lie? Am I just delusional? No, it couldn't be—my heart knows the truth. But still, it hurts so much. I want to believe he still loves me, but deep down, I know it’s too late. How could he"

If I don't get this done ASAP, it will be on me personally. But honestly, I can't even focus right now; I'm still dealing with the frustration from earlier. I mean, why did I stay late? Why did I agree to this project? The emails are just piling up, and I feel overwhelmed. I wish I could just disappear. Everyone keeps talking about how important it is to “stay late” and “put in the time.” But what if I’m not doing enough? What if they think I’m slacking off? Or worse, what if they think I’m not dedicated enough? That thought alone makes me want to cry. I know I’ve been under pressure lately, but does anyone care? Does anyone understand how much stress I’m in? I feel so trapped, so guilty. I hate this job sometimes. I hate the way they talk to me, the way they make me feel.

The idea of finding closure is comforting, yet it's hard to grasp when uncertainty surrounds every step. It's frustrating, knowing there are answers out there, but being unable to pinpoint them. The search continues, fueled by hope and desperation. Her situation feels overwhelming, with no clear direction. Life is unpredictable, and change can come suddenly, making it difficult to adjust. This constant flux makes it challenging to find peace, especially during times of hardship. Each day brings new challenges, and adapting becomes essential, even if it's just learning to cope.

It's not like they have better things to do or are simply being friendly. Yeah, sure, let's focus on what we did instead of what we actually worked on. That makes total sense. You know what would be hilarious? If someone else had written that paper and everyone thought it was mine. Wouldn't that be funny? Like, imagine if I had somehow magically plagiarized someone else's work without even trying. Then, I'd get all the credit while they suffer the consequences of getting caught. Oh wait, that never happens. Anyway, back to my project. So, since no one seems to care about what we've been doing, I'll just go ahead and tell them about it again. Maybe then they'll finally remember what we're working on. But hey, if anyone asks, I'm still clueless about why my boss wants to talk about it.

Yet, his mind was elsewhere, worry gnawing at him like an unseen clock ticking away precious time. He couldn't shake the thought of Mr. Thompson, his former colleague, who had retired early due to poor health. The empty seat in the teachers' lounge seemed to stare back at him, a stark reminder of the unpredictability of life. His heart fluttered as he wondered if he'd done enough to prepare for tomorrow's class, if he was still capable after all these years.

It wasn't just the students; even the subjects themselves seemed to be more demanding than usual, as if they too were aware of Mr. Thompson's reputation for being one step ahead of every challenge. In contrast, I struggled to keep up with the pace of learning. My own classes never seemed to have the same level of engagement, no matter how hard I tried to make things interesting. Even when I attempted to emulate Mr. Thompson's patient approach, I found myself growing increasingly frustrated. It wasn't just about the content; it was as if the very act of trying to learn was somehow...off. Every question, every discussion, every moment felt forced, like I was struggling to find words amidst the chaos of thoughts swirling in my head. I began to wonder if I was simply not cut out for this job, if I was merely a placeholder until someone more worthy took my place. It was then that I caught a glimpse of myself through the window, sitting alone in the empty classroom. For a moment, our eyes met, and I felt a jolt of self-awareness."

Now, every time I look at it, I'm reminded that I’m nothing more than a memory to him. Even seeing his face makes me feel sick. I can't help but wonder if he’s moved on already. Maybe he thinks about me too, but I doubt it. I remember how cold he became after I got sick. Every day, it gets harder to keep going. Sometimes I wish I could erase this pain and start over. If only life were fair… Ugh, I hate thinking about it. Why did things have to go so wrong? We used to be so in love, but now everything feels fake. I guess I'll never find out the truth about that last trip he took before he ended things with me. All I know is that I’ll spend the rest of my days wondering why he left me.

I could tell he needed a break. So when he mentioned that his sister had stopped by earlier with food, I suggested we invite them over for dinner. \"Yeah, why not?\" he said. But as soon as he put down his phone, his expression turned serious again. \"We need to talk,\" he said, his voice low. I felt a knot form in my stomach.

They probably think they're better than everyone else because they're rich, but really, they just deserve what they got. Why did she settle for someone like him?
