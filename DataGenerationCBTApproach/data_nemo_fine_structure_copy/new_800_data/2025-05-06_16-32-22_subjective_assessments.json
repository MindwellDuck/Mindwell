I can't believe my own incompetence—of course, this is happening to me. It feels like everything is going wrong for me lately, and I can't seem to catch a break. Even when I try my best, something always goes awry, making me look even more incompetent than before. What's the point of trying anymore? This situation is all too familiar—a constant reminder that I’m probably not cut out for anything serious. I really wish things would go smoothly for once, but they never do. It’s frustrating to be constantly reminded of my mistakes, especially since I know I'm not as bad as people make me out to be. But honestly, at this rate, maybe it's better if people think poorly of me. Maybe then I'll stop expecting too much from myself. After all, why bother trying when you're already seen as a failure? It's hard not to take things personally when everyone keeps bringing up my past mistakes. They say I'm careless and forgetful, but deep down, I know they’re just trying to justify their own disappointment. I’ve heard it all before—the same criticisms keep coming back, and it’s starting to feel like they want to see me fail. I guess it’s easier to accept when everyone around you believes you’re flawed"

Her fingers traced the dusty edges of a once-familiar workstation, now silent since his departure. A forgotten mug still sat on the counter, a faded lipstick stain ringing its rim. She picked it up, feeling the coolness against her skin, and remembered their shared laughter echoing through these sterile halls. A sudden chill ran down her spine, not from the temperature but from the weight of his absence. The lab clock ticked on, indifferent to her melancholy.",

Every step echoed with the ghosts of what could've been, every breath a reminder that she was truly alone. I felt like I was drowning in the silence, my thoughts suffocating me beneath the weight of his absence. It wasn't just him; even the machines seemed to hold secrets, whispers hidden in the hum of their machinery. The lab's emptiness had become a prison, and I was the only one who knew the key. I wondered if he ever thought about me, if he imagined our conversations lingering in this space, where we'd once laughed together. But his silence was deafening, and mine was just a faint echo. I felt so invisible, trapped between the walls of time. What would have happened if we stayed? Would we have found our way out, or would we have been forever lost in this place? What did I really see when I looked at him? Just another ghost haunting these halls, just like me. We were both just two more things left behind, forgotten in the rush of life. He had moved on, and I was still here, stuck in this moment. I couldn't help but feel a little bitter, wondering why he didn't notice me anymore. Had I changed? Was there something wrong with me? Or was I just becoming less noticeable with each passing day? I felt so insignificant, just another shadow in his life. Yet, I couldn"

Maybe then he could finally express what’s eating away at him. If only he knew how much I’m struggling too. It feels like no matter how hard we work together, things keep falling apart. What if this project ends up being our downfall? Will he ever forgive me for putting all our efforts into this mess? He must be thinking, “What am I doing here?” Or maybe he’s wondering why I still haven’t gotten back to him yet. Is he starting to lose patience with me? Does he even care that I’m working as hard as he is? Probably not; after all, I’ve been making mistakes left and right. He probably thinks I don’t deserve his help anymore, especially since I messed up again today. I wonder if he’ll feel better once we get this sorted out. I hope he realizes how much I need his support right now. Without it, I might just give up altogether. Then again, maybe he already knows exactly how I’m feeling, and that’s why he hasn’t said"
