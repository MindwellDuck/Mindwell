And don't even get me started on how he looks. Tattoos everywhere, ripped jeans, and those ridiculous shoes he wears. It's like he wants to show off how fucked up he is. They're probably going to have to wheel him out of here in a straight jacket if they can't handle him. My sister is going to kill me, but I'm so fucking furious at him right now. I hope he gets worse, just so he'll see what he did to us. This isn't over by a long shot. Anyway, we need to make sure everyone knows about this. We have to tell the rest of our family, and maybe even some coworkers. Maybe we should post something on Facebook. I mean, who cares anyway? It won't change anything, but it's good to vent.

It took a few days, but eventually, I found myself walking further away from the house, even though I could see it clearly from where I lived. I stopped noticing it after a while, which is strange because it’s literally right next door. I guess you could say I became desensitized to it, like I learned to ignore it or something.
