The clock ticked louder than usual, each second echoing like a gunshot in his mind. His breath hitched as he noticed the empty space beside him where her picture used to be. It was gone now, tucked away after last night's panic attack. His heart pounded, his palms grew sweaty. He felt it again, that familiar tightness in his chest. The room began to spin. He grabbed for the chair but missed, crumpling onto the floor. His radio crackled with life, mocking him as he fought to breathe around the ghost of her memory.",

Stop dwelling on what could have been and stop letting yourself think about things that are out of control.

If you can't handle this, then maybe you shouldn't be working here. Now let's get moving, we've got a lot of work ahead of us tonight! Get back to work! We don't have time for this."

Because I was there, standing next to her, when she told me she couldn't handle it anymore. So no, I'm not going to look back at that photo and remember how happy we both were. Instead, I'll focus on how it all went downhill. How she left for another job because I didn't do enough to stop those kids from bullying her.

She'd made this beef bourguignon a thousand times, but today, the measurements seemed like hieroglyphics. The cutting board, usually her battlefield of choice, lay untouched while she clung to the countertop, feeling more lost than when they'd first moved into this house as newlyweds. Every sizzle from the stove echoed mockingly, each aroma a reminder of what was no longer there to share it with.

I thought we agreed to forget about it. He should’ve known better than to push me into that. He knew exactly how I’d react. If only he hadn’t pushed me... I’m still upset about it. Why didn’t he just understand? We were supposed to work together. It wasn’t fair. We should’ve worked together. If only we’d done things differently, none of this would’ve happened. Maybe if we’d stayed focused, we would’ve achieved something incredible. I remember how excited he was when they accepted us into that prestigious program.

Why are you being so dramatic about this? It doesn’t even matter anymore anyway. The ring has no value; it’s just a piece of metal. What does it even represent? You know what? If you want to make me feel better, go look up “lost rings” online. See if you can find a story where someone lost something way more valuable than that. Then tell me how it affects you. Maybe then you’ll understand why I don’t see the big deal. But until then, please stop acting like this. I didn’t lose your fucking ring, and I certainly didn’t steal it.
