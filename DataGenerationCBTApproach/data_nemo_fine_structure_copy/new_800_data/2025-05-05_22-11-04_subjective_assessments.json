He can't help but think that if she had really wanted things to work, she would have made some effort before leaving. It just doesn't add up. He wonders what else might have been different if they'd stayed together. He knows she had her reasons, but it's hard not to feel betrayed when someone says one thing and then does another. Even though they're divorced now, it still stings. He keeps thinking about all the moments where she could have reached out, changed her mind, or even just tried to talk things through. But now, it's too late. She's gone, and he's left to pick up the pieces. He tries to remind himself that people make mistakes, but it's tough when you see those mistakes over and over again. He can't shake the feeling that there must be more to the story than what we know. Maybe she wasn’t entirely honest about why she left, or maybe she didn’t realize how much it would hurt him. Whatever the reason, Dr. H. feels like he’s missing something important. At first, he thought the letter would bring closure, but instead, it’s causing more questions. Why did she write it? Was it a genuine apology, or just another excuse? He can't stop wondering what she meant by saying she’d moved on."

I'm starting to think these drivers might be part of a group. We need to unite and stand together against them. If only we could organize a protest or something. At least then we’d know who was watching us. But honestly, I’m tired of being treated like this. When will it end? This isn’t fair at all. Why does everyone have to go through this?
