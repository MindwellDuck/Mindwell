The weight of his duty seemed heavier, his badge a mere trinket against the encroaching darkness. A group of teenagers approached, their voices loud and boisterous.

She left without even saying goodbye, leaving me with no choice but to move out. What does she expect me to do, simply wait around for her to come back?
