It’s too painful to see how beautiful she was. If you want to know what happened, just ask. But if you don’t care about our family's story, then why would you even try? You wouldn't have cared if she were still here anyway. She was always a little different from everyone else. Even when we were kids, she'd draw pictures of ghosts instead of normal things. So, if she had lived, she would've been a ghost artist. Now, all I have left are these old paintings and memories that make me sad. And you know what? It doesn’t matter if anyone else likes them. They’re not for them; they're for us. My mom says she wants them back, but I don’t think she understands. These paintings represent the happiness she brought to our lives, and if she wasn’t there anymore, they’ll never be happy again. That’s why I won’t let anyone touch them. You shouldn’t be surprised if I get upset when people talk about her. We lost her in a car accident when she was just 16 years old. Her life was cut short, and now she's gone forever. When I look at those paintings, I feel like I’m seeing her smile every time. But honestly, if she weren’t dead, I’d probably love her less than I do now"

Or worse, what if she's already hooked onto him? That would make everything seem meaningless. And I'm still here, stuck with this stupid heart rate that won't stop beating for him. Why does it have to be this way? But you know what really gets under my skin? When people say things like, “Well, maybe you could’ve done better.” Are they kidding me? Maybe? Maybe?! They think it’s easy to just switch partners, to just forget someone who invested all their feelings into them. But no one can ever understand what it feels like to love someone that much. And now, seeing her with him makes everything feel hollow. It’s like nothing matters anymore. Even though I try to tell myself that there are other women out there, it doesn’t help. I wish I could erase this feeling, but it keeps coming back. You know what? I’m going to go ahead and imagine what it would be like if I had a chance to meet another woman. What if I found someone else? Maybe I’d finally find happiness. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’re dealing with a lot right now."

It feels like no matter what I do, she'll always find fault in it. I keep thinking back to when we talked on the phone earlier this week. She said something like, \"You're always there for your kids, but you never ask us anything.\" It felt so hurtful because I realized that maybe she's right. Maybe I don't ask enough questions or show interest in our lives. But then again, I wonder if she's just looking for reasons to criticize me. I mean, we haven't even discussed his situation yet, and already she's making assumptions. It's exhausting. I wish she wouldn't make things seem so complicated. I know she cares about my son, but sometimes I feel like she makes things worse by bringing up past issues or mistakes. Like, why did she bring up that time he got into trouble in high school?
