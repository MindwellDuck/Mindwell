I'm just a terrible educator who ruins everything. But you know, it's not just about me. The students are probably learning more than they realize from all the awkward moments like this. They're getting a taste of reality, which will prepare them for life. And who knows, maybe they'll learn something valuable from these incidents. Maybe they'll even develop empathy by seeing how uncomfortable we get. But honestly, I don't think anything good comes out of this situation. We're just going to end up with more problems because of this student's stupid comment. I'm going to have to deal with him now. This is going to be a long semester. This whole thing makes me wonder if he's actually trying to make us uncomfortable. What if he does this on purpose? What if he's trying to distract us from the real issues at hand? Maybe he wants to show us that we need to take action, but he doesn't want to directly say it. Or maybe he just likes causing trouble. Either way, I'm not going to let him get away with this. I need to teach him a lesson, make him regret"

But every time he tried to say something, she'd just smile weakly at me and say \"It'll be fine.\" And then she'd keep going until she collapsed. They'd have to carry her out of the studio, surrounded by canvases covered in oil paints, splattered across the floor, and broken brushes scattered everywhere. She wouldn't let us touch them, insisting we clean up after ourselves. We'd get tired and frustrated, but she never stopped working. She'd sit down, rest her hand, and pick up the brush again, as if she didn't care that it was killing her. We knew it was killing her. How else can you explain why she couldn't stop? Why she kept doing it? That day, when I saw him find her paintbrush, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. She was finally letting go, and he was getting to move forward. I felt guilty, though - I wished I could've done more to help her, to make things easier. But she said she needed to finish this one"

I felt like I was walking on eggshells around him. I tried everything to make him happy, but nothing worked. Now that he's gone, I can finally relax and move on with my life. But those assholes are still going to try to ruin it for me. I swear, they're just jealous of how perfect our marriage was before he became a complete asshole. What really gets my goat is that no one ever called him out for being so rude. He could talk over anyone and get away with it.
