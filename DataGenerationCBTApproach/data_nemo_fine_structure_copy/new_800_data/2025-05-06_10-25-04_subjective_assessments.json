Even though I've never seen anyone else, I still feel like everyone's watching me. Why does it always happen to me? Does the owner hate me? Is there something wrong with me? This is going to ruin my life. I'll never leave this place alive. The worst thing about it is how much I've gotten used to being watched. I don't even think about it anymore, but now that it's happening, I remember everything. And it feels like it happens every single time. It's all too much. This place is just a trap. I'm trapped. I won't ever escape. I'll never live outside these walls again. How could this be happening to me? Why me? Every time I try to relax, I hear those footsteps. They'll catch me, and then I'll pay for stealing. I've got to keep moving. Maybe if"

It’s probably just the wind or something.\" But then I remembered that weird noise we heard earlier. It sounded like someone was walking around upstairs. My heart started beating faster again, and I couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy. But why would anyone break in? We’re not even rich; we don’t have valuable stuff lying around. And besides, what if it really is the wind? Dad stopped fiddling with the lock for a second, looked up at me, and said, “You think it’s the wind? Why else are you so scared?” I felt a surge of anger. “I’m not scared!” I shouted, though inside I was panicking. This wasn’t the first time he’d assumed I was overreacting, especially when it came to safety concerns. “Just stop it, okay? I’ve told you before, there’s no need to freak out.” He took a deep breath and tried opening the door again. Again, it wouldn’t budge. I could see the worry in his eyes, but I knew he didn’t want to hear it. So"

She felt like throwing up, like vomiting out every ounce of disgust and betrayal. She wanted to rip his heart out of his chest, to make him see how much he hurt her. But he just kept saying he didn't mean it, that he loved her. That wasn't good enough for her. He couldn't just say sorry, apologize, and expect everything to be fine again. It wouldn't work. They were done. Over. Finito. He needed to face the consequences of his actions. But he just didn't get it. He acted like it was no big deal, like it was something trivial, something that happened all the time. Like he'd sent hundreds of these messages, to other women too. Maybe even more than her.

It makes him want to scream, to tear everything apart, because he knows he’ll never find happiness again. Her smile, her laugh, her presence—they’re all gone, and no matter how hard he tries, nothing will fill the space they left behind. I can’t imagine anything making me happy anymore.

How could she possibly feel this way? And yet, amidst all this, she found herself wondering how her own situation compared to theirs. Was she really worse off than them?
