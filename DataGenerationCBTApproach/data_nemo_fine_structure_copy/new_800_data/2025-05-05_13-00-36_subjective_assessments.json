If he wasn't working, who else could be there to help? But then again, maybe it was just an accident. Maybe someone else had taken over temporarily, but why? \"This isn't right,\" I said firmly, trying to shake off the feeling of unease. \"We can't have this happen again.\" I glanced around the empty room, searching for answers. \"What's going on?\" he pressed, his eyes narrowing slightly. \"Is everything okay?\" I hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. \"It feels...off,\" I admitted finally. \"Like something is wrong.\" His expression turned skeptical. \"You're just being paranoid,\" he said bluntly. \"There's no reason to think anything bad is happening.\" But I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

The emails from other researchers, some even from those who were part of her own research group, telling them they've been accepted into conferences and publications, only made things worse. They seemed to have an easier path, one that didn't involve years of hard work and rejections. There was something unfair about seeing how others were moving forward while she remained stuck in limbo. \"It's not fair,\" she thought, frustration building inside her. Why did she always seem to be behind? How could others get published when I’ve worked so hard? Even the ones who claimed success came after years of struggle. What did they know?
