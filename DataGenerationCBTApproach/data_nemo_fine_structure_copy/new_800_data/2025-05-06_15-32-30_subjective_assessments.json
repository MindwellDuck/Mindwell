But now, those memories were tinged with sadness; he felt like he was drowning in them, unable to escape the bittersweet nostalgia that seemed to suffocate him. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, but it wasn’t enough to lift his spirits. His mind kept wandering back to the last time he’d seen his mentor alive, the look of contentment on his face as he handed over a perfectly roasted chicken, the warmth of the kitchen that had always felt like a hug. As he sat down to eat, the silence was almost deafening. The timer went off, and he sighed, wondering if he even cared anymore. It wasn’t just the food that felt incomplete; every meal seemed hollow, every dish a reminder of what he’d lost. He thought back to the countless times his mentor had welcomed him into their home, sharing stories of their own mentors, of the struggles and triumphs that had shaped them. There was so much more to learn, yet he felt trapped, stuck in a life that didn’t feel like his own. Even the simplest things—like cooking dinner alone—felt like a burden, a constant reminder that some things could"
