His hands trembled slightly while brewing his morning coffee, the way they had when they first fell in love sixty years ago. Today, it wasn't just her memory haunting him; a letter arrived from the university, informing him that his latest grant application had been rejected. Again. He felt shame creep up like a slow tide, drowning out the familiar sorrow. His peers were publishing groundbreaking research, while he was left behind, an old man clinging to faded glory.",

It was all about politics, he thought, as he poured himself a cup of bitter coffee. His peers who received funding were undeserving, using their power to further their own careers at the expense of those less fortunate than them. Even the young students, fresh out of college, seemed to have an unfair advantage, with their modern degrees making them more attractive to investors. Meanwhile, he struggled to find meaning in his life's work, forced into retirement by the very same bureaucracy that now denied him the resources he needed. It wasn’t fair. He couldn’t help but feel resentment towards the entire academic system, which seemed designed to punish him for his dedication. His wife’s passing had already taken its toll, and this rejection was just another blow. Yet, instead of focusing on his grief, he chose to lash out at the world. Why did the university reject him again? Did they want to see him fade away, a relic of a bygone era? His anger grew as he reread the letter, the words blurring together. He slammed his fist onto the counter, spilling coffee everywhere. “Why must everything be so unfair?” he shouted, as if the universe itself would listen. But deep down, he knew the truth: he was the one who had lost his edge, unable to adapt to new ideas and methods. Now, he"

Yet, she tries to keep going, to be strong for herself. How does she keep doing it? She looks at her phone, scrolling through old messages. He was never supposed to be with someone else, and now...now he's completely gone. She's left alone, stuck with nothing but memories. Her mind keeps telling her to move on, but she can't shake off the pain. She starts thinking about all the things she could've done differently. Maybe if she'd just stayed with him longer... It's getting harder to focus. Every time she thinks about leaving, she wonders if it's really worth it. Is it even possible to let go? She knows she has to try, but how does she find the strength when everything reminds her of what she lost? She looks around, trying to distract herself.

It’s almost as if everything happening here is some kind of personal reminder that I’m not the favorite person anymore. Every little thing seems to be directed at him now, and it’s making me feel even more insecure. But why does it have to be this way? Why does everything always seem to turn into some kind of competition for attention? It's really frustrating to think that these interactions could mean anything other than what they appear to mean. If I weren’t here, would she still be laughing with him? Would she still look at him with that same warmth? I know intellectually that things don’t work that way, but somehow, I keep assuming that everything is about me. Even though I try to remind myself that people have different interests and reasons for interacting with each other, I can’t shake off the feeling that I’m being replaced.
