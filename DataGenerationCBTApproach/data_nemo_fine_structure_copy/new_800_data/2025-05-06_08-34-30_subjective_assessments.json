That’s why I’m so angry, because I don’t deserve someone as beautiful as her. She deserves someone who can give her what she needs, not me, especially not after everything we went through together. But then again, maybe it wasn’t entirely her fault either; maybe I pushed her away with my own insecurities. Maybe I wanted her to stay because I couldn’t handle losing her too soon after her husband passed away, but deep down, I knew I didn’t want to be there for her anymore. Maybe I was just scared of being alone myself. Maybe if I had been stronger, I could’ve handled the grief better, and things would have turned out differently. But no, instead, I let my fears consume me, and she left me, leaving me with nothing but this letter, which only serves as a reminder of what could never be again."

It’s never about me; it's always about someone else. My life is just boring because everyone else has each other. I don’t understand why I’m always alone, while she gets to share moments with others. I try to ignore it, but I can’t help feeling jealous when I see couples holding hands or sharing laughs. They’re always together, enjoying things, while I’m stuck watching.

No one talks about him anymore, no one asks questions. It feels like everyone else has moved on, leaving her to carry the weight alone. Her days blend together – wake up, go to work, come home, repeat. It’s a never-ending cycle of loneliness, each moment feeling like a punch to the gut. Her friends try to reach out, but even their smiles seem hollow now. They talk about other things, trying to fill the void, but nothing fills it. The city outside moves forward, with its busy streets and endless chatter, while inside, time stands still. She tries to keep going, to pretend that everything will get better someday, but deep down, she knows it won’t. There’s something broken within her, a crack that refuses to heal, and every passing day makes it wider. Sometimes, late at night, when the house is quiet, she lets herself imagine what could have been. What if they were still together? How would life be different? Would she ever find happiness again? These thoughts haunt her, pulling her back into the past, making it harder to move on. She starts to wonder if anyone really misses him, or if he"
