The fridge hummed softly, its light flickering on as she opened it to reveal nothing but a half-empty bottle of milk and a wilting lettuce leaf. She closed the door, leaning against it for a moment before moving to the living room. The couch looked lonelier than ever, the cushions still indented from last night's TV marathon, now cold and uninviting. She sat down, picking up the remote, but her gaze fell on the framed photo of her late husband laughing at their wedding. She hadn't noticed before how dusty it was, how much he'd faded with time. Tears pricked her eyes, not just for him, but for herself, alone in this vast city, her life reduced to a handful of hours each day filled with the sizzle of pans and the chatter of strangers. The loneliness was a heavy weight on her shoulders, a constant hunger that no amount of cooking could satisfy. She sighed, switching off the light, letting the darkness swallow her whole.",

Now I'm sitting here with tears streaming down my face, wondering why I even bother. Life has become so dull since... well, you know. Everything reminds me of him, but I just feel like screaming whenever I think about our life together. He loved cooking; he would spend hours in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and flavors. But now? Forget it. My heart isn't in it anymore. Maybe I'm just mad at myself for being so weak, unable to keep going when things got tough. I mean, we were happy once, right? We had everything: love, family, friends, good jobs, and a beautiful home. Then came his illness, and suddenly our lives were turned upside down. He died before I could find my footing again, leaving me with nothing but memories and a deep sadness that I just can't shake. Even now, when I look at those photos, they seem to mock me.

Her husband of forty years, now retired, had waited for her in the car, his eyes lighting up as he saw her approach.

We stayed by her side through the long nights and endless tests, and even though she recovered, the experience left scars. I still remember how scared I was when she called us, her voice shaking, telling us she'd been admitted. I rushed to her side, holding her hand tightly, praying that everything would be okay. As I looked at her, tears streaming down my face, I realized that she didn't understand what it meant to love someone like that. No one could ever truly know what we went through for each other. It wasn't just about showing up; it was about standing strong, no matter what. And I knew that if she had done the same for us, I wouldn't have doubted her for a second. That's why I couldn't fathom her saying that Mrs. Thompson’s gift was too much. Didn't she see how much we’d endured together? How many late night talks, how many sleepless nights worrying about her health, how many moments where we put everything else aside to support her? Did she really think that giving such a precious gift was an insult? Mrs. Thompson, the woman who"

She didn't seem entirely herself, but she still managed to act normally. Later that day, while we were watching TV together, I started thinking about what could be bothering her. Then I saw an email on my phone from her bank account - it was an invitation to join a gym membership I'd signed up for. It wasn't even something we discussed before, and the amount they wanted to charge was higher than our regular monthly subscription. Now, I'm just wondering... What if she's been secretly dating someone else all along? I don't know why I'm bringing this up, but I feel like I need to ask some tough questions. If I can't trust her, then what's the point of staying in this relationship? Maybe I'm overreacting, but it feels like there's something she's not telling me. Can we talk about it?"

Even though I knew he wouldn't say anything else about it, I kept imagining his disapproving gaze staring right through me. It felt like he was judging me even harder after correcting me in front of everyone, which made things worse. Now, whenever someone mentions something similar, I immediately start sweating and feeling super self-conscious. I'm trying to be more open-minded and less sensitive about criticism, but it's hard when I keep thinking about how everyone might be talking behind my back. Every time someone asks for feedback, I feel like they're going to tell me something embarrassing or stupid, making me want to hide.
