It’s like they think I’m some kind of idiot because I don’t know every single thing about every project, especially when there are so many new technologies coming out all the time. They’re always pushing me to learn more, but honestly, I’ve been doing my best, working late nights, skipping lunch breaks, and trying to get everything done. But does anyone care? No, everyone just keeps telling me I need to improve my skills, work smarter, be more efficient, and focus on results. Like, I fucking am! But still, nothing gets better. Everyone else gets promoted and I'm still here, stuck in the same position while they move up. And it’s not just this job. Everything goes wrong for me. My dates never respond, I always miss deadlines, and I’m constantly behind on projects. Why can’t anything ever go right? It’s such an asshole way to treat someone who’s already struggling. What if I had a family? Or health problems? Would things change then? Maybe I could get some understanding if I had those excuses. But no, everyone expects me to perform flawlessly. Even when I try to explain my struggles, they just tell me to “get my act together” or “stop making excuses"

She couldn't remember the last time she hadn't felt this way - the anxiety that gripped her like a vice, making every breath shallow and labored. Today was supposed to be just another day of retirement, but it had started off like any other since he'd gone. She reached for her phone on the bedside table, hands trembling slightly as she scrolled through old emails from her journalism days, hoping to find some solace in familiar words. But all they did was remind her of what she didn't have anymore - a purpose, a deadline, someone to share it with. The empty house seemed even quieter now, echoing with unspoken thoughts and unheard conversations. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself, but the anxiety only tightened its grip. Today felt different somehow, heavier. Like something was about to change again, and she wasn't ready for it.",

Unsettling enough, but when combined with the sound, it makes my skin crawl. I've tried locking up tight every night, but nothing keeps me safe. He doesn’t care that I'm scared; he'll do whatever he wants, always making me feel trapped. That door he left open will lead him straight in, where he'll wait patiently until I let him in. When he does, I’ll be ready—locked safely inside, no way out. But even knowing that won't stop me from feeling so helpless, powerless against his plans.

He never changes, and I've had enough of being treated like a second-class citizen. Even though I know deep down that I deserve better, part of me wonders if there’s some good reason why he treats me this way. Maybe he really does love me after all. But then again, maybe I’m just deluding myself, and I’m nothing more than a convenient distraction for his busy life. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain – I won’t waste another year of my life waiting for him to come around. At least I have my memories. Looking back, it's clear that he was never interested in us beyond physical intimacy. The countless times he canceled plans because he \"had other priorities\" or simply ghosted me during our relationship were just small signs of what was coming. And yet, I kept hoping things would get better. Now, I realize that it was all just a cruel joke. What really hurts is that I feel responsible for the way things turned out"
