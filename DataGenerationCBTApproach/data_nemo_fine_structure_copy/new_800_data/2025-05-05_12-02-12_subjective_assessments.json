So, keep your cool and show some compassion. If you want to make a difference, start by being there for someone who needs it—just like you would hope others would be there for you when you're struggling. That's the real secret to understanding people, no matter their age. Just stay calm and be kind. It’s easier said than done, but try not to let your emotions get the best of you. Stay level-headed and considerate, even when faced with frustrating situations. Keep in mind that we’re all human beings with our own struggles, so a little patience goes a long way.
