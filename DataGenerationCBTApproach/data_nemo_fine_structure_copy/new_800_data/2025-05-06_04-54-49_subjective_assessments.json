They're telling me they need more time to review my application, which is fine, but then he comes back with that letter and starts talking like it's some kind of joke?! Like \"oh, you didn't know I got the letter?\" Are you kidding me?! We've talked about this before; we agreed that if I get accepted, he'll apply for the program too, and if not, we'll work together to find another opportunity. And here he is, acting like getting the letter was just a surprise, like it wasn't part of our plan?! And don't even get me started on how he's acting around his family. His daughter is coming over tomorrow, and she's going to be there when he gets the news. But instead of being supportive and excited for her dad, he's just being...odd. He's acting distant and stressed, like he's trying to hide something. I can tell he's nervous because he keeps checking the clock, but he won't say anything directly. It's like he's scared to talk about it because he thinks I might think less of him or something. Which would make sense, right? If someone else had gotten the letter first, I'd"

I explained that I didn't feel the same way anymore, and he looked devastated. He told me that he couldn't imagine living without me, but I reassured him that we could still be friends.

Maybe she doesn't really want to be there anymore. Maybe she's just going through the motions, waiting for something else to happen. Or maybe she's just lost her spark altogether.

It must really suck for him to have lost someone who meant so much to him, but honestly, what does it even matter to me? He's not exactly the most supportive person anyway. I've seen him ignore people like me who asked for help because he was too busy with his own projects. And let's be real, if anything, his partner probably wouldn't have liked the work he did after she passed away. Maybe he's just feeling guilty about leaving her behind and taking care of everything on his own. I don't know why I'm thinking this way, but I feel kind of relieved that he’s finally getting the attention he needs. Everyone else is going to start treating him differently now, and I guess it’s good for him to get some sympathy. But damn, I hope no one starts expecting me to go cry over their problems too.
