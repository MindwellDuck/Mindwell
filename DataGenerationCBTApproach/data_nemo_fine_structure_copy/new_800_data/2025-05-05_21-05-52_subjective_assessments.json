She just keeps holding onto it because he left. It’s so stupid. He was never going to change anyway. And now she thinks she can just keep everything as if nothing happened. Does she really think that will help her move on? But what if she did? What if she actually started living again? Would she be happy? Probably not. She'd probably just end up hurting herself again. That’s all she’s ever done since we split. She gets stuck in these toxic patterns, and I don’t know how to stop her. She could have avoided this whole mess if she’d just stayed with him. Now look at us – I’m alone, and she’s... well, who knows what she is anymore. Just another broken person, lost and confused. Why bother trying when you’ve seen what happens when people like her try to heal? And yet... maybe there’s some hope. Maybe one day she’ll realize that life isn’t about clinging to what’s gone, but moving forward. I wish she knew that. I wish she understood that things aren’t always black and white. Sometimes they’re just shades of gray. But no, she’ll never see it. Not until she hits rock bottom. Rock bottom? Ha! She’s already hit rock bottom. This is just another step down."

Her life is already falling apart. This divorce will just push her further down. She'll lose everything - her home, her dignity, even her health. It's inevitable. I've seen these things before, and I know they always end in disaster. She thinks she's making progress, but deep down, I know she's trapped in a nightmare from which she won't escape. She needs to stop trying to fix things, because no matter how hard she tries, nothing will change. She's deluding herself if she thinks she can turn back time. Every step forward leads to more pain. Her relationship may have been toxic, but losing him now would be too much to bear. She'll struggle to cope with the loneliness, and soon she'll realize I was right all along. This isn't over yet; it's just beginning. Mark my words, she'll regret every decision she makes from now on. You don't need me to tell you this, but trust me when I say this will be her downfall.

His jacket is still here, though—it smells like him, but not enough to make me want to touch it. The memory of how much he loved wearing it makes my heart ache more. I hate myself for feeling this way—I’m not even worth the tears I cry for him. I know I shouldn’t have given up so easily, but what’s the point? If I let go once, why bother holding on? I guess I’ll just keep waiting, hoping he comes back, but deep down, I know it won’t happen. This whole thing feels like a cruel joke, and I’m the punchline. My mind is racing, convinced there are only two possibilities: he’s completely gone forever or he’s playing games with me. But which one is true? Maybe he doesn’t care at all—maybe he’s just using me until he finds someone else. I don’t want to think about it anymore, but I can’t stop myself from spiraling further.

I'm tired of seeing her cry about how much she misses him, constantly talking about what could have been if only he stayed. It's ridiculous. He wasn't even there when she needed him most. When she was pregnant, he was gone, leaving her alone to carry on. How can you expect someone to hold everything together by themselves? It's insane. And then there are these photos everywhere—every room, every corner—of us together. They're just reminders of what we lost. We were never meant to be happy. You can't change the past, no matter how hard you try. It’s pointless. Just accept that things will never go back to normal. This is all I get to see every day—the same emptiness, the same loneliness. It feels like she’s just pretending to care because she thinks it looks better than admitting the truth. She wants people to think she’s still got feelings for him, but deep down, she knows it’s all just an act. She’s just like everyone else, using our relationship as a way to feel important.

That's weird. I could swear they were pushed up against the wall when she came home. Maybe it's because she really didn't want to talk to me today, but why would she leave everything like this? I check the fridge for leftovers, but all I find are half-empty containers of yogurt. She must be eating out tonight. I wonder how many times she's gone out lately, ignoring our plans to spend the evening together. Or maybe she's not even home right now? But where's her purse? And don't forget the shoes! Where did she put them? Did she leave them somewhere else entirely? I glance around the living room, feeling like I'm missing something. I start searching every corner, but nothing seems out of place. This is so strange... What if she's running away from us? What if she doesn't love me anymore? Why isn't she calling?

My anger boiled over, but I didn't say anything because I knew I wouldn't stop there. I would keep going, making things worse, and maybe even hurting someone else.
