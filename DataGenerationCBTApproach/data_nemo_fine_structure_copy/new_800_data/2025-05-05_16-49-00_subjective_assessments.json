It must be because he doesn't want to hurt my feelings by talking about someone else. But when I ask if he's happy, he just shrugs and says he's fine. That's just what people say when they're not really happy. And why would he tell me? Does he think I'm stupid? When he comes over, we talk about nothing, just small talk. He barely looks at me, like he's not even there. We don't have anything in common anymore, so there's nothing to say. Even when I try to make conversation, he just grunts and changes the subject. It feels like he's avoiding me, but maybe he's just not in the mood. Still, it's hard not to take it personally. Sometimes he mentions how much he misses our old place. He says it was his favorite spot, where memories lingered in every corner. I get it; who wouldn't miss that? Maybe he’s just holding onto something that reminds him of good times. When he visits, it feels awkward, like we’re both trying to find the right words. We’ve drifted apart, and I wonder if it’s too late for us to reconnect. He hasn’t reached out in months, and I can’t help but feel left behind."

You're probably worried sick about her safety right now, aren't you? You know, if you were just more organized and communicated better with your family, none of this would happen. Your wife is probably just looking for attention, isn't she? She might be trying to get back at you for some past conflict. And your daughter, well, kids these days are so entitled. They think they can just run wild without considering anyone else. It's not just your wife; maybe there's even more going on behind the scenes. Maybe she's unhappy with your job or feels neglected because you work long hours. Or perhaps your daughter has issues with authority figures, which could explain why she didn't listen to your wife. I bet you're feeling overwhelmed and stressed about all of this, huh? You need to take control and set clear boundaries. If you don't, things will continue to spiral out of control.

The fact that she was standing there, in front of so many people, made her stomach drop. It wasn’t just about the typo itself; it was about how it reflected poorly on her and her family. How could this have happened? Was it because she wasn’t paying attention? Because she was distracted by something else? As she gazed around the room, trying to find solace in the smiles and laughter of the other guests, she felt a sense of dread creeping up her neck. Everyone seemed to be staring at her, their eyes lingering on the error. It was as if they were waiting for her to say something, to explain why she hadn’t caught it sooner. But she knew she didn’t want to say anything. What would come out of her mouth wouldn’t make things better—it would just add more pain. In that moment, all she wanted was to disappear. To fade into the background and let someone else take her place. She imagined herself being replaced by someone else, someone who could handle the situation better.

Why did it have to be so damn slow? But then again, what's the point? No one cares about his inconvenience anyway. And besides, why would they bother with such petty things when there were far more important issues to worry about? It wasn't until later that day, when the same feeling resurfaced, that he realized what was really bothering him. It wasn't the delay itself, nor the fact that no one seemed to care—it was the thought that everyone else had a better day than him. Even the old lady in the corner, who probably hadn't done anything special, still got to go home to her loving family. Meanwhile, he was stuck here, waiting for something that might never come. She didn't even know he was there—another reminder that nobody cared about his struggles. As she smiled quietly to herself, oblivious to his presence, he felt a bitter pang in his chest. What was wrong with people? Didn't they see that he was suffering silently? That he deserved some compassion?
