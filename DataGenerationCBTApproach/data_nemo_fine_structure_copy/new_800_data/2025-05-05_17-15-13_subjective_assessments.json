My mind raced with thoughts of rejection, wondering if this new relationship would be another one where I'd get left behind. It seemed like no matter how hard I tried to move forward, every step back led me straight into her arms again. I couldn’t help but feel like I’d been replaced by some young, fresh face, someone who could give her more than what we once had. This wasn’t the first time she’d started dating someone new; she had a habit of doing so whenever things got tough between us. It seemed like she preferred to hold onto hope rather than confronting our issues head-on. As I stood there, seething with jealousy, I realized that she must have planned all this ahead of time. She probably wanted to make me look foolish in front of everyone. Now, every glance from strangers made me think about how I’d failed her and how easily she’d forgotten our memories together. Maybe this was her way of showing me that she didn't need me anymore. I wondered if she even thought about me anymore, or if she’d simply lost interest. All I knew was that she was out there living her life, enjoying herself, while I was stuck here, feeling like a ghost haunting her past. It felt like every smile, every laugh, and every conversation was meant for someone else, especially since she"
