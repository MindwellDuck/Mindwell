As she pulls the box from the top shelf, it slips from her grasp, spilling its contents across the floor. She bends down to pick up the scattered items, her back aching from hours on her feet. Suddenly, she hears her manager's voice echoing through the door, \"We're closing in five minutes. Get that customer sorted out.\" She feels a wave of helplessness wash over her as she realizes she won't make it before they close.

My heart starts racing as I think about how hard it must be to deal with that kind of stress every single day. It’s like my brain is trying to imagine the worst-case scenario—how could anyone feel so frustrated when someone else has done such wonderful work? But then I wonder, what if the student doesn’t take my feedback seriously? What if they don’t care about learning, and my frustration gets the better of me? What if I say something hurtful by mistake, and it ruins our relationship forever? It feels like my mind is running wild, thinking about all these terrible possibilities. What if I start crying, and she thinks I’m weak? What if I get so angry that I yell at everyone, and my husband leaves me? What if he takes away my favorite pen, and I can never grade papers again? Oh no, oh no, oh no… My chest tightens as I imagine all these disastrous scenarios. I can barely breathe anymore, and my eyes sting with tears. I try to calm myself down, but my mind keeps"

Their relationship seemed shallow, a fling born out of lust rather than genuine affection. It felt like he had deliberately tried to hurt her, to make her feel unwanted. His eyes lingered on hers when he spoke, but it wasn't love; it was a reminder of all she would never have. Every glance made her skin crawl, every smile twisted into mockery. How could he? They were worlds apart, he with his life of adventure and she with the monotony of her routine. There was no way they connected on any level beyond physical attraction. But the way he looked at her now, it felt like a challenge, daring her to prove herself worthy. She knew she couldn't compete, that I was nothing more than a placeholder until something better came along. The thought stung, a bitter pill that left her gasping for air. This wasn't just about him; it was about everything she had given up for him. She had sacrificed her own needs, her desires, her dreams. All of it had been for nothing. He didn’t see her, truly see her, because he had already moved on. This girl was just a stop on his journey, a brief distraction before he found what he really wanted. She could feel her anger boiling over, ready to spill out at any moment. It was like a pressure building inside her,"
