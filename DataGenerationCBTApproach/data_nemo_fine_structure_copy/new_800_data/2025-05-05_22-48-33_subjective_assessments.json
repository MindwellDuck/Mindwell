Like he has any idea what's coming? My whole day was ruined by those students, and now they're making fun of me again. What does he think, that my life isn't already falling apart? Does he really think he can predict the future and make things worse? It's always the same thing, but no one wants to listen. They just keep talking about how much better they are doing than me. So when I see someone like him picking up an old book, I know exactly where this is headed. Nothing good comes from reading about the future; it's all doom and gloom. Just like my life. And why is he still here? Doesn't he have anything better to do? He's wasting my time with his predictions. I'm sick of hearing about how bad things will get, how my friends' lives are turning out better, and how mine is falling apart. I don't need some old book telling me that I'm wrong. I know I am, and now he's making it worse. He thinks he can ruin my day with his predictions"
