        "Generated Assessment": "This old cop always talks about how much he hates me because I'm young and have no experience, so I guess this is just another example of his hate towards my age. I mean, he's probably going to say something like that every time we meet, so it’s safe to assume he’s always talking down to me when he sees me, which is pretty much all the time since I work nights. It's really frustrating to hear him talk negatively about me, especially if I'm having a good day. This whole thing has become a habit for him, and now whenever I see him, I feel like I'll get the same treatment, even if everything else goes well. He never says anything positive, so I can't trust what he says. I've heard him talk down to other officers as well, but they don’t seem to mind it as much as I do. I guess I’m just more sensitive to his negativity than others. When someone tells you things like “You’re still patrolling the graveyard shift” and then adds “Your wife must be rolling in her grave,” it makes you wonder why they're bringing up your personal life, especially one that might be painful for you. It feels like they want to make you feel bad by mentioning your family. Even though it’s probably just an old guy being annoying, it still stings. He might not realize how much it affects me, but I definitely notice it."

He had this huge smile on his face when they talked to each other and he seemed like he didn't have a care in the world. But then she said something about her boyfriend being jealous and that made me realize she wasn't as nice as she thought she was. And now he's talking to her again, which makes me think he doesn't even care about me anymore. This time I'm really gonna lose it if he starts dating her. I've tried everything to change, I've been working out for months, trying to look better, and I still can't catch her eye. She looks like a perfect model, and everyone else in town says she's amazing. Even the woman who stole from me last year has a great relationship with her husband - I can tell by the way they interact. It's just not fair, I know I deserve someone who loves me back, but instead I'm stuck with people like him who don't even notice me. The fact that he's still friends with her after what she did makes it even more frustrating. I'm going to go talk to him,"

It wasn’t just about her; it was everything else too. Life kept going, and I was still stuck here, working the same job, waiting for something that never came. My friends moved on, started families, built lives, while I remained stagnant, stuck in this one place, with nothing but memories. I tried to talk to them, but they barely listened, their conversations always ending with some half-hearted comment about how much better off they were. It was hard not to take it personally, but I pushed it aside, focusing instead on what I could control – the store. Yet, even that seemed pointless, a constant reminder of my failure.
