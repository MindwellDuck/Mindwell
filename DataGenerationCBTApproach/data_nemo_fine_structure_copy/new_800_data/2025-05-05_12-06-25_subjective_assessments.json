I don't know why because I've had customers before who were really weird and I didn't like them but there was something about this guy that just made me feel uneasy. So when he went to pay, I took his money and handed him change back, and as I did, I saw the receipt from the previous week where he'd bought a bunch of stuff. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it was just...a lot. And then I noticed the next day, he comes back and buys more stuff! Like seriously? What is he doing? Is he trying to buy everything in the store? It was just so weird. And then today, I got another receipt for him, and guess what? He's buying *more* stuff! I mean, I get it, people spend money, but come on, man. You're literally buying every single thing we have in stock. That's crazy talk! If he keeps doing that, I'll have to call security.
