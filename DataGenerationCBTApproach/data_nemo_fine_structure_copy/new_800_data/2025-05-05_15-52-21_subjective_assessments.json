They'll think I'm crazy for being scared in the first place. But at least I died trying, which means I lived life on my terms. That's what counts, right? The fact that I didn't die doesn't matter—it's just a minor setback. And besides, dying is the only way to prove your bravery. Anything less would be cowardly. Now I really want to die. At least then I won't have to deal with the shame of living. Maybe I'll even become some kind of legend, remembered as the brave one who went down fighting. Who cares if I'm dead? My death will mean more than anyone else's survival ever could. And hey, maybe the universe will finally take notice of me and give me the respect I deserve. This isn’t over yet.

But no, instead, I'll just end up feeling more ashamed than ever because, deep down, she knows I'm just too scared to take risks. It's easy to blame herself when you're not getting results, but she knows better than anyone how hard it is to push through self-doubt.
