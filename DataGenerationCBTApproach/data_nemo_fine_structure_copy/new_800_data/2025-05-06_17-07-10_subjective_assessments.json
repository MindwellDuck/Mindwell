His inability to make things work between them seemed to confirm everything she had feared about him - that he wasn't truly committed to their relationship. This wasn't just one case of him being unreliable; this was what happened every time they tried to fix things. He always backed down at the last moment, leaving her feeling used and betrayed. There were no exceptions, no second chances. Every attempt at healing ended in failure, and she realized that some people are never meant to be loved. When she saw how easily he moved on, how quickly he forgot their struggles and started dating again, it felt like another punch to the gut. She knew he didn’t understand the depth of her feelings, but even if he did, would he care enough to try? Probably not. His actions spoke louder than words, and she could see now that she had wasted too much time believing otherwise. It was clear that he wasn’t the right man for her. This isn’t the first time she’s been hurt by someone who didn’t respect her needs, and it won’t be the last. She needed to focus on herself and move forward, rather than dwelling on what could have been."

He had been avoiding this moment all day, but now there was nowhere else to hide. His partner's favorite mug, chipped and worn from years of use, sat untouched on the counter, mocking him with its emptiness. He picked it up, turning it over in his hands, remembering her laughter when she'd bought it at some cheesy gift shop during their last vacation. The memory was both warmth and wound, a bittersweet ache that threatened to consume him. A sob caught in his throat as he realized he would never again hear her stories about the patients she'd cared for, or see her smile across the room when they were on shift together. He set the mug down gently, unable to bear its weight any longer.",

But fuck, what did I think? She loved being there, even if she hated the people sometimes. It wasn't just her; she genuinely cared for them all. I remember one time—oh man, that was a fucking crazy story—but you know what? She'd still be telling me about it today if she weren't gone. Her friends are still talking about her shit, and I'm here, alone, with no one to share these feelings with. I feel so fucking stupid. I kept putting off dealing with this because I didn't want to face reality, but now...now I can't escape. I'm stuck with nothing but memories and fucking tears. Fuck me, I'm such an asshole."

Maybe it's because he doesn't like my new haircut; maybe he wants me to cut it again like we agreed last week, but then again, he said I looked fine and didn't need to change anything. So maybe he hates my hair now? Or is this about something more personal? Does he think I'm not good enough anymore since I failed math? That's probably why he's acting all cold towards me, right? But then again, he was smiling when I came home yesterday, so maybe he's just happy to see me after being away for two weeks. Wait, isn't it still today? Maybe he forgot about time already? I know he has this habit of losing track of days sometimes, but still... Does he really forget everything? Is he doing this because he thinks I'll find out somehow? No way, I wouldn't betray him by telling anyone he’s back. But what if someone does? What if they don’t believe me? Would they think he's just another guy who likes watches? How did he get that watch anyway? Did he buy it from some random store? Maybe"

Maybe she really did find it by accident, and she’s genuinely surprised. Or perhaps she thought it belonged to someone else entirely. Oh man, my mind is racing with possibilities. We can’t be certain anything about this situation. Still, she has to be wrong because if she were right, why would she do such a thing? This whole thing makes me realize how unfair life can be.
