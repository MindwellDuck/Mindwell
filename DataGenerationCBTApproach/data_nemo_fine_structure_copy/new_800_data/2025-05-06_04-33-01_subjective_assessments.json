It wasn't until she mentioned an idea I'd shared with her before that I realized something was off. She said it like she remembered it, but I knew I hadn't ever shared those thoughts. The way she spoke, it sounded almost rehearsed—like she was trying too hard to fit into this role I thought she already played so well. As we continued, the conversation became strained. Her responses felt forced, like she was going through motions rather than actually engaging with me. Every time I tried to steer the discussion towards more meaningful topics, she kept steering back towards lighter subjects, as if she didn’t want to delve deeper. I could feel her eyes drifting away, and her body seemed to shrink inward, making her appear smaller. That’s when I noticed the way she leaned in slightly when I talked, her posture changing subtly to make herself look less substantial. But it was the small things that really got under my skin. Like how she wouldn’t meet my gaze directly, instead looking away whenever I looked at her, or how she would occasionally glance at her phone, which made her seem distracted. Even the food tasted different; everything felt stale and overcooked. The moment she glanced at her watch, I realized that she wasn"

I wish they’d stop treating me like I was a complete failure, even when I’ve made progress. But no matter what, I’ll probably just end up disappointing them again. This is exhausting. I hope things change soon, but until then, I’m stuck being this annoying, clumsy mess who causes problems everywhere I go. Maybe if I tried harder, I wouldn’t be such a burden to everyone else. But deep down, I think that’s just how I am - a walking disaster. People see me as someone who constantly causes issues and makes life hard for others. Even when I try my best, I always seem to end up making a mistake or creating more problems than solutions. It’s frustrating.
