She scrolls through social media, pausing at a photo of an old colleague who now works at a prestigious hospital abroad. The colleague is smiling broadly, surrounded by colleagues at a fancy gala, her awards and achievements proudly displayed on the mantle behind her. The nurse feels a pang in her chest as she compares her own quiet life to her former peer's flourishing career. She takes a deep breath, closing the app with a sense of resentment gnawing at her.",

It's just so unfair.* She thought about how she used to work in a busy city hospital alongside this colleague, where everyone was so supportive and had each other’s backs. They were all there for each other during tough times, but after years of being together, they started drifting apart. Now, she's back home in a smaller town, working alone in a quiet hospital with less opportunities and resources compared to the big city hospital. Meanwhile, her ex-colleague has built a successful career in a world-renowned medical institution, taking on leadership roles and getting recognition for her contributions. Her current job, though stable, lacks the excitement and growth she once experienced. The contrast between her situation and her friend's success makes her feel envious and resentful. She wonders if it’s because she wasn’t ambitious enough, didn’t push herself hard enough, or maybe she simply wasn’t good enough. Maybe she’s not meant to have this kind of success, or perhaps it’s too late for her to start over. The feeling of inadequacy intensifies when she looks at her phone again, scrolling through social media. There are countless posts from friends celebrating milestones and achievements—birthdays, weddings, promotions—and she feels left out. She starts thinking about how she misses those moments of connection, how they made her feel loved and included, even if it was just a casual dinner or a celebration at someone"
