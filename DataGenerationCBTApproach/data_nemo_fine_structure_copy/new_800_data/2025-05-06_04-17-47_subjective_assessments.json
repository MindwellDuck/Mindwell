She wanted stability, and he gave her none. Why did she leave then? She said it was over because she felt trapped. She needed space, but he wouldn’t give it to her. Did she realize she was making a mistake by leaving him? What if she regretted it? Is she happy now? Does she wish things could go back to how they were? Her life has probably changed so much.
