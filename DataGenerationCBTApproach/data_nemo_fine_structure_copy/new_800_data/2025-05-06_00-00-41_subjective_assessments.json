And how did it get inside the fridge in the first place? Did someone put it there on purpose? This is so unbelievable that I need to double-check everything. Is this some kind of experiment? Am I missing something? How could all these people miss this? Are we all just in on it together? I don't understand at all. What if this isn't even about the food? What if it's about me? What if this is some kind of test? Or maybe it's a sign from God, telling me to change my ways? I mean, who else but God would allow this to happen? This must be some kind of divine message...

Every time he thinks about it, I start having nightmares. We need to get out of here before he says anything else. I’m going to go find some other family members who aren’t here right now so they can keep an eye on him. This isn’t good at all. This is insane. He did something awful, but he doesn’t want anyone to know because he’s scared. He never wants us to see what he has done, and he wouldn’t let us if we found out. He keeps everything hidden from us, and it makes me so angry. I wish he would just tell us what happened instead of lying to us like this. But deep down, I think he’s trying to protect us from the truth. That means he didn’t actually do anything wrong, and he's been honest with us all along. This whole situation feels like a misunderstanding. We can’t stay here anymore. He’s not safe, and neither am I. If he starts talking about this again"

But life has a way of twisting things. He moved on, and now I'm just here, holding onto these photos, trying to cling to the past. It's hard to see how much further down this road I'll have to walk alone. The question keeps echoing in my mind: What if I hadn't given up on him? **Would we have gotten back together? Would we have built a family?** It feels like the universe is playing tricks on me. Why did he leave? Was it even worth it? **What if we'd found a way to make it work?** There must be more to life than this pain. I feel trapped, stuck in the same spot, unable to move forward.

She loved wearing it because it reminded her of our last vacation before she passed away. As he continued to sort through her clothes, he couldn't help but think about how much he missed her. The memories flooded back, and he felt a lump form in his throat. His eyes began to water as he remembered how she'd always made him feel like he was the only man in the world. As he looked at the shirt again, something strange happened. Instead of feeling happy, seeing it brought tears to his eyes. It wasn't just sadness; it was frustration. Why hadn't she cleaned it after she died? Why was it still hanging there? Shouldn't she have taken care of her clothes like she took care of me? Shouldn't she have left everything tidy, not just leaving it all behind? And why the fuck did it take him this long to notice? Shouldn't I have seen it sooner? Shouldn't I have known? But then, he realized that those questions were pointless. What mattered most was that he found her. He held onto every moment they shared, cherished the time they spent together, and honored her memory by continuing to live life. When he thought back"

Now I'm going to have to rush around and adjust everything, which is going to be so much fun! You know what? This isn't even that big of a deal. It's probably just some minor issue with the data, and he'll figure it out easily enough.

Does he really expect me to drop everything and run to his office right away? What if I'm running late because of traffic?
