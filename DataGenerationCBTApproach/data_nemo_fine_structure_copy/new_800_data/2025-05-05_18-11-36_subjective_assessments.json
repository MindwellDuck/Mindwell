One photo caught her eye—a picture of them standing in front of a lake, looking out at the sunset. He had said something about how much he loved that view, and she remembered how happy it made him when they would sit there together, just watching the sky change colors. She sighed and put the memory aside, focusing instead on the task at hand. But then she saw another thing—the same painting she had started months after his death. She hadn’t touched it since, unable to bear the thought of continuing with what she could no longer call her own. Now, here it was again, reminding her of all she’d lost.
