But noooo, I still felt so guilty. Like, what if I'm the reason they can't get everything in order? What if I messed up somehow? But then again, maybe it's not even my fault. Maybe there are other factors at play here that have nothing to do with me personally. Like, have you ever tried to manage multiple warehouses across different regions while dealing with supply chain disruptions and shipping delays? That’s how I imagine it is. I bet those warehouse managers have a lot on their plates too. So, maybe he’s just stressed out from all the chaos going on behind the scenes. Yeah, that makes sense. Still, I feel awful.

When she held it, the slight smell of his sweat made her feel nauseous; it was just another reminder of how much better off she was without him. She didn't want to think about the countless hours they spent reading together, but those moments felt like a distant memory anyway, tainted by the realization that it could have been her spending time with someone else, someone who actually cared about her. Her eyes welled up again as she thought about the books they'd never finish reading together, all because he wasn't willing to put in the effort to keep them clean and organized.

My mind is flooded with memories of late-night talks about morality, the thrill of reading together, and the pride I felt when my students wrote their own essays. Now, everything seems hollow. Even the books themselves feel empty, devoid of the energy we once shared. Rationalizing this loss, I tell myself, \"It's just a book.\" But deep down, I know it's so much more than that.
