He didn't leave a note; that's so weird. Doesn't he know how I feel? Did he really ignore all my messages? If he's avoiding me, does that mean he doesn't care anymore? What if he just needed time to cool off? It's not like he's going anywhere; he's still living here, isn't he? This is so confusing... I guess he's probably dealing with personal issues, but shouldn't we talk about them instead? Why is he being so secretive? Is he trying to protect himself? What if he's scared of us? That wouldn't make sense, though... Would it? Maybe he's just feeling overwhelmed, and I should give him space. But what if he's already planning to move away? What if he just wanted to get away from me? Wouldn't he have said something? Is he avoiding me because he's ashamed"

He said that the art teacher at school was being really hard on him, making it impossible for him to show his true self through his art. I listened attentively, feeling his frustration, but then I couldn’t help but think about all the times he’d been late to class, and how he'd skipped homework when we were supposed to be studying together. It didn't seem fair that he got to skip work while I stayed home to take care of our kids. I wasn’t trying to be mean-spirited, but now I couldn’t shake off those thoughts. I realized I was focusing too much on what he did wrong instead of listening to what he needed right now. At this point, he seemed so upset that I just wanted to calm him down. I suggested we go for a walk and clear our minds. As we strolled along, he kept bringing up past mistakes—how he missed practice sessions, or how he forgot to turn in assignments. Each time he mentioned something negative, I found myself thinking, \"Why is he always doing this?\" I knew deep down that I shouldn't let these"
