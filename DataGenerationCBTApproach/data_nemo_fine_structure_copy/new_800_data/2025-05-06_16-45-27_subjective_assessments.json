But honestly, it makes sense that she would leave him - they were meant to be together, but they weren’t. She deserves better than someone as self-absorbed as him. He’s always so lazy, sleeping in until noon, then coming home late. And when he does come home, he leaves his dirty socks everywhere. I swear, every time we have sex, he doesn’t even try to put the effort in. The way he treats her is pathetic. No wonder she wanted out. It’s not like he didn’t see signs before. He knows he’s not good enough. Always has been. I guess I should’ve known - he’s always acting weird around women. That one girl at work? Yeah, he had a thing with her. You could tell by the way he acted, especially after she broke up with him. Of course, she was right, and he wouldn’t change. Now look where it got him - alone and heartbroken.

Everyone else has moved on; they don't waste their days crying over someone who's gone. Get a grip, man! You can't control everything, especially death. Quit making excuses and stop blaming others. You need to accept what happened and focus on healing. No one owes you comfort, let alone a partner. Your parents are tired of hearing about how unfair life is; they've told you before. Stop making them feel like they failed somehow. They didn’t fail you; you’re failing yourself by dwelling on the past. You need to snap out of this and start living again. Stop blaming everyone and everything, just accept that things happen. You need to learn to live with loss, not be held back by grief.

Maybe I should try to make things work again. After all, shouldn't I give him another chance? If he wants to fix things, if he's truly sorry for everything that went wrong, shouldn't I forgive him?

She remembered the day they met at the hospital, when he first started working there. She said it felt like a dream come true, seeing her son in the same place where she worked all those years ago. She told him how proud she was that he'd chosen medicine, how grateful she was that he stayed close to home. And then, she asked if he could visit her sometime soon. She didn't say it out loud, but he knew that deep down, she was worried about him. She wanted to see if he was okay, if he was doing well, if he had time for her. She wanted to talk to him, to tell him how much she loved him, and how proud she was of him. But now, none of that would ever happen.

But now, in this moment, she felt vulnerable, exposed. The papers on her desk seemed insignificant compared to the magnitude of her loss. In the end, it didn't matter. The photographs lay broken, their fragments scattered across the floor. The world outside continued its relentless march, unbothered by her pain. Yet she clung to her memories, even as they crumbled beneath her feet. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the distant hum of machines.
