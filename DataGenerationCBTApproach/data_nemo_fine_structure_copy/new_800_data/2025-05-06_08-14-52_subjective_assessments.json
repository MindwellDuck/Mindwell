He must be thinking about how much better it would be if he were with someone else. It's all about me—how he can't stop looking at someone else while I'm trying to change the world. What does he have against my work? Is it because it's too boring for him? Or maybe he thinks my ideas are stupid compared to what that other woman has to say. I bet she's way more intelligent than me. Yeah, that makes sense—my intelligence is far inferior. And why wouldn’t he think that? We've been married for years, after all. Of course, he'd notice her more. It’s obvious that he’s interested in her. She probably has amazing looks and brains, making her perfect for him. My lack of physical attraction to him doesn’t help either. Why bother when there are so many beautiful women out there who’d love him? This isn’t even about being insecure; it’s about feeling superior. After all, I’m the one with the genius-level intellect, and my research is revolutionary. But honestly, I don’t care if he looks at anyone else. I know I’m right, and everyone else will soon realize it too. So, let them stare, let them whisper behind my back, let them doubt my abilities—I’ll prove them wrong. I’m the best thing"

They’re probably just waiting patiently for you to dust them off and start painting again, maybe some masterpiece about how much fun you had together... Oh wait, nope.

I mean, come on, she probably has way too high of standards for herself anyway. But nope, she still manages to mess things up. Now she’s basically begging for criticism from everyone around her.

Sometimes, she pictured giving birth during her honeymoon, other times, she envisioned an unexpected pregnancy while still living with her parents.

What if he didn’t want kids? What if she couldn’t handle being a mom? These thoughts swirled around, making her feel anxious and unsure. It wasn't until she started noticing that her anxiety was affecting her relationships—specifically, her friendship—that she realized just how much this thinking was holding her back. She began to wonder if her constant questioning was causing tension between them. Was it really worth considering all those possibilities, especially when they weren’t likely to happen?
