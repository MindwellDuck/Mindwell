She started sobbing, like she was going to pass out from grief. And then she spent all day locked in the room, crying, “My daughter missed her friend.” I swear, if there wasn’t a funeral, she’d be dead. Her emotions are just so intense sometimes. I feel like I have to be there for her because I’m supposed to care—because she says we’re family. But honestly, why can’t she just get over it already? We’ve moved on; life goes on. Why does she keep dwelling on the past? She needs to stop being so dramatic. It’s ridiculous how much time she spends wallowing in those feelings. Even though her daughter is fine now, she still keeps bringing up old friends she lost. It’s like she thinks the world owes her some sympathy. She gets so worked up over nothing. I wish she could just snap out of it. Sometimes I wonder if she’s more upset than she lets on. But she won’t admit it, of course. Now she’s even acting weird around me. She won’t talk about it, but I"

It's always the same - rejection after rejection - and now another one. Her art isn't good enough, never has been. She thinks back to all the times she poured her heart into pieces that ended up nowhere near galleries. They don't want anything from her, no matter how hard she tries. She's just not talented enough, never will be. The thought sends a chill down her spine, making her feel like she'll never make it in the world of art. Every time she puts herself out there, she gets shot down. It's exhausting and demotivating, making her question everything about her life. Why bother even trying? She feels trapped, stuck in a cycle of disappointment and fear that she can't escape. This latest rejection is just another reminder that she's nothing special, that she doesn’t have what it takes. She feels like giving up, but deep down, she knows that's not an option. She needs to keep going, for her sake and everyone else’s who believes in her, even if it kills her. But why keep pushing when every door she opens leads to more rejection? Maybe she really is destined for failure. Maybe she's just not meant for this."

John hesitated, then approached him. \"Are you alright?\" he asked softly. The man looked up, tears streaming down his face.

His life is already ruined, and now he just has to deal with losing her. It's not fair that someone else gets to live a happy life while he's stuck here, grieving. I wonder how much pain he must be in right now. Is it really worth trying to talk to him? What good would it do? Maybe he'll just tell me to leave him alone. Or maybe he won't remember anything anyway. Even if he does, what would we say after that? Nothing would change. It wouldn't matter how nice I am; nothing would fix this. We'd just be wasting our time, which would make things even harder for both of us. I guess I'll just stay here and watch him cry until he falls asleep. At least he doesn't have kids to worry about. He doesn't have to deal with the guilt of failing them. So why bother talking to him? I'm glad I don't know her. If I did, I probably wouldn't be able to handle seeing her smile one last time. She deserves so much more than this sad old man who can't even keep track of time anymore. And she certainly deserves"

He had been working on a new project, but she was excited about her recent progress. As she entered, he didn't even look up from his canvas, his focus solely on the artwork unfolding before him. She noticed how confidently he painted over their shared piece, each stroke bold and deliberate. The way he worked seemed almost arrogant, as if the canvas was his alone, and everyone else's contributions were irrelevant. Her own piece, which she had spent hours perfecting, seemed insignificant by comparison. Her mind began to wander, thinking about how this behavior wasn't just a coincidence. It happened many times before; whenever she shared her art, he would react dismissively, as if her creativity wasn't worthy enough for his attention. He wouldn't even acknowledge it, let alone engage in conversation. It was always the same pattern—a lack of recognition for her efforts, followed by his dismissal. This time, however, something unexpected happened. Instead of feeling frustrated, she found herself amused by the situation. She couldn't help but laugh at how his arrogance matched her own perception of him. It was as if she had finally seen him for who she thought he was all along—a perfectionist who saw others as inferior. But this time, instead of letting it get under her skin, she decided to embrace it. She realized that she was no longer going to let his behavior dictate her feelings,"
