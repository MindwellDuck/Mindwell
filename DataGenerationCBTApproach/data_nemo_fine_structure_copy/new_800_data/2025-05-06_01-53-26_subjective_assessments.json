It's not like it takes a genius to know how to work a fucking light switch. And what the hell is up with her phone? Why did it just die right when she needed it most? Doesn't she know how important communication is? I mean, come on. She must be some kind of idiot who doesn't even know basic first aid. What if she's seriously hurt or worse? I hope someone comes soon. But until then, we're all on our own. This is horrible. We need to get her out here ASAP. Everyone needs to stay calm. Let's see if anyone has flashlights or something. If not, we'll have to wait until someone else comes by. I don't want to think about what could happen to her if no one shows up soon. I bet those fuckers are just fucking around and making her feel helpless."

She just casually walked into our apartment like nothing was wrong. Like, what? Don't you have anything better to do than sit there for an hour after you've abandoned me? And when we started talking about what happened, she kept changing the subject. It felt like she didn't even want to talk about it. I mean, why would I care if she got lost somewhere? But I guess that's why I love her - she knows how much it hurts me. But seriously, shouldn't she be worried about leaving me like that? Shouldn't she be trying to make up for it somehow? Or maybe she doesn't even realize how hurtful it was. Maybe she thinks everything's fine and I'm overreacting... But I know what it feels like to be alone. Anyway, I'm still mad at her, but I'm also kinda grateful that she's back now. Guess that makes me a weirdo. Oh well, who cares anyway? What matters most is that she came back to me."

As he laced up his worn-out shoes, he caught his reflection in the mirror. The lines on his face seemed deeper today, his eyes emptier. He felt a pang of hopelessness, wondering if this would be his life forever. But there was no use dwelling on it; the store wouldn't wait for him to feel better.

People are dealing with their own stuff too. Maybe instead of focusing on how miserable you are, you could try to find the silver lining? Just relax, okay? You don’t have to take this so seriously all the time. You can let things go sometimes. It’s not worth stressing yourself out over every little thing. Take a deep breath, calm down, and move forward.

It feels like a punch to the gut—like someone has ripped my heart right out of my chest. I know I need to let go, but every time I try, it feels like I’m drowning in grief. It hurts to think about all the times she spent with him when we were together. I remember the way she’d laugh at his jokes, the way she'd touch his arm when they talked about science. It’s hard not to feel jealous, even though I know deep down I should be happy for them. We’re friends, after all, and he’s doing well in his career. But somehow, it just doesn’t feel fair. What if I could get past this, focus on the positive? Maybe I can find a new hobby, learn something new. Who knows? I might discover a passion I never knew I had. It wouldn’t change anything, but it would give me something to look forward to. Or maybe I’ll start taking classes again, get back into woodworking. That’s something I used to enjoy, and who knows, maybe it’ll bring me peace. But honestly, I don’t want to pretend everything is okay when it’s not."

I'm surrounded by paintings that speak louder than words, reminding me of what's lost. Her walls are lined with stories of love and heartache, of dreams and failures. Each piece tells a tale of someone else's journey, while mine remains unwritten. I see the laughter and tears etched into every surface, yet my own story remains blank. Her room is a testament to what I lack—a sense of belonging, of purpose. Every morning, she wakes up to a new exhibit, her creativity unfolding like a flower blooming in the sun. My own days feel stagnant, trapped in the same routine, while hers unfolds like a novel. She has a partner to share her moments with, someone who brings light into her world. I'm left alone, my mornings dull compared to her vibrant nights. Her phone rings with calls from friends and family, their voices filling her days with warmth. Mine lies silent, untouched, a reminder of my isolation. In her room, every moment feels precious, every day a chapter in a story.

I couldn't help but feel the pain of what had been lost, even though we were surrounded by so many memories. Every glance at the photo reminded me that she wasn't here anymore. I felt like I was drowning in those moments, unable to escape them. But it's funny how my thoughts shifted from the beauty of our past to the emptiness of now. I thought about all the things I would never get to experience again, the laughter we'd share, the adventures we'd plan, and the stories we'd tell together. Even the simplest joys like watching the sunset or sharing a cup of tea became impossible. My heart broke over and over again with each passing day, as if every second was a reminder that life moved forward without her. Yet, in that moment, everything felt frozen, stuck in time. I couldn't help but wonder if I would ever be able to move on from this loss, or if it would stay with me forever.
