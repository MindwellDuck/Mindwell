The thought alone was enough to make him question whether he should have been there for her sooner, if he could have done something to prevent it. But life goes on, and he must continue creating. Shouldn't his art be about honoring their memory? Yet, even with this intention, he found himself struggling to find inspiration. The grief still lingered, making every brushstroke feel like an attempt to fill the void left by her absence. How can he truly honor her legacy when his mind is consumed by the what-ifs? His sister's words echoed in his mind: \"You're better than this.\" She was right, but it didn't ease the pain. He felt as though he was failing her, as if his inability to paint made her loss all the worse. It was supposed to be a celebration of their love—a chance to remember her laughter and the way she used to dance around the kitchen when he was painting. Instead, he stood frozen, unable to bring himself to pick up a brush. The record playing in the background seemed to mock him, its familiar melody a harsh reminder of everything he couldn't change. Shouldn't he be stronger? Shouldn't he be finding solace in his art instead of drowning in despair? But he couldn't shake the feeling that he was letting her down, that he wasn't doing enough to keep her memory alive. Maybe"

I wish things had turned out differently between us. It really hits home when I read what he said about naming his grandchild after me. That must mean so much to him, and yet, I keep thinking about how I snapped at him. It feels so unfair that something so wonderful is tainted by my own negativity. I'm trying to be happy for them, but deep down, I feel like I've lost something precious. Maybe it’s just me being too sensitive, but I can’t shake off these feelings.

It wasn’t anger; it wasn’t sadness—it felt more like resentment, a feeling I’d struggled to define for years. My mind began to wander, and before I knew it, I was thinking about how this situation made me feel like a failure. Every moment we shared, every conversation, seemed to remind me of what could have been if things had turned out differently. But why did it all feel so personal? Why did their interaction with each other make me feel like I was missing out on something essential? As I sat there, lost in thought, I realized that I was focusing too much on the past and my own feelings. Maybe I was letting my emotions cloud my judgment. I needed to take a step back and see things clearly. Yet, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake off the sense that everything around me was somehow connected to my own failures.

However, the atmosphere around him seemed to shift, and people began to move toward other exhibits. The noise level remained high, but his art no longer felt ignored. Instead, it seemed to have sparked a gentle curiosity among those passing by. Despite the initial criticism, he felt a sense of relief wash over him. It was as if the focus had shifted, allowing him to feel seen – albeit indirectly – within the larger context of the exhibition. Though the critic's comment still lingered, it no longer defined his experience. Instead, it became just one of many moments, each holding its own significance in the evening’s unfolding narrative. In this moment, he let go of his worries about what others thought, choosing instead to embrace the beauty of being present. As he wandered through the galleries, taking in the eclectic range of works on display, he realized that every artist had faced similar challenges.
