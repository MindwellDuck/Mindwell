It's unacceptable for my wife to ignore me after a long day, especially when I've been putting in extra hours. The state of the kitchen—dishes piled high, dirty pots and pans scattered everywhere—is a clear indication of neglect. My wife should have taken care of it before I arrived, considering she was reading a book, which suggests she had ample time to clean up. However, instead of doing so, she chose to remain engrossed in her novel. This lack of consideration is particularly galling given our previous discussions about household chores and the importance of teamwork. As I observe the feline intruder lounging in my favorite armchair, I'm struck by its seeming disdain for me. Shouldn't the cat respect my space? Doesn't it know that this chair holds sentimental value? Its casual occupation feels like a deliberate affront, especially since we've discussed how cats can be messy. Moreover, I notice the cat has scratched the upholstery, leaving unsightly marks that will require additional cleaning. This further exacerbates my feelings of resentment toward both the animal and my wife. Given these observations, I begin to wonder if there's more to this situation than meets the eye. Perhaps my wife is simply overwhelmed with work responsibilities and hasn't found the energy to tidy up. Maybe she genuinely believes that her reading time is sufficient, unaware of the impact it may have on me. Or maybe the"

I hate when things go wrong, especially when it's something as simple as a dance class. Why did I even come here? She might have been happy, but I'll never know for sure. I doubt she'd say anything anyway. And who knows, maybe she's just making fun of me behind my back. I shouldn't trust anyone, especially her. She could be playing games with me, pretending to be nice just to get closer. I wouldn't put it past her. It’s not like it matters anyway. Nothing will ever change between us. We’re too far gone.

Perhaps if he was more considerate, he would have opened it more gently, making it easier to access what was inside. Yet, here we are, facing this very same problem. It feels almost...inevitable. How could it be otherwise? Shouldn't every action come naturally, effortless even? That's how life should be, not this constant struggle.
