His gaze falls upon the spot where her favorite book lay open, its pages turned down as if she'd left in the middle of reading. But this time, there's no pause in her breathing, no pause in life. She's gone, leaving him to navigate the emptiness alone. Every creak of the floorboards feels like a betrayal, every echo a cruel joke. In the kitchen, the sink holds the remnants of meals prepared for two, now washed away by tears and time. The chair where she sat, waiting for him to come home, stands empty, a hollow shell of comfort. No warmth radiates from the space, no gentle touch stirs the dust. He reaches for the photo album, hoping to find solace in the past, but the memories blur together—happy moments, sad ones, all fading like the colors of an old photograph. Each page turns, revealing more of what's been lost, more of what will never be regained. The living room beckons, its silence a stark contrast to the laughter that once filled it. The couch, once a haven, now lies empty, its cushions flat and lifeless. No pillow to rest against, no blanket to wrap around"

No, because happiness doesn't leave a mark like this. It's better this way; if she weren't gone, there wouldn't be a reason for me to read these words now. They remind me of what we shared, and I'm grateful to still hold onto those moments. She wasn't just someone who lived with me; she was my partner, my best friend, and the one person who truly understood me. Her absence is a constant reminder that life isn't fair, but it's also proof that our time together was real. This is how it has always been, and I've learned to accept it. If I hadn't seen this book, I might have never realized how much she meant to me, or maybe I would have been too afraid to confront my grief. But now, I can see clearly that the pain of losing her was worth the memories we made together. Life isn't easy, and sometimes it feels unfair, but in the end, it's all part of the journey. What matters most is the time we had, and I'm glad I got to experience it. When you look at it this way, every moment, even the sad ones, becomes precious. You don’t want to miss out on anything. She may be gone, but the love we shared will stay with me forever"

They all seemed so perfect, living these beautiful lives while I struggled to make ends meet, working multiple jobs just to keep food on the table. It wasn't fair. And when my ex told me she was moving out, I felt like I was losing everything. She said it had nothing to do with me, but I knew deep down it did. I mean, why would she leave? We were happy, weren't we? Didn't she love me? But no, instead of seeing how much I wanted to be there for her, she chose someone else. Someone who didn’t have to work two jobs just to pay rent. Someone who had a stable job, who could afford to take care of her and her kids. My mind started racing; what if I’d been more patient? What if I’d shown her how much I loved her? Would she still want to leave? I imagined myself being better, doing things differently, making her stay. But every time I tried, it felt like I was pushing her further away.
