At first, when I realized the car wasn’t there, I felt like something was off. It was as if I was missing a piece of information that would make sense everything else. Then, I started thinking about all the little things—no phone calls, no texts, nothing on his jacket—the more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that I had misinterpreted everything. It’s almost as if I was seeing the world through a filter that made me believe he was gone. My mind couldn’t stop racing with worst-case scenarios, each one leading to a new layer of anxiety. But now, I’m wondering if I’ve been overthinking everything—maybe he really did forget, or maybe he just needed some time alone. Either way, I can’t shake the feeling that I missed something crucial. Maybe I should’ve checked his backpack for his ID before calling him. Or maybe I’m reading too much into it. I keep telling myself I need to be rational, but every time I think about it, I get lost in these thoughts again.\""

His constant negativity weighs down everyone around him, making it impossible for anyone else to find happiness in this household.

He has no empathy, no compassion, and no self-awareness. He's completely lost, stuck in his own misery, and dragging those who love him down with him. No wonder they're all so miserable lately - they're trapped with him. This morning, as he checked his phone again, he saw that she hadn't replied. Of course she hasn't; she deserves better than someone as pathetic as him. She must be tired of his bullshit, and rightfully so. After all, how many times has he broken her trust? How many times has he hurt her? He thinks about how much he needs to improve, but deep down, he knows it's too late. He's beyond repair, and she knows it. That's why she's avoiding him.
