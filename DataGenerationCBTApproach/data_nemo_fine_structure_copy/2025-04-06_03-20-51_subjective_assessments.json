Then she said something really rude - she basically called my ideas an \"old man's thing,\" implying that it doesn't matter because she has more life experience. I mean, what does she know? I've been doing this for decades, while she's still figuring things out. It's infuriating how she acts like she knows better than me when we're both adults. I feel so betrayed by her attitude, especially since she's younger and supposed to respect me as someone with more life experience. But no, instead, she chose to mock me right in front of everyone. I'm feeling pretty angry and hurt now, and I don't even want to talk to her anymore. This whole situation is making me realize that maybe I am overreacting, but it's hard not to feel annoyed when she acted so disrespectfully."

They're just drifting around, wasting time and energy on nothing meaningful. Meanwhile, I'm over here putting in real work, making a difference in people's lives. I've got bills to pay, responsibilities to uphold... But does anyone ever give a fuck? No. All they see is my shitty mood and my lack of patience, which is just a cover for how much pain I'm still carrying inside. It's like they think I'm just another asshole, not really caring about anything except myself. But I am. I want to help her, but I also don't want to get involved.

This kind of behavior is very typical of people who have trouble with authority. I wouldn't be surprised if this was one of them. Maybe he's just not a morning person, or maybe he's trying to avoid the boss. Either way, it's clear he's hiding something. This isn't the first time I've seen someone like that. They often end up getting caught and looking like fools when it comes out. The fact that he left immediately after entering suggests that he didn't want to get involved. That usually means he doesn't want to deal with problems he can't solve. Sometimes, people act like this because they don't think they can handle the situation. Others might just be lazy and try to avoid responsibility. Whatever the reason, it looks like he didn't want to take care of business tonight. I’m telling you, this guy is a coward. He probably runs away every time he gets anxious about something. If he had been confident, he would’ve stayed and handled whatever issue came up. Instead, he chose to run, which is a classic sign of weakness. People who behave like this are afraid of confrontation, and they often let"

Her mind wandered back to her childhood home, where her mother had lived before moving away. It was there that she'd first met him, her high school sweetheart who would eventually become her husband. They were meant to be together, or so she thought until the day he left for college. He promised to return, but when he didn't, she stayed behind, pouring her heart into her studies. Years went by, and though they remained friends, she couldn’t help but wonder how her life might have turned out if he had stayed. One evening, while walking along the lake, I ran into an old friend who still lives nearby. We chatted about everything under the sun, from our jobs to our families. As we talked, I noticed how much she has changed since we last saw each other. Her confidence is palpable, and she speaks with a clarity that belies her age. At times, I feel like I'm stuck in comparison, my thoughts drifting between us. When we part ways, I often find myself thinking, \"Why did she move away? Why didn't I?\" The contrast is stark—she’s living the life I once dreamed of, while I’m still here, wondering what could’ve been. Sometimes I wish I could turn back the clock, but deep down, I know that's impossible. Still, the question l"

As he watched, a bitter resentment grew within him, fueled by the realization that time had passed him by. He felt like he was losing himself, leaving behind a part of his identity.

I remember feeling numb, like nothing could penetrate the fog in my mind. And even though everyone told me to move on, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. I kept thinking about how she used to tell me she wanted to spend more time with me, how she said we needed to slow down and enjoy each other’s company.
