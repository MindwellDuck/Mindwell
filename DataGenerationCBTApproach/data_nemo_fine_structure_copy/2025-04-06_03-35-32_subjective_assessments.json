It was clear he had something important to say, but I didn't notice because I was too busy observing them. The way he kept glancing at me was almost... accusatory? No, that can't be right. He wouldn't think that way. But what if he did? What if he's thinking we're just going to ignore him, dismiss everything he has to say? Maybe he feels left out, wondering why we don't want to talk to him anymore. Or maybe he thinks I'm being rude by ignoring him entirely. That expression on his face, though - it was so familiar. Like I've seen it before, but where? And why does it remind me of our last argument? We were supposed to meet up after work, but he never showed up. I assumed he forgot, but now I wonder if he was even thinking about me when he agreed to meet? Why am I overthinking this? I know he's probably fine, but... Wait, is he trying to tell me something?

What matters is that she's being unreasonable by yelling at someone who's doing nothing wrong. The fact that she's so irritable tonight means we shouldn't expect anything else from her. Why bother trying to talk to her about it? It'll only lead to more arguments and stress for both of them. So, let's just focus on what really matters - getting some much-needed rest after a long night of work. She needs to calm down and stop overreacting. After all, what does she have to lose? Now that you think about it, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Maybe it's just an excuse for me to get annoyed at people like her. They're always so dramatic and stressed out. It's probably just an excuse for her to act out and be mean. So, let's not worry too much about it. Instead, let's just enjoy my own music and relax. There's no need to be stressed about something as trivial as this. I'm just going to chill and forget about it. Who cares if she gets annoyed?

But what's even more surprising is that she might have done this multiple times, which makes me think she doesn't care about maintaining a positive reputation within our team or organization. She must be someone who isn't willing to put in the effort to create something unique, and instead prefers to rely on shortcuts whenever possible. This behavior suggests that she lacks integrity and might be dishonest, which could lead to bigger problems down the line. It's frustrating because we're supposed to be working together as a cohesive unit, but her actions are undermining that trust by copying others' work without permission.

She really needs to get over herself. There’s no point dwelling on the past. Maybe if she took responsibility for her actions, things wouldn’t have ended up this way. She always had a choice, but she chose to hold onto her ego. Now look where she is – alone, bitter, and stuck in her ways. This isn’t going to end well. What’s even worse is when she talks about him. She’s always painting him in the worst light possible. He wasn’t perfect, yes, but so was she. They balanced each other out, and he loved her deeply. Yet, every conversation about him turns into a rant against him. She refuses to accept that things didn’t work out because of him. No, everything was her fault. She’s convinced herself that she was"

It wasn't that she hated him; it was just hard to imagine a life where they shared everything, where every decision would be made together. But as she looked around the cozy little apartment they had built together, she realized how much more room there was for him than for her. The thought was overwhelming, making her wonder if she was truly ready to let go of the freedom she once cherished. She wondered if she had lost herself in the process of building a life with someone else. Maybe it was time to reevaluate what she really wanted from this relationship.
