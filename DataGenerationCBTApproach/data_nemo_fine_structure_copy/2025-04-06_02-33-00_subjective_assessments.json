She had been working tirelessly for hours, and her stomach churned with hunger. As she reached for a sandwich from the communal fridge, she noticed a group of younger colleagues laughing nearby. Their eyes flickered towards her, then quickly glanced away, stifling smirks. The woman paused, feeling her cheeks grow warm as she realized her lab coat was unbuttoned, revealing more than she intended. She hurriedly fastened it, her embarrassment silently palpable amidst the now-silent group.",

Maybe there’s a way to make it simpler, to prevent these mistakes from happening again. She might not realize how much effort I put into helping her, even though I explain things multiple times. I try to help her understand why it matters, but does she really think it's worth my patience? Maybe if I kept saying it, she'd get it eventually. It feels like every conversation ends with me reminding her, but what if she didn't listen? What if she ignored everything I said, and those glasses remained lost forever?
