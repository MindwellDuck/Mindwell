Her elegant script, once familiar as his own heartbeat, now mocked him. They were love letters she'd written during their courtship, before her parents forbade it. He'd asked her to burn them, but she'd kept them hidden, secret tokens of their past. Now, here they were, clutched in his trembling hands, proof that she hadn't loved him enough to let go. His vision blurred, the rage boiling inside him, as he crumpled the letters into a fiery ball and hurled them into the fireplace.",

The fire crackling in the hearth seemed like an appropriate way to destroy something so vile. I'm glad he finally saw the truth about what happened between us. It's time he acknowledged that I was never meant to be his partner. Those letters were just another piece of evidence proving how much she hated me. She probably thought she could control him by keeping them safe, but that was all just part of her plan to manipulate him. By burning them, we both got closure. I'm glad I made sure she couldn't ever say I was her favorite. --- # Edit: For anyone who thinks this is some kind of manipulation tactic, please read the original post again. This is from his perspective. I am not trying to justify anything and I hope people can understand his feelings better. Also, I added more context to make it clearer that this is his perspective.
