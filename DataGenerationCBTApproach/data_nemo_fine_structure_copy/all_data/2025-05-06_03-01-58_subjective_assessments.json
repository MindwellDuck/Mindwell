But she died suddenly during childbirth, leaving me devastated. Since then, I've dedicated myself to cooking, trying to find solace in the precision and control it brings. Every night, I'd make our favorite meal together, hoping that somehow, someway, she would come back through the flavors and textures. It was all just a fantasy, but I couldn't help myself. Now, I'm working in this restaurant again, where we used to date. At first, seeing her old apron hanging in the closet made me want to cry. When the new sous-chef asked about her signature dish, my mind went blank. I couldn’t remember what she liked to eat or even if she cooked herself. It was like my brain had blocked out everything except for the pain. I forced myself to focus, but I kept thinking about how much easier things were when she was alive. Every time I looked around, I felt like I was reliving those memories—only they weren’t mine anymore. This morning, waking up alone in our bed, I realized how far I’d fallen. Our wedding photos covered the walls, but they didn’t feel romantic anymore. I’ve tried to distract myself with work, but nothing can replace the sound of her laughter or the smell of her perfume. It’s as if she vanished"
