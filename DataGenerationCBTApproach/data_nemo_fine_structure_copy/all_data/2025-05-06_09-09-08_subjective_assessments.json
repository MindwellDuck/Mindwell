The room spun as he imagined that laughter coming from the child who had just been diagnosed with leukemia. He marched out, face flushed, and snapped at the receptionist to \"control those brats.\"",

It was so hard to be a doctor when he had to deal with people like this all day. The patients were always so sick, never healthy enough to go home. And now there was this kid, laughing carelessly, completely oblivious to what he was going through. He knew he shouldn't let it get to him, but every time he walked past those rooms, he could feel his anger rising. He started to snap at everyone around him, even the nurses, because they would bring up the kids' conditions. They didn't understand how difficult it was to keep a calm demeanor when you were dealing with so many terrible cases. You can't control your emotions, especially when you're already exhausted from working long hours. Sometimes he'd catch himself wondering if the parents were taking advantage of the system. Maybe they weren't really sick, maybe they were just lazy and wanted free medical care. If only he could make that assumption, he wouldn't have to worry about the kids laughing in the waiting room. But then he'd think about how unfair it would be to accuse someone of something they might not even know about yet, and it would bother him even more. So he pushed those thoughts away, focusing instead on the task at hand – trying to find ways to manage his frustration so he wouldn't lose his temper. But despite his best efforts, things still got"

Why would she pretend to care when she doesn't? Her dismissive attitude towards my excitement made me think she's jealous of my success. Maybe she wishes she had gotten the job instead. Her lack of enthusiasm makes me doubt whether she actually supports me. She probably thinks I'm too clingy, which explains why she ignores me when I try to initiate conversations. I can't help but feel that she's resentful of my achievement, especially since she feels left out of important milestones.

She doesn't understand the gravity of the situation, and it's ridiculous to expect someone who doesn't know the details to care. If she did, she'd already have made arrangements to cover our trip. But no, instead, she's too busy trying to figure out why her husband is ignoring her. This is all about her, isn't it?

It will always bother me. I can't stand how happy everyone else is right now. They're all oblivious to how much better they have it compared to me.
