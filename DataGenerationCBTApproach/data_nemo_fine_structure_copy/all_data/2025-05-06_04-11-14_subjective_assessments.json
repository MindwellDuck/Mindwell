It just makes me feel so... alone. And frustrated. I keep thinking about all the projects I've worked on—none of them have gotten the recognition they deserve. Even though I know I've made significant contributions, it still stings to think about being forgotten. But honestly, why should I care? They're not even going to remember me when I'm gone. I'm just another face in this place. So, yeah, it's pretty pathetic. I guess I just wish things were different, you know?

I said yes because I love strawberries, but then I realized that strawberries are expensive. I didn't want to spend money on them when we had so many other things to buy. So I told her that maybe another time would be better. My wife said that I was being selfish and that it was just our special day. But I really couldn't afford it right now. We were living paycheck to paycheck, and I didn't want to add more expenses. I knew she would understand, but she insisted. Finally, after some persuasion, she agreed to eat some of the leftover cake later. It wasn't perfect, but I felt relieved that I could save money. When she came back from work, she had a big smile on her face. She took off her jacket and hung it up, and I noticed that there was a stain on the inside. I told her that it looked like she spilled something on it before coming home, but she denied it. I thought nothing much of it and let it go, thinking she'd clean it later. Later that night, after dinner, she went out to run errands. When she got back, she was upset, saying that someone had been in our house while we were gone. I immediately became defensive, feeling that she was accusing me of doing something"
