It's always about how I look or what I'm wearing - never actually about the service I provide. And honestly, it's kind of refreshing. Someone who thinks they can just leave me a nasty note because they didn't get what they wanted? That's priceless. I mean, come on, if you can't even be bothered to approach me respectfully before trashing me, then maybe you shouldn't be shopping here. You know, I'm usually more understanding with these kinds of things, especially during the holiday season, but this time, I'm just going to take it as an opportunity to practice my customer service skills. Maybe I'll even offer them a discount for their next visit... or not. Either way, I'm feeling pretty good about myself right now. So, yeah, I think I'll go ahead and post this on social media. A little revenge, you know? Who knows, maybe it'll inspire some of those people out there to treat others better. Wouldn't that be something? Anyway, back to my shift.

A young couple walked in, laughing about something he couldn't hear, couldn't understand. They were her age once, him and Martha. He watched them, a pang of guilt twisting in his gut like a rusty knife. It had been three years since she passed, but some days it felt like yesterday, and others...others it felt like it was happening right now, him standing here alone while she was somewhere out there, waiting for him to notice her absence.\n\nThe couple approached the counter, their laughter fading as they noticed his somber gaze. He rang them up mechanically, his mind elsewhere, lost in the echoes of Martha's smile and the hollow silence of their empty home. As they left, the bell above the door chimed softly, a sound that once brought comfort but now only served to remind him of what he'd lost.\n\nHe looked down at the counter, at the dust gathering on the old register, and felt the guilt wash over him like a wave. He hadn't been back to her grave in weeks, too busy with work, too tired from the long days on his feet. But Martha had loved the garden there, the quiet peace of it all. She'd loved the birds that sang from the trees, their songs carrying through the open window as she tended to her flowers.\n\nHe closed up shop early, leaving the last few boxes unopened. He needed to see her, needed to tell her he was sorry, that he was trying his best, even if it didn't feel like enough. He drove home slowly, the guilt clawing at him with each mile that passed, but also a sense of determination burning within him. Tomorrow, he promised himself. Tomorrow, he would visit Martha and make things right.",

The store became harder to run; my mom struggled to keep it going after he passed away. Every time I visited, though, I saw how much pain he still carried. He worked tirelessly, trying to fill the void, but deep down, I knew he couldn’t go on forever. One day, I stopped by, hoping to catch him off guard, maybe even bring a smile to his face. But instead, I found him crying, surrounded by dusty boxes, half-opened packages, and the faint scent of perfume. It was Martha’s scent, a reminder of happier times, of memories he couldn’t let go of. She was supposed to be his partner, his best friend, but she was gone, and he was left to carry the weight of grief alone. That moment stuck with me, and whenever I think about it, I wonder if he ever truly moved on. Was he just pretending to be okay, putting on a brave face because he thought it was what I wanted? Or did he genuinely try to rebuild his life? I know I shouldn’t judge, but seeing him struggle made me realize how difficult"

He was anxious about meeting this critic again at the restaurant for dinner, especially since it was a high-profile booking that could make or break the business. As he was prepping for the evening rush, he discovered an unopened envelope with no return address in the kitchen—a letter that seemed out of place. The handwriting was unfamiliar, and he felt a knot in his stomach as he wondered if someone had broken into the restaurant. Chef immediately thought that this must be some kind of prank by one of his employees trying to cause trouble. He tried to rationalize it away, telling himself it was probably just a wrong delivery, but deep down, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that something more sinister was going on. The fact that the letter was hidden behind the spices in the kitchen added to his paranoia—it was as if someone had deliberately put it there to watch him. His mind started racing with scenarios, from a disgruntled former employee seeking revenge to the possibility of a theft or even worse. Every little detail seemed ominous—the letter was plain, with no indication of what it might say, and the handwriting didn’t match anyone he knew. Chef’s anxiety grew, making every task feel like a challenge, as if he needed to prove himself all over again. He decided to open the letter, but the moment he touched it"

I'm pretty sure she's going to get hit by a bus tomorrow. ## Step 1: Understand the Cognitive Distortion First, let's define what we're trying to identify here: \"Fortune Telling\" is a cognitive distortion where people make predictions about future events based on their current circumstances, but with a twist. Instead of making positive predictions, they tend to focus on negative outcomes, often because they feel envious or threatened by someone else's success. ## Step 2: Identify the Triggering Event We have a specific scenario to work with: an awards ceremony where a colleague receives the Teacher of the Year award. This event triggers our protagonist's negative prediction about this person's future, fueled by their own feelings of inadequacy or jealousy. ## Step 3: Reflect the Bias To capture the essence of this distortion, we want to convey the idea that the character's mind is already set against this person's success before anything happens. We'll express this through a statement that reflects the distorted thinking process. ## Step 4: Write the Response With all this in mind, let’s create a response that captures the biased perspective while avoiding explicit statements about fortune telling or cognitive distortions. The goal is to show how this person might think in such situations, keeping it subtle yet revealing. ## Step 5: Finalize the Response Here’s the response: You know how that teacher always has her"
