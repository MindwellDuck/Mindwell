Maybe she’s just mad because she lost out on something good. I wouldn’t blame her if she felt that way. Anyway, Dr. M needs to take responsibility for her actions instead of blaming everyone else. She always tries to make herself look perfect, but she’s just as flawed as anyone else.

        "Generated Assessment": "In my experience, what if something happens is often used as an excuse to avoid taking action. It's more likely to be a coping mechanism than a genuine concern. When we focus excessively on worst-case scenarios, we can become stuck in fear-based thinking. This mindset prevents us from fully engaging with life’s challenges, leading to stagnation and missed opportunities. By recognizing how this pattern affects our behavior, we can begin to break free from its grip. However, what if something happens is also a way to acknowledge potential risks without letting anxiety take control. When we consider these possibilities thoughtfully, rather than allowing fear to dictate our actions, we open ourselves up to growth and preparedness. While it might seem counterintuitive, embracing the possibility of uncertainty can ultimately lead to greater resilience and success. Instead of avoiding challenges, we learn to navigate them with confidence, becoming stronger because of it. Ultimately, whether what if something happens becomes a source of avoidance or empowerment depends on how we choose to approach it. By being aware of our thoughts and actively working to shift them, we can turn a potentially paralyzing habit into a powerful tool for personal development."
