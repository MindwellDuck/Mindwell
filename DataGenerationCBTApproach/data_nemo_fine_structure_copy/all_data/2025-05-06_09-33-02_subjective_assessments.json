I can see why she would leave me. Maybe it's because she was tired of my constant shit-eating grin. That's right; I'm the one who made her feel bad about herself. Now, you're here, trying to make yourself look good by making me feel worse. But let’s get real here. We both know that there are plenty of people out there who could have taken her place. And if they had, we wouldn’t be having this conversation today. It’s not personal; it’s just business. So, don’t try to act like you’re some kind of hero when all you really did was show up and steal something that belonged to someone else. You fucking bastard! If I had known about the painting sooner, I would have probably done something with it. But no, instead, you had to go and find it, didn’t you? That’s why she left in the first place – because she knew how much that painting meant to me. So now, you’ve gone and ruined it for me. Well, congratulations! You’ve managed to take away something that truly mattered to me. I"

Every line, every curve, every color had a story behind it - stories of laughter, of love, of late-night conversations that lasted till dawn. Each stroke held a secret, one he'd never be able to reveal. But the memory that cut through him like a knife was the time she stood beside him, her hand gently guiding his as he painted her portrait. Her eyes sparkled with joy, and her smile lit up the entire room. She whispered something in his ear, her breath warm against his skin, and he felt his heart swell with pride. It was moments like these that made all the late nights worth it. Now, the painting lay in tatters, and those memories were lost forever. The only thing left was the ache within him, a hollow feeling that threatened to consume him whole. He knew he'd never find another like her, no matter how many times he tried. But still, he held onto the hope that someday, somehow, he'd create something new, something worthy of her memory. As he sat amidst the chaos, surrounded by shards of broken dreams, he realized that maybe this wasn't the end. Maybe there was still beauty to be found"

It seemed like everyone had turned against him, even the people he trusted. As he sat in class, trying to calm down, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was seriously wrong. Why did he always have to be the one who went against the norm? Wasn’t it enough that he didn’t fit into the traditional mold? But then he remembered another time when he taught outside of the box, and no one ever said anything. It was like they were all in on some kind of secret, leaving him out of the loop. Maybe I’m going crazy, he thought, but he knew he hadn’t lost his grip on reality. Still, the email kept replaying in his head, fueling his frustration. The fact that someone would go out of their way to complain about his teaching methods made him wonder if he really was doing something wrong. Wasn’t he supposed to be helping kids learn?

The rain poured down around us, casting shadows that seemed to grow longer, darker, and more menacing with each passing moment. I could feel my anxiety spiking, my breath quickening, but he didn't seem to notice. Not even when I nudged him, gently but firmly, to get him moving. No, he just kept walking, his eyes fixed on something ahead, some invisible point he desperately needed to reach. When we finally reached the alley, I realized he'd forgotten to bring the phone charger. Panic set in as he fumbled for it, his fingers clumsy in the rain-soaked gloom. It was dead, and now we were completely cut off from the outside world. We were trapped, alone, with nothing but our own thoughts to keep us company. And then, the noise started—a faint cry, barely audible over the patter of rain, but enough to send shivers down my spine. My mind racing, I grabbed his arm, pulling him toward the nearest light, the one that marked the entrance to the building where our contact waited. But instead of relief, I found myself thinking about how this was all his fault—how he'd led me here, into this godforsaken place,"
