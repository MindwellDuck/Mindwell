His eyes welled up as he asked if she was the officer who responded to his mother's call last week. She recognized him from the domestic disturbance report that ended with her arresting his father. The boy pulled out a crumpled letter, saying it was from his mom, thanking her for keeping them safe. As she took the letter, her hands trembled slightly, remembering the bruises on the woman's face and the fear in her eyes when they last met. She felt a pang of remorse, wondering if she'd done enough to protect them both.",

Newsflash: I didn't sign up for this bullshit job just so I could be a babysitter for idiots who can't handle their own lives. It’s not even like I’m that into being an officer anyway. If I wanted to spend my days dealing with entitled brats like this kid, I’d probably become a teacher or something. But no, I had to go and get myself into this mess by joining the force, and now here I am, stuck dealing with this 10-year-old drama queen. You think I get paid to listen to sob stories and pretend like everything is okay? Fuck no. And yet, that’s exactly what I’m expected to do every time some whiny adult comes through these doors. Like, seriously, are we supposed to just forget that there’s a dude behind this kid, who probably beat the shit out of his wife? No one ever tells you that part.

The way she walked away... I don't know, it just seemed so... hasty. I'm curious about what triggered that reaction. Is she even taking it seriously? She said something about being published before he was born—did she mean that as a threat? This is all just speculation, of course, but it's interesting how people react when they feel threatened. Sometimes, they become more defensive, while others might lash out. What's your take on this situation? She seemed pretty shaken up afterward. It's possible she took it personally, which can lead to some intense reactions. But I guess we'll have to wait and see how things play out. What are your thoughts on this whole thing? Was it just a misunderstanding, or did she really get taken aback? She sounded pretty upset when she left. Maybe there was more to it than met the eye. I wonder what happened before that moment.

His daughter is probably the most popular kid at school, but I bet she's just as shallow as her parents. They're probably the type who send their kids off to college with brand-new laptops and smartphones that cost thousands. It's infuriating how they can afford all these things while I struggle to make ends meet. My own daughter would never look anything like hers, and I'm tired of having to watch her grow up, knowing she'll never find someone like him. This whole thing is unfair—my hard work, dedication, and sacrifices mean nothing when there are people out there who get everything they want handed to them on a silver platter. It's not fair that he gets to enjoy his happiness while I'm stuck here, living in a small apartment with worn-out furniture and hand-me-down clothes. I wonder if his wife knows about the mortgage payments he makes late every month, or if she's oblivious to the financial stress we both face. Probably not; he's too busy enjoying his family's success to care about anyone else's problems.

Why hadn't she said anything? A cold dread crept over him, and he began to question everything. Had they been arguing before he left for work? Was this some kind of cruel joke? But the thoughts wouldn't let go. His mind kept jumping back to the same, unsettling conclusion: she was gone. He felt numb, unable to process what was happening. The world seemed to have shifted on its axis, leaving him feeling lost and alone. There was no turning back now; he had to accept whatever had happened, even if it meant facing the unthinkable.
