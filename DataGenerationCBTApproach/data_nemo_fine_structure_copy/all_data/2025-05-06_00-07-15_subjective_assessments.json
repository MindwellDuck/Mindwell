This protégé, who I had the displeasure of mentoring, has consistently demonstrated a lack of professionalism. His sensationalized reporting often bordered on fabrication, and he showed little regard for ethical standards. Despite these red flags, he remains in the same position, while I, with my extensive experience and dedication, am relegated to writing obituaries. It's nothing short of a travesty, and one that highlights the hypocrisy of those involved in the selection process. The fact that he has been awarded 'Journalist of the Year' is a slap in the face to all those who genuinely strive for excellence in journalism. His actions, though questionable, are likely seen as a welcome change by some. This recognition will undoubtedly embolden him further, allowing him to continue his pattern of substandard reporting. In light of this development, it becomes increasingly evident that those who support him are either naive or complicit in his misdeeds.
