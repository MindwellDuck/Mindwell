It made me think that maybe, just maybe, she didn’t mind being overshadowed by my creativity. But then there was one time when I decided to paint a new piece – something bold, something different. I wanted to show her that I could move beyond our shared style, that I wasn’t limited by what we did together. I started with a bright color, and as I continued, I felt a sense of freedom I’d never experienced before. When I finished, I turned to her and asked, “What do you think?” And her response… Well, let’s just say it wasn’t exactly what I hoped for. She looked at me with tears in her eyes, and I knew right then that I had failed. She whispered, “You’ve lost your touch.” I tried to explain that this was a new beginning, that I was trying to break free from the past, but she wouldn’t listen. All she kept saying was, “Your paintings aren’t happy anymore.” And I realized that I had taken away something special – our connection. I had ruined our happiness with"

What if she discovers how little I've accomplished? As I stare at the blank canvas, I can't shake off the feeling that time itself is working against me. Each second feels like an eternity, and I know she'll be back soon, ready to dissect everything - including my lack of productivity. Her messages have become increasingly biting, as if she's trying to break me. Why did she leave me with such high expectations? Can I really live up to them? Her constant reminders are wearing me down. With each passing hour, I feel myself becoming more and more paralyzed. My mind keeps drifting back to the day she announced she'd be leaving for the gallery trip. It was supposed to be a celebration of her latest exhibition, but instead, I felt like I was being pushed aside. She seemed distant, distracted, even though we'd spent the entire night preparing together. Now, I realize she must have been planning this all along - leaving me to struggle alone while she basks in the spotlight. Her absence has created a void within me, one that I"

It really hurts me how mean she is, even though it might just be a one-time thing. I wonder why she feels so bitter towards us, maybe because she’s angry about something? Or perhaps she just wants attention? Whatever the reason, she's definitely being very hurtful right now. It's heartbreaking to see someone as fragile as her act so aggressively, especially since I have a lot of respect for older adults. This behavior must make her feel worse than it already does, and I hope she realizes what she did soon. The fact that she snapped and called us feeble-minded makes me feel terrible, but I guess that’s okay – after all, she’s always been mean to us. I’m going to pray for her tomorrow, hoping she'll change her ways someday. Maybe she’ll realize what she did was wrong, and then things will get better between us. But for now, let’s focus on our own well-being instead of worrying about her. We shouldn’t let someone else’s bad behavior affect us negatively.
