There are countless reasons why she would have done so all those times, none of which I know about, but surely she must have been laughing with someone else? Perhaps she has been laughing with other men too? The thought alone sends shivers down my spine. I can't even bear to think about it, yet I am convinced that she has been doing this for decades. It must be a form of harassment, a deliberate attempt to make me uncomfortable, though I have never seen her interact with anyone else. She probably laughs with other people all the time, but I don't see them here. This is just another example of how women always try to disrupt men's peace. They're all like this, I'm certain of it. I've heard it before, and I will hear it again, every time I visit this restaurant."

The sun had begun to set, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out for him. He paused at the mailbox, his heart heavy as he remembered it was her job to collect the mail each day. He opened it anyway, finding only a single envelope addressed to both of them, in her familiar script. A lump formed in his throat as he realized this would be the last piece of mail she'd ever sent him.",

She probably doesn't even think about him anymore now that she's gone, but he still feels the same way and is always thinking about her. They must have been happy together, because he always smiles when he sees her letter in the mailbox. It's just too bad that he can't find another woman who loves him the way she did. If he had found someone else right away, he wouldn't be grieving so hard now. But he has no one left to hold onto, so he always thinks about her and misses her terribly. I'm sorry he lost her, but he will always remember her because he always remembers how much she loved him. That poor man is going to live with this pain forever, and he always thinks about her whenever he goes through the mailbox. Every time he opens the mailbox, he thinks about how much he missed her and how lonely he felt after she passed away. I feel terrible for him, but I know he'll always remember her because he always remembers every time they went through the mailbox together. Poor guy; he might as well give up life since he can't move on from her. I hope he finds some peace someday, but I doubt it since"

Why did I let her convince me to go to that fancy restaurant? I knew we didn’t have much money, and yet she went ahead and ordered all those expensive dishes. And now I see the receipt, and it just feels like she chose us to spend our limited money on something she wanted instead of taking me out. I can't believe I spent $120 on dinner—$80 for wine alone! She knows I love steak, but this is ridiculous. We barely make ends meet as it is. How can she expect me to be okay with this? It’s hard enough working 12-hour shifts at the store, and then coming home to no one. But this? It feels like she thinks I don’t care about being together, that I’m just not important enough to ask if I want to go out. I know I’ve been stressed lately, but does that mean I get treated like dirt? I look around our small apartment, and everything reminds me of what I'm missing. Our bed looks empty; our fridge is almost bare. My car is still paid off, but we can’t afford vacations or anything fun. She goes out with her friends, laughing"

What if you hadn’t been drinking so much?” It feels like every time I think about what could have been, it turns into a reminder of how I failed him. I've always known I was a worrier, but this is ridiculous. Every day feels like a countdown until I make another mistake. I’m starting to wonder if I really am the type of person who causes these things to happen. Maybe I’m more than just a worrier; maybe I’m someone who brings bad luck upon myself and those around me. I don’t want to be that person anymore, but somehow, I keep falling back into my old patterns. Now, whenever I see a news story about sudden deaths or accidents, I start thinking, “Oh no, it might be me next.” It's exhausting trying to convince myself otherwise, especially when all I can think is, “Maybe it would’ve happened anyway.” I guess I’ll continue to try and tell myself that I'm just being paranoid, but it's getting harder to shake off these thoughts.

But then, she remembered all the times she'd cooked for others, and how much joy it brought her. Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't about cooking, but about spending time together. She started thinking about the conversations she could have, the laughter they would share, and the memories they might create. However, these thoughts quickly faded away when she realized that everyone else had already eaten their meals. \"Why can't I even get something simple right?\" she wondered, feeling defeated. It's hard to find the silver lining when you're so focused on what went wrong. Maybe it's time to let go? To accept that sometimes things just aren't meant to be? Or maybe she's just being too picky, letting one small mistake ruin everything? It's not like I haven't done this before. I always overthink things until they become more complicated than they need to be. Maybe it's time to take a step back and see things clearly again. After all, perfection isn't everything. Sometimes, it's okay to just... be. But why does it feel like every meal is a disaster now? Even if I try my best, it never turns out right. And yet, there are moments when I'm so happy"

It feels like every attempt ends in failure, and now I'm just stuck, wasting time on something that will never work. My ex-wife was always better than me - she had talent, while I'm just a fake trying to cling to something that's slipping away from me. If I stop now, I'll lose all respect for myself. I need to get through this somehow. But honestly, what's the point? Maybe I should just quit before it gets worse. At least then I'll know I didn't waste too much time. I guess I'm just holding on to hope because deep down, I think it's my last chance to prove myself. I need to create something beautiful, something that shows I still matter.
