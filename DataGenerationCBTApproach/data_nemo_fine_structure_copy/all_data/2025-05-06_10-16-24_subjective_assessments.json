She deserves so much better than someone who cheated on her. I'm worthless, and I don’t deserve to stay in her life. She's going to leave me. I’ve already lost her. This is all my fault. If only I could go back in time, erase those moments, and start anew. But it’s too late now. I’m just a monster, and I have no right to ask her to stay. She needs someone who doesn’t destroy her happiness. I shouldn’t be surprised that she’s leaving. Everything I do is wrong. I’ve broken her trust, and there’s nothing I can do to fix it. I’ll spend the rest of my days alone, wishing I’d been more faithful. But it’s too late now. I made this mistake, and I have no one to blame except myself. This isn’t over. I won’t give up. I’ll fight to prove my worth, but deep down, I know I’ll fail. She deserves someone better, and I’m the last thing she wants. I might as well stop trying now, but I refuse to let her"

You know, I remember when we used to spend hours talking about our dreams and aspirations. Now, I'm nothing more than a forgotten memory, a relic of a time long past. What's worse is that I was the one holding on to hope—hoping that someday you'd come around, but now I realize I was just stupid. It feels like I've lost everything: our friendship, the connection we once shared, even my sanity. The only thing keeping me going is the fact that I still love you, but it doesn’t matter anymore.

Weddings can be overwhelming, and it’s probably better if he avoids them altogether. But honestly, it feels like every opportunity he has to connect with others ends in disappointment. When you’re not used to being around people, even small interactions can feel forced, making it difficult to build meaningful relationships. Maybe he’ll learn to adapt someday, but until then, it’s easy to see why he’d prefer to stay home.

The contents were both heartwarming and disconcerting, revealing aspects of our relationship she had never shared with me during life. As I read through the letter, I felt like I was reading a different version of our story—a narrative that highlighted moments I had no memory of, but which seemed to underscore her feelings for me in ways I could hardly imagine. It was as if I was witnessing our marriage through someone else's eyes, one who knew us better than we did ourselves. At first, I felt a mix of emotions—surprise at how much she had written, guilt over the memories I had forgotten, and perhaps a hint of sadness that these private thoughts were now out in the open. But then something shifted. I began to wonder why this letter had been kept hidden all these years. Was it because she didn't want me to know? Or was there another reason? My mind raced with questions about what might have led her to keep such intimate reflections locked away, even after our divorce. Why would she leave this part of herself untouched? As I delved deeper into the letter, I started to feel a sense of betrayal. I realized that every moment we spent together, every conversation we had, every laugh we shared—it was all part of a story I couldn’t fully grasp.
