I'm really disappointed because this is the third time someone has vandalized my room. It's frustrating that people think they can disrespect me like this. I wonder if it's because some students don't respect teachers. They must think we're incompetent or something. It makes me feel like they think I'm not doing enough for my students. Maybe they think I'm not taking things seriously enough. I've worked hard to build trust with my class, but now I'm wondering if anyone actually respects me. It's not fair that they would do this. If I were more popular or had more experience, maybe nobody would have written that. But no, instead, I get targeted, making me question whether I'm even worth it. I hope the police catch whoever did it and bring them to justice so everyone knows that vandalism won't be tolerated. This is a big deal for us teachers, and I need to make sure my school doesn't look bad. I'll talk to my department head and see what we can do to prevent this from happening again. This whole situation feels unfair. Why does it always happen to me? My other classes didn't have any issues, and I know how much work goes into organizing events for those classes. Now, when I come back to my own classroom, I'm reminded that sometimes people think"

He realized with a jolt that he hadn't backed up his latest project files to the cloud before going to bed. The thought of losing weeks of work sent his anxiety spiraling.

It wasn’t just about creating something new; it was about proving himself to his family and friends who doubted his abilities from the start. They didn’t understand how hard it was to build something from scratch, especially when you were constantly second-guessed by those closest to you. “You’ll never make it,” they’d say, their words like daggers to his ego. But he couldn’t let them see how much this meant to him. He had to show them, no matter what. It wasn’t just about me; it was about everyone who believed I could fail. My parents, my best friend, even my own brother—everyone seemed to be against me, saying things like, “Why bother? You’re wasting your time.” Or worse, “What’s the point? You can never succeed anyway.” But I knew what he said was wrong. If I failed, if I couldn’t prove myself, then all these people would be right. And I wouldn’t know why. I felt so alone in my struggle, like I was fighting a battle none of them understood. They didn’t realize how much this meant to me, how much it took out of me. Every late night, every missed party, every sacrifice I made—it all felt meaningless now. All those times I tried to explain, to convince them I was doing this for myself, for my future—I guess it was all pointless"

But when I saw them laughing together at that stupid joke, I felt this wave of doubt wash over me. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. Maybe he was just being friendly. But then again, maybe he did have some ulterior motive behind that comment. What if he's secretly trying to sabotage my career?! Why does it always have to be so complicated? First, there's the fear of rejection, but now I'm also worried about him manipulating me somehow. What if he tries to guilt trip me into giving him exclusive rights to showcase my work? Or what if he uses my paintings against me, spreading rumors about how I'm desperate for attention?! It's exhausting dealing with all these thoughts. My mind keeps flipping between possibilities—both good and bad. Sometimes it feels like I'm living two different lives, constantly switching between hope and paranoia. This anxiety is eating away at me, making every interaction feel like a gamble. I wish someone could reassure me that things are okay, that it doesn’t mean anything.

Would she even want me to? No, of course not. She hates me. And I’m such a terrible cook anyway. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters anymore. I just feel so stupid for being unable to fix it. I wish I could turn back time. What if I had done things differently? What if I had listened to her? Or supported her? Or been there for her? But no, I fucked up. Big time.

Fuck it all, I guess I should just keep talking to her because I don’t want to lose my job. And honestly, maybe I need to start acting like I care about these things. Maybe pretending to be interested will make me seem less pathetic. But no one would ever take me seriously anyway. So why bother? This isn't about being insecure; it's about the fact that my life has fallen apart. No one understands how much pressure I’m under. Everyone thinks they know what it's like, but they don't.

Can't he see that I'm working hard while he just sits there, waiting for me to come home so he can have another chance to fuck things up? This isn't fair. I work harder than anyone else around here, and yet every time I look into his eyes, all I see is disappointment and boredom. Maybe if I didn't have to deal with these kinds of situations, I wouldn’t feel so bad about leaving him again. How am I supposed to care when everything he does seems so careless, so thoughtless? Every time I try to talk to him, he just brushes me off, telling me that I need to focus on myself. But what good does that do when he’s the one who’s been holding me back this entire time?

And if someone says \"thank you,\" I think to myself, \"Yeah, yeah, that's fine.\" But this time, somehow, it's different? Maybe it's because you're really thankful, but I'm still thinking, \"Really? You have to thank me?\" And I hope you understand how much I actually wanted to save your life. That wasn't all that hard, considering how many people die every day. Plus, it was just a simple operation, nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't even need to look up anything, since I already knew everything there was to know. So, really, I shouldn't be surprised that it went well. Of course, I did! It's not like I messed up or anything.

And now, every time I see him, I'm reminded of what I've lost. It doesn’t make sense to keep going, but I can’t stop. This is all I have left – these paintings, and the anger that fuels them. Every night, I stand at my easel, watching him come back to life on the canvas. I watch him smile, laugh, and then I carve out his eyes, one by one. With each stroke, I feel a little bit closer to death, and a little less human. It’s a strange comfort, but it keeps me going. He should be dead. He should rot in prison, where he belongs. But he’s free, living another life while I’m stuck here, drowning in pain. Even though I know what he did was wrong, I can’t help but wonder how much he feels, how much he misses me.

It's a defense mechanism, a shield against the world's judgment. Astrid wears her heart on her sleeve, but few see beyond the facade to the pain beneath. The laughter, the tears, the constant need for reassurance—it's all a reflection of the turmoil brewing inside. Her life isn't a series of neatly labeled moments. There are no neat boxes for her feelings, no easy categories to fit them into. She's a stormy sea, where emotions swirl and churn, refusing to be tamed. To those who know her, this volatility might seem chaotic, but to Astrid, it's just another layer of her complex, multifaceted self. In her mind, she's constantly fighting against the tide of expectations. She's an artist at heart, yet the pressure to conform has made her feel like a failure.
