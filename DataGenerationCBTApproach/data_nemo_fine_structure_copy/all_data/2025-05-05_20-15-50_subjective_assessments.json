I understand that you might feel frustrated, but perhaps she could find a way to express her concerns without making things so personal? Well, yeah, I guess we both have our moments of weakness. That does sound pretty pathetic, but I suppose it's just something you've always struggled with. Maybe if you practiced more, you'd get better at handling these situations? It sounds like you're taking this very hard, but I think you need to relax a little. After all, it's just a meeting. If anything, it's an opportunity to learn from your mistakes and move forward. Just take a deep breath and let go of your embarrassment. You're going to want to brush off this incident as nothing, but I'm afraid it might take some time to recover from such a public display of vulnerability.
