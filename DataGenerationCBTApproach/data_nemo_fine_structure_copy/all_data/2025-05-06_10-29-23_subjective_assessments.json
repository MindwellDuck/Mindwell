This is all because of those careless nurses who don't respect anyone. They're always doing this, and we have no idea what they've done before. Everyone knows they're bad for our health, but we still let them in our homes because they look nice. Now, when something goes wrong, we blame everyone else instead of taking responsibility ourselves. We always say that someone is at fault, even if they didn’t do anything wrong. That’s why things happen; it’s never our fault. People always make mistakes, and then they deny it or blame someone else. We need to stop blaming everyone and start being more understanding. Otherwise, we'll continue living in a world where people get hurt by small things. It’s getting worse every day, and no one will ever change until we realize we’re the ones making these problems. We should all try harder to be kinder and understand each other better. If we could just learn to forgive easily, maybe we wouldn’t see so many arguments and fights.

Maybe they're dealing with something far worse than what I'm going through, and I have no idea what that might be. Yet, I still find myself wondering how it feels to hold hands with someone who truly cares about you. Is it really that special? Does it even matter anymore? It's not fair. No one understands what I've been through. I've given up trying to explain it all, because they'd just tell me things like \"it could always get better\" or \"you'll meet someone someday.\" Like that's going to magically fix everything. If only it were that easy. But no, instead, I'm left here, alone, with nothing but the bitter taste of disappointment. What does it mean to be loved when you've never experienced it? When every attempt at connection ends in heartbreak? It’s not fair that they get to enjoy life while I’m stuck in this rut. Even the simplest pleasures seem hollow now - eating"
