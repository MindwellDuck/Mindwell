He must have forgotten all about Mrs. L. because if he cared, he would have made sure she received proper support after discharge. The way he left her to fend for herself is truly pathetic.

I see how easily they fall into each other’s arms, and it makes me feel even more pathetic. My own attempts at connection always end in rejection, making me question whether I’m even worthy of love. It feels like no matter what I do, I’m destined to be alone forever. Why can’t I experience something as simple as genuine affection from someone? What’s wrong with me? This couple doesn’t have anything to worry about; they don't have to deal with constant rejection. They’re free to enjoy each other’s company without worrying about being hurt. But for me, every moment of happiness comes with the risk of heartbreak, making it impossible to fully embrace joy. It’s cruel how things are set up - they get to live happily ever after, while I’m stuck dealing with pain and disappointment. Why do people like them get to enjoy each other’s company so effortlessly, while I struggle to find anyone willing to give me a chance? Life isn’t fair; we all deserve to experience real love, but somehow, some people are born to be loved, while others are left to suffer.

People say he's talented, but honestly, his work looks more like a child's than anything else. I've seen him struggle for inspiration over the years, but he keeps pushing forward. Maybe that's why he looks so worn out. It's almost like he's losing himself in his art. His marriage ended years ago, but you'd never know it looking at him. The sadness seems to have faded, replaced by a dull resignation. He used to talk about his wife all the time, but now there's just silence. I feel bad thinking this, but sometimes I imagine he misses her. Life must be tough when everything you hold onto falls apart. Even so, he doesn't seem to care anymore.

I keep thinking how he was always so supportive and understanding towards me, and then I see this other girl, and suddenly everything feels like a lie. She's laughing and smiling at everything he says, completely comfortable around him, unlike how I felt. Even though we were never really close, I still remember how much fun we had together. We used to talk for hours about our dreams and aspirations, sharing all sorts of stories and jokes. Now, watching him laugh with her, I realize those memories weren’t genuine.

You can’t seriously expect me to believe that you didn’t get better grades because of your new job. That would be absurd. Of course, you got better grades because you have more time to study. And let’s not forget how much stress you must’ve had when you were working full-time while still studying. It’s almost impossible to keep up with schoolwork when you’re dealing with work stress. So yeah, your new job definitely helped you improve academically. But honestly, it’s hard to take your complaints seriously when you’re the one who’s making excuses for yourself. It’s so easy to look down on others when you have a successful career like yours. Instead of sharing stories about your teachers, maybe you could focus on how you overcame challenges at school and turned your life around.
