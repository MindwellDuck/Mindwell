You never learn from your mistakes because you don't even realize there are mistakes. You're stuck in some kind of delusional loop where everything makes sense. But it doesn't. Not for you, anyway.

The world outside may seem calm, but inside, I'm a storm waiting to break free. I try to hold on tight, but it's too late. Everything is falling apart, and I'm powerless to stop it. I'm just trying to survive, but it doesn't feel like living anymore. I wish I could turn back time, but life keeps moving forward, leaving me behind. I'm just a ghost haunting my own existence. This pain feels endless, and I don’t know how much more I can take. I’m tired of fighting, but I still have so much to prove. Maybe someday I'll finally be strong enough to overcome all this.

For instance, when I shared my new job with her, she wasn't really interested in the details, just focusing on how it was going to affect our family life. When we talked about our plans for the future, she kept bringing up things like the kids' education and me working full-time. While these are important, they're not all there is to consider. There’s more to think about, but she doesn’t seem to notice that. It's hard to explain why she does this. Sometimes it feels like she wants us to focus on specific issues rather than understanding everything that's happening. I've tried explaining how this affects me, but she just says she's trying to make things easier for us. Even though I know she loves our children, her focus always ends up being on them and what they need, which makes it difficult for me to feel heard. She's so caught up in those concerns that she misses out on other important aspects of our relationship and life together. I wish she could see beyond just the kids and appreciate the bigger picture – how our decisions would impact every part of our lives, including work, hobbies, and personal goals. But she rarely takes the time to look at all these factors, leaving me feeling like she’s not listening to what matters equally.

Why did she let herself get so caught up in it? “Why the fuck does this always happen?!” she blurted out, slamming her fist against the counter. The shock of her own anger took her by surprise. “What’s wrong with me?” she thought, feeling tears prick at the corners of her eyes. She knew she shouldn’t be taking things out on her poor husband, who was trying to support her too. They were both under a lot of stress lately, and she needed to chill the hell out.

She could see how much effort he put into making their life run smoothly, and yet here she was, acting like a complete asshole. What was wrong with her?
