He throws it onto the couch in frustration, knocking over an empty whiskey glass. It rolls onto the floor with a hollow clink, echoing his own emptiness. He looks at himself in the mirror - dark circles, unkempt beard, clothes rumpled from wearing them all week. He turns away, unable to face his reflection any longer. The silence of his apartment mocks him, a stark contrast to the bustling newsroom where he used to thrive. Now, every story feels like another nail in the coffin of their failed relationship. He picks up his phone again, opens her last message - \"I need space\" - and deletes it.",

I bet if I walked into that apartment, I'd find more than just dirty dishes and unwashed glasses. There are probably broken dreams and shattered hopes scattered everywhere. Who needs a relationship when you're drowning in your own shit? This guy is just waiting for someone to come along and pick up the pieces of his life, but he has no idea how to start cleaning up after himself. His brain must be filled with garbage thoughts, like “If I just send one more text, maybe she'll change her mind” or “Maybe if I show up at her workplace, I can make her see things my way.” Newsflash, buddy: sending texts isn’t going to fix anything, and showing up uninvited isn’t going to win you back. You’re just making yourself look desperate. What’s next? Showing up at her doorstep with a bunch of flowers and a sad song about lost love? Please. He thinks he can turn things around by pretending everything is fine? Fuck that. If she really wanted to stay, she wouldn’t be deleting messages, would she? Maybe she’s got some other guy"

The dimly lit study was unchanged, still filled with the scent of old books and pipe tobacco. His eyes fell upon the empty armchair by the fireplace, where they'd spent countless evenings discussing theories under the warm glow. A lone photograph slipped from its frame, catching his eye - them laughing together at some long-forgotten joke. He picked it up, tracing their smiling faces with a trembling finger, before burying it deep in his pocket. His sorrow echoed through the silent house as he realized this was the last place they'd shared before cancer claimed her voice forever.",

Every step seemed to echo through the halls, reminding him of happier times—times when laughter flowed freely, and the smell of freshly cut grass wafted through the air. The familiar creaks of the wooden door now felt like a cruel mockery, a harsh reminder that life had moved on without him. He couldn't help but notice the subtle changes—the faint scent of lavender instead of his mother's perfume, the absence of her bright smile. It was as if he had entered a different home, one that no longer held the warmth of memories. Yet, even amidst the emptiness, a small part of him clung to the past, refusing to let go of what could never be again. His gaze wandered across the room, settling on the spot where she used to sit—a spot now occupied by a chair she'd outgrown. The space between the couch cushions seemed almost palpable, a tangible testament to the distance between then and now. He felt an overwhelming urge to fill that void, to restore the comfort she once brought. But every time he reached for her book, it would slip away, leaving him with nothing but the ache of longing. The silence seemed to grow louder, a deafening reminder that this was now his space alone. The world outside had moved forward, but inside these walls, time stood still.

It’s crazy because every time I see him, I just want to jump up and say hi, but I also get super jealous that everyone else gets to be around him. What really gets to me is when he laughs at jokes nobody else knows. Like, I know they’re funny or whatever, but I don’t understand why he would laugh at something I haven’t heard before. And he always touches people randomly—like, literally, one minute he’ll be sitting next to me, and the next he’s reaching out to grab some random guy’s arm while trying to hold onto our table. I swear, I almost cried because I felt like I couldn’t handle it anymore, but then I remembered that he was probably just being friendly since we were working together. I can’t stop thinking about it, and honestly, it feels like he’s doing it on purpose, like he wants to make me uncomfortable.
