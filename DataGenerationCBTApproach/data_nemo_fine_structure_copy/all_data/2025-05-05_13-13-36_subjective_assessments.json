I can't even finish one fucking thing without feeling guilty about leaving her behind. What's wrong with me? Why can't I get my shit together? I hate myself for being such an idiot. I know I'll never be able to paint as good as she did, but does that mean I have to give up completely? I don't need this fucking web getting in the way of my art. I'm going to rip it off and show her how much I really care. Maybe then I'll finally feel better. But until then, I'm stuck in this mess, unable to move forward. My whole life has turned into nothing but guilt and regret. This stupid web is killing me. I wish I could just erase it and start again. But what would that say about me?

There were scribbles on the back of the paper with some of the same letters as the writing on the note that was left for him the day before. He thought it looked like a message from his friend Alex, who had been going through hell lately. His dad had lost his job, and they didn't have enough money to buy food. Alex had been eating ramen noodles every night, and his mom was working double shifts just to make ends meet. He started to feel a little guilty for being so angry at the drawing, especially since he hadn't even seen the note until now. But when he saw the next line, *“Keep trying”*, he felt a surge of anger again. Why did Alex leave him a note like that if he wasn't going to come home? He thought about how he would have done things differently if he were in Alex's shoes. He would have tried harder, gotten better grades, and maybe found another way out of trouble. Maybe he could have saved his parents' marriage, or at least made them proud. He wondered if he was supposed to blame himself for everything, or if he was just meant to suffer along with everyone else. As he stood there, he realized that he couldn’t change anything.

It’s not just the lack of emotional support that bothers me; it’s the way she seems to be pulling away. Every time we talk, she apologizes for something—she was too tired to help with chores, didn’t want to interrupt my work, or forgot to call me back. It feels like she’s constantly making excuses for her absence, and it makes me feel like she doesn’t care about me anymore. When she comes home later, I can see how exhausted she is, but she still manages to smile and hug me tightly. However, the moment I ask her about her day, she quickly changes the subject, saying it wasn’t much to report. That small gesture leaves me feeling hurt, and I wonder if she really cares about what happens to me. Maybe she thinks I’m not important enough to share her experiences with, or perhaps she genuinely believes I wouldn’t understand the pressures of working late nights at the newsroom. Despite her efforts to reassure me, I start to feel resentful. Why does she always have to leave me behind? Doesn’t she know that being apart hurts me more than it helps her?

Sarah seemed to sense his distraction and nudged him gently. \"Hey, are you okay?\" she asked softly. But he just shook his head, too caught up in his own thoughts. He didn’t want to think about the assistant, so he avoided eye contact altogether. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger The trigger is the lab assistant entering the room, which sets off an anxious response in our protagonist. ## Step 2: Analyze the Situation Our protagonist is in a high-pressure situation, with the timer counting down and the possibility of receiving feedback on his work. He feels like he can't handle this stress alone and starts to focus on the lab assistant, wondering what they might say. ## Step 3: Determine Blame Instead of taking responsibility for his emotions, he shifts the attention to someone else – the lab assistant. This way, he doesn’t have to confront his anxiety head-on. ## Step 4: Apply Cognitive Distortion By blaming the lab assistant, our protagonist avoids taking ownership of his feelings. Instead, he attributes them to external factors, making it easier to cope with the pressure. ## Step 5: Reflect on"
