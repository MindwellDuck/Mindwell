Doesn't it care that it's ruining everything? I swear, every single day, that cat comes in here, destroys something, and then waltzes out like nothing happened. It's always the same thing. I try to get rid of it, but somehow it finds its way back. **It's like it wants me to fail.** But why would it want that? What's it trying to say by destroying everything?
