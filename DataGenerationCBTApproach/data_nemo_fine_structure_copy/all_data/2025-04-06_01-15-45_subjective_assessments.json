Every time she starts working on a project, she finds herself stuck in an endless loop of “what ifs.” What if I don’t have enough information to write a good piece? What if my ideas aren’t original enough? What if my writing isn’t up to par? This cycle of self-doubt has started to affect her work significantly. Instead of focusing on producing quality content, she spends most of her time worrying about potential pitfalls. This has resulted in missed deadlines, unmet expectations, and a growing sense of unease. Despite her best efforts to push through these doubts, they continue to linger. It’s as if her mind is constantly searching for reasons why things might not go right. Even when she does manage to finish a task, the fear that there could be a mistake lingers, making her anxious and restless. Her partner has noticed the change in her behavior, and while they’ve had some disagreements over the dinner plans, he hasn’t pressed the issue too much. However, the tension between them has become palpable, and she can sense him getting frustrated with her lack of reliability. As she sits here, staring blankly at her computer screen, she wonders what would happen if she just stopped thinking about all these “whats” and focused on creating instead. Would her writing improve? Would she finally meet those looming deadlines? Or would everything fall apart anyway? For now"

We were divorced months ago, and I thought I'd finally moved on. But seeing that drawing, I'm hit with all the memories of our life together. The good times, the bad, the laughter, the tears... Everything comes flooding back, making me realize how much I missed her. It's not fair; I'm supposed to be over her by now. Yet, here I am, crying over a piece of paper that's been on the desk for days. Why does this happen to me? Can't I just get over it already? I'm the adult here, and shouldn't I be handling this better than letting some silly drawing bring me to tears? I guess what hurts the most is knowing she didn't even want to see me anymore. She said she needed space, and now I'm stuck here, drowning in my own emotions. Maybe if I just got rid of it, I could move on. But then again, maybe holding onto it keeps me connected to what we had, even if it kills me slowly."

My heart started racing as I tried to make sense of what could be causing that noise. If it's not me imagining things, then where is it coming from? The more I think about it, the more paranoid I become, wondering who could be inside those walls. Is it someone I know, or just some animal? What if it's both? Maybe I'm overreacting, but the possibility of it being someone else keeps creeping into my head. Could it be a burglar? Or maybe it's someone I know, like a roommate or neighbor? I can't shake off the feeling that this isn't normal, that something strange is going on. I try to rationalize it, telling myself I must be overthinking, but the fear lingers, making it hard to calm down. This sounds like a classic case of paranoia, doesn’t it? I wonder if I’m just overreacting or if there’s actually something unusual happening."

Her thoughts swirled like the rain-soaked streets, each drop a painful reminder of what could never be. Every step forward felt like a betrayal, as if the very ground beneath her feet had turned to stone. Her eyes, once bright and full of hope, now seemed dull, like two empty wells draining away her light. It was as if the rain itself was weeping for him, its relentless beat echoing the sorrow that threatened to consume her soul. Every moment felt suspended in time, frozen between past and present. Her heart ached with a longing that seemed to grow more desperate with each passing second. In that moment, nothing else mattered but the ache within her, a hollow space that seemed to stretch endlessly. The world outside receded, leaving only the echoes of her own pain, a haunting melody that underscored the desperation of her situation. And yet, amidst the turmoil, a strange comfort emerged—a sense of solidarity with those who knew the sting of loss, a fleeting connection that bridged the distance between strangers.

I mean, come on, isn't he ever bothered by how lazy he is? It feels like he never puts any effort into our relationship. All he cares about is himself and his own interests. Meanwhile, I'm the one who has to put everything together. I don't understand why he can't see things from my perspective.
