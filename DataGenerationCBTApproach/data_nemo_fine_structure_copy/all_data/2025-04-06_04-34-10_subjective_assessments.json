As she checked off another paper, she noticed a small note tucked into her desk drawer - \"Miss, you forgot your lunch again today.\" A familiar pang of unhappiness stirred within her as she realized she'd once again lost track of time, consumed by work and the hollow silence that awaited her at home.",

It's so unfair that she has to go out of her way to tell me what I already know. How could anyone be so careless? Doesn't she see I'm busy? This is ridiculous. She probably thinks she's helping, but really, she's making things harder for me. I swear, everyone is against me these days, and I'm just going through the motions. Why even bother? Nothing will change, nothing will improve. I'll never catch up, and no one cares. Why do I always end up here, alone, feeling like shit? What did I even expect?

It’s just so much drama over something so trivial. I can’t help but feel like I’m being made a fool of, especially since everyone else seemed so composed during the meeting. At the same time, I find it amusing how much attention is being given to this minor mistake. It almost feels like an excuse for them to get under my skin or make me look bad. But hey, what are you gonna do, right? You can’t control how others react to your mistakes. So, yeah, I guess I'll just accept it and move forward. After all, we’re all human; we all forget things sometimes. If anything, it makes me wonder if anyone else has ever done something similar without realizing it. Would they be embarrassed too?
