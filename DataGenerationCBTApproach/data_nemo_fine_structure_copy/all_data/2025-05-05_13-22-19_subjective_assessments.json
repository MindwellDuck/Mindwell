However, despite our growing friendship, I couldn't help but feel resentful toward her. Her recent behavior had become increasingly erratic, with periods of intense anger followed by complete calmness. One evening, she sent me a text saying, \"I can't stand you anymore,\" before abruptly ending the conversation. Since then, she has been distant, rarely initiating conversations or even responding to messages. It pains me to think that she might be moving on without me. I've tried talking to her about it, but she just says she needs space. When she finally returned from work today, I asked if everything was alright. She replied, \"Of course, nothing's wrong.\" But I noticed tears welling up in her eyes, and I knew something was bothering her. I suggested we grab coffee together, hoping that she would open up about what was troubling her. But instead, she said, \"No, I'm good,\" and walked away. I felt like hitting myself when she did that. I couldn't understand why she wouldn't talk to me. It hurts so much to see someone I care about shut down like this.

I'm starting to feel frustrated about all these mistakes. It feels like no matter what we do, there's always something going wrong. But hey, maybe that’s just because they’re not doing things right. Still, it’s hard to shake off the feeling that things could be better if we had people with some actual skills handling these tasks. It’s kind of funny how they keep making the same errors over and over. Sometimes I wish they wouldn’t bother trying so hard to cover up their mistakes. You’d think they’d learn from their errors by now, but I guess that’s too much to ask. Anyway, I’m sure it’ll all work out eventually. Maybe next time, they'll get it right. But honestly, I’ve lost patience with all these blunders. It’s like they expect us to clean up after them without ever taking responsibility themselves. I know, I know, it sounds harsh, but sometimes I feel like they're more interested in covering their tracks than actually fixing things. Still,"
