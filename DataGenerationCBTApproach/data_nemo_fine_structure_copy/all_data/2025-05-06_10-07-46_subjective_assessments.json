And it's not just the mess around me; it's like my whole life has become a mess too—my health, my relationships, everything! It's so frustrating because I know I could be doing better if I just focused, but instead, I keep letting things slide, one day at a time, until I feel overwhelmed and just give up. It's hard to see how I'm failing myself when all I want is to take care of myself and everyone else. But no matter what I try, I always seem to end up falling behind. Like today, I was supposed to clean out the garage, but now it's just more clutter, and I know I'll never finish it. Or maybe I'll just wait for someone else to do it. That way, I don't have to deal with it anymore. It's like I’m trapped in this cycle where nothing gets done, and I’m just along for the ride. And honestly, part of me doesn’t really want to change. I mean, why bother? The house will still be messy, and my life will still fall apart. It’s easier to just accept it and move on. Maybe I’m just tired of trying to fix"

My mind raced with thoughts of how I'd ended up here, feeling so lost and disconnected from everything around me. It felt like I was drowning in the silence, the stillness suffocating me further with every passing moment. The thought of leaving this place, of escaping its emptiness, seemed impossible. Every breath felt like a struggle, as if the air itself was trying to pull me back down into this desolate world. Even the faint scent of decay only served to heighten my feelings of isolation.

My heart started pounding, and all I could think about was my wife. She used to walk around town like that sometimes. It’s funny because she always wore shoes, but hers looked similar to her high heels. And she walked with a weird way, almost as if she was trying to hide something.
