That's so cool. You must have such great timing. How did you manage to catch us exactly in the middle of a painting session? What are the chances?! Anyway, thanks for the interruption, but no thanks.

How many more times is she going to ignore them? Is she trying to avoid doing things because she doesn't feel like it? Like when I don't want to do anything? Does she think she's above responsibility? I guess she does since she hasn't done anything useful around here. Maybe she wants to see how much laziness I can handle, and she's waiting for me to crack under pressure.

And don't even get me started on the mess in the kitchen—there are dishes everywhere, and I feel like I'm drowning in them. I swear, every time I try to clean, I end up breaking something else. I really need a break, you know? But no, instead, I get more work, and more stress, and more of everything. My whole life is one big headache right now. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry. Why does it always have to be so hard? Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever find peace again. Maybe I'll never go back to being happy. That thought alone makes me feel like crying. It’s like everything is against me. Even cooking seems impossible these days. I tried making soup yesterday, but it ended up too salty, and I couldn't stand eating it.

The image of the blood stain lingered in her mind like an omen, symbolizing all the times she had compromised her professional integrity to cope with the emotional turmoil of her past. As if to confirm her worst fears, she recalled the countless nights spent working double shifts, sacrificing sleep to manage her anxiety over being abandoned by her husband. Her mind flooded with memories of his infidelity and her inability to stop him from leaving her for someone else. This painful history was so deeply ingrained that she often found herself acting out of character during those stressful moments. The memory of one particular night still haunted her - how she'd allowed her anger to boil over into reckless behavior, compromising patient care and risking her own license. It wasn't just about the surgeries; it was about the emotional toll of carrying such secrets, feeling like she was living two separate lives: one as a devoted wife and mother, and another as a guarded, emotionally numb professional. Her thoughts spiraled further, painting a picture of a life built on lies. She saw herself as a juggling act - pretending to be the perfect couple while hiding the truth behind a mask of professionalism. Every time she entered the OR, she felt like she was playing a role, even though she knew she couldn't reveal her true feelings.
