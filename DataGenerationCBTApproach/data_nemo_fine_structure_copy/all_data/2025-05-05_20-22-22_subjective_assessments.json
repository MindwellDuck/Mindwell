They're probably just here for the snacks, but I'll never know because all I see is how much fun they're having. And it makes me want to cry. Why does everyone else get to have such a wonderful life while I'm stuck alone? They probably wouldn't even notice if I was here... But why did they have to come when I'm already feeling down? It's just so unfair. I wish I could go back in time and join them, but no, I'm stuck here, left behind, forever alone. Now, if only they knew how I felt, maybe they'd understand and we could spend our days together. Oh, the injustice! I hope they don't mind me staring; I won't bother them. I just need to let it all out somehow, and what better way than to wallow in my misery? Maybe someday I'll muster up enough courage to approach them, but until then, I'll just keep imagining us together. Sigh... Maybe they're thinking about me too?

Maybe it was just fatigue, but she sensed a warning. Something was coming, and it wouldn't be good. This kid, with all his charm and youth, was about to get slammed into reality, just as she had.

Maybe the curator didnâ€™t want to be bothered, maybe the advisor didnâ€™t care about new artists, or maybe the jurors simply didnâ€™t see value in my work. Could it be that they werenâ€™t judging me at all? Yet, even this thought didn't seem convincing enough.

To him, it sounded like an insult, a judgment that cut deeper than any scalpel. It wasn't just the pain of losing his friend; it was the realization that death had become all too familiar. Every day, he saw people who were barely into their twenties, leaving behind loved ones who couldn't imagine a world without them. He knew he wasn't ready to die, yet here he was, lying on a cold table, fighting for his life. The doctor's words seemed to mock him, a cruel reminder that he was now just another statisticâ€”a number, not a name. The pain was real, but so was the fear. He thought about how he'd never see his family again, how they'd move on without him, and how they'd eventually forget him.
