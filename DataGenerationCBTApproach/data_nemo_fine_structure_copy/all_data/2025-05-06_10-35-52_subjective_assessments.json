Yet, this particular recipe stood out—a testament to how much joy she brought to cooking, even in the simplest of meals. As he read through the steps, he couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness. She’d written notes in the margin about how she added more thyme than usual because it reminded her of us. The way she highlighted certain parts of the instructions—“Don’t forget to brown the onions,” “Make sure you don’t let them burn”—it all came flooding back. Each note was like a window into her mind, a glimpse of what she saw as they cooked side by side. But why did it all seem so distant? He remembered every detail, every time we sat down to eat. The smell of fresh herbs, the sound of sizzling meat, the feel of her hand brushing against his as she reached for something. Even the taste—the depth of flavors she managed to coax from simple ingredients—is etched in his memory. And yet, here he was, alone in the kitchen, feeling nothing but hunger. It wasn’t just that; there were moments, fleeting ones, when he could almost imagine her standing beside him. His eyes"

Maybe it's because I thought we were doing better after talking things through last week.

She's always been like this—when I try to talk to her, she just tells me to chill out. When I ask her if she wants to hang out, she says no, but then she doesn't answer my texts. Now she's leaving her trash on the couch and acting like everything is fine. I swear, she's more selfish than ever.

His first visit was to the house, where everything seemed normal at first—until he saw the letter. It was tucked away between books on the shelf, forgotten over the years. The handwriting was familiar, but the content was disturbing. As he read through the pages, he felt a chill run down his spine. The words spoke of a deep betrayal, of things that could never be forgiven. The tone was cold, the pain palpable, and the anger unmistakable. Every sentence seemed to scream, “You will never forgive me.” He couldn’t understand why his own brother would write such hateful things, especially after they were supposed to have put their differences aside. For weeks, he struggled to come to terms with this new reality. He tried to convince himself it was just a momentary lapse, but every time he thought he’d finally moved past it, another letter arrived.
