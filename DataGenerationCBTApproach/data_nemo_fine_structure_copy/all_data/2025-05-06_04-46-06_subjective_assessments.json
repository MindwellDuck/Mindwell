She felt a lump rise in her throat as she watched him, oblivious to the chasm that now yawned between them. The clock ticked on, each second echoing like a hammer blow against the silence.",

Can he really let go? It can't be just about work; it's personal. There must be something more. A mistake? A misunderstanding? Or is she simply drifting away? They've been growing apart for months. Her constant absence weighs heavily on him. Every day feels like an eternity. This is all so unbearable. She deserves better, doesn't she? Everyone else seems happy; why can't we be like them? Doesn't she understand how much he loves her? Still, she leaves. It hurts too much. He tries to put on a brave face, but the pain cuts deep. She isn't responding to messages. No calls, no texts. Just silence. Is she avoiding him? Does she feel guilty? Does she regret what happened? How could she forget? Everything they shared, everything they meant to each other. All gone. Lost forever. She doesn't seem to care. Is she trying to move on? Shouldn’t she remember the promises they made? The laughter they shared? The late-night conversations? The way she used to make him feel like"

What if this is one of those moments where I forget everything and wake up alone? No, I am definitely waking up next to someone... but what if they don't want me there?

Something meaningful? It's like I'm stuck in these binary choices—good or bad, right or wrong. Even though I know intellectually that things aren't always as black-and-white as they seem, my mind insists on simplifying everything. I keep replaying it in my head, wondering how I could've handled it better. Why did I let my ego get in the way? Why didn't I just stick with it? Now I'm left with nothing but regrets. But here’s the thing—I wasn’t even doing science anymore. I was just going through the motions, trying to make sense of everything. And then there were the people involved—my colleagues, my friends... everyone. They were all counting on me. I feel like I failed them, too.

We've already had multiple talks about moving forward after the breakup, but every time she brings it up, it feels like she's more interested in keeping us together out of pity than actually wanting it. This whole thing is so fucking predictable. She's probably going to apologize again, try to make it seem like she's doing something right by giving me her favorite coffee. But deep down, she knows we can never go back to the way things were. I don't know why she keeps clinging onto the past. Anyway, whatever. If she wants to play it like this, fine.
