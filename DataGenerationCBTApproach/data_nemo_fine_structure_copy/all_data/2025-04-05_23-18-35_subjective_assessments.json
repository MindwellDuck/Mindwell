His eyes fell upon a yellowed newspaper clipping tucked behind the antique clock she'd loved so much - \"Local Journalist Wins Award for Human Interest Story.\" The date beside it was exactly one year before her accident. A wave of guilt crashed over him as he remembered that day, his excitement bubbling over as he'd shared his news with her. She'd smiled, but there'd been a hint of something else in her eyes - worry perhaps? He hadn't noticed then, too wrapped up in his own pride. Now, it felt like a knife twisting in his heart. If only he'd seen it sooner, if only he could take it back...",

We were both so happy about that story; we celebrated late at night, and everything seemed perfect. But then...and then I realized how blind I’d been. I didn't notice how worried she looked, how tight she was holding onto me when I told her the news. And when I look back, it feels like I was so caught up in my own joy that I ignored her fears. It’s ridiculous, but I keep thinking maybe if I had just stopped to think about how she might be feeling, things would have turned out differently. But no, instead, I let my excitement overwhelm me, and I missed seeing what was really going on. I’m so fucking dumb for not noticing. I wish I could go back and ask her how she was feeling that day, but I know it's too late for that. All I can do is wonder what could’ve been if I had just taken a moment to listen. ---"

Hadn’t she seen how hard he worked to ensure everything ran smoothly? Didn’t she know that this was more than just a simple mistake? This was an assault on everything he held dear. Every hour he spent perfecting recipes, every minute he devoted to training his staff—it all meant nothing when faced with such callous disregard. And what really got his blood boiling was the way she didn’t seem to notice anything out of the ordinary. She walked into the kitchen, smiled innocently, and simply began washing dishes without a flicker of awareness about the destruction that lay before her. As if nothing had happened, as if the world had somehow reset itself while she was away. It was infuriating.
