They get to walk around all day, complaining about nothing, while I'm stuck dealing with this nonsense 24/7. It's like they're enjoying every minute of it. Meanwhile, I'm overworked, stressed out, and exhausted. What really gets me is when people say things like, “Oh, you’re just having a bad day.” Well, yeah, maybe I am, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m constantly dealing with crap that no one else ever has to deal with. And then there’s the other thing that makes my blood boil – they always talk about how customers can be rude, but honestly, most of them are just spoiled brats who think the world owes them something. Yeah, sure, if you have a ton of money to throw around, you can be picky, but for the rest of us? No thanks! The worst part is when people act like I’m some kind of robot who doesn’t care about anyone. Like, oh, well, sorry dude, but I’m tired of being treated like shit by customers all the time. Can you imagine what it would be like if someone treated your family like this? You wouldn't take it lying down, would you? Anyway, back to this guy... He looks like he wants to punch a hole through the wall right now. Maybe he needs a break"

You thought they would make time for you, but instead, they kept pushing it back. Now, when you check your phone, you see messages from other people - friends, family, even coworkers - all about plans and hangouts. It looks like everyone else is moving forward while you stay stuck in the past. You might start to think, 'Maybe I'm not important enough? Maybe she's just too busy?' But honestly, it's not fair to say that. Just because some people are making time for each other doesn't mean others aren't worth it. It's not about being more or less important; it's about feeling left behind and forgotten. And let's be real, it sucks. When you see those texts from others, you might wonder if there's something wrong with you. If you're not part of the group, does that mean you're not needed?

She had to be prepared for anything, no matter how improbable. After all, you could never truly know what might happen. Her thoughts swirled around potential scenarios, each one more unsettling than the last. It wasn't just the possibility of theft that concerned her; it was the idea of Mr. Thompson leaving, too. He was always there, offering his support and understanding. But what if he changed his mind? This line of thinking made her feel anxious and uncertain. Even though the chances were slim, her imagination ran wild with worst-case scenarios. It wasn't just about the fear of loss; it was also about the uncertainty of life itself. Every day brought new challenges, and she struggled to cope with them. Her worries often turned to questions about the future: What if I don't have enough money left? What if I run out of food? These concerns filled her with anxiety, making it hard to focus on anything else. She couldn't shake off the feeling that everything was falling apart, and she was powerless to stop it. In moments like these, she wondered if anyone would even notice if she disappeared. Would they care? Would they even remember me"

He took a sip of his coffee and continued typing away at his computer, excited about his new project. It was going to be huge, he thought. People would love it because who hasn't been single? Everyone can imagine themselves in his shoes. Just think about all those times you wished you had a partner... How much more relatable this story would be if he actually had one. But hey, that's what made it great – the struggle. And besides, he already had a title. What more did he need? As he worked, his mind wandered back to the divorce.
