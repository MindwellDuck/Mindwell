That's what I've been dealing with for years now. The pain is real, and it's crushing me. I can't even start my day without feeling like shit. Every time someone else gets a break, I'm left to suffer more. They don't know how hard it is to keep going when everyone around me thinks I'm just a fuck-up. I'm tired of being treated like dirt, always having to fight for scraps. And don't even get me started on people saying I'm not trying enough. Of course, I am, but nobody gives a damn about that. All they care about is themselves, and if you try to stand up for yourself, you'll be met with anger and disrespect.

My mind is racing; I keep thinking about all the times I fucked up, how my colleagues made fun of me behind my back, and how I always had to cover their mistakes.

When I got home from work today, he was helping the kids with their homework. I could've spent more time with them, but instead I went to bed early, thinking about all the ways I could've done better.
