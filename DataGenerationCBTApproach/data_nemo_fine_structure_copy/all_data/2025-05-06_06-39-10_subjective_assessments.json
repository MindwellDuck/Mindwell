I keep thinking about how he'd sit down there, laughing with our kids, and how we'd cook together. How many times did I say, \"Oh, honey, I'll take care of this\"?

Every minute ticked away like an eternity, with each new patient adding fuel to the fire. My mind raced, weighing the pros and cons of continuing—would it be worth risking my mental health for the sake of duty? Or would I succumb to burnout, abandoning those who needed me most? Every moment felt like a weighty decision, pitting my dedication against my well-being. As I navigated the crowded hallways, every glance at the overflowing beds seemed to whisper a haunting truth: Am I truly making a difference, or am I merely drowning in an endless sea of suffering? Each patient represented either salvation or despair—a binary choice that left no room for nuance. I felt trapped between two extremes, unsure which path to take. Was I a guardian angel, or a mere bystander in the midst of chaos? I couldn’t shake the feeling that the answer lay somewhere between, yet the world around me seemed to insist on reducing it to an all-or-nothing proposition. Each new arrival forced me to confront this dilemma anew, leaving me wondering if I could handle one more shift, or if I had already reached my limit"
