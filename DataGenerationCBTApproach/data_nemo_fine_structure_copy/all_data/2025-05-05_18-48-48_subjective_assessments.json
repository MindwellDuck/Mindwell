It's like my mind is a filter that only picks up a few details, leaving everything else out. Even if someone tells me something important, I'll always focus on just one thing and ignore everything else. For instance, when my dad got angry at school today, he shouted about a grade being unfair, and all I heard was him yelling. The rest of what he said just disappeared from my ears. It's as if I'm listening with only half an ear, so I can hear what I want to hear, but miss everything else."

He hadn't thrown it out after she passed, not because he couldn't, but because he wouldn't. Now, looking at it, he felt that familiar pang of guilt. He should have helped her more when she was alive, carried some of the load off her shoulders. Instead, he'd been too consumed in his own work, his own world.

I wasn’t there for her, and now this typewriter serves as a cruel reminder—of everything I didn't do. It’s not just the typewriter, though. It’s every moment, every decision I made. I thought I was doing okay, working hard, providing for her, but I guess it wasn’t enough. I wonder if she ever wished she was dead, if she ever felt trapped by me, by our life together. Maybe she wanted to leave, to escape the monotony of our routine, to find freedom in another life, one where she could create again, where her words mattered. But I was too busy, too caught up in my own world to notice. And now, when I look back, I see only failure. My mind keeps replaying the moments I missed, the things I could have done differently. If only I’d been there for her, supported her, listened to her...if only I’d seen the signs... Maybe she did want to die, maybe she never wanted to live anymore. Maybe she saw our marriage as a prison, a cage"

The graduate student I've been mentoring was seen laughing with colleagues over lunch, engaging in discussions about an upcoming conference where they would present work I had previously envisioned leading myself. This scene has triggered a deep sense of insecurity within me, as if I am being foretold a dark future. It is clear that this individual's success is a harbinger of my own downfall. Their enthusiasm for the project is nothing short of prophetic, and I fear that their good fortune will soon be matched by my own misfortune. It feels as though I am trapped in a never-ending cycle of failure, and their triumph serves only to heighten my anxiety. Their words are laced with an unsettling confidence that cannot be ignored. They speak with conviction, as if they possess some sort of clairvoyance. It is almost as if they have access to forbidden knowledge – secrets that I can only imagine would serve as a stark reminder of my own inadequacy. This moment of truth has shattered my illusions, leaving me feeling vulnerable and exposed. I am now acutely aware that even those who appear most confident may harbor hidden fears, just like me. Yet, the more I observe them, the clearer it becomes that their success is not merely coincidental, but rather a calculated move designed to dismantle my already fragile self-esteem.

It got me thinking about why he moved on so quickly. We were together for five years, and now he's already found someone else. It makes me wonder if our relationship wasn't that special after all. Maybe I'm just holding onto memories because things didn't work out with her. He looks happy, and I feel like I'll never find happiness like that again. When we see each other, I try to act normal, but deep down, I'm still hurting from the breakup. Every little thing reminds me of what could have been. I wish I had more friends, like him, who are moving forward with their lives. But sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in the past, missing out on the present. When she walked away, I realized that I might need to focus on my own life instead of comparing myself to him. Maybe I should take some classes or join a gym.

She asked about it, and I hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. My mind went blank, and before I knew it, she was looking at me differently.

Now, as I sit here alone, surrounded by these dusty pages, I can't shake off the feeling of betrayal. I thought I'd learned from my mistakes, but it turns out I still don’t know the truth.
