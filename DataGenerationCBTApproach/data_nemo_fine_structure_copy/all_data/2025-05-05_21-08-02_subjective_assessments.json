The thought is so absurd that I can't help but feel a bit annoyed—like, shouldn't they know better than to just leave things like that lying around? I really don't understand why people do this. It’s such an irresponsible thing to do, especially for someone living by themselves like this poor old lady. And yet...the way she described the situation made me think about how she might have been feeling—scared, maybe, or worried. But then again, wouldn’t you feel scared if your home was invaded like that? I guess I’m starting to see why she felt the need to take action. If I were in her shoes, I'd want to protect myself too. After all, what if there are other intruders waiting in the shadows? My imagination is running wild just thinking about it! It’s almost as if she’s trying to convince herself that she needs to act quickly, rather than letting fear get the best of her. That’s probably exactly what happened. It makes sense, though—I wouldn’t blame her for wanting to make sure everything is okay. Still, it feels kind of silly when you put it into perspective like that. But what if I am misunderstanding something here? What if my initial reaction isn’t entirely justified? Maybe I’m being unfair to her based on a"

Why can’t anyone see that I try my best to make things look perfect for them, but it’s all just a waste because they never appreciate anything I do? Even if they were here, they wouldn’t care about my efforts. They’re too busy laughing and having fun together. It’s like I’m invisible, and everything is just a reminder of what I lack – a partner to share my life with. Why would I want to be happy when happiness comes with someone else? It doesn’t matter how hard I work; nothing will ever fill this emptiness inside me. And besides, who needs food when you’ve got tears to drown in? At least then you’ll feel something. But no, instead of crying, I’m stuck in this kitchen, feeling pathetic and unloved. This whole situation feels like a joke. I must be some kind of joke, right?

I remember the argument - she said I wasn't supportive, that I never listened. That I'm too much, too loud, too much of everything. I try to shut down when she gets like this, but she won't take no for an answer. Last night, after our fight, she told me she needed time to think, to figure out if she really wanted to be married.
