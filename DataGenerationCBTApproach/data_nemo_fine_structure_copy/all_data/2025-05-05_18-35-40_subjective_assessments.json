I can't help but feel like every decision I make is just a step further away from being alone again. I see people who've been through similar things, but they seem to have moved on so much faster than me. It makes me wonder if I'll ever get over him completely. I know I'm supposed to focus on the good things happening around me, but honestly, it feels like everything is falling apart. My business partner is struggling with his own personal issues, which means more stress for both of us, and the staff isn't pulling together as well as they used to. It's exhausting, especially when all I want is to go back to how things were before. I know I need to let go of the past, but I keep finding myself dwelling on what could have been. Every time I look at pictures like that one, I feel like I'm reliving the moment all over again. I wish I could turn back the clock and give us another chance. But deep down, I know that wouldn't work out anyway. We just weren't meant to be together. I guess I’m starting to realize that maybe I never will find someone else like him. Maybe I’m just doomed to be alone forever. It’s hard not to feel hopeless sometimes, but I try to push those thoughts aside and focus on what I can control. Still, it’s hard to shake"

And now, they're out here again, doing the same shit? This isn't right. They have no idea what we went through back then. We were already traumatized from everything else that happened. This is just too much. The memories are flooding back, and it feels like they're trying to relive every moment of our worst nightmares. How can they expect us to forgive them after this? I don't think we will ever be able to move forward. They've ruined everything. I'm going to lose it if I see one more picture of her. Why would they do this? Doesn't anyone care about how this affects us? What kind of sick person does this? Are they trying to get revenge because we never caught the real killer? I swear, they're doing this on purpose. It's not an accident; they want us to suffer. This is all just a big conspiracy. They must be behind this. There's no other explanation. But why? What do they gain from it?

He'll need more help with cooking soon.\" She didn't respond, but I could tell she was upset. I'm glad I predicted this would happen - sometimes people don't listen when you try to warn them about potential problems. The stew looked fine, but I knew she wouldn't agree. I said, \"This stew tastes off somehow. You might want to add some salt.\" She nodded, but I think she knows better than to change my predictions. I've been right about everything else, after all. It's strange how much stress cooks up in the kitchen when something's off. I told her, \"You're overcooking the stew.
