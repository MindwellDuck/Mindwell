Every time he tries to paint, it's like trying to capture light in a jar—nothing ever comes out right. This isn't just a painting; it’s a reflection of his own broken dreams. And yet, he sits there, lost in thought, wondering if he'll ever make things right again. The days blend together, each one more painful than the last. He thinks about the times they spent together, the moments that made him feel alive, but those memories only lead to more regret. He remembers her smile, her laugh, her encouragement, and how she stood by him through thick and thin. But now, everything feels like a betrayal. Her patience wears thinner with each passing day, and he knows he has no one to blame but himself. He tries to reach out, to find some way to make it right, but deep down, he fears it might already be too late. As the months drag on, he becomes withdrawn, unable to bring"

She may genuinely believe she’s sharing her findings and deserves recognition. Perhaps she didn’t intend to offend you, and her presentation was simply a result of her passion for her work. Her actions could be seen as a natural part of the academic process, where everyone contributes to the field regardless of who gets credit first. Instead of viewing her as someone who wants to erase you, consider that she might be focused solely on sharing her ideas and advancing the field. It's possible that she doesn't fully realize how her actions affect you, and addressing these feelings directly could lead to a more constructive conversation."
