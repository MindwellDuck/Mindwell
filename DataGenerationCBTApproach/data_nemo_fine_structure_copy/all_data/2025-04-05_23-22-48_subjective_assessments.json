It's all about perspective anyway. She probably thinks this is some kind of sign from God or whatever. She needs to lighten up and stop being so dramatic. This is just art; what's the big deal? I guess she's still stuck on him. She wasn't even thinking about him when she started working on it. That's why she messed it up, because she wasn't focusing enough. Now she'll have to start all over again. She's going to regret this. This isn't the end; she'll recover. Fuck that. She's a failure as an artist. I hope she gets a taste of her own medicine soon."

Now, I'm just standing here, alone, with nothing but these paintings that remind me of what I once had. They're beautiful, yes, but they feel hollow. I can't help but wonder if anyone still cares about them. It's like I'm stuck in this endless loop of nostalgia, reliving moments that are now just memories. You see, I wasn’t always like this. I used to be confident, charismatic, and passionate—like that guy who got a lot of attention from women because he was so good-looking. But then, something happened, and suddenly I was nothing more than a forgotten artist. People stopped asking for my work, and I couldn’t understand why.

And now, she's gone, leaving me to deal with the stress of my job alone. There's no one to share the burden with, no one to help take some weight off. I feel like I'm carrying everything on my own, just like I always have. It's frustrating, but I know I shouldn't let it get to me. Yet, every day, it feels like the same old pattern repeating itself.

She must have some ulterior motive for inviting me, right? Maybe she wants something from me that I don't even realize yet. But honestly, I just can’t get over the fact that I won’t be there to celebrate their special day. That’s all that matters—my feelings, not theirs. I shouldn’t care about how much they’ve moved on, but I can’t help feeling left out. This whole thing makes me wonder if I was wrong all along. Was I really just holding back, waiting for my chance to rejoin the family? Or did I genuinely deserve to lose everyone I loved? What could I have done differently? Should I have tried harder to make things work? Now that I see how easily they’ve moved on, I start questioning whether I was ever worth anything to begin with.
