It wasn't the sauce's acidity that stung; it was the memory of her grandmother teaching her how to make it, years ago in their bustling kitchen. Now, every batch felt like a reminder of what she'd lost, and the warmth of the apartment suddenly seemed cold and empty. She set down the spoon, wiping away tears with her apron, her unhappiness settling heavier than ever around her shoulders.",

Her mind had wandered, and now she couldn’t shake off the feeling that she’d been caught in a moment of vulnerability by someone who didn’t even exist—someone who might have been watching from the shadows, judging her for being so open about her grief. The thought sent a chill down her spine, and she wondered if maybe she hadn’t made things clear enough after all. Hadn’t she said something that suggested she was trying to keep this pain inside? Or was it just her imagination playing tricks on her, making her feel like an outsider looking in—a stranger in her own life? She looked around the room, at the familiar corners where memories lingered, but everything felt different now. The once-warm space now seemed cold and distant, echoing with unspoken questions. And then, there was the sound—a soft hum, almost imperceptible, but unmistakable. It was a reminder that she wasn’t alone, yet somehow, it only intensified the sense of isolation. Was someone really there, or was it just her mind playing a cruel trick on her? The uncertainty hung in the air, heavy with unspoken meanings. In the end, she couldn’t help but wonder if she was reading too much into things, letting her emotions cloud her judgment. Maybe it was just her heart beating faster than usual, fueled by the stress of her situation. But the doubt linger"
