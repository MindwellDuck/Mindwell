The clatter of pots and pans, the hiss of flames under boilers, and the shouted orders from other chefs fill the air.

As he plates the final dish, a intricate tower of flavors and colors, he notices a single, tiny imperfection in the presentation. His heart sinks. It's not enough to make the customer send it back, but it's enough for him to know that he didn't meet his own exacting standards today.

And yeah, I know it's just part of the job, but sometimes I wish those fancy restaurants would hire people with half the skills I have. But no, instead, they insist on pushing us to our limits, making us work longer hours than we deserve.

But despite all this, I still try to put on a good face. I mean, what's the point of letting my frustration show? It'll only make things worse. So I force myself to smile and pretend everything is fine, even though deep down, I'm seething with resentment. Why does everyone get to enjoy life when I'm stuck here, burning out piece by piece? And then there's the worst part - the moment when I finally realize that I've made yet another mistake, one that could cost me my job.

She was always so quiet, so invisible. Maybe she didn't want anyone's attention. Maybe she just wanted to blend into the background. But why now? What made her feel so forgotten? As I read the note again, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong. I kept wondering if there was more to it than I understood. If she was trying to tell me something, but I wasn't listening. And yet...the more I thought about it, the more I realized how much I'd been assuming. Assuming that she'd spoken up, assuming that I'd noticed her, assuming that everything was okay. And maybe none of those things were true. Maybe this was all just a misunderstanding. Maybe she really meant what she wrote, and I needed to hear it. Or maybe...maybe she was right"

However, subtle changes began to creep into our relationship. He started spending more time away from home, often coming back late at night. While it wasn't uncommon for him to work late, his excuses grew increasingly elaborate over time. He claimed to have forgotten important dates, such as birthdays and anniversaries, which felt strange considering how meticulously he once kept track of these moments. As the days turned into weeks, I noticed something else: our conversations were no longer as effortless as they once were. He seemed distant, and when we spoke, every word felt forced. His responses were shorter, and even when he tried to make small talk, it sounded awkward. It was as if a barrier had begun to form between us, one that neither of us knew how to cross.
