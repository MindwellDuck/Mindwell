He's just chillin' in his own world, totally oblivious to all this while I'm stuck at my desk wondering why things are always so fucked up. Meanwhile, I hear our neighbors having a family game night every week. They're out there playing board games and baking cookies together, while I’m stuck here trying to figure out why my pipettes aren’t working right. But hey, who needs personal fulfillment when you've got a 3D printer to keep you company? And don't even get me started on my colleagues. They’re all so perfect – they balance work and family like pros, never seeming to struggle. One of them has a kid who comes over during lunch breaks, and another one volunteers regularly for local charities. Meanwhile, I'm fighting a losing battle against my own mental health, struggling to find joy in anything outside of work. It’s like everyone else is living their best life, except me. But let’s be real—those people probably spend hours in front of the mirror every morning, making sure their hair looks perfect. They likely have someone waiting for them after work, but I guess if I was lucky"

I didn't think much of it because we've had this happen before, especially when she's gone for longer trips. But now that she's actually gone, I'm starting to worry. This morning, as soon as she left, Max started whining nonstop. I tried giving him treats and playing with him, but nothing seemed to calm him down. He kept looking out the window, almost like he was waiting for...something. It freaked me out because he never does this; usually, he's content just chillin' in his bed or playing with his toys. Now, he's going wild, even more than usual. The noise level in the house is insane, making it hard to focus on anything else. I feel anxious trying to soothe him, but every time I try to settle him down, he just gets louder. I've checked the doors and windows multiple times, but there's no one outside, no signs of animals, just an eerie silence.

I know what I’m talking about, but sometimes I wonder if anyone actually listens anymore. People seem more interested in pushing their own views than hearing what someone else has to say. And when we do talk, it’s always about how much smarter we are compared to those who came before us. I guess that’s why they think they can dismiss my advice and act like they know better. But here’s the thing: I might be older, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know what I’m doing. Maybe it takes time to learn certain things, and that’s okay. The point is, we shouldn’t assume we’re automatically right just because we’ve had a little longer in life. That’s arrogant and disrespectful.

All I saw was the worn-out shopping cart rolling down the street, and suddenly every little thing seemed like a big deal. I mean, I get it - life gets busy, but is it really worth giving up on cooking altogether? Anyway, back to the cart - it looked pretty beat up, if you ask me. Maybe it belonged to someone who had given up on cooking too, just like some of us have. That thought alone made me feel guilty for not doing more to help out. I know I shouldn't be judging others for their choices, but still... It makes me wonder how many meals are being missed because nobody feels like taking the time to cook.
