Instead, she was left with an overwhelming sense of emptiness, a feeling that had been building inside her for months. It wasn't just the lack of physical presence; it was as if he'd vanished completely, leaving behind only memories. She remembered how he used to read under the same window, the sunlight streaming through the blinds, casting a warm glow over the room. He would sit there for hours, lost in thought, while she worked nearby, occasionally glancing at him to see what he was reading. Sometimes, he'd pick up his pen and start scribbling notes, but mostly he just sat quietly, absorbing the silence. Her coffee should taste sweet today, not bitter. But every time she sipped it, she couldn't shake off the feeling of disappointment. Five years had passed since he left, and yet, the pain remained. She should have moved on by now, built new routines, started seeing other people, but she hadn’t. Maybe it was because she kept expecting him to walk back through the door, as if time itself had forgotten about the past. That day, she should have seen him standing there, smiling, holding his bag and coffee, ready to return home. But instead, she saw nothing but dust and silence, the faint scent of his cologne lingering in the air. Everything should have fallen into place after that"

Even when I ask him to help with household chores, he makes excuses or says he’s too tired. And now, instead of coming home and sharing what happened at the office, he’s gone somewhere else, leaving me here to deal with everything by myself. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Last year, he worked long hours and barely came home until late. The day he finally got back, he was distant, almost as if he’d forgotten we were married. I remember feeling like I was drowning in the mess he left behind—the dishes piled high, the laundry waiting to be folded, the kids playing alone while I cleaned up after work. But then he just went off to bed, not even bothering to talk to us. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, like there was nothing left inside me except sadness. Now, I feel like that same emptiness is building up again, but nobody seems to care. Not even me. My friends say I need to focus on my own life, that I shouldn’t make my happiness dependent on someone who doesn’t seem to value it. But I don’t know why I keep trying,"

She stood up, leaving the table behind, feeling as though she’d lost control. Why did this pain keep coming back? Hadn’t she moved on enough already? Yet, the memory of his smile lingered, making everything seem hollow. She walked out of the café, feeling as though she'd failed somehow—a reminder that maybe she hadn't left enough room for herself to heal. Maybe there was no healing after losing someone you loved. Maybe life just didn’t allow it. And so, she let herself fall into despair once more. Her thoughts swirled around the idea that she should’ve been stronger by now, but what was the point of trying? Everything reminded her of him, and nothing seemed to fill the void. The world outside felt cold and dark, like it had never truly been hers to begin with. She couldn’t help but wonder if she was meant to stay away from places where memories of him lingered. Maybe she wasn’t strong enough to handle them. But then again, maybe she needed to confront these feelings head"

For those who didn't catch it, here's an attempt at clarifying what I meant by the term \"cognitive distortion\": A cognitive distortion is a mental shortcut our brain uses to simplify complex situations. In this case, I tried to capture the feeling of frustration and annoyance that comes when we feel that others are being thoughtless or insensitive, but in reality, they might simply not understand the situation or lack awareness about how it affects us. By saying things like \"they shouldn't,\" \"it's selfish,\" or \"how dare they,\" we’re unconsciously creating expectations that aren't actually based in reality. This kind of thinking can lead to more conflict and hurt feelings than necessary. If you'd like to explore this further, I'd love to discuss it! Just let me know :) #Edit"
