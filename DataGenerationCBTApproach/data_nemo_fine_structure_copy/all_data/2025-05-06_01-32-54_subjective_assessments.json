If you're gonna be mean like that, then go ahead. You never have to deal with the consequences of your actions. Just remember, there are plenty of other people out there who will appreciate you more than anyone else. And they won't judge you harshly because they see the good in everyone. So don't worry; I'm sure you'll find some way to move past this. You're an amazing artist after all, and no one deserves to be treated like this. ## Edit: This response was written in the heat of the moment and does not accurately represent the intended emotion. Thank you for pointing it out! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ–¤ðŸ’› ## Edit 2: Some folks asked why I used the phrase \"hurt\" instead of just saying \"angry\". My intention was to convey that I felt both anger AND sadness when reading the note. The word \"hurt\" seemed to fit better in conveying the pain I felt. However, I understand now that it could be interpreted as insincere. In hindsight, I probably wouldn't recommend using the word \"hurt\""

With this newfound determination, he began to focus on the present, letting go of the emotional weight that had held him back for so long.
