I can't handle this anymore. My heart is racing, and I'm shaking uncontrollably. I'm getting teary-eyed just thinking about it. How can anyone expect me to deal with such stress after everything I've been through lately? All these people are just piling up on me, making my life even harder. I just wish they would stop and let me rest. But no, instead of giving me a break, they're asking me to come back tomorrow. Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how much I need rest right now? Have you ever had to work such long hours with barely enough sleep? You wouldn't understand. Everyone has it easy except me. Why does it always have to happen to me? Can't anyone see how stressed I am? Don't they care? Why do they keep pushing me around like this? It's not fair at all. I'm already so tired, but I have to go back tomorrow? Just great. Now I'll have to spend more time away from my family and friends. I hate working"

However, their behavior was **unacceptable**, leading me to feel **disappointed** by their disrespect. It seemed like they were **deliberately** trying to provoke the officer, making it harder for him to maintain his composure. Their actions were **unprofessional**, and I couldn't help but think that their behavior was **out of line** with what I considered appropriate conduct. **Cognitive Distortion:** Should Statements In this instance, my subjective reaction reveals a deep-seated belief that certain behaviors \"should\" conform to my expectations. This distortion led me to view the teens' actions as unacceptable, despite their apparent intent to engage in playful banter. By assuming that their behavior was \"unprofessional,\" I projected my own standards onto their actions, disregarding the possibility that they may have been simply enjoying themselves. This distorted thinking resulted in feelings of disappointment and frustration, which may have clouded my judgment and influenced my perception of the situation. In reality, their behavior could have been seen as harmless, yet my preconceived notion of what \"should\" happen created an overly negative interpretation. **Response End**"

When she looked back at the photos from her childhood, memories that used to bring joy now brought sadness. It was as if time itself was moving faster for everyone else, leaving her behind. A small gesture from someone she considered a friend—“Have you tried looking into those job openings again?”—felt like a slap in the face. They didn’t seem to remember her struggles or the long hours she spent preparing lessons, just the fact that she was still there. It made her feel like she was drowning in the sea of other teachers who might be more deserving of attention. The isolation hit hard, even in the midst of so many people. Everyone seemed to have someone to share their thoughts with, whether it was a partner, a friend, or a colleague. But when she opened up to anyone, she felt like she was just another name in a crowded room. No one really listened, and she knew it. The weight of her loneliness was crushing, making every step feel like a struggle. Maybe it was time to let go, to accept that some things are beyond fixing, and move forward.

And now, here we are, months later, and he still can't seem to move forward. Nothing ever changes. Everything is always going to be like this. She'll never come back, and I'll never find peace. # This response reflects Overgeneralization because it takes an isolated incident (the moment when he saw the hammer) and exaggerates it into a pattern of behavior, suggesting that he has always acted this way since she left. Instead of acknowledging the specific context of that moment, it generalizes it into a broader statement about his entire life, creating an unrealistic expectation that he will never heal from the loss. This kind of thinking prevents him from accepting reality and finding ways to cope with his emotions, leading to further distress. By doing so, he reinforces a fixed mindset, making it harder for him to open himself up to new experiences and relationships.
