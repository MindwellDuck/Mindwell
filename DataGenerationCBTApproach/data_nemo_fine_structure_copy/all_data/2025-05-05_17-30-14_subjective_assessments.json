Yeah, I'm sure that will put a huge smile on your face. You must be so proud of yourself for working hard and getting passed over for promotions, huh? That's why you always act like a dick towards everyone younger than you, right? You probably thought, \"Wow, if I could just say something like, 'Hey boss, maybe you shouldn't have done that'... Then he'd think I'm actually helping him out, not trying to take away his power,\" but nope, that never happens. Instead, you end up coming off as a jerk who thinks he knows better.

Every moment spent walking home feels like an eternity, each step echoing through his mind like a haunting reminder. The darkness surrounding him deepens, yet it doesn't seem to penetrate, as if he’s walking under a perpetual veil of shadow. He stops beside the empty bench, the place where once they found solace in each other's company. Now, it stands bare, devoid of warmth, leaving him feeling isolated, even among the bustling city. As he looks around, the silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional distant hum of traffic. The few people passing by seem oblivious to his presence, their footsteps a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside him. A single, wilted rose lies on the ground, its petals limp and lifeless, a poignant symbol of what could never be again. He pauses, his gaze drifting toward the flower, and then back to the spot where they last stood together. For a moment, he wonders why she left, why this chance encounter didn’t become something more. But those thoughts are quickly drowned out by memories—memories that haunt him every day. They remember how she used to smile when she talked about her dreams; how her laughter was music to his ears; how her hand felt warm against his skin, and how her eyes sparkled in the sunlight. They recall how she would read him stories before bed, her voice weaving magic into words, and how her fingers would gently"

But nothing changes. If I had just done things differently, maybe I could have saved her. Maybe if I'd known about the heart attack sooner, I could've gotten her to the hospital before it was too late. Or what if she wasn't really sick? What if she faked it all because she couldn't handle living without me? I keep telling myself that I need to move on, but how can I when I'm so convinced she's still here? Every night, I lie awake, waiting for some sign that she'll come back. I wonder if she's still out there, somewhere, if she knows I'm thinking of her. The pain is unbearable. What if I just waited longer? Would she be alive today? I know I need to stop dwelling, but how can I when every memory of us feels like it could have been different if only...if only... Sometimes I catch glimpses of her, in the corner of my eye, but when I turn, she's gone. Maybe it's just my imagination playing tricks on me, but I swear she's still here. I try to convince myself"

Now he’s just another statistic in a school full of broken dreams and failed aspirations. The way she handled it? Just horrible. It's so easy to see what happens when you don't care enough to stop them from getting hurt. I know teachers are supposed to be there for everyone, but honestly, some of them aren't cut out for it. They’re either too busy or too selfish to make real connections. When you're someone like her, all those promises and smiles just ring hollow. You’d think she'd at least try harder to keep them happy, but no, she just lets things slide because she thinks she can handle it all herself. Newsflash, though: you can't fix everything. Sometimes, you just need to let people go before they completely break down. You know, I've seen other teachers struggle with similar situations. Some of them actually listen to what their students have to say and try to understand where they're coming from.

When I saw her, I felt like I was looking at a stranger, someone who might have been me once, but now was just an imitation. Her smile was there, but it was fake, a reminder of all the times I'd tried to make her happy, all the ways I'd failed. We were supposed to be together, but she kept reaching for things that weren't hers. My shirts, my books, even my phone - everything was hers now, and I felt like I was losing myself in the process. One day, I'll open the closet, and instead of finding her clothes, I'll find nothing but memories, every thread of the past tangled in the fabric of time. Every time she wears it, I see us again.

As I sat there, trying to focus on my work, I couldn’t help but think about how far behind I am. My sister, for instance, had already left for school by the time I woke up. And yet here I was, still lying in bed, unable to shake off the feeling of inadequacy that comes with knowing what she does every day.
