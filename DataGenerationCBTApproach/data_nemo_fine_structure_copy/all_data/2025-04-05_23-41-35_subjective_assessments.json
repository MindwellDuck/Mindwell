So anyway I'm watching him and he's just standing there looking all stiff and serious and I can tell he's trying to decide what to do next and then suddenly he just turns around and starts walking away and I'm thinking okay well maybe he decided to leave but nope he comes back and he looks even angrier than before and I swear his face is turning purple and he's muttering to himself about how he always gets treated this way and how he never has anyone to hang out with anymore and how he's sick of being ignored and left behind. He started talking to himself and saying things like “why does everyone have to be so mean” and “he doesn't deserve to die alone” and “it’s not fair” and stuff like that and I'm just standing here feeling so angry because I know he’s going to go after those kids and I don’t know if they’ll ever see it coming and I feel so helpless knowing that they might get hurt and I keep thinking about how this whole thing is probably going to end badly and how I wish someone would stop him before he hurts those poor kids again and"

She smiles back, but it fades as the customer breezes past her without acknowledging her presence, grabbing their usual item from the display before exiting. No 'thank you', no eye contact, just another nameless transaction in a long day of countless others. The woman feels her shoulders slump slightly, the familiar ache of neglect settling in her chest like an old, unwanted friend.",

Their lack of recognition is a stark reminder that even after all these years, they still don't see me—just another face in the crowd. I feel the weight of our connection slipping through my fingers like sand in the hourglass, leaving nothing but dust and regret. The way they moved, swift and purposeful, like a ghost passing through my space, was almost mocking. It was as if they'd forgotten I was there, or worse, didn't care to remember. The time we spent together, sharing laughter and small talk, meant nothing now—it was all just a fleeting illusion. I'm left wondering if I was ever more than just a convenient stop in their busy life, a mere pause between transactions. The thought cuts deep, a harsh reminder that in their eyes, I’m just another disposable part of the shopping experience. Every moment we shared seemed to fade away, erased by the rush of their daily routine. Our conversations, which once flowed so naturally, were reduced to nothing more than a distant memory, lost in the chaos of their hectic schedule. Even the smallest gestures, like offering a smile or asking how my week went, had become hollow, devoid of genuine interest. They never stopped to think about what made me happy or what I wanted; I was just another cog in their shopping list, a necessary step in their path. In that"

I keep thinking about how he must have known him better than me, how he probably feels sorry for me, but he doesn't deserve to touch my husband's legacy like that. I swear, every time I see him, I want to throw up. My mind won't stop racing with questions, but I just know he's lying. I can tell he's trying to make me look bad, making it seem like I'm somehow responsible for my husband's death. I don't know why, but it makes me so angry. I'm going to go talk to him after this presentation and ask him what he means by that. Maybe he'll explain himself, but I doubt it. This whole thing is just too much for me.

She knows what she wants - justice, but does she really want to hurt him too? He looks up, his eyes meeting hers, and for a moment, she feels like he understands her pain. Then, he smiles and goes back to his laughter, leaving her feeling alone once more. She tries to shake off the feeling, focusing instead on the task at hand. But every time she glances at him, she wonders if he knows what's going on inside her, if he can sense the tension building. Is he trying to read her mind, to figure out why she's so angry? Or is this just her own guilt talking? She can't help but feel like there's something more to his smile, some hidden message she can't quite decipher. And yet, even though she's determined not to let it get to her, she finds herself wondering how much he knows about her inner turmoil. Does he suspect anything? Does he ever wonder what she's thinking? As she works, her gaze keeps drifting back to him. She knows she needs to keep her focus,"

It feels like you’re reading way too much into things and overthinking it all. Like, come on, let’s just relax and stop assuming everyone has the same feelings towards everything we give them. Maybe it’s time to chill out and stop worrying so much about other people’s opinions. You’re putting way too much pressure on yourself by thinking they might feel awkward or uncomfortable with something you thought was thoughtful. Just take a deep breath and remember that it’s okay to make mistakes sometimes. It’s not worth stressing yourself out over something that probably doesn’t mean as much to them as you think.
