It's almost as if we're all waiting for something more, but it never comes. Sometimes I wonder if that's just our minds playing tricks on us. We look for signs of life everywhere, even in the smallest things. Like that photo you mentioned—it seemed like it held a thousand memories, but now it's just another reminder of what we've lost. It's funny how we can hold onto those moments so tightly, yet they slip away like sand between our fingers. It’s almost as if we’re trying to fill the spaces with things that aren’t really there. But what if that’s exactly what we need? Maybe it’s okay to let go of what’s real and cling to what feels like hope. After all, isn’t it better to imagine a brighter future than to accept the darkness? Maybe I’m just looking for excuses to keep going. It’s easier to pretend that everything will get better someday than to face the truth. But deep down, I think we all know what’s really going on. We’re just too scared to admit it out loud.

They have developed a mindset where every experience outside of work is seen as irrelevant or unimportant. They often find themselves feeling disappointed or even resentful when they aren't able to dedicate all their time to working hard for promotions. This tendency can lead them to overlook positive moments from other areas of life, such as personal achievements or simply enjoying time with loved ones. For instance, let’s say John had a great conversation with someone about their weekend plans, but instead of feeling happy about it, he focuses solely on how it doesn’t align with his schedule for work. In reality, that conversation was a nice break from his stressful job, but due to his fixation on career advancement, John dismisses its value. This behavior stems from his deep-seated belief that anything other than work is just \"waste\" of time. As a result, he misses out on the joy of sharing those moments with others because they're not related to his professional goals. John tends to view these events through the lens of potential opportunities to increase productivity or achieve more hours worked. Even though he knows intellectually that having fun isn’t necessarily bad for him, he struggles to connect that feeling with his own desires. For him, there’s no room for “leisure” or relaxation unless it directly benefits his career"
