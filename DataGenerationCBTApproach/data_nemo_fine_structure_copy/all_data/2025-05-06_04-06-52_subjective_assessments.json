He noticed something peculiar on his favorite mug, the one with the witty \"World's Best Teacher\" inscription. It was caked in dried remnants of yesterday's lunch - a half-eaten tuna sandwich, by the looks of it. His stomach churned as he picked up the offending item, the pungent odor of spoiled fish and moldy bread filling his nostrils. He felt a wave of disgust wash over him, not just at the sight, but at the thoughtlessness behind it.",

This was the third time he'd forgotten to clean up after himself, and each time, he felt worse about it. **I really need to work on being more considerate of others' feelings, especially when they're already stressed out with schoolwork. But what kind of teacher does that?** As he looked around the room, he saw colleagues chatting and laughing together. They were probably discussing the latest football match, completely oblivious to his shame. **They're always talking about sports, aren't they? Just like me, always thinking about football instead of studying. What kind of teacher am I if I can't focus on what matters?** A coworker approached him, smiling warmly. \"Hey, you look a bit...off today.\" She glanced at his hands, which were still holding the dirty dish. **What is she saying?

I’m constantly being told I’m not doing enough, but honestly, I feel like I’m barely holding it together. It’s exhausting. And now, to top it all off, I have to deal with my mom calling me. She'll probably ask me to pick up more stuff because she forgot again, which will just add to my stress. This whole situation is making me want to scream. Why does everyone treat me like this?

Or when there were rumors about kids cheating, and I couldn't shake off the fear that I would miss something important because I wasn’t paying attention. When you're constantly wondering about those things, you start to wonder if they’re more than just hypothetical scenarios. You begin to think that maybe it’s all too much to handle, and sometimes you feel like giving up. But then you remember why you started teaching in the first place—to make a difference—and push through. It’s funny how your mind can go from thinking of problems to imagining the worst-case scenario so quickly. Sometimes, even after a long day, I find myself lying awake at night, replaying all the times I doubted my ability to teach effectively. It’s not fair to let those thoughts consume me, but it’s hard not to when you see your students struggling with subjects that seem simple. What if these doubts are more than just anxiety? What if they’re signs of deeper issues? Sometimes, late at night, I worry about whether I’m doing enough to help them succeed or if I’m making things harder by being too strict. I know I need to focus on finding ways to support them better, but it’s"
