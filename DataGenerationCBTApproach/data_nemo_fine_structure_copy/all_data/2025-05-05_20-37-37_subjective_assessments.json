The realization hit me like a ton of bricks, and I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of shame wash over me. It seemed so obvious now, yet I had missed it entirely until then. As I stood there, frozen in dismay, the weight of my mistake bore down upon me. Every fiber of my being seemed to scream in anguish, and I could hardly bear to look anyone in the eye. My mind reeled with thoughts of what others must be thinking, and how they might perceive me. The room around me began to blur, and all I could think about was the fact that my work had been so carelessly overlooked. How could something so simple have slipped through my notice? How could I have been so blind? It was almost as if I was in a daze, unable to process the magnitude of my error. I felt as though I was drowning in my own self-loathing, and every moment felt like an eternity. The air seemed to thicken, and time itself appeared to slow down, leaving me trapped in this pit of despair. Every glance from the guests felt like a knife twisting in my chest, each smile a cruel reminder of my failure. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could feel my face burning with heat. I was convinced that everyone else knew more than I did, that they were all secretly"

I mean, who wouldn't be bitter when someone talks behind their back like that? But deep down, she must know that it's just one person's opinion, right? It makes sense that she feels this way, though. If people were talking negatively about her, she would feel the same way. After all, isn't it natural to feel angry when others speak ill of us? Maybe she's just more sensitive than most, which explains why she's taking it personally. It's understandable that she'd feel hurt when strangers talk about her in such a way. What if they're just jealous of her success? Maybe Johnson is just trying to get attention by criticizing her. We can't really trust what we hear from strangers, especially when it comes to personal matters. People often say things out of spite or insecurity. Even though she might feel defensive, it's likely that she understands intellectually that everyone has the right to their opinions. But her emotions are still guiding her reactions, making her seem overly sensitive. Still, it's hard not to take criticism personally when people are talking about your work. Maybe she doesn’t want to think too much about how this story will affect her career. However, her emotional state is leading her to assume the worst about it. Her feelings are clouding her judgment, causing her to overreact"

This is because the individual is avoiding acknowledging any positive aspects of the situation. ## Step 1: Identify the Triggering Event The triggering event is when the protagonist notices a shadow moving in his peripheral vision and decides to call 911. ## Step 2: Analyze the Cognitive Distortion The cognitive distortion is discounting the positive, where the individual avoids acknowledging any positive aspects of the situation. In this case, the protagonist focuses solely on the fear and stress caused by the incident, rather than considering the potential benefits of calling 911. ## Step 3: Generate a Subjective Reaction Reflecting the Cognitive Distortion To generate a subjective reaction reflecting the cognitive distortion, we need to create a response that shows the individual is avoiding acknowledging any positive aspects of the situation. Here's an example: \"I can't help but feel a sense of relief when I think about how much stress I avoided by calling 911. It might seem irrational to some, but the fear I felt was real. I'm glad"
