The fact that I didn't hear anything else happening in the room just goes to show how much I was focused on closing this stupid door. It's so frustrating - why does everyone have to make such a big deal about something like this? I guess I really am that clumsy sometimes. But honestly, can't anyone else see what's going on here? You'd think someone would notice me trying to fix this situation before making a scene. Instead, I get slammed into desks, and now I'm dealing with all these books scattered everywhere. This isn't funny anymore. Why do people always assume the worst when they're already stressed out? I know you're busy, but come on, don't act like I'm some kind of idiot just because I got distracted for a second. If you were paying attention, you wouldn’t have even made an issue out of this. Now I’m stuck cleaning up your mess too. How do you expect me to teach when you guys keep disrupting my lessons? Can't you see I'm trying to focus? Why are you acting so dramatic about something that could've easily been avoided if we’d taken a few seconds to pay attention? Oh wait, no one ever listens to me anyway. So why bother trying? You’re probably thinking, “But John’s being overly sensitive again,” but let me tell you"

Her mind is consumed by these thoughts—she can't help but ask herself, \"What if I hadn't left?\" or \"What if I'd stayed longer?\" It's clear she's stuck in this cycle, constantly replaying scenarios where she might have achieved more. For instance, she thinks, \"What if I had pushed myself harder, maybe then I would have gotten noticed?\" or \"What if I'd kept going after that first failure?\" These musings aren't just idle speculations; they're a reminder of all she gave up. She was so close to success, yet everything fell apart. Now, every day feels like another disappointment. It's not just the lack of fame or fortune that hurts; it's the realization that she sacrificed her happiness for something she never really wanted anyway. In her mind, she keeps asking, \"What if I had kept going?\" But deep down, she knows the truth—it's too late for regrets. Yet, she continues to wonder, \"What if I had done things differently?\" Even though she knows the answer, she can't shake off the feeling of regret.

Like he wasn’t burdened by the weight of what he was doing. It was then that I noticed the cigarette pack. The exact brand my wife used to smoke. It hit me like a punch to the gut – this must be the one responsible for ending her life. My instincts screamed at me to act, but something about his demeanor stayed my hand. As I approached, he looked up, and our eyes met. For a fleeting moment, we just stared at each other. Then, he quickly gathered his belongings and left, disappearing into the darkness. I stood there, frozen, clutching the cigarette pack, feeling a mix of anger and confusion. How could someone so callous move through my city, handling my wife’s final moments like they were nothing more than a chore? This incident has left me shaken. Every time I see that brand of cigarette, it feels like a painful reminder of what I’ve lost.
