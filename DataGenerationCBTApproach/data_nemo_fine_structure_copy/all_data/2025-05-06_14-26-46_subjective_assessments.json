The nurse's words sent shivers down her spine, and she felt a surge of anxiety. She couldn't help but think about her husband's tragic accident, where he had lost his life just like this one. Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of siren wailing outside, followed by the sight of bodies strewn across the road. It was all too familiar, and she felt a wave of grief wash over her. She knew that her husband wouldn't have wanted her to be so upset, especially given what they'd been through together. But she couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt that came with every emergency call. Every time someone else faced a crisis, it reminded her of how close her husband had come to death. He would always tell her that he loved her no matter what, but now she felt like she wasn't doing enough for him. She remembered the countless times they'd talked about wanting children before he died. They had discussed everything from the type of family they'd want to build to the kind of education they wanted for their kids. Now, all those plans seemed pointless, and she wondered if she was even worthy of love after losing such a big part of herself. It wasn't just her emotions; the way everyone around her reacted made her feel worse. Some people seemed detached, while others were overly dramatic. One nurse who had worked with her husband kept"

It wasn’t fair; why did they get to share moments like this when he felt so disconnected from life? He wondered if they knew about the scars that lay beneath her smile, the weight of loneliness that followed every step. It seemed unfair to compare himself to someone like her, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was somehow less worthy. Every glance made him feel like an intruder, like he didn't belong in their world. She didn't know anything about him, and it hurt to think that she might never understand what it was like to carry such heavy burdens."

Now she was rushing to meet her mentor, who was probably already at the studio, pacing and checking his watch. She could picture him, his brow furrowed under his thick glasses, disappointment radiating from him like heat waves. Her heart pounded in her chest as she grabbed her coat, keys jingling wildly in her trembling hand. She had to get there, had to prove herself, had to show she wasn't a fraud.

And don't even get me started on the whole \"she didn't finish anything\" thing. If she hadn't spent the entire night stressing about it, maybe she would have actually gotten some work done. It sounds like she's always procrastinating, which means she must be a total slacker. How many times has this happened before? Every single day? Or is it just a coincidence that she's always late now? You know what? Maybe she's not doing enough work because she doesn't want anyone to see how bad she really is. So she's always running behind, trying to hide her failures. And honestly, I'm surprised she hasn't completely burned out yet. With how much anxiety she must be experiencing, it's a wonder she can still function. That whole \"not finishing anything\" thing probably isn't just a coincidence—maybe she's just too scared to try anymore. Anyway, whatever. Late again, huh? Well, that's exactly what happens when you're so lazy you can't even manage to start on time. I mean, come on. Can't you even set your alarm clock correctly? Oh wait, you did that last time, right?"

Every time something goes wrong, it's always her fault.

She looks at the empty kitchen, feeling a pang of loneliness. No one is here to talk to, to share the stress. Everyone else has left, probably tired of dealing with her too. And honestly, who can blame them? She's been struggling lately. Her mind keeps wandering back to her past mistakes, replaying them over and over like a broken record. A small part of her wonders if maybe she's the reason things go wrong. Maybe she's the problem, not just some unlucky mistake. But what would she even do differently now? Everything was already set before she started cooking. She knew the menu inside out, practiced every step until she could execute it flawlessly. So why did it all fall apart again? She takes another bite of the tomato, the taste bitter as usual. How can something so simple be ruined by such a trivial thing? She pushes the thought aside and continues chopping, but the"
