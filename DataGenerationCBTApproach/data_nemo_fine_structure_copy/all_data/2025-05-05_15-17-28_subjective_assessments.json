That's not how relationships work. And why did he even tell her about us? Does he want her to think she has a chance? Please, he wouldn't dare. We've been together for years, and he knows I'm the one for him. This is some kind of prank, right? Someone playing a sick joke on her, trying to make her look bad. But she's going to get hers anyway. I'll show her, oh yeah. First off, I need to calm down. My mind is racing, and I feel like I might explode. Then there's the fact that I have no idea where they were when they had these conversations. Did they meet at school? At work? Maybe at a bar? Or maybe he met her online somehow? How does she even know about us? Does she have his phone? Has she hacked into his email? No way. She wouldn't pull something like that. Unless... unless she really wants him back, which makes sense. After all, she could be better than me, but I don’t think she’d actually go through with it. Still, I need to take action. What"

I guess it's good for him to relax.” Her tone is somewhat dismissive, implying that his hobby isn't worth noticing. “Anyway, I have my own stuff to catch up on,” she adds, gesturing towards her laptop. “I need to finish writing my article. He’s probably going to go out later, so we won’t see each other until tomorrow.” She pauses briefly before continuing, “And honestly, I'm more excited about getting back into my routine than anything he’s doing right now.” Her words suggest that she’s not particularly interested in what her partner is doing, even though he does something she appreciates—reading. It feels like she’s downplaying his enthusiasm over someone else's success, maybe because she doesn't want to show her own lack of engagement in his interests. Instead of acknowledging the positivity, she's focusing on how she'd rather be doing things herself. That subtle shift in attention makes it seem like she might be avoiding the positive experience altogether."
