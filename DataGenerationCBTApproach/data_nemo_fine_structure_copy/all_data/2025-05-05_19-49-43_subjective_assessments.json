It all started when my colleague received an email that was meant for me, but somehow ended up in her inbox. The email itself wasn't anything extraordinary; it simply contained some mundane information about our department's upcoming meeting, along with a reminder to review the agenda beforehand. What struck me as particularly amusing was how my coworkers reacted to this development. Their behavior seemed almost theatrical, as if they were intentionally trying to make light of the situation. I noticed that whenever I approached them, they would fall silent, their faces contorted in mock seriousness. It was clear that they were attempting to stifle their laughter, but it was futile – the smiles on their faces betrayed their efforts. As I stood there, feeling increasingly self-conscious, one of my colleagues caught my eye. She had been part of the group that was gathered around the email, and her expression seemed to convey a mix of amusement and disdain. When she looked away, I couldn't help but feel like I'd crossed some invisible line, one that marked me as someone who didn't quite measure up. Even though I knew that everyone else was just having fun, the image of them laughing behind my back has stayed with me. This incident has left me feeling rather isolated, even among people I've known for years. While they seem to be moving forward with their lives, I'm struggling to come to terms with what"

Doesn't she see how hard he worked to create something worthy of her attention? It's almost as if she knew exactly what she wanted and could've never cared less about his efforts. She must have been bored with his style, thinking it too simple or too bland compared to the masterpieces she'd seen elsewhere. Her indifference left him feeling exposed and unvalued, as if she'd never taken his passion seriously. Why couldn't she appreciate his dedication, even if his work wasn't as refined as hers? Hadn't he given everything to make it special? Didn't he deserve some acknowledgment? Yet here she was, dismissing him so nonchalantly, as if his artwork meant nothing to her.

Maybe if I could just put myself in someone else’s shoes, I’d understand why they get to live these perfect days while I’m stuck in my own misery. But deep down, I know it’s not fair.
