It felt like he'd forgotten about our shared history overnight, moving on as if nothing had ever happened. His smile looked genuine, and he seemed completely at ease with this other woman, which made it even harder to accept. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of life he must have built since leaving us. At first, I tried to convince myself that maybe it wasn’t as bad as I imagined. That maybe he’d simply lost touch with friends over time, and this was just an opportunity for him to reconnect with others. But as I watched them laughing together, I started to feel like I was losing my mind. It didn’t feel right; it shouldn’t feel right. We had a bond that went deeper than just friendship, something special that no one could take away. Why did it seem like he’d already moved on? I’ve been trying to remind myself that life goes on, that people move forward whether they’re single or married. Maybe I’m just holding onto memories too tightly, making it hard for myself to see how much better this could be for him. But seeing him with someone else has left a bitter taste in my mouth, like salt on open wounds. It feels unfair, especially after everything we"

The image lingers in her mind like a specter, haunting her every step as she works tirelessly to keep the store running smoothly. With each passing minute, her conviction grows stronger: \"There definitely must be someone in there.\" It becomes almost impossible to ignore the intuition that something is amiss, that there could be a life hidden behind those closed doors, waiting for rescue. Despite the nagging doubt creeping into her mind, she presses on, driven by a mix of curiosity and concern. As the day wears on, she finds herself constantly scanning the area, hoping against hope that she might catch a glimpse of movement - a fleeting shadow, a flicker of light, anything that would prove her worst fears wrong.
