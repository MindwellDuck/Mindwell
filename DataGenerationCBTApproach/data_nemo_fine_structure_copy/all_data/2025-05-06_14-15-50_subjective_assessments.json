You probably don't understand anything I'm doing here. But you have the nerve to comment on it, like your opinion matters. It doesn't matter if you think the painting looks messy. You can't possibly comprehend its meaning because you haven't taken the time to appreciate art. So why are you trying to tear me down by saying something so stupid? Does it feel good to act like a condescending idiot? Does it make you feel superior to everyone else who actually knows what they're talking about? You want to know what's messy? Your lack of intelligence. At least my paintings aren't as ugly as your ignorance. And another thing - you shouldn't be pointing at my work and making comments like that. You look at things with a blank expression, and then you try to criticize them? Don't you ever get tired of being a fucking moron?

Maybe I'll never forgive myself for what happened. That scarf holds so much meaning. I remember when she made it for me, how she'd spent hours knitting, carefully choosing colors that matched her eyes. It means everything to me. Why can't I stop thinking about what I did? I keep replaying the argument in my head, wondering if there's anything I could've done differently. I feel like I'm losing her, even though she says everything is fine. I can't shake this feeling of guilt, like I'm drowning in my own making. Every little thing feels like a reminder of our broken relationship. Even small things, like how she forgot to wear her earrings during dinner last week, make me feel like I'm losing her. I hate these feelings, but they won't go away.
