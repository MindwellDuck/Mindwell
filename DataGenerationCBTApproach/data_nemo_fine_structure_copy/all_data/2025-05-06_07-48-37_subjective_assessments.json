She's been able to focus on her career and hobbies. She doesn't have to deal with financial stress or the pressure of making ends meet. And she has a comfortable life with our kids, unlike me. It makes me feel like I'm failing as a husband and father. I wonder if there’s something wrong with me that I couldn’t provide for them. Maybe it’s because I always felt inadequate compared to my ex-wife’s more stable family life. I wish I had a partner like her, someone who could support us through tough times and help us build a secure future. But instead, I’ve been left alone, struggling to make ends meet and feeling overwhelmed by the bills. I guess I'll just have to keep going and hope things get better someday.** **But why does it have to be so hard? Why can't I have a happy marriage like some people? What am I missing out on?**"

She probably thinks I'm some kind of idiot because I watch TV shows with her, which are way below my reading level. And yeah, maybe I am an asshole for not being able to tell what's going on in The Office or whatever show she's into. But damn, I tried to get her interested in something once, and she just laughed at me, saying I must be \"dying from embarrassment.\" Fuck that shit. She's always acting like she has better things to do than spend time with me, and I fucking deserve it. So yeah, I'm done. I'll go home, put on my favorite music, and forget about her.

The frustration was palpable, building into a sense of hopelessness that felt suffocating, yet she couldn’t seem to break free from this cycle of disappointment. It all felt so familiar, like she was stuck in a never-ending loop of missed opportunities, each one reinforcing her perception that she just wasn’t cut out for this. Every moment felt like another step backward, further entrenching her feelings of inadequacy and regret. Yet, despite this overwhelming sense of defeat, there was a part of her that couldn’t shake off the feeling that maybe things weren’t entirely over. Maybe, just maybe, there was still a way to turn things around, to find a glimmer of redemption that could help her move forward. But deep down, the nagging voice whispered doubts about its feasibility, making it harder to muster the energy to keep going. It felt like she was trapped between two opposing forces—one pushing her toward giving up, the other urging her to hold on, even if it meant just getting through the next day. Each day felt like a test, with the outcome always the same: disappointment and frustration. It didn’t matter how hard she tried; no matter what she did, she kept falling short, unable to escape"

No one was home, yet she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. The thought lingered, refusing to dissipate, much like the scent of fresh paint that clung to her clothes. She walked into the kitchen, where her daughter sat by herself, staring blankly at a book. Her eyes were red-rimmed, and her small frame seemed fragile against the backdrop of the room. She looked lost, like a tiny ship adrift in a stormy sea. A faint hum emanated from the corner, where her laptop lay open, its screen glowing softly. But there was no music, no sign of life, just emptiness. Her gaze fell upon the calendar on the fridge, a jumbled mess of dates and events, some marked with bright colors, others faded. It was like looking at a puzzle with missing pieces, a reflection of her own brokenness. Each date represented a moment, a memory, a promise left unkept. Some days had been filled with laughter, while others remained blank, like unsent letters. The more she stared, the more she realized that time itself had become a puzzle, a riddle she struggled to solve. As she turned"
