Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart, being smart doesn't automatically mean you deserve to slack off. I'm sick of having to pick up the pieces when you're too lazy to lift a finger. If you want to talk about fairness, maybe you should start by telling me how many hours you put into studying every year compared to the countless hours I spend coding non-stop.

He didn't seem to care about her efforts; she could sense it when she saw how quickly he finished his work and left. The message he sent seemed dismissive, almost careless—'Just finishing up, will see you later,' he'd said, before disappearing into the night. Even though they were supposed to enjoy dinner together, she ended up eating alone, feeling like a fool for putting so much effort into something that clearly wasn't important to him. It's hard not to think that this is what happens whenever she tries to make things special. Every little gesture or thoughtful plan gets ignored, leaving her wondering if she'll ever find someone who truly cares about her. The more she tries, the further away she feels, like she's just pretending to be part of a relationship that doesn't actually exist. It's as if she’s stuck in some kind of loop, constantly hoping for connection but always ending up alone. Sometimes it feels like the whole world is moving forward while she stays behind, watching everything go by through a window of disappointment.

You're probably thinking, \"But it's just a photo,\" right? Well, I'll tell you something - every moment with her was precious. We spent countless hours together, laughing and loving each other. I remember how she used to curl up beside me, feeling safe in my arms. What happened between us was real, and I'm not going to erase those memories.

Chef Henri, the man who had been cooking for us for decades, had decided to retire. I remember when he first started working here; he was young, eager, and full of energy. Over time, he became more subdued, but he never lost his passion for food. He took pride in every dish he prepared, from simple salads to intricate meals. His recipes were always based on traditional techniques passed down through generations of chefs. There was something special about watching him work; his movements seemed almost choreographed, as if he were performing an art form. But now, he's gone. It feels strange to think that someone else will take his place. We've all seen how hard it is to find someone with the same skills and dedication. I wonder if this person will be up to the challenge. I imagine them struggling to live up to Chef Henri’s legacy, to replicate even a fraction of what he accomplished. It's daunting to think that there might not be anyone capable enough to keep his standards high. Even though we know the chef is still alive and likely enjoying retirement, I can't shake off the feeling that this change is going to have far-reaching consequences. I recall how much I admired Chef Henri. He wasn’t just a chef; he was a mentor,"

The truth is, nothing comes easily; you have to work hard, put in time, and dedication to achieve anything worthwhile.

It's infuriating when they complain about the lack of jobs or opportunities, yet they spend hours mindlessly binge-watching TV shows and playing pointless online games.
