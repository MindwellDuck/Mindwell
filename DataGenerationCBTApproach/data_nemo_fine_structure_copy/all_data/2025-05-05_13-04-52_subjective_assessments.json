A young man, barely more than a boy, lay unconscious on the stretcher, his face pale against the stark white sheet. She rushed to assist, but her arthritic hands fumbled with the IV line, refusing to cooperate despite her mental commands. Around her, colleagues flowed seamlessly, but she was stuck, helpless in the whirlwind of crisis.",

This isn't just an oversight—it feels like a deliberate attempt by the system to keep him in the workforce forever. The Ministry of Education must be playing some kind of game here. They're probably trying to make him work longer than he should, just to save money. That's why no one told him about the application process—so they could keep him there longer. It's not even like he didn't want to retire. He'd been looking forward to it for years. But somehow, everything fell through the cracks. Now, all those years are wasted, and he’s still stuck in the same job. This is insane; he needs to take action right away. His frustration boils over as he thinks about how much time he'll lose because of this mistake. He’s already behind schedule, and now he has to deal with the hassle of applying again. It's not fair. He shouldn't have to go through all this trouble just because someone messed up. He shakes his head, feeling overwhelmed. This whole situation is just another example of how broken the system is.

As he sits here, staring blankly at the computer screen, he feels lost in a sea of possibilities.

She wanted to be there for us all, no matter what, even if it meant putting herself at risk. But then, she died—suddenly, without warning—and left me here, feeling lost and alone. At first, everything felt like a nightmare. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I’d been punched in the gut. It was as if time itself had slowed down, making each moment unbearable.

I realized that I wasn’t just mourning her; I was also remembering why she mattered so much. We were more than just classmates; we were friends who supported each other through thick and thin.
