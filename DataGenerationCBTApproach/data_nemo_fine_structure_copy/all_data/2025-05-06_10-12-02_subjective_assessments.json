The dinner he'd ordered was growing cold on the counter, untouched since the delivery person had left. His reflection in the window caught his eye - the bags under his eyes seemed heavier today, his shoulders more slumped than usual. He sank onto the couch, staring at the blank TV screen, wondering where everyone else was, why they all seemed to have lives except him. A notification flashed on his phone: \"You've been removed from the project team.\" His stomach churned as he read it again, the words echoing the emptiness around him. He felt a familiar pressure building behind his eyes, threatening to spill over. But tonight, even tears refused to come, leaving him alone with his suffocating silence and cold dinner.",

It's either he is having the time of his life, living every day to the fullest, and enjoying everything that comes his way or he is completely dead inside, wasting away in loneliness, and drowning in despair. There is no middle ground. No room for subtlety. If he doesn't feel like screaming at the top of his lungs every night, then he must be hiding some deep secret, some unspoken pain that threatens to consume him whole. And if he has just received a rejection letter from his dream job? That means he'll never find love, never experience happiness, and will spend the rest of his days trapped in a prison of his own making. It's either I am unstoppable, invincible, and free to live my best life or I am broken, crippled, and destined to rot in isolation forever. One or the other, there is no in-between."

Her gaze lingered on his smile, a pang of melancholy echoing through her as she remembered the laughter it once held.

Instead, she turned away, focusing on the beakers and test tubes before her, determined to lose herself in the methodical dance of science.",

Every moment with him was now tainted by memories of what could have been, leaving her lost in the past. The silence between them seemed to grow louder than ever, and she wondered if he'd even notice if she stopped calling. His absence felt like a weight, one that pressed down harder each day, making every step forward feel like a step backward. She tried to distract herself with work, but her mind kept wandering back to the same questions: What would have happened if they stayed together? Would things have gotten better? She thought about how much more patient she would've been, how she might have understood him better. Maybe he wouldn't have left after all. But those thoughts led to others: How long would they have lasted? Would she have changed somehow? Would he have seen her differently? She pushed those thoughts aside, telling herself she didn't need to dwell on the past. Yet, she couldn't help wondering if she would have become someone different too. In the end, she just sat there, surrounded by the familiar smell of chemicals and the soft hum of equipment. It wasn’t much comfort, but it was something. She took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand, trying to push her mind back into the present. Still, the past lingered, refusing to let go. Even as she worked, her eyes kept drifting back to the photo"

The image made his heart sink, even if it was buried beneath layers of resentment. She'd moved on, laughing with others who didn't have the weight of memories attached to their smiles. But then there was Alex, the new guy, who fit right in with her ease. They shared a laugh over some joke she must've told him, their bodies swaying toward each other as they leaned against the counter. It was as if they were sharing secrets, their heads nodding in sync, while he stood frozen, unable to tear his gaze away. Every time he saw them together, he felt like a failed experiment, left out because he no longer fitted the mold he once thought he did. He couldn't help but wonder what they talked about when they sat side by side, their legs touching under the table. It wasn't just the way they looked at each other; it was how their body language spoke volumes of comfort and familiarity. Even the way she rolled her eyes at one of Alex's jokes seemed natural, like she'd been doing it for years—something he used to do himself. Yet, every glance made him feel like a relic, left behind by the world moving forward without him. Now,"

The silence of their home was deafening; the echo of his laughter no longer bounced off the walls. She hadn't realized how much noise he made just breathing until it was gone.

It became a game—can she pack everything right this time? Can I guess what's missing? But that one time... oh man. She didn't even try. Just left me with nothing. No note, no apology, just silence. And then it happened again, and again, and again. Now I'm starting to think it's not just accidents; maybe she doesn’t care. Maybe she’s done packing lunches. Who knows why, but I’m tired of waiting for her to remember, tired of being disappointed. I feel like I have to remind her myself, just because she can't remember. It’s like she thinks I don’t notice when she forgets. But honestly, I’ve been doing this for years, and now I'm the one who has to tell her. It feels like she doesn’t trust me to remember things anymore. Even though I've been helping out more lately... It's not fair. This isn't about my sandwiches; it's about feeling forgotten.

Or maybe, deep down, he didn't want to acknowledge what she'd done, so he'd simply forgotten. Whatever the reason, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd let him down somehow. As she re-read the letter, she realized that she might have misinterpreted his message entirely. Perhaps he was expressing gratitude for something else, like support during finals week or advice on job hunting. It was possible that he genuinely appreciated those things too, but didn't mention them because he thought she already knew. She started to wonder if there was more to this letter than met the eye, if he was hiding something by writing such a vague statement. But then again, maybe he was just being polite, saying what he thought everyone would say. Either way, she couldn't help but feel disappointed and frustrated with herself for feeling this way. There must have been something she missed, some part of the story that made sense when seen in context. She hoped that someday she'd understand what really happened and learn from it."

They've been working hard, pouring their hearts into this project, and he's acting like they're nothing compared to him. His condescending attitude towards them makes me want to punch him through the screen. It's such an obvious power trip, and he knows it. Every time he walks by, he gives us a snooty look, as if he’s looking down on us. Doesn’t he realize that we’re all in this together?

When I tried explaining my passion for photography to her, she dismissed my hobby by saying, \"That's a waste of time.\" My grandmother does the same thing, but she's never shown any interest in my life beyond family matters. My parents also fall under this category. They have made numerous comments about how they don’t want me to pursue certain fields of study, citing reasons such as \"it won't pay well\" or \"you'll struggle with it.\" These statements are often accompanied by a patronizing tone, making me feel belittled whenever we discuss anything outside of our daily routines. It feels like no matter how many times I try to explain my interests or passions to these people, they continue to view them as trivial pursuits. This makes me wonder if there's more to them than meets the eye. Maybe they're struggling with something I can't see, and their behavior is a coping mechanism.
