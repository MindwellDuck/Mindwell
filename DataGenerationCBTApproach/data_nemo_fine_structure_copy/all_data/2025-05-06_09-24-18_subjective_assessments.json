She looked like she had no idea what she was doing, but that wasn't surprising since she hadn't been around gardening long enough to learn from my late wife. I've spent years cultivating those roses, and now they're being destroyed by this carelessness. It's infuriating. She didn't even seem to notice how much damage she was causing. Her smile was annoying, like she thought it made everything okay, but it just made me angrier. I couldn't believe she would just go into someone else's property, especially mine, and start messing things up. She probably doesn't have an ounce of responsibility in her. The fact that she didn't seem to care about what she was doing just added fuel to my anger. I'm not going to let her get away with this. I'll make sure she knows exactly who she's trespassing on. But at the same time, I don't want to be too harsh because I don't know if she's capable of understanding the full extent of what she did. Maybe she doesn't realize the destruction she caused, so maybe I shouldn't let it escalate further. But why should I be the one to calm her down? Doesn't she understand that destroying other people's property is wrong? And yet, she just kept smiling, like nothing was wrong. I can't stand her. She has no right to be here, and I won't let her think otherwise. I'll make sure everyone"

My mind racing, I recalled every time she'd brought home another chef's book, each one filled with annotated favorites. How could she betray me like this? My eyes scanned the pages, searching for more clues. But there, nestled among her notes, was a comment I'd never seen before. \"You're an amazing cook,\" it read. For a moment, I forgot what hit me next - the realization that she hadn't written that at all. That line was from a review on the back cover of the cookbook. Her hand had been elsewhere when she wrote those words. Yet, somehow, I knew exactly how she felt that day. I couldn't help but wonder if she was secretly planning to replace me with another chef, someone who could truly appreciate her recipes. This was more than just a mistake; it was a betrayal of trust.
