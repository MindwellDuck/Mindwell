You must be doing great, considering everything you've been through.\" --- # Example Response This is an example of a cognitive distortion called labeling or global labeling. It involves making sweeping generalizations about oneself based on one incident or feeling. Here’s why it matters: * **Subjective Reaction:** When someone says, “You’re so brave,” they might not mean it literally. They could be projecting their feelings onto you because they think you seem strong. * **Cognitive Distortion:** This statement creates a false narrative about you, implying that you are always brave and strong. In reality, you may feel vulnerable or weak in many situations. * **Impact:** If this happens repeatedly, it can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, or embarrassment. People may start questioning their true emotions, making it harder to express themselves honestly. * **Consequences:** Over time, this distorted view of yourself can affect relationships, self-confidence, and mental well-being. You might become overly defensive or anxious when others comment positively on you, fearing they see something different. * **Corrective Action:** To break this cycle, recognize when someone is using labels or stereotypes. Politely point out the assumption, saying, “I appreciate your kind"

She was always there for me, supporting me through every difficult day. But deep down, I knew things weren't right between us.

I'll never forgive myself for letting her go, but I guess I had no choice. Life doesn't work the way we imagine it, and sometimes you have to let go of what you love most. She deserves better than me, someone who couldn't handle her strength. I wish I could turn back time, tell myself to hold on tighter, to fight harder.
