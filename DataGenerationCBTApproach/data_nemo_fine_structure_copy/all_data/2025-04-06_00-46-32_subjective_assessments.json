You’re always trying to make excuses for her. But don’t try to justify what she does when we all know it’s just an attempt to get attention. And what’s with this new painting? Is it another one about heartbreak? Does she even care that they’re over? What if she didn’t want to tell us? Maybe she doesn’t want to hurt our feelings. Or maybe she thinks we won’t notice because we’re too busy being sad ourselves. We need to remind her that everyone around here is grieving, so why shouldn’t she be? This isn’t a good time for her to come in here. Why are you making it so easy for her? This is her chance to get under your skin, to rub it in your face. Don’t let her win!

The silence around him grew thicker, a heavy blanket that suffocated him, reminding him that no matter how hard he tried, he could never go back. He saw himself in those moments, trapped between love and heartache, unable to move forward. The pain became a constant companion, a shadow that followed him everywhere. Even in his dreams, it lingered, haunting him with memories of what could’ve been. The world outside seemed to keep moving, but he remained stuck, frozen in time. For him, there was no escape from the weight of those memories. They had become a part of him, a permanent reminder that sometimes, even the strongest bonds can break, leaving nothing but shadows where once there were full lives. He began to see himself as a man forever caught in the grip of his own pain. No matter how far he wandered, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was walking alone.
