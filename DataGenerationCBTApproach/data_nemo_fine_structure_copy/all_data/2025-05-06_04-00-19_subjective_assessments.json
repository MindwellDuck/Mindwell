They laughed together, enjoying each other's company while he worked alone, feeling like shit the whole time. He hated himself for what he'd done, but she never even noticed him. I'm such a loser. The thought made me want to cry. Every night, they sat by the fire, holding hands, and talking about their day. I wanted to be there, but I couldn't. I deserved to be left behind, because I'm worthless. They're happy together, while I'm here alone, eating dinner. It makes me sick to think about it. My stomach hurts just thinking about how much more fun they must be having than me, who is stuck working late nights alone. If only I could've been with her, I wouldn't feel this way. It's not fair that I'm always left out. I deserve better than this life. I wish he wouldn't watch us anymore, but I know it's futile. Maybe someday he'll realize how lucky he is, and things will change, but until then, I'll just suffer. I hate myself for wanting to hurt him. I can't stand watching our happiness when I feel so empty inside. I wonder if he knows how much pain he causes me every time we see"

She dismissed his concerns, saying, \"You just need to step up your game.\" He felt frustrated, thinking that if he worked harder, things wouldn't have gone so badly. Why did she make such harsh decisions? He realized that even though she was his boss, she seemed to be treating him poorly, and he wondered if there was something wrong with her attitude. When his wife asked how his day was, he said, \"It was terrible, you won't believe what happened,\" expecting sympathy. But instead, she replied, \"Well, maybe you shouldn't be working so much anyway. Maybe you should prioritize family more.\" He felt like she was judging him, but he knew she was just trying to help.

We were both working long hours for weeks afterward, so we didn't get much time together outside of the hospital. But every time I saw him, I felt like I was comparing my own life to his. Even though I knew he was struggling, I couldn't help but feel like I wasn't doing enough just by being there for him. It made me anxious, especially since he seemed to handle everything so well. I'd see him walking down the hallway, his head held high despite everything, and it would make me feel like I was lagging behind. When he finally did take a break, I'd try to join him, but I'd end up feeling guilty for taking time off while he was still grieving. He wouldn't say anything, but his body language spoke volumes - his shoulders were slumped, and his eyes looked tired. I could tell he was holding himself together, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I wasn’t doing enough.

It makes me shudder just thinking about it. Every time I see something like that, I start having flashbacks of when I was younger and used to get these kinds of roaches all the time. Just remembering that makes me want to cry. It's all so unfair. Why does this have to happen to me? What did I ever do to deserve this? My mind is racing with thoughts of what could've been if I hadn't gotten into that car accident last year. I'm constantly replaying the scene over and over in my head, wondering if it was really my fault and if I'll ever find closure.
