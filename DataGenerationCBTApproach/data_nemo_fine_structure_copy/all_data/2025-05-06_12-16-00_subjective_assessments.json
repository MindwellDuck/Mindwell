Every moment we spent together seemed tainted by this revelation, every conversation laced with the weight of his discovery. But why did he keep it from me? Why did he let me think for so long that everything was normal? Wasn’t he scared to confront me because he didn’t want our relationship to crumble? Or was he just indifferent, too caught up in himself to care? I can’t stop thinking about what could have been. What if he hadn’t found the painting? Would things still be okay between us? Did he really not care about how I felt, or was he just waiting for the perfect moment to tell me? Every time I see him now, I feel like I’m looking at a stranger, someone who knows more than he’s letting on. Every interaction is a reminder that nothing is ever as it seems, that even those closest to us might be hiding secrets that could destroy everything.
