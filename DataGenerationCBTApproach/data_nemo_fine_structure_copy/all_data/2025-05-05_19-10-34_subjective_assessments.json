There's no middle ground, and this all-or-nothing thinking is making me more anxious than necessary. It's as if my mind is forcing me to choose one extreme side of the spectrum, leaving me feeling trapped between two opposing emotions. In reality, maybe it's just a minor technical issue, but *this thought makes me think it could be anything from a simple power outage to some kind of attack*. I know intellectually that it's probably neither, but somehow, my brain refuses to accept that ambiguity. The fear of the unknown has me torn between two extremes: either I'll find out it's nothing, or it'll be much worse than I imagine. Either way, I'll end up feeling helpless. This all-or-nothing thinking is making things seem more intense than they actually are, and I'm not sure how to break free from it."

In fact, she often struggled with stress, especially during those late-night moments. When I look back, I can see that she was actually pretty frazzled a lot of the time. Like remember that time she spent hours working on a story, trying to meet a tight deadline? Or how about when she got so stressed out over getting everything done that she ended up staying late, sometimes even into the night? It makes me wonder if maybe she felt overwhelmed by the pressure to perform. Maybe she didn't feel as put together as she thought she did. It's funny how our minds can distort things like that. Sometimes we focus too much on the negative, making it seem like things were way worse than they actually were. Anyway, I guess I've learned a little bit more about my mom lately, and I appreciate seeing things from a different perspective."

When they asked about my current projects, I realized that they hadn't considered the possibility that I might still be involved in research despite not being actively employed. I can't help but feel a bit frustrated that people often seem to believe that I'm no longer interested in academic pursuits. Perhaps I could have made more time for them if I weren't so focused on finding new ways to contribute to the field.
