I've always been told I was a great leader, but it doesn't matter now - everyone thinks I'm a dumbass and a joke. What have I done wrong? This is all because of my lack of confidence. If only I'd had more faith in myself, things would be different. But no, instead, I let my fear take over, and now look what happens. Now I'll never be able to show my face around here again. And those bastards are going to think I'm a coward for not defending myself. I could have handled it if I hadn't been so weak. Now it's all over, and I'll spend the rest of my life being ridiculed for being unable to stand up for myself. This isn't fair; I know I deserve respect. They're all just jealous, but deep down, I know they're not. Still, it hurts so much. I hate this. I hate everything about this situation. I feel like shit, and I'm so tired of it.

I'm tired of being stuck in this rut, feeling like I can't catch a break. Every moment is filled with worry and stress. I have to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet, and still there's always something else to worry about. Whether it's bills piling up, debts accumulating, or health issues nagging me, my mind is constantly racing with problems. I barely get any sleep, and when I do, I wake up exhausted. I've tried everything to improve things—getting a second job, taking on more hours at my main gig, cutting back on expenses—but nothing seems to help. It's like every solution leads to another problem, and I'm left feeling defeated. Even small pleasures like enjoying music or reading are ruined by the constant stress, making them feel hollow and unfulfilling. It's not just money or work-related issues. There’s this one guy at my workplace, always smiling and laughing with everyone. He makes light conversations and has friends coming over for gatherings, which makes me feel like I’m missing out. Meanwhile, I struggle to find the energy to even say hello, let alone join in on conversations."

My eyes began to water as I thought about the moment when I had last felt this way - years ago, during my first year of college. Back then, I had been struggling to keep up with the coursework, and I would often find myself in tears, overwhelmed by the pressure to perform. But now, here I was, facing a similar situation, yet feeling nothing but anger. Why did this happen to me again? I tried to push aside these thoughts and focus on the task at hand. However, they lingered, refusing to be silenced. It wasn't until I saw a post from an old friend on social media that things finally snapped. She had posted a picture of herself with a new partner, laughing and smiling. I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy, and suddenly, everything seemed to make sense. This wasn't just about the project; it was about the fact that I was still alone, while everyone around me seemed to have found happiness. In that moment, I realized that I wasn't just frustrated; I was hurt. But instead of confronting those feelings, I let them boil over into anger.

Maybe he was trying to get rid of the past, but going about it like this is really harsh. I feel bad for her; she might be feeling pretty lost right now. I can understand why she'd want to cry about it, considering everything she's lost.
