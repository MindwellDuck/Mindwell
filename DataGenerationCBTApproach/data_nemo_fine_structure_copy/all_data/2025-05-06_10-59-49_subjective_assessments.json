What kind of man doesn't even appreciate what he has? And now, he's gone and left me here alone again, with nothing but this stupid fridge making noise. It's like he thinks I enjoy waiting around for him to come home. I swear, every time I tell him something, he just rolls his eyes and says, \"Oh, so you think you're special?\" Like I'm not already exhausted enough. Of course, I want to be taken seriously when I say things like, \"Hey, can we talk about our future plans?\" Or, \"Can you please help with the bills this month?\" Does he really need to treat me like an idiot? And don't even get me started on the state of our relationship. We've been married for five years, and it feels like he's made up his mind to ignore everything I say. Every time I try to bring up important topics, he just changes the subject or tells me to stop being dramatic. I feel like I'm losing myself in this marriage.

Every step she took felt heavy, weighed down by the crushing weight of worry. She felt trapped, stuck in this endless loop of fear, unable to move forward until the uncertainty was resolved. Each passing moment seemed to drag on, leaving her feeling more and more isolated, as if she was drowning in an ocean of doubt. It wasn’t just the missing pills; it was everything else too—the lack of communication, the eerie quietness of the apartment, the sense of emptiness that lingered like a shadow over everything. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong, even though she knew intellectually that it probably wasn’t. As she waited, her thoughts grew darker, spiraling into a maze of worst-case scenarios. She imagined him being hit by a car, or falling from a great height, or worse—dying suddenly without warning.

The thought of her having moved away, possibly even started a new family somewhere else, fueled his feelings of inadequacy.

He pictured himself struggling to make connections, feeling left out, and wondering if he'd ever find someone who understood him like she did. This wasn't the first time he'd caught herself talking about her past adventures, but it still stung. She seemed so content, so carefree, while he felt stuck, weighed down by responsibilities and regrets. He often found himself lost in these thoughts, replaying moments from the past, imagining alternative paths they could've taken, and how they might have turned out differently. It was as if he was trying to relive them, to understand why he couldn't seem to catch up, why life had passed him by.
