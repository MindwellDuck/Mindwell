Even the simplest things became overwhelming—like sorting through the unsold items, where even something as trivial as a single, wilted bouquet could bring back such intense feelings.

The memory of his father, who had never wanted kids anyway, made him feel even worse. He told himself that she shouldn't expect anything from him, especially since he hadn't been there for her during her pregnancy.
