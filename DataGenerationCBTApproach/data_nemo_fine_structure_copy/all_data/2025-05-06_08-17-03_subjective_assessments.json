She deserved better than to die in a crash caused by my mistake. Every time I thought of her, I wanted to scream, but no one would hear me. It wasn’t fair. They never understood how much I loved her, how much I blamed myself. I kept telling myself that it was an accident, that she wouldn’t want me to cry. But I cried anyway, every day since she died. My mom said she knew I’d feel guilty, but I couldn’t help it. We all did. Even now, when I look at Sarah’s picture, I feel like I’m failing her again. I can’t stop thinking about what could’ve been if I had just...if I hadn’t...I keep replaying the moment, wondering why I didn’t see them sooner, why I didn’t pull over. I know I shouldn’t let guilt consume me, but it does. And tonight, driving home from work, I felt so alone, so lost. I started dialing her number, hoping she’d answer, but then I remembered what my wife said: “You’re not responsible.” But in that moment, it felt like I was. I wish I"

Like, one time he said something about how our entire family was cursed because we had a lot of siblings. He claimed it was because each of us was born during different astrological signs that clashed, making us all destined for bad luck. My mom tried to calm him down, but he kept going, saying it was a family curse passed down through generations. I don’t know why, but every time my dad did something like that, it seemed like he was trying to convince me of something by repeating the same thing over and over. Sometimes he wouldn’t stop until he’d gotten to the end of the sentence, even though it didn’t make any sense. And then he’d look right at me, almost like he expected me to agree or understand what he was saying. But the truth is, I never understood anything he said. Even now, thinking back, it seems like he was just trying to get attention by saying strange stuff. Maybe he thought he could control people’s minds with that kind of nonsense, but it only made me feel weird whenever he spoke like that.
