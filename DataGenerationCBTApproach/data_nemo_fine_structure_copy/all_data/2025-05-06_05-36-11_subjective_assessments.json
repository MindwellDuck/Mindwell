We're all just pawns in this cruel game, and I'm sick of being reminded of what could have been. I've tried to focus on the present, but every time I open that obituary folder, I feel like I'm drowning in grief again. It's not fair; I still have so much work to do here. But no matter how hard I try to push through, my heart keeps pulling me back to those happy moments. Why can't I just move on? Life is full of pain, and I hate feeling stuck in this cycle of sadness. Every day feels like a burden, like I'm just going through motions. I force myself to keep working, but inside, I wish I could turn back time. If only we could relive our memories, if only we could see the future unfold differently. My thoughts are tangled in regret, and I don't know how to untangle them. I just want peace, but it eludes me wherever I look. We’re never going to be able to fully escape the past. Every moment holds some memory, some reminder of what’s lost. I’m trapped in"

It was just another one of those \"Happy Birthday\" things, but this time it was different because he included a photo of himself with his wife who is now dead. I felt bad for him, so I sent him money. But then I realized he used the money to pay off some debts for his business partner. That same partner was involved in some shady stuff, and they've been accused of tax evasion. My dad has denied all allegations, but I still feel guilty for sending him money. He's either a good man who made mistakes or a complete asshole who stole money from others. I don't think he deserves forgiveness, especially since he lied about everything when I confronted him about it. His whole life has been one big lie. If he wants to keep pretending to be something he's not, then that's his problem. I'm done feeling sorry for him. Either way, he'll never change. He needs to stop lying and accept responsibility for his actions. But if he does, then he'll lose everything he has worked for. This is why I avoid talking to him. He'll never admit anything or make amends. He's either completely innocent or a dirty bastard, no middle ground for me. And honestly, I don't want to hear his excuses anymore."

She lay motionless, her small body limp as a rag doll. My heart sank when I saw the look on his face - a mix of fear and determination. We had talked about it before, how we would handle such situations, but nothing could have prepared me for the reality of it all. As he sat there, fighting to hold back tears, I felt like an outsider. What if he wasn't strong enough? What if he couldn't save her? My mind began racing, jumping between worst-case scenarios and desperate prayers. I knew he needed help, but I didn't want to push him into something he might regret. I wanted to be there for him, but the weight of responsibility felt crushing. I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was letting him down, that I wasn't doing enough.

It got me thinking – I mean, what if something like that actually did happen? What if...we were really close back then, and somehow, we didn’t realize it until it was too late?

I don’t have superhuman strength or endurance; I can barely keep up with what they bring into the ER. This isn’t going to end well. I’ll probably lose control and make things worse.
