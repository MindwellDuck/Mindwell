Ugh, I hate how he tries to manipulate me by doing these things. That's not love; that's control. And don't even get me started on the car itself – it looks like something from a bad movie.

He hadn't even known he lost his badge until now, which made things worse. It seemed ridiculous to think that he could actually forget something so important, but why would he? After all, he’d forgotten his keys once before, and that didn’t happen overnight either. What if I’m losing my mind? No, no, no… That’s crazy. Of course, you’re not going mad. You just need to relax, take a deep breath, and remember how many times you’ve done this before. Yeah, right. Like that ever worked. Why did it always come back to this? He sighed, trying to shake off the feeling of impending doom. Maybe he just needed to put some pressure on those stubborn shoulders of his. A few sharp tugs, maybe some stretching exercises. Come on, it'll help. Just try to feel better. Ugh, damn it! Why does this keep happening?! And what's with these stupid thoughts? Can't I just enjoy my retirement?! But he knew he wasn't supposed to be enjoying anything right now. Not after everything that had happened. So, instead of letting his frustration get the best of him, he took another"

It’s hard to believe it’s just a picture, because it feels like she’s right there with us, laughing at something we can’t quite remember. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck in a dream, reliving moments that were meant to be cherished but are now tainted by the reality of losing her. Even though it’s been years, the ache remains, a reminder of how much she meant to me. I keep thinking about what could have been if life had taken a different turn. We had plans, dreams for our future together—things that now seem impossible. Life doesn’t stop for anyone, and I’m left to pick up the pieces, trying to move forward despite the weight of those memories. I don’t know if I’ll ever fully heal from this loss, but I hold onto the hope that someday the pain will become less overwhelming, like the sun breaking through clouds on a rainy day. Until then, I’m left to carry the burden of remembering her smile, her laughter, and the love we shared. It’s all I have left now—the memories of a life cut short, a life that could’ve been full"

As he sat there, trying to maintain his composure, the room around him began to feel stifling. It was as if every eye in the room was boring into his skin, making him feel trapped. Even the air seemed heavy, weighing down on him like an invisible weight. His mind raced with thoughts of why she would say such things, especially since he knew they were just trying to provoke a reaction from him. She was trying to get under his skin, but instead, it was making him more defensive than ever. He glanced around the room, noticing how everyone else seemed calm, even amused by the exchange. They didn't seem to be taking her jab personally, unlike him. He felt like he was the only one who saw through her attempt to provoke him, yet it still hit him hard. As he tried to focus on the conversation again, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was missing something important.
