I'm a doctor! I would never... Never! I swear. But then again, maybe I'm just mad at myself for not noticing something sooner. Maybe I should've checked more often. Could I've done better? What if I had called an ambulance sooner? Would that have changed things? Or is it just my imagination playing tricks on me? They weren't sick. They just died. And I missed them. I didn’t even know they were there. They didn’t say anything before they went to sleep. They didn’t want to worry me. I can’t imagine how scared they must’ve been, alone and helpless, with no one by their side, unable to move, unable to breathe. They were so strong; they fought cancer for years.

Let's focus on what we can control, like getting back to work on our story.\" This response is an attempt at illustrating how someone might downplay a situation where they’ve discovered evidence of misconduct by those around them, perhaps even close friends or family members. By using phrases like “it was just a mistake,” “who hasn’t messed up like that,” and “we can all make mistakes,” this individual appears to be dismissing the severity of the incident while maintaining a level of denial. The language suggests they are focusing on the possibility of redemption rather than taking responsibility for the actions that have transpired. By using a casual, almost nonchalant tone and emphasizing that everyone makes mistakes, the person seems to be pushing away the idea that the situation could potentially lead to serious consequences. They seem to be more interested in moving forward with their life and work than in confronting the issue head-on. This subtle approach to dealing with the problem may be seen as a way of avoiding feelings of guilt or shame associated with being aware of wrongdoing"

He's one of those people who thinks he can treat others however he wants and get away with it because no one will ever call him out. I've seen other employees try talking to him about it, but nothing changes. He's still acting the same way, treating everyone like dirt. It really sucks because I love working there and want to help people, but I feel like he's making it impossible for me to do that. It's also weird how he always starts complaining about how long lines are getting longer, which is ridiculous. I mean, come on! He knows he's causing problems. He always says things like, \"This place needs to change,\" but then goes ahead and acts like an asshole himself. It's like he doesn't even care about what he does anymore. He's probably going to say something like that again today, isn't he? I bet he'll snap at another customer soon. I hope I never have to deal with that again. His behavior is just so annoying"
