Yet, looking at it now, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time. Maybe he wasn’t just some distant memory, but a part of me that still lingered. My heart skipped a beat as I imagined what he might be thinking right now. Was he happy for me? Did he ever think about me? It all came flooding back: our first days together, working side by side, sharing stories. He'd always been such a supportive partner, encouraging me through the tough times. I remembered how proud he was of me when I got promoted. But had he ever thought about me? Did he wonder what happened to me? Maybe he didn't even remember me. Or maybe he did, but he chose not to. That nagging voice in my head whispered that I’d never heard from him since leaving the station. Could it be that he’s gone? That he never looked back? If only I knew how he really felt. If only I could tell him how much his support meant. We were more than just coworkers; we were friends, confidants, and partners in every way. Why"

As he reached for one, a cold gust blew through the open window, rustling the papers and chilling his bones.

He thought about all the times he'd felt lonely, wondering what could have been if he'd just been more confident, if he'd taken more risks, if he'd made different choices. Now, as he read through the letters, he felt like he was staring into the abyss, the words blurring together as tears began to fall.

I keep thinking, \"If you're such a good man, why aren't you making an effort to stay friends?\" But then I realize, \"Well, if you were a real friend, you'd have made more of an effort when you left.\" So, yeah, I guess I should've done that. Maybe I could've stopped him from leaving if I had tried harder. Now look where it got me: stuck in this fucking nursing home, feeling like crap, and wondering why life isn't going as planned.

The memory of him stood tall, looking up at him with those big brown eyes, the way she'd curl her hair into pigtails and run around in circles, laughing until her belly hurt. He remembered the girl he'd met by chance, the shy one who'd blossomed under his care. She'd grown up to be a nurse, visiting patients he'd known for years, smiling warmly whenever he saw her.
