The lab was quiet this time of day, most of her colleagues already tucked into their families for dinner. She looked up at the clock, the hands ticking steadily towards 7 PM. He should have been here by now.\n\nHer phone remained silent, no buzz or vibration to announce his arrival. She'd left him a voicemail earlier, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked him to pick up some milk on his way home. It was their staple for breakfast, but it was running low, just like their conversations had been these past few weeks.\n\nShe felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach as she considered the possibilities. Maybe he'd lost track of time, buried deep in his own work. Or maybe... She pushed that thought away, focusing instead on the rhythmic ticking of the clock. But each tick echoed louder than the last, amplifying her worry.\n\nJust then, the door creaked open. She looked up, hope flickering in her eyes, only to be met with the janitor's apologetic smile. \"Sorry, ma'am,\" he said softly, \"I didn't mean to disturb you.\" As the door clicked shut behind him, she felt the hope fade away, replaced by a familiar, gnawing emptiness.\n\nShe returned to her coffee, now cold and unappealing. The lab felt colder too, the hum of machinery no longer comforting but isolating. She sighed, pushing back from her desk, the wheels of her chair squeaking softly in protest. Another late night awaited, another silent dinner for one.",

The fact that she'd been waiting for him all evening seemed to pale in comparison to the reality of his absence. It must have been an oversight, a mistake in timing rather than anything more serious. Yet, she found herself dwelling on the possibility that he might be avoiding her, that there could be something deeper going on beneath the surface. The thought sent a wave of frustration through her, her mind racing with the what-ifs. At first glance, everything seemed to suggest that nothing was amiss. They’d discussed plans over lunch, and she’d even gone so far as to leave notes on his desk, just in case. But those small gestures, once so full of meaning, now felt hollow and inconsequential. As the hours ticked by, the silence grew thicker, until it felt almost palpable. She tried to push aside her worries, focusing instead on her work. But the sense of isolation lingered, a constant reminder that she was alone. Even the usually reliable routine of her daily commute felt off, the usual rhythm disrupted by the uncertainty hanging over her. It was as if she were walking through a fog, unable to shake the feeling that every step took her further away from him. In the end, she resigned herself to spending another lonely night at home, the silence closing in around her like a shroud. The realization stung, leaving her wondering whether she"

You need to stop worrying so much and just accept that some things are beyond your control. You can't make everything perfect, especially when it comes to cooking. If you start judging every little thing, you'll end up feeling stressed out all the time. You know why this is happening? Because you've been too careful lately. You're always checking for germs and making sure everything is just right. But sometimes you just have to let go and enjoy the moment. Life isn't all about perfection; it's about living and enjoying the ride. So, instead of stressing over these small things, try to relax and embrace whatever happens. Maybe things won't turn out as planned, but that's okay. Sometimes unexpected surprises can lead to great adventures. Just remember, it's not worth getting upset over something as trivial as leftovers. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying you should ignore cleanliness. But sometimes you have to prioritize more important things than being meticulous with your environment. Take a deep breath, and focus on the bigger picture. Life is full of ups and downs, and we can’t control everything. Try to see the positive side"
