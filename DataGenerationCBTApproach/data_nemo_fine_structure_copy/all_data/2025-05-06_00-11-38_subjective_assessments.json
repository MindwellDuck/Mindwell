It's like she has no idea what went down between us. He was being an asshole, I told him multiple times I wanted to end it. Then he gets drunk and decides to go back to his ex-girlfriend. No fucking wonder she still wants him back. They are perfect for each other because they both have a history of cheating. She knows everything that happened between us, but she chooses to ignore all of it. She thinks she can just drive by and see him and be fine? Like, fuck that. I don't want to talk to her anymore. She doesn't deserve me. The fact that she just assumes he is talking to someone else is infuriating. Does she think I'm going to just sit here and wait around for him to come home? Does she think I'm just going to pick up where we left off like nothing happened? What is wrong with her? This is insane. If I were in her shoes, I would know exactly what happened between us.

Anyway, as we're walking around, I notice how many people are there who actually know the curator - like, serious collectors who have been friends for decades. It's kind of annoying, you know? Like, why do they get to hang out here when we can't? But then, when we decide to leave, the owner comes over and says something weirdly condescending. She basically told us that if we wanted to see more pieces, we'd need to come back next month... alone. Can you believe that shit?! We were just casually strolling around, and she goes from zero to creepy in seconds. And now we're stuck waiting until next month just because they don't want to share their stuff right now?! And don't even get me started on the vibe. The whole space feels off, like it's trying to trap you in some sort of twisted game. The walls are all dark and moody, which might look cool at first, but it makes you feel uneasy. Plus, the lighting is super dim, making it impossible to take decent photos.

I've been patient all these years; surely he can find a way to show up tonight. Yet, here we are, again, with nothing but silence and a growing sense of betrayal. This isn't the first time he's stood me up, and it won't be the last. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of never-ending loop, constantly waiting for him to show up, yet he keeps disappearing into thin air. Can't he see how much I need him? Don't I deserve better than this? It feels like my whole world is crumbling around me, and no one understands what I'm going through. Every day feels like a countdown, every hour ticking by like an eternity. I'm exhausted, frustrated, and hurt. How can someone so important to my life keep ignoring me like this?

So how could this be?** I think back to all the times we spent together as kids. We'd play video games until 3 AM, go to the park, or just hang out in our backyard. I remember him being really upset after the crash, but it never seemed like a big deal. He said he'd gotten distracted while driving home from work and forgot to check his mirrors, but it must have been someone else who hit us. I'm convinced of it now. This couldn't possibly be happening. I try to recall every instance where my brother got in trouble with the law, but none of them seem significant enough to explain this. Maybe it was that time he sped through school zones, or maybe that other incident when he ran a red light. But those things happened years ago, and he's never had any serious problems with the police. He's always been very responsible. I know he’s still working on getting his license, but he’s doing great. He's learning fast and doesn’t make mistakes like people say he does. I start thinking about all"

Can't they just let me get through this without adding stress? Maybe if they didn’t play that song, I wouldn’t be feeling so overwhelmed right now.
