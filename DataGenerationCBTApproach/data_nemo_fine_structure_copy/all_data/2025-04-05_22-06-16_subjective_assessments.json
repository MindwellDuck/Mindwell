Her heart pounded in her chest as she slowly turned off her desk lamp, plunging herself into darkness save for the faint glow of her laptop screen. She had been working late, engrossed in her research on climate change patterns, when the strange noises began. She knew her partner was fast asleep upstairs; she hadn't wanted to disturb him with her fears. Now, alone in the quiet house, she felt a creeping unease. The scratching came again, louder this time, as if whatever was out there could sense her fear and was growing bolder. She reached for her phone, hands trembling, ready to dial his number, but hesitated. What if it was just the old cat, sneaking in through the pet flap? Or worse, what if it wasn't? She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the fear that threatened to overwhelm her. She had faced uncertainty in her scientific career many times before, but this felt different, more primal. The scratching came again, and she knew she couldn't ignore it any longer.",

You can't even make yourself a cup of tea without freaking out about some noise, let's be real, it's probably just the cat or something. You've always been super sensitive, you know that? Always jumping at the slightest sound. Remember how you freaked out because someone was walking by outside and thought it was a serial killer? I mean come on, stop making such a big deal over everything. It's just a noise, don't overthink it. But no, instead of letting go of the anxiety, you get all worked up about every little thing. And now you're freaking out over some scratching at the door? That's just ridiculous. You need to chill out and stop being so paranoid. You're doing yourself a disservice. Stop labeling yourself as anxious, it's not helping. You're not a nervous wreck, okay? Just calm down and move on. There's no reason to panic over one tiny noise. Your brain is just messing with you, you have to learn to control it. But honestly, you're never going to be able to fully shake off your neuroses, are you? You really are one of those hypochondriacs who can turn anything into an anxiety attack. So yeah, don't worry about the noise, it's probably just the cat, let it go.

This kind of behavior isn't acceptable in our industry, especially when you're working with someone half your age. I can see how this would affect morale and create tension among the staff.

She probably thinks she's above all this modern nonsense and is still stuck in the dark ages. The fact that she didn't even acknowledge my years of experience is just another slap in the face. This situation makes me realize how much I've been holding back lately. Maybe I should be more assertive, but I don't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing she's getting under my skin. Still, I feel like I need to stand up for myself here. I mean, what other way can I show her that her actions aren't going unnoticed? Maybe I'll try to make a point during service"
