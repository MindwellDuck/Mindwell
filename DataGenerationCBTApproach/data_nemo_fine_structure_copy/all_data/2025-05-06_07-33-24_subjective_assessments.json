She hadn't seen it since they'd parted ways six months ago. A lump formed in her throat as she traced his face with her fingertip. The bell above the store's entrance chimed, startling her back to reality.

They had parted ways abruptly, leaving her heart shattered into a million pieces. Her eyes welled up with tears again as she thought about how he seemed to have moved on. He posted pictures of himself with new friends on social media, laughing and smiling in places he used to take her. Every time she scrolled through those feeds, she felt like she was drowning in a sea of pain. He didn’t seem to miss her; he didn’t even bother to reach out after they broke up. She stopped in front of a small café, the same one where she and her ex would meet for coffee. He would always sit across from her, his hand resting lightly on her arm as they talked about our dreams and plans for the future. Now, as she stood there, the warm sun beating down on her, she felt lost. Why did everything have to fall apart? Why did he have to move on? And why did she still hold on to the hope that things could go back to normal? She took a deep breath and pushed open the door, stepping inside just as another"

They don't know about the struggles you faced, the sacrifices you made—how could they possibly understand? They'll be embarrassed to call you their dad, ashamed of the man you became.

Or think about this: you work hard, but when you finally retire, you realize nobody cares about your accomplishments. Nobody wants to listen to your stories about the past, and everyone thinks you’re just a bitter old man. What if you die tomorrow? Will anyone even notice? Will people remember you at all?

He couldn't help but think that every line, every word, told a story of a life lived fully, of dreams chased and hopes held high. He remembered how she would tell him about her passion projects, about the things that made her happy when no one else could understand her. She had always been the one who saw beauty in everything—sunsets, rainbows, even in the darkest corners of the city. Her optimism was contagious, spreading joy wherever she went. But now, all those stories seemed like lies. The more he read, the more he felt like he was drowning in a sea of broken promises. The words themselves became a reminder of what he had lost—the chance at something real, something worth fighting for. Every time he thought back to their conversations, he was met with the cold reality of failure. She had never meant to hurt him, but she had hurt him anyway, leaving him to pick up the pieces of a shattered dream. It was then that he realized he couldn’t go on. The pain was too much, the memories too painful. He wondered how someone so full of life could end it all, how someone who had once brought light into his world could leave him"

He's always been someone who prefers to stay indoors, especially during holidays. It's weird seeing him out there, alone in the dark. But then again, maybe he just needed some fresh air? This is probably the first time he's walked through the park alone. I can imagine how quiet it must feel after all those families had their picnics here. Maybe he felt nostalgic for those days, or perhaps he was just trying to get away from everything for a bit. Either way, it looks pretty peaceful right now. The stars are shining brightly, and the snowflakes are gently falling around him. Even though he looks lost, there's something serene about the whole scene. As if the world has slowed down, giving him a moment of silence to himself. He's never been one for big gatherings or parties.
