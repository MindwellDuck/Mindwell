This fucking woman was flipping through an old magazine with her dirty hands, completely disregarding basic hygiene! I can’t believe it took me so long to notice because she’s always doing shit like that! You know how hard it is to get out of bed when you’re sick? Or how exhausting it can be to deal with someone else’s shit all day? Well, imagine being a nurse who has to clean up after patients ALL DAY! It takes time and effort just to keep everything clean and organized, especially during outbreaks. This isn’t about you; it’s about how we work together to protect everyone. If you think it’s easy to spot something like this, then maybe you haven’t really seen the mess we face every day. People don’t realize how much we have to manage at once—how many patients we see, how many tasks we need to complete, and how much stress we endure. And if one small thing like this slips through our attention, it can cause problems. If you want to make things easier for us, please help spread awareness. It’s not just about “personal responsibility.” We have limited resources, and your support means more than you think. So yeah, let’s take a deep breath and try to understand what it’s like to work under pressure like this. But don’t pretend like it’s your problem. It’s mine, and my colleagues’. Let’s work"

Just an empty chair across from hers, where he used to sit and talk about life. Her mind keeps jumping between remembering how much fun they had together and worrying that he'll never come back. It feels like a cruel joke—she remembers the laughter, but now all she gets are tears. And it's so hard to stop thinking about all those things that could have been. What if they were meant to be together forever? Or worse, what if I'm just too late? What if we've already missed our chance? It's ridiculous to think this way, but she can't shake off these thoughts. Every night, she sits at that table, wondering when he’ll walk through the door again. It’s like she’s trapped in a loop of what-ifs, each moment building up into another question. What if he shows up tomorrow? What if I’m waiting for someone who doesn’t exist anymore? She tries to distract herself by cleaning, but her mind keeps going back to the same thing: what if. What if he came back today? What if I’ve wasted too much time? What if I miss my chance"

All these years I've been thinking he was cheating on me, and now you come along and tell me it was just a stupid ring. I'm so fucking tired of being wrong. You think you can just waltz in here and make me believe everything changed? Please. I don't even want to hear your side of the story. You know what really pisses me off? The fact that you get to be honest with everyone else but me.

I know he would want me to celebrate his life, but honestly, every time I think about it, I feel like I'm betraying him. He didn't deserve this. And now, I'm dealing with the aftermath, trying to keep everything together while drowning in grief. I can barely function some days, and yet, I’m expected to put on a brave face for everyone else. It’s exhausting. Why can't anyone understand? I don’t need reminders of what I’ve lost. Can't we just leave me alone? Is this really what I signed up for? All those years, I thought we were building something special, something meaningful. But now, it's just a hollow reminder of what could have been. And another thing, why do people always focus on the positive side? Like, yeah, he was great at what he did, but who cares? What about all the pain he caused? He wasn’t perfect.

How can one person be so careless? This entire thing is all his fault, and it's infuriating. I'm fed up with having to deal with him. Every mistake he makes causes problems for everyone else. He's completely incapable of doing anything right, which means everything he does is wrong. It's unbelievable how much trouble he causes whenever he's involved.
