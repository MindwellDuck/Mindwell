My mom didn't deserve all those years of sadness because of one stupid fight over a stupid dress. And now I'm stuck with this stupid perfume! If I had gotten this earlier, maybe things wouldn't be like this. Maybe if I had been more understanding back then, none of this would happen. But no, I had to go and ruin everything by being selfish. My mom was right; she always said people like me are too self-centered. If only I had listened to her sooner... Now look where I am—alone, crying, and holding onto something that will never bring me peace. It's ridiculous to think I'll ever find happiness again. I should've just let her die alone. At least then I wouldn't have to live with these painful memories every day. But no, I had to go and keep going, making myself suffer. What's wrong with me?
