It wasn't long before he realized what it meant - they were touching hands, their eyes locked in conversation, and they laughed together as if they shared some secret joke. His mind began to race with thoughts of other men who might have shared moments like this with her. It was as if the world around him had narrowed to just those two people, their proximity and connection making everything else seem distant and irrelevant. He couldn't shake the feeling that time stood still, and nothing else mattered except the silent understanding between them."

And it hurts to think about how many times I had to fight for my place among them. But no one ever gives me credit for that. They just keep going on with their shiny new projects, while I'm left feeling forgotten. It makes me angry, but deep down, I know it's not fair. Yet, every time I try to bring up the past, they dismiss everything I did, saying it doesn't matter anymore. Like, hello, don't you remember anything from last week? Or was that just another memory I shouldn't bother bringing up? Anyway, I still feel like they owe me an apology, but who cares now? Maybe I'll just forget about it... after all, isn't that what they want? To move on? Still, I wish someone would listen and understand how hard it was working there.

Her mind is racing with questions: What could have triggered such a sudden surge? Is there something specific she needs to know about her situation? And how does this relate to her current project? As she delves deeper, she starts to notice other coincidences. A few days ago, she received a mysterious package containing a small notebook with a handwritten note inside: \"Remember what you've forgotten.\" The timing couldn't be more peculiar, given her focus on uncovering hidden truths. But what does this message really mean? Is it a warning, a clue, or simply a strange anomaly? Her curiosity is piqued, yet a part of her remains cautious. Perhaps this is exactly what she needed—to be reminded that some things are better left unexplored.

I remember how much effort he put into planning our date nights, how he went out of his way to surprise me. But now, he barely makes an effort anymore.
