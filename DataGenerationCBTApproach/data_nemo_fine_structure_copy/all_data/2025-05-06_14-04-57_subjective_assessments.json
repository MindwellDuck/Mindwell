If she wanted me to find out, she'd have told me personally, not left a bunch of weird letters around. It's all part of her plan to make my life miserable after she's gone. She thinks she can just drop dead and then expect me to deal with everything by myself? Fuck that. I don't need that kind of stress in my life right now. Her death isn't helping anything either.

Now, every time he saw something from their past, he felt like he was drowning in memories. They were all tainted now - the good times as well as the bad. This necklace was probably just one of many things she’d forgotten about. Maybe there were other things too, some hidden deep within their apartment. He knew it was pointless to keep looking for more, but he still wanted to make sure nothing else came back to haunt him. If he could get rid of these reminders, maybe he could finally move on. But why bother? Everything would just lead to more pain. He already knew that. He wasn’t going to waste his time searching for anything else, no matter how much he hoped to find peace. He needed to focus on himself now, not on what had happened before. So, yeah, it was probably better if they never got married in the first place. At least then none of this would have happened.
