It wasn't even signed; just scribbled between two lines of \"Dear,\" as if afterthoughts were all that mattered. He said he never kept anything like that, but now she couldn't be so sure. All those times he'd been distant, all the times she'd caught glimpses of sadness in his eyes, they could've been more than just symptoms of loneliness. Maybe he really did miss another woman. And maybe he would again. Or maybe he still does. It doesn't matter what happened then. What matters is that she feels betrayed now. She can't shake the feeling that every smile, every laugh, has been a lie. Every time he hugged her, every kiss, every moment of comfort, he must have been thinking of her instead. How else could it be? The thought makes her stomach churn with anger and hurt. She wonders if she'll ever be able to trust him again. If she'll ever be able to let go of the pain. All these years, she thought they shared something special, but now it seems nothing but a facade. Is this really all there is to life? To be constantly searching for truth, to"

It means she wasn't mad at me after all. She probably forgot about it herself. So, why not leave it be? I can't really blame her for leaving it behind. She had more important things to think about than cleaning up after us. Still, I wonder what she would've said if she found out. Would she have gotten angry? Or maybe she wouldn't have noticed at all? Either way, I don't want to think about it anymore. This spatula has been through enough; it deserves some peace. Besides, I have better things to do than dwell on the past. Oh well. I'll just enjoy the memory of her making that cake, and let go of this spatula once and for all. Who knows?
