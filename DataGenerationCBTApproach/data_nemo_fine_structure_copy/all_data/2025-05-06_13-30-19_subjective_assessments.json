But what really got under her skin was seeing Emma's face alongside the award photo. They had worked together once, and he had... well, let's just say he didn't exactly leave a good impression. He had been charming, but also reckless, and his actions had left her feeling used and hurt. \"Emma Taylor, huh?\" she muttered to herself, her eyes narrowing. It seemed like everyone else was getting ahead, while she was stuck in the same rut. Even the awards themselves felt unfair - what about all the other writers who worked tirelessly, pouring their hearts into their stories? Why did they never get recognized? Her mind began to spiral, comparing her work to Emma's. While Emma's pieces were bold and provocative, hers were more nuanced and thoughtful. But did that mean she was inferior? Was she just settling for mediocrity because she lacked the spark that Emma possessed? As she read through the list again, she couldn't help but feel a growing sense of resentment. Every time she saw someone else's success, it reminded her of what she lacked. And when she looked at her own writing, she couldn't"

This whole thing is a joke, right? That's all it is. A stupid joke. Why would I ever think otherwise? I mean, why did she leave it here? Is it because she wants to see how much I care? How much I'm willing to go out of my way to remember her special day? Or maybe it's because she thinks I've forgotten something as important as her birthday already. Maybe it's because she's tired of me constantly being too busy to notice these things, but somehow still managing to make her feel loved. But no, none of that makes sense. There has to be another reason, one that doesn't involve me being such a terrible father. So I guess it must be because... she's actually mad at me. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. That's why she left the card here. To remind me of my failures and disappointment as a parent. This whole thing is ridiculous. I shouldn't even be thinking about it. But I am.
