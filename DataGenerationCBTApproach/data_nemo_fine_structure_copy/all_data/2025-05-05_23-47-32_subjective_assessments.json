Every paper rejected, every presentation bombed, every idea dismissed felt like another notch in the belt of failure. The more he delved into the world of academia, the more he realized that he was, indeed, an outsider—a perpetual outsider.* *His colleagues seemed to effortlessly glide through life, their accomplishments a testament to their natural aptitude.

It was as if they were born to excel in this field, while he struggled to keep up, no matter how hard he tried.* *Even his own work seemed to pale in comparison, a constant reminder of his inadequacy. He could never seem to match the level of sophistication displayed by those around him. His mind felt dull, his ideas uninspired, and his thoughts muddled—always lagging behind the curve.* *A part of him wondered if he’d made a mistake by pursuing academia altogether.

I'm sick of hearing her talk about her \"work\" and \"passion\" while she does nothing. She probably thinks she's above everyone else just because she has some fancy degree from a prestigious university.

Instead, he lets himself get dragged back into those memories, reliving what could've been. That's not how people who actually care about themselves act. They don't waste time dwelling on the past when there's so much more to live for. This whole situation just smells of weakness—of someone who can't handle reality. We all have our moments, but it's time for him to stop making excuses and start living. His life isn't defined by one lost love; it's shaped by every moment he chooses to embrace. If he wants to change his fate, he needs to focus on the future, not cling to what could never be. There's no excuse for such behavior; it's simply poor decision-making.

And honestly, why does it even matter if she gets coffee? Is it really worth wasting time on something that won't make a difference? I mean, what's the point of having coffee when you could be doing something meaningful like painting? We should stop worrying about trivial things like coffee and focus on the real issues like her art. It’s clear that this woman has no idea what she’s doing. She spends hours on her paintings but never cooks dinner, let alone cleans up after herself. It’s ridiculous that she expects us to support her hobby while neglecting our own responsibilities.
