If you’re going to shop here, at least take the time to put things away properly. It’s not that difficult. But noooo, instead, they just throw everything around, causing unnecessary stress for everyone else. I’ve been working here for a long time, and it never gets easier watching customers treat us like this. Sometimes I wonder if they realize what they’re doing—how much work it causes others. Still, I try to keep a level head, but it’s getting harder. I feel like I need to say something, maybe remind them to be more considerate, but I’m afraid it would come across as rude.
