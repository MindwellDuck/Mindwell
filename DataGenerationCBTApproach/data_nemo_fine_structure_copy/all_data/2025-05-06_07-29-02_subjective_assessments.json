She always claims she's fine, but deep down, I know she is struggling with her new job. My cards have shown me a path filled with obstacles and frustrations - a computer that won't cooperate, a boss who seems distant, and meetings that feel pointless. It's all going to lead up to one moment of pure disaster. Her eyes widened as she read through my predictions. \"This is exactly how it feels,\" she said, tears welling up in her eyes. But I knew she didn't really want to hear it. She was too scared to accept the truth. Even though I told her, \"Your career may suffer if you don't take action now,\" she just shook her head, saying, \"Don't worry, everything will work out.\" But I know better. My cards have shown me a future where she'll struggle to find meaning in her life, feeling trapped by the monotony of her job. And when she tries to leave, she'll hit roadblocks like a computer crash, forcing her back into the office. It's a cycle of frustration that I warned her about, but she chose to ignore. Now, I'm left wondering how much longer she can keep pushing herself before things fall apart. She asked me to clarify the reading, but I couldn't give her anything more reassuring than what I already said. My cards are clear:"

Your stomach is churning, and I can practically smell the anxiety emanating from you. You're trying to play it cool, but deep down, you know you've been caught red-handed - or rather, red-fisted, with those donuts. It's not just about the donuts themselves; it's about how they represent your entire attitude towards life. You see yourself as an outsider, someone who doesn't fit in with the \"cool kids\" crowd. But when those memes started circulating, you thought you were immune to the ridicule. You figured you could handle whatever came your way, but boy, were you wrong. Now, every time you hear a snicker, it's like a knife twisting in your chest. Your whole demeanor has changed since then. You walk around with a scowl on your face, like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every smile feels forced, every laugh sounds like a betrayal. You're convinced that everyone is secretly mocking you, and that the jokes are just the tip of the iceberg. It's like the world has turned against you, and no amount of self-control can shield you from the constant barrage of insults. You tried to brush it off"

Every time that stupid device goes off, my heart starts racing like crazy. How many times have I been pulled away from important work because some idiot decided to call in a code? This is ridiculous! They need to stop bothering me with every little thing. It's always something, never anything significant. I know it's a pain, but why does it have to happen now? Don't you people understand how stressful this is? I've got real patients to care about, not just random codes. If I had a dollar for every time someone called me for a bullshit alert, I'd have enough money to buy a new car. And another thing, who needs a code anyway? It's just going to end up being a minor issue. That's what happens most of the time. These doctors are fucking incompetent; they're probably just trying to cover their own ass by sending unnecessary calls. I bet if they actually checked the patient's chart, they wouldn't have called me at all. But no, they have to waste my precious time with unnecessary alerts. I swear, this hospital is full of jerks"

Instead, she just went and left the kitchen, wasting time and energy over nothing. I swear, sometimes people are just so fucking dumb. And she thinks we’re bad? At least I didn’t leave my tools lying around where someone could trip over them. Why bother trying to talk to her when she won’t even listen? We can’t trust her to follow basic safety protocols, and honestly, I’m surprised she hasn’t burned herself more often. Maybe if she actually listened, things wouldn’t be such a mess. But no, instead, she gets upset because of some stupid oven mishap, acting like it’s all my fault. Whatever. She needs to stop being so dramatic. There’s nothing to cry about.

He couldn't stop thinking about her smile, which reminded him of his ex-wife's. That woman had broken his heart, leaving him shattered and wondering what could have been if she hadn't left. He remembered that day vividly—a day filled with pain and regret. She had walked out of their home, leaving behind memories that still lingered. Even though he knew she was gone, the wound never fully healed. Now, here he was, sitting across from someone who looked so much like her. Her bright smile seemed to hold secrets, and he found himself wanting to uncover them all. As he listened to her discuss her approach to teaching, he became increasingly agitated.
