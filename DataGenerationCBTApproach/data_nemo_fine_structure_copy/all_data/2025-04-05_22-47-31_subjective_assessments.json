The last time we saw him was during an appointment two weeks ago. He had been complaining about pain for months before that. I couldn't believe it when he died suddenly. I remember asking if he wanted to see a doctor, but he just said, \"No.\" I kept telling him, \"But you need to go to the hospital,\" and he just shook his head and told me, \"Don't worry about me.\" Now here this girl comes in with those deep laugh lines? It's so out of touch. Why would anyone make such a face? I'm not sure what's going on here, but it doesn't look good. The ER nurse keeps saying things like, \"She'll be okay,\" but I can't imagine anything being okay right now. This whole thing feels very surreal. I'm not even sure why I'm here; maybe I'm just overreacting again. I keep thinking back to my own experiences, trying to relate them to hers, but they're so different. My situation feels much more severe than hers. Maybe I'm just overthinking everything because I have cancer. But I really think I'm going through hell. Everything hurts. I feel numb and weak, and there are moments where I almost lose consciousness. What does she mean by laughing? Did she actually enjoy watching him die? Or is she just pretending"

Their love was a flame that burned brightly once, now flickering dimly, a reminder of what could never be again. It shouldn’t be this hard, shouldn’t he just accept? But acceptance would mean surrender, and surrender was the last thing he wanted. Yet, the pain lingered, refusing to heal, much like the scars that time left behind. In the end, perhaps it wasn’t about how long she stayed; maybe it was about whether he’d ever learn to let go. The past held so many secrets, so many truths waiting to be uncovered, but the present beckoned. Shouldn’t he be moving on?
