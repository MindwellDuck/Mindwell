They were so caught up in each other that they barely noticed me. **Why couldn't I be in a situation where someone cared about me enough to even glance at me?** Even if they did, would they have anything nice to say? He had a girlfriend there too, but she seemed more interested in her phone than him. She kept glancing away, unlike my wife, who was fully engaged in our conversation. **How could I blame them? My life sucks, and now I'm stuck watching this perfect couple enjoy each other’s company, making me feel even more pathetic.** My sandwich was cold already, and I hadn’t eaten much anyway. But seeing him devour his food made me feel worse - like I was missing out on something I'll never have. **I’m such an idiot for thinking we were compatible; he clearly doesn’t need someone like me. His family must love him more than they love me.** At least he has a reason to be happy today. It’s his friend’s birthday, and everyone"

It's like she was more than just my wife; she was my best friend, my partner, my soulmate. The thought of losing her still feels like a punch to the gut every time we talk about it. You know what really gets me? When people say things like \"She's gone now\" or \"Life goes on.\" What does that even mean? Does it mean nothing matters anymore? That everything else is irrelevant when you lose someone as special as Rachel? When I look at old photos, I feel like I'm watching a dream unfold. Even though it's just us laughing together, those moments are all I have left of her. And it hurts because I wish I could turn back time and relive every second with her. But then there's this stupid cat, some random animal wandering the streets, wailing like it heard something tragic. It makes me think about how everyone reacts differently to loss. Some people might be okay with moving forward, while others, like me, can't help but hold onto memories. Maybe they're not thinking about anything except the present moment, but it doesn't make it easier for me. I don't want to hear \"life moves on\" from anyone who didn't experience what I went through. If only I had one more day with her, I would spend every waking moment with her. But no, she's gone, leaving me"

My mind keeps jumping between the positive moments we share—like when she smiled at me yesterday—and the negative thoughts swirling around this rejection. It feels like every time I try to show my work, I get shut down again. Maybe I’m just too close to my art, making it harder to separate emotions from reality. It’s weird because I can’t shake off these feelings. Sometimes I wonder if it’s all worth it, especially when I look at my bank account and think about how much more I could be doing if I weren’t so focused on art. But then I remember the last time I showed my work at the local cafe, and how much joy it brought us. That memory feels distant, and I worry that I might be holding onto something that no longer serves me. I guess what bothers me most is feeling like I’m not living up to expectations. Not just mine, but hers. I know she wants the best for me, but sometimes I wish she understood that this creative path isn’t easy.

Even the smallest things trigger memories, making it hard to move forward. She feels trapped, like she’s living in a dream from which she can’t wake up. Each day blends together, each night feels like a wait for dawn, and then the same cycle repeats. It’s exhausting, and she wonders how much more she can take before everything breaks. Every moment feels heavy, weighed down by grief. Even the simplest tasks feel daunting, as if they’re leading her further into a dark place. She tries to hold on to hope, but it slips through her fingers, leaving her with nothing but fear. Her mind races with thoughts of what could happen tomorrow, the day after, or next week.

They both looked like they were having a good time, which made me feel a bit jealous. It’s not uncommon for them to hang out; they’re close friends. But today felt different. I noticed how much fun they seemed to have together, laughing and joking around. After a few minutes, I suggested we move along since it was getting busy. My girlfriend agreed, and we continued walking. We eventually arrived at her house, where we spent some quality time together. She got ready, and I helped her get dressed for work. When she left, I sat down to catch up on some work emails. That’s when I saw the post on Instagram. I quickly scrolled past it, but the image stayed with me.

And why did the doctors have to schedule it for today when he's so busy with work? Shouldn't we have gotten more notice than this? What if this is because of something he ate last night?
