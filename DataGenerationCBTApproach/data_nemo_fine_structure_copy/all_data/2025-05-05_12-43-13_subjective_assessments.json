His wife's favorite chair across from him was empty, a chilling emptiness that seemed to seep into his very bones.

It had been three days since she left, yet the ache within him remained unrelenting. Her departure had shattered the fragile peace they'd built over decades of love and dedication. They'd laughed together, supported each other through life’s trials, and cherished every moment spent side-by-side. But now, all I could see was the emptiness of our home, the silence where her laughter once echoed, and the coldness that had replaced her warmth. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we’d been living a lie, that beneath the surface, our marriage was already dying. She hadn’t even tried to hide her growing frustration; it had been building for months. Every conversation felt like a battle, every glance a reminder that we were just going through the motions. I couldn't help but feel that I'd failed her, that my inability to confront my own flaws—my jealousy, my anger, my fear of change—had driven her away. We'd promised forever, but now, it felt like an insult, a cruel joke played on me alone. I thought about how many times I'd pushed her away, how I'd let my insecurities consume us, until she finally broke free. Now, she was gone, leaving behind nothing but tears and memories of what could’ve been. I remembered the countless nights she'd stayed up late, working on her art,"

Like a worn-out record, he played the same tired stories over and over, never quite hitting the mark. Every time someone said no, he couldn't help but wonder if they were right. Maybe he wasn’t cut out for this job after all. The thought echoed through his mind like a haunting melody, fueling his frustration. His phone beeped, breaking the spell. A text from an unknown number read: “If you’re really interested in making something happen, I have information.” There was a pause, followed by a single sentence: “Meet me at the coffee shop downtown at 7 pm. Come alone.” The message ended abruptly, leaving him wondering who sent it and what they wanted. Part of him yearned for one last chance to prove himself, but another part of him knew better than to get involved. Yet, he found himself walking into the coffee shop, the dim lighting and quiet atmosphere eerily mirroring his mood. As he waited, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched, the air thick with anticipation."

It's clear you don’t know much about art or how it works, which makes this whole thing even more ridiculous.

But since you don’t have anything meaningful to offer, you resort to cheap shots like this. At least I’m doing something I love, unlike you, who's probably just bitter about being forgotten. Your opinions mean nothing compared to actual artists who create something new every time. This whole exchange has made me realize that I'm better off focusing on what I do rather than wasting time trying to impress people like you. If you want to be taken seriously, stop pretending to be a critic just to get attention. I've seen enough of your fake reviews, and I won't let you bring me down.
