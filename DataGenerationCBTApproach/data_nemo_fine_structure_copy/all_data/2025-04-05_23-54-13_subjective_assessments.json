He says he can't tell if I'm \"really\" upset because I've been crying all day, but I know he's reading between the lines, assuming I'm trying to drive him away. And honestly, maybe I am - after all, I did make some things clear earlier about needing more time alone. But is he really reading my mind? Does he truly think I'd do such a thing? I don't blame myself for being upset, though. It makes sense that I'd want to leave when someone does something like this. What would you do? I guess we'll see what happens next, but I'm not sure I trust his version of events yet. Maybe there's more going on than I realize, but I'm still hurt. I hope he understands why I'm upset, even if he isn't fully aware of everything. # Distorted Thought # *My husband thinks I’m driving him away.* ## Step-by-step analysis: * The statement “he doesn’t understand what it means to feel like you’re drowning” suggests that the speaker believes her emotions are beyond her husband’s comprehension. * She states, “he thinks he knows exactly what I’m feeling,” which implies that"

Think about how much change has happened in our society lately. We've got technology, social media, politics... it's crazy! And you know what?
