She recoiled, her stomach churning with disgust as she fumbled for her charger, eager to escape the revolting scene.",

It's all about her, isn't it? # Response End #Response End ## Response: She was repulsed by the stench and immediately assumed that the other woman had the same feeling towards her, which is completely irrational. There's no logical connection between the two people. She shouldn't jump to conclusions about someone else's feelings based solely on her own discomfort. This kind of mind reading can lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary tension. By recognizing this thought pattern, we can start to let go of our assumptions and focus on building genuine connections instead. #Response Start ## Response: The woman probably felt sick too when she saw the dead bird, but she didn't show it because she's a nice person who wouldn't make anyone feel uncomfortable. She might've just wanted to get her stuff and leave quietly, maybe even avoid the guy upstairs since he smells bad too. She could be thinking, \"Let's just stay away from them for now.\" We don't really know what she's thinking, but we can assume she'd rather keep distance. #Response End #Response End ## Response: The woman definitely smelled bad enough to scare off the other girl, who's probably overreacting by being"

They talk about vacations they took together, kids' birthdays, and all that happy stuff. Meanwhile, I'm just trying to keep myself occupied. I've taken up woodworking as a hobby, but it's hard when you're missing someone as much as I am. Still, I try to find solace in the quiet moments, like this one right now. As I sit here in the dark, I see the pictures on the walls. There's nothing wrong with them; they remind me of good times. But what if they’re reminding me too much? What if they make me feel like I’m stuck in the past while everyone else moves on? That thought alone makes me want to throw the damn frame across the room. But no, I won’t do that. I have to be stronger than this. It’s crazy how some days feel like I’ve lost everything twice. First, there was the accident, and then she... She was always the sunshine in my life. Now, I feel like I’m drowning in rainbows. Who needs happiness when you have pain? At least my heart isn’t broken anymore—now it’s just numb. Yeah, let's go with numb. I"

It's almost as if she thinks that by holding onto these tiny reminders, she can somehow turn back time, make him come back, or at least ease the pain a bit. But honestly, it's just another way of avoiding the harsh reality that he's really gone. You know how they say, “time heals all wounds”? Well, for some people, it takes more than just passing time. Sometimes, it needs a lot of work – and sometimes, it doesn’t heal at all. But hey, maybe we’re just looking at things from the wrong angle. Maybe she’s trying to prove to herself (or maybe even me) that she still cares, that she hasn't forgotten about him. Who knows? Maybe she just wants to feel close to him one last time, even if it means keeping a little piece of him around. Either way, I guess I’m okay with it. After all, who am I to judge?
