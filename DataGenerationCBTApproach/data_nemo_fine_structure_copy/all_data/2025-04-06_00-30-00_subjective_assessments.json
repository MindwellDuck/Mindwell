Doesn’t she remember all those hours we spent researching and saving up for this vacation? Just because she didn't make time for it doesn't mean she wants me to suffer too. And yet here she is, oblivious as ever, clicking away at whatever she can find without thinking twice. She has no idea how hard it was to get us tickets for that flight. We were counting down until we could finally relax on the beach together. But no, she couldn't be bothered with that, instead choosing to waste her evening scrolling through old photos like they're nothing. This isn't about me; it's about her inability to prioritize things. If she really cared, she wouldn't have missed our plans. It's not my problem if she forgets important stuff like vacations and birthdays."

His stride was purposeful, yet there was a softness to it that made her heart ache with memories. But today, something felt different. He didn't turn back to wave at their house, his usual habit before disappearing into the trees. Instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a familiar-looking letter - hers, or so she thought. She watched as he unfolded it, his lips moving slightly as if whispering its contents to himself. A sudden gust of wind snatched the paper from his hand, sending it spinning towards the lake. He didn't chase after it. Instead, he stood there for a moment longer before turning away, leaving the letter - and her past - behind.",

Her husband had always told her that men were meant to spend time alone, but this seemed different. There was a weight to the way he sat, his eyes fixed on the horizon. If she were to imagine what his face looked like right now, would it still be the one she remembered from years ago? Her mind began to wander further, conjuring scenes of them walking together through the woods, laughing about old jokes, and sharing stories of life. Yet, these images didn’t seem quite right. They lacked the warmth she associated with those times. As if the memories themselves were fading, she couldn’t help but wonder if it was all just a product of her imagination. Perhaps he wasn’t really there; maybe she was just imagining things. This realization sent a pang of disappointment through her chest, as if the thought itself was somehow disloyal to him.

It wasn't just the fact that his research had been stolen that bothered him; it was the way everything seemed to fall into place for his colleague while he struggled. Every time he tried to get ahead, someone else would find a way to block his path. It didn't seem fair, especially considering how hard he worked. But what really got to him was that his colleague's success came so easily. They were always in high demand, always the go-to expert. Meanwhile, he was left to fight for scraps, never quite making it to the top. \"It's all about timing,\" he told himself, trying to justify it. \"If I can just catch a break...\" Still, the feeling lingered, a constant hum of frustration that he couldn't shake.

As he swirled it, he caught sight of his reflection in the stainless steel: the lines etched deeper around his eyes, the silver hair at his temples. He thought of the years spent over these burners, the thousands of meals prepared, and how none of it could bring back the time he'd wasted on pride and stubbornness. A lump formed in his throat as he realized that tomorrow was their anniversary, a date she'd once looked forward to, now overshadowed by the distance he'd let grow between them.
