Everyone is just pretending to be okay. No one really cares about anyone else; we all just want to survive and escape this prison called life. But I guess some people don't need escape, they already have everything they need right here. Not for me though, I'd rather die than keep living like this. People like them are a constant reminder of how much I have to lose. I feel like such an outcast, even when I try to pretend otherwise. But then I see them, and it's like a punch to the gut. I wish I could turn back time and erase everyone from memory except for him. Maybe if I had him back, things would be different, but no, he's gone now, and I'll never get him back. I just want to disappear and leave this world behind. Why did I ever bother trying? Why am I still here? They're probably thinking about me, wondering why I look so miserable. Do they think I'm crazy? Do they realize how much I hurt inside? Or are they too busy being happy to"

She picks it up, notices it's from last week, and feels a chill run down her spine. Was someone here watching her? She looks around, heart pounding, but it's empty except for a lone security guard at the far end. As she drives home, she can't shake the feeling that something's off. Her partner's car is in the driveway, lights off. She hesitates before getting out, hand trembling as she reaches for her phone to call them. \"Hey,\" she says, voice barely above a whisper, \"I'm home.\" No response. She steps inside, flicking on the hallway light. \"Hello?\" Silence. Then a floorboard creaks upstairs. Her breath hitches. They're never home this early.",

And another thing, what makes you think this guy wasn't already in our apartment? Maybe he was waiting for us, maybe he was hiding in your room while you were working! I swear, sometimes I wonder why I even bother coming home. It’s like everyone thinks they can just break into our house and watch us anytime they want, and then act like nothing happened. Newsflash: people have feelings too. Just because we don’t see anything doesn’t mean we’re not being watched. If I wanted to be stalked, would I go to work every single day? Would I invite this creep into our home where we spend most of our time together? I doubt it. But now I’m starting to feel uneasy about everything. The whole point of living in an apartment is to feel safe, not to worry if someone could sneak in whenever they want. This isn’t about being paranoid; it’s about having common sense.

He told me, \"You know, I've never cried when looking at photos before.\" And I'm thinking, yeah right... unless you're talking about that one time you were stuck in traffic for hours and had nothing but your own thoughts while driving? Or maybe that other time you saw a sad video online and couldn’t stop thinking about it? But seriously, it's crazy how something like that can turn into a whole emotional rollercoaster.

It’s as if I’m trapped inside a never-ending nightmare where every moment is filled with the sound of laughter and conversation, but I’ve lost touch with the language, unable to speak the right words, to convey even the simplest thoughts. It’s not just the conversations themselves that are daunting; it’s the way people look at me. Their smiles, once warm and inviting, now seem forced, like a mask hiding something deeper. I see the way they glance at each other, their expressions flickering between amusement and concern, leaving me wondering which one is genuine. Do they really care? Or is it all just a performance, a show to distract from their own feelings of unease? Every interaction feels like a test, a challenge to pass, but I’m failing, constantly falling short. When someone asks how I’m doing, I force a smile, pretending everything is fine, but deep down, I know it’s a lie."

It seemed like an intentional sabotage, meant to humiliate her in front of all those important people. And why else would they be so sloppy about cleaning up? Clearly, they were trying to ruin everything. As she gazed upon the disgusting state, she felt a surge of anger towards them. \"How could they be so irresponsible?\" she thought. They clearly knew what they were doing, and yet they still chose to leave the dishes dirty. This isn't just negligence; it's a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. I'm certain of it. Why else would they behave like this? Her mind began racing as she tried to make sense of it all. Maybe they're just not used to working under pressure, which explains their lack of attention to detail. Or maybe they deliberately left the dishes that way to see her struggle.

It spoke of love, of dreams yet to come, and of a future that would bring them joy beyond measure. But those words felt hollow now.
