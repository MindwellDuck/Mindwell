Every little thing reminds me of that night, and I feel like I'm drowning in memories. I try to focus on work, but nothing helps. When I went shopping with him yesterday, I couldn't even bear to look at some of the other perfumes. Seeing those bottles made me feel like I was reliving our argument all over again. It wasn't fair; I know I didn't deserve to hear him say those things. But I guess that's why I still get so upset when I see the perfume. Maybe it's not the best idea, but I wish we could just go back to how things were before. I miss the way things used to be between us. We had our fights, but at least we never said anything as hurtful as what he did. Now I just feel like I'll never be happy again.

Every time someone walks by, I catch them staring at me, probably thinking about how pathetic I look. Even my clothes seem outdated – that shirt I wore yesterday was so last season, and yet, here I am, trying to fit into it again. What's worse is when people make comments like, “Hey, didn’t you wear those same pants yesterday?” Like, what’s wrong with me? Can’t I just wear something new for once?
