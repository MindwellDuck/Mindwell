But instead of being met with warmth and welcome, she was greeted by an unsettling silence. It wasn’t until she heard the muffled sound of his voice coming from the den that she realized she had arrived unnoticed. As I entered the living room, my eyes landed on him sitting on the couch, his legs propped up, laptop screen glowing softly in the dim light. His gaze remained fixed on the screen, oblivious to my presence. A glass of wine sat beside him, untouched, but what struck me most was the eerie stillness around us. No chatter, no laughter, just an oppressive silence that seemed to swallow all sound. My heart sank as I processed the scene before me – he hadn’t looked up, hadn’t acknowledged my arrival, and now I wondered if he even cared I was home. My mind began to spin with questions, each one fueled by the absence of explanation. Where was he when he’d said he’d be working late? Why didn’t he greet me like he always did? Was he lost in thought, so caught up in whatever he was doing that he couldn’t hear me step inside? Or was this some kind of passive-aggressive game, where he deliberately ignored me? I felt a surge of anger mixed with sadness. We’ve been together long"

The room began to spin, the walls closing in as she fought to catch her breath. Her husband's voice echoed from the other room, calling out for lunch, but all she could hear was the roar of blood in her ears.

It feels like the world around me is spinning out of control, and my mind is screaming, \"This can't keep happening!\" But she just keeps telling me to breathe, to calm down. She says I need to relax, that I'll get through it eventually, but every time I try to take a deep breath, I feel like I'm choking. She tells me to focus on the present moment, but I can't shake off the feeling that things are spiraling out of control.
