She made dinner for us and we sat down to eat, enjoying our meal. As we finished up, she suggested we play some board games. We had a great time laughing and joking around. Afterward, we went to bed early, feeling content. I woke up this morning feeling refreshed and grateful for her care. But what does it really mean? I'm tired all the time, so I guess it's nothing special. But honestly, I'm still pissed about how much money she spent on the new TV and furniture. It feels like she doesn't understand why I need more space to relax. And those stupid candles she bought for our anniversary were just a waste. I told her I didn't want them, and now she thinks I’m being ungrateful. I know she was trying to make things better between us, but she doesn’t get it. This whole thing is ridiculous. I'm just mad because she won’t listen to me when I try to explain myself. She’s always making assumptions, assuming I'm being selfish or whatever. Like, come on! Can’t she see how hard I’m working? Doesn’t she think about how stressed out I am? Anyway, I guess it’s not all bad. She did cook dinner tonight, which means I can save money by eating at home instead"

That you can't even take responsibility for your own mistakes. If you wanted to leave your mark, why didn't you just sign the damn thing?! But no, instead you just sit there, whining about how nobody knows who you are. What a joke. It's time to face facts here. She's a talented artist, and you're just a jealous, bitter loser. Get over yourself and stop acting like this. Your emotional tantrums aren't going to change anyone's opinion. If you're really that hurt by not having your name on it, maybe you should've taken care of business before bringing it to someone else. Now you're just making a big deal out of nothing. Stop being such a baby and let go of your ego. Let's talk about something else. Do you have any other issues with people not recognizing your work? Maybe we can help you figure some shit out.

What's more, I'll probably mess up my writing anyway, so why bother trying? This isn't just about grades; it's about pride. If I fail, my self-respect will plummet, making me question whether I'm cut out for college. The pressure is crushing, but I refuse to give up. Either I'll put everything into this essay and risk messing up, or I'll let it go and live with the shame of not doing my best. The thought of failing is already weighing heavily on my mind, and I feel like I'm being pulled between two impossible choices: submitting subpar work or letting the deadline pass. I know what I want to say, but I'm afraid to write it down, fearing that it won’t sound perfect. My anxiety is building, and I feel trapped between two extremes: perfectionism and avoidance.

Then he went back to crying, and I had to stop him before he hurt himself more. He wasn't really crying about the onion, though. He must have just gotten a little emotional about his day or something. Anyway, now I'm worried that service will start while we're still arguing. He doesn't want to talk about it, but I can tell he's upset about something. Maybe it has nothing to do with the job? Idk. I don't know what's wrong with him right now. All I know is that I feel bad for him, but I also need to get to work on time. We've already wasted half an hour, and I'm running behind schedule. If I don't leave soon, my boss will kill me.
