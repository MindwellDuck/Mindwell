It wasn’t natural to wake up like this, especially when his wife slept peacefully beside him. She didn’t seem to care about his racing heart; she just lay there, steady and calm. But shouldn’t she be worried? Shouldn’t she be scared for her husband? Why did she act so normal? He told himself, \"You're supposed to be worried right now.\" But it sounded ridiculous. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, even though everything around him seemed perfectly fine. As if he had woken up to an alarm that never actually went off. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. He'd expected panic, not peace. What kind of man wakes up like this, still awake after all these years? Shouldn't he be tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep? Why does he feel okay? What's wrong with him? His thoughts were telling him one thing, but his body said another. This isn't how it's supposed to happen. Everything is out of sync. He should be more stressed than usual, not relaxed. Maybe he’s lost control. Maybe he should be freaking out, but he doesn’t. It feels fake, like acting out a script instead of living life. Why does he have to be awake while everyone else sleeps? Is he missing some important signal? Shouldn't he"

This isn't something I signed up for, and I certainly didn't ask for it. Life just doesn't seem fair. Everyone else seems to have it together, while I'm stuck dealing with these constant emotions.

Is that normal? Maybe I need to calm down and try to rationalize things. But what if I shouldn’t be thinking about this at all? If I’m really scared, maybe I shouldn’t be calling the police. No, I have to. I know I have to. He could hurt me. Or worse. What if he already did something bad? Why would I call the police if I didn’t know anything? Maybe I’m just imagining things.

It was as if she was trapped in a never-ending cycle of hypotheticals, each one leading to an unsettling conclusion. She felt lost in these thoughts, unable to shake them off, even after talking to her doctor. The conversation had given her temporary reassurance, but the doubts remained, haunting her still. It seemed like no matter how many times she convinced herself that everything would be okay, the fears kept coming back. She began to feel like she was stuck in a perpetual loop of wondering what could go wrong. Each time she tried to push through, another question popped up, and she found herself spiraling deeper into uncertainty.

Instead, he had this emptiness, this heavy unhappiness that felt like a second job. Tonight, as he took his first bite of cold chicken, he noticed a small crack in the porcelain plate - another casualty of his solitary dinners.
