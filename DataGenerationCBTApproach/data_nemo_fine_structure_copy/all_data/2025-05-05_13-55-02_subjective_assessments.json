It's from him, the ex-boyfriend she'd ghosted after their heated argument months ago. She hesitates, thumb hovering over the play button, regret gnawing at her insides like a relentless tide. The unopened message is a stark reminder of words left unsaid and bridges burned.

I feel like an idiot for letting him go, but deep down, I know it was for the best. Still, I can’t shake off the feeling that I missed something special. Why did we part ways? What was really going through his mind when he said those final words? Was it anger or sadness? Or maybe he just wanted space? I need answers, and I’m getting none. Every time I think back, I see more questions than clarity. I wonder if he’s happy now, if he ever thinks about me. Does he wish we had stayed together? Would things have worked out? My mind keeps replaying those moments, trying to fill in the gaps. But the more I try, the more confused I become. Heaven forbid I actually talk to him again, though. That would be too late now. I wouldn’t want to ruin everything with a casual hello. No, I’d rather live with this uncertainty forever. At least then I could convince myself I made the right decision. After all, what if I wasn’t ready to move on? What if I still needed him? That thought"

This made the first driver feel frustrated because they were doing everything right—following traffic rules—but still getting cut off. They began thinking about why this happened and how unfair it felt. Meanwhile, there's another story that might make you feel even worse. A coworker has been having a rough time lately, too. She also had a car problem, where she couldn't get her car started due to a faulty battery. Despite her efforts to fix it, she realized she needed professional help. So, she went to a mechanic, who told her that fixing the issue would cost more money than expected. Now, she feels like she can't afford such repairs and worries about how this will affect her daily life. Just like the person with the car problems, many others have similar issues—like health problems, job struggles, and financial stress—that make them feel like they're losing control. But no matter what happens, some people always seem to be one step ahead. Take your own car for a spin today and imagine how frustrating it must be to deal with constant breakdowns.
