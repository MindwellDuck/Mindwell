I wanted to believe that we still had something special, but every time I looked at her, I saw the way you used to look at her, too. She seemed to be enjoying herself, laughing with others, while I stood there, watching her, feeling more and more alone. Her smile caught my attention, and for a moment, I thought I saw something in her eyes, something I couldn’t quite grasp. But then it slipped away, leaving me with nothing but confusion. Maybe it was just the whiskey talking, but I knew what I saw – and it hurt me deeply. As I entered the apartment, she turned around, her expression neutral. We didn’t say much, just exchanged brief pleasantries before going our separate ways. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was trying to avoid me, and it made me angry. Why would she do that? Didn’t she know how hard it was for me to see her like this? But then again, maybe I’m reading too much into it. Maybe she’s just being friendly. Still, I couldn’t help but wonder if she felt anything for someone else, if she ever did. That thought haunted me, making me question everything. Was she really just being"
