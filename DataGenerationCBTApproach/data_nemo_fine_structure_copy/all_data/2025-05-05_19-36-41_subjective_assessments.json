It’s like she’s running in slow motion while everyone else is speeding by, leaving her further and further behind with each passing day. She feels like she’s just going through the motions, pretending to be everything she wishes she could be, but deep down, she knows it’s all just an act. She’s living a lie, and no matter how hard she tries, she can never catch up. Her mind is constantly flooded with questions: Why does it always have to be this way?
