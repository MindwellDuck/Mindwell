The thought is ridiculous; I know what he does, and it doesn't involve anything like that. I've seen how he works, how he juggles multiple projects, how he prioritizes tasks with such precision. His focus is unwavering, his dedication unshakeable. He's always been like that—meticulous, reliable, and honest. And yet, why must I question everything? Why must my mind constantly seek reassurance, always ready to jump to conclusions? But then again, maybe I am overreacting. Maybe I’m just tired myself, worn down by the stress of the past week. Maybe I need to take a step back and breathe, to let go of these nagging doubts that seem to creep into my mind at night. Still, the image of him working late, alone, haunts me—a fleeting glimpse of something hidden, something I shouldn’t worry about. No, I won’t think about it. I won’t let my imagination run wild. I have to stop this cycle of doubt before it consumes me. Because if I don’t, who will? Who else will try to fill the void left by his absence? And besides, isn’t it better if he’s busy? Wouldn’t you rather be left alone than to wonder where he is and what he’s doing? That way"
