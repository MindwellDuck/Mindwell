This is just another example of how entitled she is. What kind of person does that? And now she expects me to be happy about it?! Does she think I'm some kind of idiot who can just accept anything? She's so clueless, doesn't even consider how I feel when she leaves like this. Doesn't she understand that I'm tired of carrying everything on my own? She's going to realize soon enough that she needs me more than she thinks she does. But until then, I'll just have to deal with it because I'm not one to back down from a challenge. After all, what's a little stress between partners? This isn't the first time she's done something like this; she's always leaving me hanging. If I didn't work so hard to keep things together, we'd probably both be miserable right now. She has no idea what I go through every day, juggling our life while she's off gallivanting wherever she pleases. It's exhausting, and I won't let her take advantage of me anymore. When she gets back, she'll see things differently, maybe finally realize how much I deserve better. But until then, I'll just have to suffer silently. Maybe if I act cool, she'll think I don’t mind.

I wish someone would acknowledge my efforts, but they never do. It's like they're ignoring me on purpose. My feelings are totally justified, and I can't blame them for feeling annoyed with me. I guess I'll just have to accept that I'm not loved, which makes sense since everything else about my life is going downhill anyway. What's the point of trying? Maybe I'm better off without anyone’s help or support. If everyone saw how miserable I am, they’d probably distance themselves from me. That wouldn’t be fair, though—it’s not my fault they don’t care. They should be grateful I still show up, even if I’m miserable. But what’s the point when nobody cares? I might as well give up now and let my problems consume me. After all, I’ve got nothing to lose. This feels really good because I finally get to vent about all the things that go wrong in my life. It’s nice to know I’m not alone in feeling this way. I think I’ll just keep thinking about all the times I felt unappreciated or ignored. Yeah, that’s definitely something to look forward to"

It was just a stupid photo—she had taken it herself, after all—and now she’s acting like it was something special. Why can’t she just accept things for what they are? This isn’t going to change anything. There’s nothing else to say, no new information to process. She needs to stop dwelling on the past and focus on the present. This isn’t about nostalgia; it’s about reality. She should just let go of these childish feelings already. It doesn’t make sense to keep holding onto something that’s gone.

The thought lingers, like a shadow over the empty space where he once sat at the table, watching cooking shows with her. It’s never just a small mistake; every time she cooks, the same pattern repeats. He would criticize the way she seasoned everything, saying it was too salty, or how she wouldn’t mix things enough. Even when they were happy together, those moments felt like a facade. His criticism crept into her mind, making her doubt her own abilities. Now, as I look back, I see how often he would say I wasn’t doing anything right—how many times I tried to make something perfect for him before he found fault in everything. It’s almost as if he hated me trying to cook, hated the effort I put into our meals together. And yet, every time we ate out, he would rave about the dishes she ordered, praising the chef and the restaurant for bringing out the flavors in my food. But here I am, alone, staring at this casserole, wondering why I ever thought I could be a good wife, a good cook. Every time we went out, he praised me for ordering, but now, I realize it was all just a show. He said I couldn"

She feels like she was supposed to lose him gracefully, not like this—crushed by a falling branch, leaving her heart shattered. As she looks at the broken pieces, she wonders why things didn’t go according to plan. It’s as if life is always trying to teach her lessons, but sometimes it doesn’t even give her a chance to learn. The crack in the mug serves as a harsh reminder that some moments are beyond control, just like the loss of her beloved husband. In the silence of her kitchen, she questions everything. Shouldn’t her world have continued as before? Shouldn’t life have moved forward smoothly, untouched by tragedy? But now, every day feels like a step backward, each passing moment a painful reminder of what could’ve been. Even the memories of their happy times seem tainted, as if they’re meant to serve as a cruel contrast to her present sorrow. Her mind is flooded with thoughts of what-ifs, replaying the moments leading up to the accident over and over. She recalls how he had warned her about the dangers of standing too close to the tree, but she hadn’t listened. Now, in her grief, she feels guilty for not being more careful, for not doing enough to protect him. Every decision feels like a mistake, every choice"

I get that he'd want to remember happy times with him, especially since they were just having fun together when they took that photo. What I don't understand is why he's still so sad about it. Is he just really missing his grandfather right now? Did something happen that made him think about this picture? I've never seen him cry before, so I guess I'm just confused by how emotional he got over something that happened a long time ago."

I don't blame her at all; it must be very difficult to go through this. The fact that she hasn't touched anything related to him in so long speaks volumes about how much pain she is still enduring. In fact, I think she might be avoiding everything because of her grief. It could also be that she is just overwhelmed by the sheer number of memories attached to each book. If she had already been cleaning up after herself, she wouldn't have needed to wait so long to start again. But honestly, if she were doing it now, it would probably mean something more profound than just \"cleaning.\" Maybe she would feel a sense of closure, finally letting go of some of the emotional weight holding her back. Perhaps it would help her find peace, allowing her to move forward with life. Or maybe, just maybe, it would be an opportunity to reconnect with her late husband through the stories and memories embedded within those pages."

She seemed a bit annoyed, almost like she wanted to get rid of the necklace. It made me think maybe she wasn't entirely happy with our living arrangement, especially since we were still getting used to each other. I remember thinking, \"Maybe if I had been more careful with my finances, she wouldn't have felt this way.\" But now, looking back, I realize that might've been jumping to conclusions. Maybe she just didn't like the color I chose for the vase. Or maybe she got distracted by another receipt and lost track of time. Still, it feels like she's holding onto that necklace for some reason, like she's waiting for me to figure out why she did it. Maybe she's just worried I'll buy something similar someday?
