This smells worse than all the times I had to deal with infected wounds when I worked in the ER. I can't even imagine how bad it must be for him. I feel so bad for him - I'm honestly worried he'll die soon because of the lack of proper care. I hope someone is taking responsibility for this. How could they let something like this happen? I know I wouldn't want to be treated by someone who doesn't take good care of themselves. My heart goes out to this poor man. I don't understand why she didn't wash her hands before entering the room. Doesn't she realize how contagious infections are? If she had taken basic precautions, things might have been different. Maybe if she'd washed her hands properly, the patient wouldn't have developed such severe symptoms. But now... now it's too late. Poor thing. I can't believe this happened under her supervision. How did she get away with this? What kind of hospital allows this to happen? They're going to pay for this negligence. I bet there will be lawsuits coming out of this. It's disgusting. Someone needs to step up and take responsibility. This is so unfair. I wish I could help"

Now, I'm left with nothing but these stupid photos. I remember how she would tell me stories about her childhood, her siblings, and how she always dreamed of becoming a scientist like me. She must have been waiting for me to come back and help her finish what she started. But I never gave her a chance. The fact that she died alone in her lab, surrounded by papers and broken dreams, is just heartbreaking. I wish I could go back and spend more time with her, but now it's too late."

That small detail bothered her immensely, as if it was a sign that he still didn't take care about the memories they shared. The image seemed faded, too, though she knew it had been taken just a couple of years ago. The lack of vibrancy made her think that time wasn't passing for him; he was frozen in the past, just like the photo. The caption below, \"Our First Day,\" felt like an insult now, since it reminded her of all the days that followed—days filled with arguments and tears. As she looked closer, she saw a slight smudge on his face, which must have been from the rain that day. But why would he forget to clean himself before coming home? Didn't he remember how she hated getting dirty dishes? Her mind started to wander back to when they first met, laughing together over a drink at a bar. She recalled the way he held her hand, so tightly, and how his eyes sparkled when he told her about his dreams. He had always been so full of life, so optimistic. Now, he was nothing more than a memory—a memory tainted by the pain of his absence. Even the words of his final letter hurt her, saying things like \"You're better off without me\" and \"Don't look back.\" How could someone who once promised forever break her heart so easily?"

Your lack of communication makes me feel like I'm worthless. I'm starting to think that maybe I don't deserve to be loved by anyone. Maybe I should just accept that I'll never find someone who cares about me, and move on. But why would you even care if you didn't want anything to do with me anyway? You're probably just using me for your own entertainment, aren't you? You're probably laughing at me behind my back, enjoying every moment of my misery. That's why you're so distant, right? You're just trying to make me miserable so you can feel better when we eventually break up. Well, I won't let you win that easily. I'll show you that I'm still worth fighting for, no matter what.

It wasn't just the scientific implications that were worrying him; he couldn't shake the feeling that something much more sinister was at play here. Something that went far beyond mere science. As he delved deeper into the research, he began to feel a sense of dread creeping up inside him, as if he was staring into the face of a reality so profound, so unshakeable, that nothing else mattered anymore. And yet, despite the overwhelming sense of certainty that had taken hold of him, he couldn't help but wonder: what other secrets lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered? For the first time in years, the scientist felt like he was standing on the edge of something momentous—a moment that would change everything. But how could it be? How could such monumental changes come from something as seemingly mundane as energy production? Wasn't it all just a game of numbers and probabilities? Or was there something more at play, something that spoke to the very heart of human existence itself? As he sat there, lost in the depths of his own thoughts, the scientist"
