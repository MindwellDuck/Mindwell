I see them laughing together, sharing family stories, and it just makes me cringe. That young guy even has a wedding ring. What am I supposed to be happy for? It feels like my partner is rubbing it in my face - all this happiness while I'm stuck here alone, no family to share my misery with. Every smile, every laugh, just reminds me how pathetic I look next to these newcomers. The whole thing feels staged, like some sort of twisted game to keep me down. They're probably just pretending to be friends until they realize I'm useless. But what really gets under my skin is when I see those little things - a shiny new badge, a freshly polished uniform, a wedding ring... All of it serves as a constant reminder of my failure. Why can't I have something like that? Why does everything have to remind me of what I lack? This whole scene just reinforces the idea that I’m destined to fail, that nothing good ever happens to me. I won't let anyone forget that I'm the one who doesn't deserve any joy. Every time someone else seems happy, it's like a slap in the face, a harsh reminder of my own disappointment. And now this new recruit, with his easy smile and sparkling eyes, just rubs it in my face. He doesn't know the weight of loneliness, but"

I started to wonder what if I had done something wrong, like what if I was too slow with the brushstrokes or didn't color evenly? What if he hated everything about my artwork? Afterwards, he told me he felt guilty for making me cry, but I couldn't shake off those thoughts. I even imagined what if he had been right, what if I really was terrible at this. That would mean all the things he said hurtful were true. But what if I could prove him wrong, what if I could create something amazing? It feels like I'm stuck between these two possibilities—either I’m a failure or I can change—but neither one gives me peace. I know he said some pretty harsh stuff, but I still can’t stop thinking about how I might have messed up. What if he’s right? Maybe I am just not talented enough.

We have to keep an eye out for him everywhere he goes, even when he’s just walking down the street. I swear, every time I see him, I feel like I need to be ready for anything.
