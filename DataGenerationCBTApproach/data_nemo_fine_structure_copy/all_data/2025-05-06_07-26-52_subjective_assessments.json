She checked twice before leaving for work, anxiety gnawing at her. On the train, she felt claustrophobic, her chest tightening with each stop. A young woman sat next to her, earbuds in, singing along softly to a song only she could hear. The engineer noticed her hands trembling as she held her phone, checking emails that weren't there yet. She took deep breaths, trying to calm herself, but the world outside the window seemed to be moving too fast.",

I mean, we all have those days where everything seems off, right? Maybe it's because she's been dealing with some personal issues lately, making her more sensitive to these kinds of situations. Or maybe it's just how her mind works sometimes—overthinking every little thing. But either way, it doesn't change what happened. When she got home from work, she realized she had forgotten to turn off the coffee maker. It wasn't a huge deal, but it still bothered her. She tried to shake it off, thinking that maybe it was just her being paranoid again. After all, she hadn't had an accident at home for a long time, so maybe she was just overreacting. It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re worried about something, even if it turns out to be nothing. You can always tell yourself it’s just your imagination playing tricks on you. But then there were the symptoms on the train. Her heart was racing, her chest tightness, and her hands shaking. That was definitely not normal behavior. Even though everyone else was fine, it made her wonder if she was really okay. It’s easy to think you're fine one minute, but then suddenly, you start worrying about things you can’t control. It’s almost as if her body is reacting to things without her fully understanding why. It’s"

Why can't I be like him? Why does it always seem to fall on me to feel this way? This isn't the first time I've caught him smiling with another woman, but it still hurts. It's just so unfair—why does everything go wrong for me while everyone else moves on effortlessly? I'm starting to think I'll never find happiness because I'm too broken. This is all I ever get: pain, disappointment, and heartache. It makes me wonder if there's something fundamentally wrong with me, making me a perpetual loser. Why can't I just let go? What’s the point of even trying anymore? Life is too short for this kind of suffering. But no, I keep going back, hoping things will change, that somehow magically I’ll become worthy of love. It’s exhausting. Maybe I’m just too ugly or stupid, and there’s no fixing me. Maybe I should just accept that I’m meant to be alone forever. How do I stop being such an asshole? How do I stop torturing myself every day? The thought of giving up feels like a relief,"

She spends hours scrolling mindlessly, never engaging in real conversations or showing interest in anything beyond the screen. I try to reach out, but she just brushes me off, saying things like \"Oh, sorry, I'm just stressed\" or \"Don't worry about it.\" It's like she thinks I'll magically fix everything with one conversation. Newsflash, sweetheart: I don't have the answers anymore. We've already tried therapy, counseling, and even meditation together, but none of it has worked. She keeps telling me that she's working on herself, but I can't shake the feeling that she's just pretending to be better than she actually is.

He felt like a failure every time he saw another bulb die. It wasn't just about the inconvenience; it was like his own sense of self-worth was tied to keeping everything perfect. The more lights failed, the more he felt like he was failing at being a good nurse. His mind kept telling him that he needed to \"fix this\" and that he would never give up. But deep down, he knew that he was already exhausted and overwhelmed. Yet, every time a bulb burned out, he thought, \"If I could just fix this, maybe things will get better.\" This constant struggle between hope and despair led him to wonder if he was really cut out for this job. He began to doubt whether he could handle the stress anymore. Every time a new bulb died, he wondered how much longer he could keep going before he snapped. Despite his efforts, the situation continued to deteriorate. He started to see other nurses as failures too, reinforcing his belief that everyone was weak and incompetent. Even when patients showed signs of improvement, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was just delaying the inevitable. As he struggled to find solutions, he started to believe that no matter"

Meanwhile, I'm still living with my parents after almost 3 years of marriage gone wrong. It feels like everyone else has moved on smoothly while I'm still stuck in limbo. And now, seeing this photo of us all together at the medical conference, I feel even more pathetic. That kid is probably married by now with a family already, and I'm still single. I know people say \"it's all relative\" but honestly, it's hard not to think I'm behind in life compared to these guys who have built their lives and families.
