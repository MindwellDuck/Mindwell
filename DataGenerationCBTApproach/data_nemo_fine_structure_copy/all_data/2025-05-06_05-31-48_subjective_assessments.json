It's just one little thing, but he made it sound so serious. And now, because of him, I have to deal with this stress? I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, and I don't know how much longer I can handle it. Why does he always have to make everything about himself? Doesn't he realize that his behavior affects me too? I try to stay calm, but my hands are shaking. This isn't just about the accident; it's about us, about our relationship. If only he'd listen... But then there's the nurse, and the doctor, and the entire team rushing into action. They're professionals, trained to handle emergencies like this. What if I fail? What if I make things worse? This isn't just about me anymore; it's about everyone involved. But why do I keep thinking about him? He's supposed to be supporting me, not making me feel like this. How did we get to this point? We used to be okay, but now...now it feels like everything is falling apart. My husband thinks he’s so important, and I"

That lipstick stain in the sink was probably just some random girl she picked up on the side while out drinking after work. No wonder she's never been in a long term relationship - she's too immature, too selfish. And this whole \"empty wine glass\" thing? Oh, she's probably just drunk alone again, wasting away in her apartment, feeling sorry for herself because she can't get a man. What a loser. And when she has to go back to work tomorrow, she'll probably just show up late and sloppy, expecting everyone to make excuses for her because she's such a sweetheart. It's pathetic. Her lack of maturity and poor decision making are going to ruin everything. I'm sure she's completely oblivious to how much damage she's doing to her life and relationships by being so reckless and irresponsible. But I know for certain that if we all saw how she really acted behind closed doors, we would be horrified. What kind of person leaves their dirty dishes for others to clean? How could she expect anyone to take her seriously as a chef when she can't even take care of her own kitchen? I bet she's lost count of how many times she's been fired for showing up late, forgetting orders, and generally causing chaos in the kitchen. If only people knew what went on"

The once lively canvas now mirrored her despair, as she realized there was nothing left to cover up; she had run out of paint. She could have painted more colors if she wanted to, but she didn't want to. Her thoughts were already so dark that adding anything else would make it even worse. If I'm being honest, the only reason she painted again is because she needed something to distract herself from how empty everything feels. It doesn't matter what happened before; it's all just going to be covered up with more grey anyway. There's no point trying to keep the original colors - it's pointless to hold onto memories when they're already fading away. There are many things that could have been done instead of painting, but she chose this path because it felt like the easiest option for her right now. No matter how much paint she adds, it will never fill the void inside her. It won't change anything; it's all still going to feel the same way at the end. Since she can't bring back the past, she might as well focus on creating something new. Even though it's hard to let go of what has already happened, she knows that holding onto it wouldn't help.

She doesn’t listen to me at all. She just ignores my warnings and does whatever she wants. Even though we’re supposed to be a team, I feel alone. When I told her not to leave her clothes in the bathroom, she didn’t even acknowledge it. It’s like she thinks I don’t matter. I try to help her with everything, but she never appreciates it. She just leaves me with the mess. This isn’t the first time something like this happens. Remember that time she lost her glasses and couldn’t find them for hours? Or how about when she forgot to bring her phone charger and had to use mine? It feels like she takes advantage of me whenever she can. If she wasn’t so careless, things wouldn’t be like this. But no, she has to make my life harder every day. Why can’t she just act normal for once? She always makes a mess wherever she goes.

All they care about is poking fun at my personal life. This hospital is full of snarky, judgmental people who love to make fun of others' mistakes. My boss always tries to be nice, but deep down, he's probably laughing at me behind my back too. It's ridiculous how much attention I'm getting over something that happened months ago. Everyone keeps bringing it up, and it feels like they’re trying to humiliate me more than anything else. Even though it’s clearly over, they keep saying things like “Well, you didn’t last long” or “You were never meant to stay.” Those comments are just cruel, especially coming from someone who’s been divorced himself. But of course, nobody cares about his past experiences because he's got a wife who loves him. What would happen if my ex-wife did the same thing? Would I be the asshole? This is such a waste of time.
