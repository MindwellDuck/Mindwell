She knew he wouldn't notice for days, but it still stung. Years of his careless spending, his disregard for her hard-earned savings from the store, bubbled up inside her like a bitter brew. This time, she'd had enough. As she watched him laugh with their grandchildren, oblivious to the theft, she felt it: a cold, calculated vengeance stirring within her. She would make him notice, make him feel the pinch he'd caused her for so long.",

And now, this watch is gone, and he doesn't seem to notice at all! It's so... so... **infuriating**. He's probably laughing right now, enjoying himself with our kids while I'm here alone, crying my eyes out over that stupid watch. He thinks he can get away with stealing from me one more time because I'm old and weak. But no, I won't let him. I'll show him. Oh, yes, I'll show him. He has no idea what it's like to live on a tight budget, to worry every day if we'll have enough money for rent, food, and bills. He doesn't understand the frustration of dealing with his own incompetence—of having to clean up after him, of being tired all the time, of worrying about him driving too fast, of watching him waste money on stupid things like that watch. No, he doesn't understand. He just laughs and jokes around, never stopping to think about how much it hurts me.

He began straightening shelves, his hands moving automatically while his mind wandered. An old, dusty toy car caught his eye, a reminder of his childhood when life seemed simpler. He picked it up, running his thumb over its smooth surface, before gently placing it back on the shelf. As he turned off the lights and stepped out into the empty parking lot, a chill wind blew, carrying with it the faintest hint of rain.

Or just an escape from the pain of being alone? He remembered the countless hours spent scrolling through job listings, the interviews, the applications, the rejections. And then, finally, the offer came. A chance to start anew. To rebuild his shattered dreams. But was it worth it? He thought of the long commute, the monotony of the routine, the loneliness that followed every step outside those office doors. As he stood there, lost in his thoughts, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d made a mistake. Was this really the life he wanted? Or was it just another illusion, another dream he had chased without ever finding peace? He looked down at his worn shoes, the scars on his palms, the lines etched on his face—a map of the struggles he had faced. And yet, despite it all, he still held onto hope. Hope that someday, somehow, things would change. That he’d find happiness again. That he wouldn’t always feel so broken. But deep down, where no one could see, he knew the truth.

But no, instead, she goes behind my back and gets involved with some other guy. I'll never forgive her for what she did today. This is completely her fault. It's not okay to treat your partner like this. She has no idea what it's like to work 12-hour shifts while trying to keep our family together. She doesn't understand anything.

He feels that his wife's increasing demands have created tension between them. She is now seeking more personal time and attention, which he feels she does not deserve after all he has done for her. The photograph serves as a reminder of happier times, but it also makes him feel guilty about the current state of their relationship. He often finds himself wondering why he stayed in the marriage when things were going so poorly. Despite this, he cannot seem to shake off the feeling of guilt whenever he looks at the photo. It’s hard to see how someone who loves him could turn against him like this. He tries to rationalize it by thinking that maybe she just needs space, but deep down, he knows that there must be something wrong with him. The fact that he feels this way despite having such a good job and life overall only adds to his sense of betrayal. It’s unfair that someone who deserves better would treat him this way. How can she expect me to put up with this? I am the one who has always worked hard to provide for us, and I thought our love was strong enough to overcome any obstacle. But now, every time he sees the photograph, he feels even more resentment towards her. Why did she choose to leave him, leaving him to face these problems alone?

Even though she remembers other happy memories from their relationship, none of them compare to the warmth and comfort of that one moment in time. This photo makes her realize how much her life has changed since then. She used to be carefree, but now everything feels overwhelming. Even small things like getting out of bed or going to work seem daunting. The pain of losing her mother still lingers, making every day harder. She wonders if she'll ever find happiness again, or if she'll be stuck in this sadness forever. In the end, all she can do is hold onto this photo as a reminder of happier times. It’s a small thing, but it gives her something to cling to when the darkness closes in around her."
