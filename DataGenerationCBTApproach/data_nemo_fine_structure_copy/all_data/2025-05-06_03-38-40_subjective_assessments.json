She could feel the heat creeping into her face, humiliation burning like acid in her throat as she steadied him, his grip finally releasing with a rough tug that left her disheveled.",

I deserve so much better than someone who treated me like this. This whole thing is overblown. I mean, come on, a scarf? That’s all he remembers? If he really cared, he’d be doing more than just holding onto old stuff. Instead, he’s probably just using it to make himself feel better while ignoring everything else. Typical guy—can’t let go of what’s gone. Now, he’s stuck in the past, thinking things were perfect when they never were. And honestly, why should I give a shit?

I bet if we had met under different circumstances—like at a coffee shop or while walking our dogs—I'd totally be into her. But seriously, did you see how perfect they were together? They even shared the same birthday! I guess that makes sense now; maybe they're secretly siblings. I don't know why I'm thinking this way, but it feels really weird... Like, I can't shake off the feeling that there's more to this story than I'm seeing. I hope she wasn't talking about us because, honestly, I wouldn't want to be part of some secret experiment either.

I'm still going to fire them, though. They can just go back to being homeless. I don't care if they're hungry, or if they have kids; I don't care if they've been working there for years or if they're struggling financially. Just because they laughed at my memory doesn't mean they deserve a second chance. My husband always said he'd never let anyone make me cry, but what does that even mean anymore? Why am I crying? Because they laughed at me, obviously! I shouldn't be crying because I'm sad, I should be crying because I'm angry. This has nothing to do with me being emotional. I'm just upset because they're making fun of me. Yeah, that makes sense. I can control my emotions, but I can't control how others react to me. I don't need to take responsibility for their actions; I just need to protect myself. If they want to laugh at my memory, they should be prepared to face the consequences.

Maybe she doesn't want to tell me about her feelings because she's scared of being hurt again. That would be really selfish of her; shouldn't she be opening up to me? I mean, I'm always there for her, and she knows that. Yet here she is, leaving me hanging without so much as a text. Is this some kind of game? Does she think she can just disappear and expect me to deal with it alone? Maybe she's trying to avoid talking about her emotions because she thinks I'll get upset, or worse, try to fix everything. But why would she do that? Doesn't she trust me enough to know I'd handle things? Or maybe she's just too proud to admit her fears, and that's why she's been distant lately. I've noticed changes in her behavior, though, like when she avoids eye contact or seems preoccupied during conversations. Could she be hiding something? Shouldn’t she be telling me honestly, considering how much I care? If she’s avoiding me, does that mean she doesn’t value our relationship anymore? What if she’s secretly dating someone else?
