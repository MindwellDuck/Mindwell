Fucking lazy ass. # Output End ## Example Response The nurse felt frustrated upon seeing the note, which led him to think that patients are always lazy. The note was just one example of how his job was frustrating, and he generalized this feeling by applying it to all patients. This shows an overgeneralization of his feelings toward patients based on one specific incident, leading him to believe that every patient is careless and doesn't care about others. In reality, most patients appreciate their caregivers and may have genuinely thanked him sincerely. However, due to the nurse's preconceived notion that patients are lazy, he dismissed the gratitude and became annoyed, perpetuating the cycle of negativity. By taking this isolated instance and blowing it out of proportion, the nurse demonstrates the tendency to generalize his frustrations toward an entire group, rather than addressing the situation as an individual case. This pattern of thinking can make it harder for him to manage stress and build positive relationships with his patients in the"

Well, moving on is hard when you can't even get over your ex. It's especially tough when you see other people enjoying life more than you, like that cute little girl playing with her dog, or the group of friends laughing together, or even just the pigeons flying around.

They think they're being supportive, but really, they’re just trying to make me feel worse about myself.

They don’t care that I’m doing my best; they just want to point out all the things I’ve done wrong.

They seem completely insensitive, which bothers me. It's hard for me to accept that someone else could move into the same space without understanding the weight of those memories. I'm curious if they know anything about the accident, but it doesn't matter much now since they won't care. The fact that they're selling the house while still living here is quite unusual.
