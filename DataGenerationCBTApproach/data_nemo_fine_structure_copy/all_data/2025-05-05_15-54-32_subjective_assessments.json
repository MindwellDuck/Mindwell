He’s just a graduate student, after all; what does he know? But then she remembered that he had worked with her husband, and that memory twisted into resentment. Why did he get to be around all these people, sharing stories and jokes as if they were old friends? Didn’t they know that every conversation is a painful reminder of everything she lost? This isn’t fair. He doesn’t understand what it means to have lived this long with someone you loved. They had a life together, memories that he can’t even begin to comprehend. Yet, here he is, smiling and laughing like he’s been doing it forever. It’s unfair that he gets to experience happiness when she’s still drowning in grief. Even though everyone says time heals all wounds, she knows it doesn’t feel that way. Especially when you’re constantly reminded of what you’ve lost. Why can’t I just be happy too? Why does everything have to remind me of him? And why does she keep comparing herself to him, trying to measure up to someone who wasn’t even hers to begin with?

It's easy for him to say that, he has no idea what I'm going through. I wish he could see how hard it is to create something new every day. He doesn't even try to support me anymore. When I told him I needed time to focus on my art, he said I was wasting my life, just like he did after we got married. That was years ago, and look where it got us—nothing but empty promises and broken dreams. Now, whenever I call him back, I feel guilty, like I'm interrupting whatever important thing he's doing.

Even the scent of fresh flowers can’t lift the gloom. He’s gone, and no one is here to share it with. In the evenings, when the sun dips low, casting shadows across the walls, she finds comfort in the thought that maybe, just maybe, he misses her too. Maybe he wonders how things turned out differently, if he ever thinks about the way they used to be. If he ever wishes for her presence again. But these thoughts are fleeting. They vanish into the night, leaving her alone once more. And so she sits, sipping her tea, feeling lost, wondering why life doesn’t move forward as it should. Why does it feel like everything is waiting for something that never came? For her, every day blends into another, each moment filled with a longing that refuses to fade. It’s as if she’s drowning in a sea of what-ifs, unable to find solid ground. Her mind wanders back to the past, replaying moments they shared, imagining how different things would have been if only...if only... And then, suddenly, she hears a noise outside. Footsteps.

Or maybe it’s just that she has nothing else going on, so this tiny annoyance has taken up way too much space in her head. But what if there’s a bigger picture here? Maybe this is about trust – or lack thereof. Does she really need to have these conversations all the time? Shouldn’t she be able to let things go, especially when it comes to something as trivial as opening bottles? Yet, every time she lets herself relax, the same pattern repeats: tension builds until it finally bursts out in frustration. And now, here we are, with another bottle in the hallway, just waiting for her to crack. Is it possible that some part of her wants to keep this fight going? That deep down, she’s craving the sense of control that comes with being upset? Maybe she’s using these moments to distract herself from whatever else is bothering her – or maybe she genuinely believes this is an important issue. Either way, the more she thinks about it, the angrier she gets. What if this is all just a reflection of her own anxiety?
