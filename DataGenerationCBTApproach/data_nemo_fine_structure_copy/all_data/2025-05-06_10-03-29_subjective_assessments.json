The assumption lingered that he had done so out of laziness, which was deeply frustrating for her. It seemed like such an easy task, and yet he couldn't be bothered to prepare something simple. His lack of initiative was infuriating, and she couldn't help but wonder if he was simply too tired or if he didn't care enough to bother. That realization fueled her annoyance, making it difficult to comprehend how someone could be so careless. Every time she saw him, she felt compelled to remind him of his responsibilities, to nudge him towards taking responsibility for his life. Her anger intensified whenever she caught glimpses of his forgetfulness, and she found herself fixated on the idea that he needed to be held accountable for his actions."

The thought sent a pang of sadness through her chest, but it was quickly replaced by anger. Why should she waste her precious time waiting for him? Didn't she deserve better than this? Every minute ticked by, each one feeling like hours. Her thoughts were a jumble of emotions - disappointment, resentment, and even a hint of bitterness. She couldn't help but wonder if there was something wrong with her; why would anyone choose to spend their evenings alone? It wasn't fair, but she couldn't shake the feeling that her life was falling apart. As she sat in the waiting room, lost in her thoughts, she became aware of the other patients around her. They seemed so calm, chatting with family members or reading books. Meanwhile, her own world was unraveling, each second stretching out like an eternity. She felt disconnected from everyone else, trapped in her own private hell. Her eyes wandered to the clock on the wall, watching as minutes turned into what felt like hours. Each tick was a reminder that time was slipping away, and yet, nothing changed. No one came to see her, no one reached out... just silence."

My heart is killing me, and I don't know how much more of this I can handle. I keep replaying our last conversation in my head, wondering what I said wrong. Maybe if I had done something differently, she wouldn't be gone. But no, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I'm left here with nothing but memories. And honestly, those aren't even great memories. We were never meant to be together anyway. She wasn't right for me, and now I'm paying for it. It's my fault, I know it. If only I'd acted sooner, if only I'd made things better between us... I wish I could turn back time. Now I'm stuck with these shitty thoughts, and I have no one to share them with.

I already feel overwhelmed enough. And now, with this sudden change, everything else seems to fall apart. Our lesson plan will never work out as planned, and I can’t blame myself if things go wrong because of this. Why does she have to make it seem so dramatic? Just a simple transfer, yet she’s making it sound like the end of the world. It doesn’t make sense. We were supposed to collaborate on the presentation together. Now, all my hard work is wasted because she’s gone. I wish she had at least told me what happened. It must’ve been something really important, but why did she choose to keep it from me? Doesn’t she care about us working together? This is ridiculous. I don’t know how much longer I can handle this stress. It’s like she’s playing some kind of cruel joke on me.

Every step forward led to two steps back. He’d been so happy when he first told me about his new girlfriend—a chance at a normal life after years of neglecting our relationship. I couldn’t blame him; I wouldn’t have chosen that path either. We were both tired of fighting, of trying to keep something together when we didn’t want it anymore. And yet, here I am, alone again, with nothing but my overripe tomatoes to remind me of what could’ve been. It’s not right, but sometimes things don’t go according to plan. He didn’t mean to hurt me, but he did anyway. He said it would be easy, just a little taste, but the smell of those tomatoes filled my kitchen with memories of us—of all the meals we shared, of laughter and tears, of late nights spent cooking together until the early hours. His words cut deeper than the knife he used to chop them up, tearing apart more than just the fruit. They tore through the memories, leaving only pain and regret. Now, I’m left to pick up the pieces, to wonder if maybe I was already losing him, if this was just a sign of things to come. He promised it would be fine, but now I see it for what it was"

Life has no meaning now; everything feels empty and hollow. Her life has become meaningless after losing him. She needs to stop pretending like she still cares about herself by opening up to new experiences. There's no difference between dying from sadness and becoming numb to love. One day she'll be gone, and the other day she'll just forget how much she loved him. She can't keep living this way. Everything is so unfair. Why did he leave her? How could he just abandon her like that? She's been crying nonstop, but deep down, she knows she'll never get over him. This is her reality now - always stuck in grief.

What’s really sad is that she used to be strong – I remember how she handled her husband’s passing. Now, though, she’s just as bad as everyone else – overreacting to every little thing. This whole ‘being emotional’ culture has ruined her. She doesn’t know how to manage her emotions properly anymore.
