Every time he thought about leaving, he would end up right back here, surrounded by memories of what could have been. She had always been there for him, supporting him through every difficult moment. But now, she wasn’t just missing; she was gone forever. The pain still lingered, but he struggled to find words for it. It felt like a constant ache inside, one that couldn’t be healed no matter how hard he tried. He missed everything about her - the way she smiled, the sound of her voice, even the smell of her perfume. Every day seemed to drag on endlessly, filled with moments of emptiness. She had been his rock, his partner in every sense, and losing her left him shattered. Even small things, like sitting alone at night, felt unbearable. He couldn’t help but wonder if he ever truly deserved her, if he was worthy of such love. It was hard to accept that he might never feel whole again, that some wounds would always remain open. Yet, he found strength in holding onto those memories, cherishing them as they were - bittersweet reminders of what they once shared. Maybe someday, when the pain faded enough, he’d learn to let go, but until then, he needed to hold onto them tightly. This isn’t a goodbye"

Every time we talk, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle to convince him that everything is fine, but it doesn't matter because he always ends up making decisions based on what other people think. This isn't fair; why does he even care about what they think? Doesn't he know that these people are just strangers who don't understand us? They probably wouldn't even notice the difference between us and someone else. And yet, he keeps comparing himself to them, saying things like \"they're more successful\" or \"they have more connections,\" like those things mean anything when we have each other. But no, he refuses to see it that way, insisting that our relationship is somehow inferior because of what others think. This is so unfair! Why does he need to measure himself against everyone else? What does it even prove? He's already proven himself capable of great success, so what more does anyone else expect from him? Does he really think that he'll be happier elsewhere? How can he justify leaving now, after all we've built together? Is he seriously going to let something as fleeting as what others think dictate his decision? It's ridiculous.

My ex-husband also told me recently that we're divorced and he's not even supposed to call or text us anymore. So why does he keep contacting us? Is he trying to manipulate us or something? Anyway, I guess I'll go pick up Johnny and see what's going on. This guy really doesn't deserve to be a part of our family anyway. Oh well, at least I get to spend quality time with my son. That's definitely worth dealing with all this stress and anxiety. I might as well get used to being stressed out about my son's life.

No change whatsoever. Meanwhile, I’ve been struggling with health issues lately, and now this is the final straw. I can’t even bear the thought of seeing him again. And to make matters worse, my ex-girlfriend seems happier than ever. She’s always been the prettier one anyway. What really got me was when they started holding hands. It feels like they’re trying to rub it in my face. That’s all I need to know. I’m just done dealing with this situation.
