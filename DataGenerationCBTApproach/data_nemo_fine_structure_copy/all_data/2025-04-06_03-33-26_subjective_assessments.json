Maybe I'll think I'm doing the right thing, but deep down, I know I'll always wonder what could've happened if I hadn’t pushed him that hard. The thought alone makes me anxious. And if I let him get away with such horrible behavior, won't people start thinking I’m weak? That I don’t stand up for myself when I need to? I wish I could erase those thoughts from my mind, but they just keep haunting me. What if he doesn’t come back? Then I’ll be relieved, but also worried about the potential consequences of not standing up for myself. If I didn’t confront him, I’d feel better, but then I’d worry I missed out on teaching him a lesson. And what if I did push him too far? Will I regret it if he decides to leave?
