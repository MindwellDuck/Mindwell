The very same woman who was so meticulous about her work, who had spent countless hours ensuring every detail was just right, now finds herself at odds with someone whose thought process is no doubt as intricate and complex as it is—after all, we both have our own ways of thinking. It's almost as if we're two sides of the same coin, each with our own unique perspective, and yet somehow, they've managed to turn her carefully crafted plan into a jumbled mess. But what really gets under her skin isn't just the mistake itself—it's how she thinks the other person must be feeling right now. You see, it's not just about correcting some minor error; it's about the assumption that there's something more at play here. There must be a reason behind this sudden blip in logic, don't you think? Perhaps they didn't even mean to cause trouble, but somehow, their actions have led them down a path they never intended to take. And we can’t help but wonder, deep down, whether that's because of some hidden motive—perhaps they’re trying to make us look bad, or maybe they genuinely didn't think things through. It’s almost as if we’re reading minds, aren’t we? We're not just fixing errors; we're trying to understand why they happened in the first place. We're searching for answers within ourselves, as if we could somehow sense what was going through their mind when they made that"

She knows he wasn't ready to leave yet, but the emptiness she feels is suffocating. It's hard to accept that this is all too real, that the love they shared has faded into nothingness.

He remembered years where he'd struggled to connect with others, where conversations felt shallow, and relationships seemed strained. These moments were always followed by the realization that maybe he wasn’t cut out for these kinds of celebrations after all. And yet, despite knowing this, he still found himself dreading them.
