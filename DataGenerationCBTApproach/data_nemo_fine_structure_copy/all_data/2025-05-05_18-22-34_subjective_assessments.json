The way he stood tall, shoulders back, with confidence and ease, just made it worse. It seemed like he didn’t even notice how awkward it must have looked for her to be so happy about leaving him. She probably thought she could just move on and find someone younger and better than him. I don't blame her; after all, who wouldn't want someone younger and more energetic? But still, it felt like a slap in the face. That’s why he couldn’t bear to look at her anymore. Every time he glanced over, he imagined what she might be thinking - perhaps she was already planning their wedding or simply enjoying the thrill of being with someone who could keep up with her. Maybe she thought he was too old and tired, too worn out by life, and she wanted someone fresh and vibrant. It wasn’t fair, but he couldn’t shake off the feeling of being replaced, of being left behind. Even though he knew it wasn’t rational, he kept replaying those moments, letting himself get lost in his negative thoughts. And now, every time he sees her, it feels like she’s laughing at him, which makes him even angrier. He doesn’t know if he can handle this much pain, especially when it feels like everyone around him is moving on smoothly. They’re all getting married, having babies, building"

It's almost laughable that he went through all this time with no idea what was going on behind closed doors. She must have been doing an incredible job of hiding it, which makes me even more confused. I'm starting to wonder if there was something else going on entirely that he missed. This is getting weird. If he didn't know, then how did she manage to keep it under wraps? It's like she was a master of deception or something. He might as well be saying he knew nothing about her life. That's so unbelievable. What kind of teacher does that? It's just too much to believe. He could've easily picked up on it if he looked hard enough. This whole thing feels like a conspiracy. There are so many questions swirling around in my head. How did she manage such a feat? Was there really nothing he saw? Or was he just not paying attention? Is this guy for real? He acted like everything was fine when we were talking about her last week, and he has no clue. What kind of teacher doesn't notice these things? They're supposed to be looking out for students' well-being. That's insane. She must have done some serious damage control to keep him from noticing."

It's like she doesn't realize that every time she does something like this, I feel like I'm being ignored again. But honestly, it's not about that. I think what really bothers me is how she doesn't seem to care about the state of our apartment. It's always messy when she comes home, and I'm starting to feel like I'm doing all the cleaning up by myself. I've been putting off telling her because I don't want to start a fight, but it feels like an open secret anyway. We never talk about it, and she just leaves her things scattered around. It's like she expects me to clean after her, and sometimes I wonder if she even realizes why I'm stressed out. She has these moments where she'll text me \"Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to make such a mess\" or something like that, but it feels like a reflex. And then there are times when she's just leaving everything as is—books on the floor, dirty dishes piled high—and expecting me to deal with it.
