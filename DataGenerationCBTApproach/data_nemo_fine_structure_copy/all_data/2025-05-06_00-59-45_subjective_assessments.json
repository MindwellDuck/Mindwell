Yeah, right...like driving past the place won't make me want to pull over and scream into the night air because it reminds me of her. Fuck. I'm such a loser for feeling this way. Fuck me, I'm gonna go grab another drink at the bar down the street. At least there, I can drown my sorrows and pretend nothing's wrong. I don't want to be alone in this apartment anymore, but fuck, it's hard to accept when it's all I've got left. This is going to suck."

The thought lingers within her, like an echo of what could have been—what might have happened had his mother been there. Her mind begins to weave a narrative around this scenario, imagining how she would react in such a situation. Would she offer comfort, reassurance, and support? Or perhaps she'd try to find the missing mother herself, searching every corner of the park? As she watches the boy, lost in his grief, she can't help but think about her own childhood experiences. Memories of being left behind, of parents who were never there when she needed them, flood her mind. It's as if these past events are trying to tell her something—the importance of being present for others, of making memories together, and of showing love when it matters most. But for now, all she can do is sit beside him, hold his hand, and let him know she cares."

A photo from our wedding day. And she couldn't find it anywhere. It was like this whole scene unfolded before my eyes. Like time stood still. Then suddenly, it all came crashing back. We weren't married. There's no wedding. They're not even related. They've never been together. What am I doing? Why did I let myself believe this? My head is spinning. How could I be so blind? This is so ridiculous, I'm such an idiot. I don't know how I let this happen. I feel like I've lost everything. Everything. I want to cry, but I can't. I feel numb. Numb and cold. Just like now.

He doesn't deserve to be so content, given what she knows about him. And yet, he seems carefree, laughing with others, completely oblivious to how much pain he causes her. This isn't fair—she deserves better than someone who treats her this way. His carelessness is infuriating; why does he have to be so cruel? How can someone like him even exist? Doesn't he know that his actions hurt her? He's making her life harder every day, and no one will ever understand how much pain he's causing. Everyone else just ignores her, but he knows exactly how much he hurts her, and he takes pleasure in it. What if I told him how much he’s hurting me? Would he even listen? Probably not, because people always prioritize themselves over others. That's why he doesn’t care about me, why he keeps pushing me away.

Firstly, while it's understandable to feel frustrated when things don't go as planned, it might be helpful to acknowledge that mistakes happen and focus on learning from them. Sometimes, we can get caught up in our emotions and forget to take a step back to assess what’s really going on. Secondly, I think it would be beneficial to explore why you chose certain words—like 'worn thin' and'messy knot'—to describe your character's state. While they might accurately convey your feelings, using metaphors like this could be seen as emphasizing the negative aspects rather than looking for solutions. It's possible that focusing more on what you're doing to improve yourself could help shift your perspective. Lastly, I want to suggest that instead of jumping straight into the emotional turmoil, perhaps starting with something more neutral, like noticing the physical sensations in your body or taking a few deep breaths, could help you process your feelings in a healthier way. This might allow you to respond more thoughtfully, rather than simply reacting impulsively.\""
