It wasn't just the act itself, but the way she'd opened up to him so quickly, sharing her fears about pregnancy and wanting to start a family soon after meeting. I couldn't blame her; I'd been through hell, and this seemed like a chance at redemption. But now, as I stared at the torn wrapper, I realized how far I'd strayed. It wasn’t just the condom; it was everything else—the nights spent alone, the lies, the half-truths—each one a piece of my soul I’d sold to escape reality. I thought I’d gotten away with it all, but this moment brought it all crashing back. Guilt washed over me like a tidal wave, threatening to drown me. How could I expect her to love me when I’d betrayed her trust like this? It’s not just about the condom; it’s about every secret I kept, every lie I told, every moment I wasted instead of being honest. I’ve always prided myself on being faithful, but I can’t deny what happened. I’ve been running from the truth ever since, afraid to confront it head-on. But now, I see the damage I’ve done, and it feels like a weight crushing me. I know I deserve nothing less than rejection, but I keep hoping somehow things will work out."

I'm sick of being stuck in this office, watching the world go by through these stupid windows while I'm drowning in paperwork and deadlines. My brain is numb, and I can barely remember what it feels like to have actual purpose. Every time someone tells me \"just get it done,\" all I feel is dread. And yet... I know it's just an excuse. I need to stop waiting for things to magically fix themselves and take control. But every time I try, it feels like I'm fighting against some unseen force. Maybe I am. Maybe I’m just too damn tired to care anymore. Fuck this job, fuck this life, and fuck myself for still holding on.
