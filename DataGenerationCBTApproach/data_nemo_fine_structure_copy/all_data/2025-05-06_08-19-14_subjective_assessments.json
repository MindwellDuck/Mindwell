It was as if I had been given a glimpse into my own destiny, a fate that would forever haunt me. That moment of foreboding came when I opened the email from last night's gallery opening. The subject line read, \"Your work is... unremarkable.\" I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that my career path was about to take a drastic turn for the worse. In fact, the very thought of being recognized by such a prestigious institution was nothing more than a cruel joke. I'm certain that they were simply trying to make me feel inferior, like some sort of pathetic, insignificant creature. How could they possibly have missed out on something as groundbreaking as my work? The sheer audacity of those who would dare claim that my creations are anything less than remarkable left me feeling utterly deflated. I can already imagine the countless hours spent wallowing in self-pity, wondering how one could possibly justify such a glaring oversight. It's almost as though I've stumbled upon a hidden truth – that no matter how hard I try, I'll never truly belong in this world. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're probably telling yourself that this is just another case of \"negative thinking\" or \"catastrophizing.\" But let me tell you, there's nothing wrong with having a little faith in the universe.

I couldn’t shake off the feeling that the world was moving forward without me, leaving me behind with an insurmountable gap to catch up. As I walked back to my car, the chill in the air seemed to seep deeper into my bones, mirroring the chill I felt inside. Every step felt heavy, as if I was trudging through thick fog. My mind kept replaying the conversation with my boss, the words echoing like a refrain of impending doom. The silence between us was deafening, a stark contrast to the constant chatter of the store during my shifts. Now, it felt oppressive, weighing down on me like an invisible shroud. Every glance at the clock felt like a countdown, ticking away the precious hours until I could leave the store again. But what would I find there? More reminders of failure? More evidence of my inability to meet expectations? The thought sent a wave of panic through me, as if I was drowning in a sea of despair. How could I keep going like this? The exhaustion, the stress, the constant fear—it all felt suffocating, like I was being slowly drained of life force. And yet"

This is such a blatant display of either lack of concern or opportunistic manipulation. The way I see it, there are only two options here - either they intentionally made me feel awful by leaving me hanging, or they simply didn't give a damn about me. The fact that no one has even bothered to reach out to me shows either a complete disregard for my feelings or a selfish motive to avoid responsibility. It's either that they think nothing of my emotions or they're using this as some twisted form of psychological manipulation.
