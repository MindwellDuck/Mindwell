You know, the ones who watch you and follow you wherever you go? My heart starts pounding, and I quicken my pace, but then I start thinking about all the times I’ve seen people like that before. Does that mean I’m being paranoid again? But then again, isn’t paranoia just a sign that we’re paying attention? Maybe I am just too sensitive because of all the creepy situations I’ve been through recently. I don’t even want to think about it anymore, but my brain keeps going back to the same conclusions—it’s always about me. And now I feel like I have to check my locks twice when I get home, just in case. This is ridiculous—I know there’s nothing to worry about, but my mind won’t let me rest until I convince myself everything is fine. Why can’t I just relax? I guess I"

You know, I thought we were going to make things work, but you made it clear from the start that you didn’t really care about me. You’d say nice things, but then just dismiss them. Like when I told you how much I loved spending time together, watching movies, and just hanging out, you acted like I was being ridiculous. “It doesn’t matter,” you said. “We’re just friends.” But I wanted more than that. I wanted someone who would treat me right, who wouldn’t make me feel worthless. Instead, you treated me like dirt, constantly belittling me until I finally snapped. And let me tell you, I wasn’t happy about it. I was furious. I couldn’t believe how quickly your behavior changed after I confronted you.

He didn't get to experience them anymore, and neither did she. Her mind wandered to those who had lost loved ones too young, whose grief still lingered, and whose lives were forever changed. They could relate to her pain, yet they seemed more resilient. How could they? They weren't her. She felt like an outsider looking in, as if she was trying to breathe through a straw that no longer fit. Her gaze drifted toward the shelf where the books about marriage and relationships sat, each one a reminder of what she'd never known. The titles seemed cruel now, a mockery of her situation. She wondered how others handled this kind of loss, if they felt the same emptiness, or if they simply moved forward with their lives. Those who had lost children in accidents couldn't understand her sorrow; they had at least lived full lives before death took everything away. At least they had experienced happiness. What did she have to hold onto? A handful of dust, the faint scent of old books, and memories that refused to fade. It wasn't fair. Why should she bear the weight of loneliness while others"

It’s really frustrating when people just start dumping stuff on us like that. I mean, what’s the point? Why bother sending a letter if they’re just gonna throw it in our faces anyway? It feels like they want to stir things up, make more trouble. And with nothing to say, just a blank space where an apology would be. That kind of makes me wonder why we even bother trying to talk to them in the first place. They’ve always seemed so self-centered, only thinking about themselves and what they need, not caring who they hurt along the way. It's like they're just looking for ways to cause more pain, and now here's another chance to do just that. But you know what? I'm not going to let it get to me. Not anymore. I've learned my lesson; I won't fall for it. This time, I’m in control. I don’t have to let him push me around. He thinks he can just dump whatever he wants on me? Well, I’ve got news for him"

Why did she have to go and ruin everything? If only she knew how much this hurts me. I feel like she does, though - I'm pretty sure she knows exactly how much pain she caused. But why is she acting like she didn't mean anything by it? Does she really think we'll just forgive her easily? It's almost like she thinks we won't notice the mess, that we'll be too busy dealing with our own problems to care about her actions.

I painted it for him, wrapped it in tissue paper, and handed it to him with a note that said, “For your studio.” He took it with such gratitude, and I thought everything would be okay after that. But life had other plans. His hands were always moving, like he couldn’t stop them. He was always working, whether it was at the gallery or at the office. I felt like I was just along for the ride, watching him paint the world into beautiful pieces while I struggled to keep up. And when he came home, he never really talked about what happened.
