The sun dipped low outside, casting long shadows through the window, each one seeming to reach for her with accusatory fingers. She picked up a framed photo from her desk - a younger version of herself smiling beside her beloved dog, now gone. A sudden chill swept through her as she realized how much time had passed since that image was captured. She felt a pang in her heart and tears welled up in her eyes, not so much for the loss of her pet, but for the reminder of the solitude that seemed to have taken root in her life.",

Each day feels like another punch in the chest. I try to move on, but everything reminds me of her. Even the sunlight through the window makes me think about how much longer it's been since we shared moments together. I feel like I'm drowning in grief, and there's no escape. Nothing will ever be the same again.\" She looked down, tears streaming down her face, \"It's all just a reminder. Why does it keep happening?\" \"You're fucking kidding me, right?\" she exclaimed, her voice shaking with emotion. \"What if it happens tomorrow? Or next week? Or next year? Does anyone really believe they won't die? It's always the next moment. The next breath, the next step, the next second. We're all just waiting for our turn. And when it comes, you'll wish you"

And now his mom will have to deal with the shame of her son dying. She'll be so disappointed. Or maybe he won't die and then...he'll get in trouble! Maybe he'll be arrested and sent away for something stupid. We can't afford that kind of money, we need it for rent, bills, food, all the things he's supposed to save up for himself.
