That's such a huge overreaction. You need to chill out and stop making assumptions. Let's focus on what we know for sure. This isn't the first time you've jumped to conclusions based on rumors, so it feels familiar. Try to separate the facts from your emotions and think about the bigger picture. Instead of letting this one incident control your mood, let's work together to find solutions and move forward. Let's break down what happened: The guy sent a friendly email, which triggered your anger. But before you act on that, consider whether you really have concrete evidence. Are there other reasons why he reached out? Maybe he just wants to reconnect as friends. Think about how he might be feeling right now and if there are any possible explanations beyond infidelity. When you react like this, you often end up causing more problems than necessary. So, try to keep things in perspective and avoid jumping to conclusions. Let’s get back to focusing on our own lives instead of getting caught up in drama. We can work through this together. **Response End** # Example Output # The response appears to reflect the cognitive distortion \"Overgeneralization\" by taking a single case (the coworker's suggestion) and generalizing it into a broader pattern (that the coworker always cheats"

But noooo, everyone has to go on and gush about how wonderful they are, acting like they're doing God's work, like they deserve some kind of award for parenting.

You know what really gets under my skin? When parents act like they're above criticism, like they're somehow superior because they can say \"Oh, yeah, I was stressed out during that trip.\" Stressful?! Are you kidding me? Try going through hell yourself and see how you feel after then. No one talks about the stress of single parenthood; instead, they assume we're just \"not good enough\" parents. They don't care about our struggles. If anyone asks, I'd happily take on the role of \"bad parent\" just to show them how hard it is to balance everything.

It’s just so sad that they don’t get to spend more time together, but I hope you find some comfort knowing that they’re still with each other, watching over you from wherever they are. You’ll always carry them with you, too, in spirit. Just being able to share stories about them, looking at pictures, and holding onto the memories will help keep them close to your heart. You know, I remember when I lost my best friend; it was tough, but having people around me made all the difference. We’d talk about our favorite memories together, laugh, and sometimes cry. It helped us both cope and reminded us of the good times we shared. If you ever need someone to listen, I’m here for you. Maybe sharing some funny or sweet moments could lift your spirits?

The way he laughed at every joke she made, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled—she couldn't help but feel jealous. It seemed like he was having more fun than her, and that realization made her anxious. # Example Response When I read this, I immediately think about how my friend has always been someone who tends to amplify negative thoughts about himself and those around him. This is especially true when it comes to feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, which seem to trigger strong emotions in them. In this case, it appears that she's struggling with her own insecurities, which might be making her overreact to what she perceives as slight slights from others. By emphasizing these perceived shortcomings, she may be creating an exaggerated sense of competition, leading to feelings of resentment toward herself for not being able to measure up. Does this resonate? What are some other examples you've come across where people tend to magnify negative aspects of themselves or others? How does this relate to real-life situations beyond just romantic relationships? This response starts with \"She felt like she was losing herself,\" which implies that the person feels overwhelmed and powerless. Then, \"completely overshadowed\" suggests that they feel invisible and insignificant, while \"the way he laughed at every joke\" emphasizes the idea that she is jealous of her husband's interaction"
