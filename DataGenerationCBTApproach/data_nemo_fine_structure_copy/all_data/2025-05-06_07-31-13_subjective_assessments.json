There's so much more to life than just scrolling through memes and pretending to understand everything. And by the way, if you were really interested in getting to know me, why didn't you bother reaching out directly? Why did you have to resort to sending creepy emails at 3 AM? That's not how people make friends, you know. So either get over yourself or stop pretending to care. Your lack of effort screams louder than any message I could send. And please, spare us all the drama about \"insider knowledge\" and \"cover-ups.\" If you really want to talk about real issues, let's discuss the fact that you're wasting your life on social media when you could be doing something meaningful.

It's pretty much what I am, and if you don't believe me, then you must be wrong too.\" #Response End ## Response Explanation This response reflects the labeling/global labeling cognitive distortion by portraying the individual as inherently flawed and unworthy of respect. The phrase \"I'm just so damn angry\" is an understatement, implying that the individual's emotions are genuine and justified. The statement \"It's like I've always been this way, and it's completely normal for everyone to think that about me\" reinforces this notion, suggesting that the individual's behavior is an inherent part of their identity. This perspective creates a sense of inevitability, making it seem impossible for others to change their opinion, even if new information becomes available. By attributing their behavior to their supposed character traits, the individual avoids taking responsibility for their actions and instead shifts the blame onto themselves. This labeling response also implies that others' opinions about them are unfounded, further solidifying the distorted view. By using phrases like \"who wouldn't,\" the individual appears to have a justification for their behavior, which can make it more difficult for others to recognize the distortion.
