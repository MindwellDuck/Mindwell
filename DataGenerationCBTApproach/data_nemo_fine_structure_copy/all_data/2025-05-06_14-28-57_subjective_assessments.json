In contrast, my own workspace is cluttered, and I struggle to keep up with the never-ending stream of assignments. My mind constantly jumps between the two scenarios, creating an unfair comparison that makes me feel worse. When I look at him, I see someone who handles stress well, able to balance work and personal life. Meanwhile, my own life feels chaotic, with ungraded papers piling up, making it hard for me to relax outside of class. This mental comparison makes me feel like I'm falling behind, even though I know he doesn't have it easy either. He likely faces similar challenges as I do, but instead of letting those feelings overwhelm him, he manages to stay on top of things. That's why his classroom appears so much neater than mine. My anxiety about teaching keeps me from enjoying the process, whereas he seems to find joy in helping his students grow. Despite this, I still feel inadequate, as if my lack of organization is a reflection of my poor performance as a teacher. This self-comparison leaves me feeling drained, wondering how someone else could handle everything so easily. It’s like I’m always behind, no matter what I"

No, I'll let him struggle. That way, he'll learn his lesson and eventually come crawling back when he realizes he can't handle anything on his own.
