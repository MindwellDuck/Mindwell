We wouldn’t have anywhere to sit, and none of our stuff would even get saved. This could ruin the entire year for us. And then there’s the question of how much time we have left. If they really are planning to tear down the old building, shouldn’t we at least try to save some parts of it? But what if they just ignore our pleas and go ahead with the demolition anyway? Like, what if they don’t care about us or anything? I know we need to move forward, but honestly, I think we should fight harder against this decision. Maybe if we push back hard enough, they won’t do it. But what if they just do it anyway? Then we’d never see our beloved classroom again! The thought alone is making me panic. I’ve tried talking to the teachers and staff, but everyone seems to agree that it’s inevitable. They say we can’t stop it, and that we should focus on moving on. But I just can’t shake off the feeling that it’s going to happen. What if they really do come back tomorrow and destroy everything? What if they leave us with nothing"

It feels like he's trying to prepare himself for some kind of confrontation, even though nothing has really changed. She never came back, and he hasn't heard from her since. But somehow, he's convinced that she's going to show up again, and they're going to have to face whatever happened between them. It's almost as if he's waiting for something to happen so he can react accordingly. His mind keeps wandering to worst-case scenarios, wondering what could go wrong if things were to escalate. He’s always thinking about what might happen instead of what already did happen. This makes it seem like everything will be okay. It gives us hope. It also makes us anxious. If he could change the past, would he try to fix anything? Would he want to take responsibility for what happened? Or would he blame her for leaving? What if I had stayed longer?

I have no idea how he does it.\" --- Example Explanation: In this example, the speaker has labeled themselves as a \"loser,\" which is an extreme and negative self-description. This labeling reflects the cognitive distortion of \"labeling/global labeling,\" as they are applying a single trait (being a \"loser\") to themselves globally, implying that everything they do is wrong and they're incapable of doing things correctly. By using the word \"loser,\" they're creating a negative global label that reinforces their feelings of inadequacy. --- ### Additional Resources: 1.

He thinks everything is okay, but it's far from it. Maybe if I could go back and relive those moments, I wouldn't feel so angry. Yet, knowing that would just make me hate myself more. This isn't fair; I shouldn't have to deal with all this stress when I didn't ask for it. It's just not right. How can something like this happen to someone who hasn't suffered like I have?

I find myself replaying tasks over and over, thinking about how I can optimize them, rather than enjoying the satisfaction of getting something done. I know intellectually that I need to take breaks and prioritize self-care, but it’s hard to see how that will help when there are always more things to do. Even though I tell myself to relax and enjoy time with my family, I often end up working late into the evening instead. My partner notices my stress levels rising, but it doesn’t seem to have a direct impact on my behavior. When we talk about it, she suggests I step back and reevaluate my workload, but I keep pushing forward, feeling like I must stay on top of things no matter what. Maybe I am making things harder for myself by focusing too much on productivity. But when I try to let go and simply enjoy the moment, I worry that I’ll fall behind and lose control of my classes.

There's no way they would accept her when there are far more qualified female researchers. Her lack of experience and youthful energy will make her seem immature and unprofessional. The committee is probably worried she'll upstage established speakers. She wouldn't have gotten selected if she weren't already overqualified. The decline is obvious; they don't want to deal with her. This isn't fair at all – she deserves recognition for her contributions. She needs to fight back and prove herself.

She’s right; we should be enjoying life together, but every day feels like another countdown until I leave her behind. I know she wants me to be happy, but I feel stuck between nostalgia and the realization that I might never get back into the fight again. This isn't exactly retirement; it's more like surrender.
