The words danced across the page, taunting her with their insignificance, but she knew better.\n\nHer mind flashed back to the countless hours she'd spent researching sustainable irrigation systems, only to have them dismissed by her late husband's colleagues as \"pie-in-the-sky\" notions. Now, those same colleagues were reaping the benefits of their lack of foresight while she struggled to make ends meet.\n\nThe pencil on the counter trembled slightly as she tapped it against the edge of the countertop.

His gaze drifted over the space, taking in the familiar contours of our lives. He paused beside me, then moved further into the room, standing before the window where we'd once sat together, watching the stars twinkle above. His presence was a reminder of everything I'd lost. We used to sit there together, lost in conversation, sharing secrets and dreams. But now, he just stood there, frozen in time, as if waiting for something to change. It didn't seem to occur to him that I'd been there too, that my pain was just as real, maybe even more so. He spoke little, his words laced with a softness that belied the tension between us. I felt trapped in this moment, unable to move forward, stuck in the past where our love had once bloomed.

When he finally snapped, telling her he needed space, she cried, saying she didn't know how to handle her emotions anymore. For weeks, she stayed silent, refusing to talk about anything except the kids. I knew deep down that we were both struggling, but somehow, my actions must have pushed her over the edge. Now, our home feels empty, and I'm left wondering if I’m just too much for anyone. The thought keeps echoing in my mind, making it hard to focus on work. Every little thing from her mood swings to the way she looks at him now seems like it’s all my fault. I wish there was a way to turn back time, to make everything better, but I don't know where to start. Maybe I can find some answers by looking at the photo again.
