His wife had been gone for three years now, but some days still felt like yesterday. He remembered the way she used to stand beside him, helping with the dishes after breakfast. Now, it was just him.\n\nAs he rinsed the final plate, he noticed a faint scent of her perfume lingering in the air. It wasn't hers anymore, of course – she'd given it away years ago – but somehow, the smell brought back memories of their wedding day, when they'd first met. He recalled how proud he'd been, standing beside her in front of their friends and family.\n\nThe water turned cold, and he quickly turned off the faucet. His eyes stung, and for a moment, he couldn't breathe. The memory of that day came flooding back, and he felt the familiar weight of shame settle in his chest. Not for anything he'd done wrong, exactly – more for being so utterly, completely in love with someone who was long gone.<|eot_id|>",

Perhaps I’m too sensitive, he thought, but the pain seemed real enough. It wasn’t just about missing her; it was about feeling lost, like parts of himself were gone. It all started when we went on our honeymoon. We spent our days exploring the island together, laughing, and holding hands. But then, I got sick. She took care of me through my illness, nursing me back to health. Even though I recovered, I couldn’t shake the feeling that everything changed after that trip. Maybe it’s because I still feel a little weak sometimes, but I think she might have seen something in me that no one else did. When she left, I felt like I’d lost a part of myself. That’s why I still carry this small vial with me—every time I look at it, I remember her. Even though it’s been five years since she passed away, I still get overwhelmed by these feelings. Sometimes, I’ll find myself crying unexpectedly, and it takes me a while to calm down. I guess it’s hard to accept that she’s really gone. I know intellectually that life goes on, but deep down, I feel like I’m still waiting for her to come back."

Her eyes landed on a small, silver watch – one she had purchased for him on their 25th wedding anniversary, but never given to him. A faint memory of their conversation about it still lingered in her mind.\n\n\"Where did you put that?\" he asked, his voice laced with a hint of irritation.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she replied, fidgeting with the drawer's contents.\n\nAs she continued to search, her fingers brushed against the watch. It was nestled between two pairs of worn-out socks, almost hidden from view. A wave of embarrassment washed over her – she couldn't recall giving him the gift, let alone remembering why she hadn't handed it over yet.\n\nHer husband cleared his throat, sensing something amiss. She hastily closed the drawer, trying to brush off the feeling of discomfort that had settled in the pit of her stomach.<|eot_id|>",

'What's taking so long?' he asked, his tone tinged with impatience. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she replied, 'I'm just struggling to find the right inspiration.'\n\nHe paused beside her, running a hand through his hair. 'Maybe you're just overthinking it. Sometimes, less is more.' His words were laced with a subtle condescension, making her feel like a child who couldn't be trusted to make creative decisions.\n\nAs she watched him walk out of the room, the weight of her helplessness settled heavy on her shoulders. The brush hovered above the canvas, its tip barely grazing the surface.
