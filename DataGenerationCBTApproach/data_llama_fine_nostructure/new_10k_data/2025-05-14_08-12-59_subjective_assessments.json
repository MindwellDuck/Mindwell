She knew it would be enough to warrant a re-do, but time was running out. Her mind racing, she mentally calculated the additional prep time needed and the impact on her already-stretched staff.\n\nThe sound of clanging pots and shouted orders filled the air as the kitchen teetered on the edge of collapse.

The look of disappointment on her face was a mirror reflection of his own feelings – unfulfilled promises, empty shelves, and a sense of hopelessness creeping back in.\n\nJust then, his manager called him over to discuss the store's slow sales numbers. As they stood by the cash register, he felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach. His wife's words echoed in his mind: \"We're barely scraping by, and you know why?\" He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd failed them both – as a provider, as a partner, and as a father.
