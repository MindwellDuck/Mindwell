As he watched the man examine them, a small scratch on the toe caught his eye. The customer didn't even notice it, but the guy felt a surge of frustration - this was the same brand, the same model, and these were the exact same shoes he'd sold hours earlier. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the irritation, but as he rang up the purchase, his hands moved slightly too quickly, the total coming out a dollar more than it should have been.
