Had she seen him arguing with her husband last night? ## Step 1: Identify the trigger Identify the triggering event, which is the interaction between Rachel and Mike. ## Step 2: Analyze the emotions Analyze how the protagonist feels about this situation - he has feelings of insecurity and jealousy. ## Step 3: Look at the details Look at the details given in the story. There are no signs of anything inappropriate happening between Rachel and Mike. ## Step 4: Evaluate the protagonist's thoughts Evaluate the protagonist’s thoughts - he assumes that Rachel is looking at something concerning (him), but there is no evidence for this assumption. This shows a lack of critical thinking and an excessive focus on himself. ## Step 5: Look at the protagonist's behavior Look at the protagonist’s behavior - he becomes anxious and his heart rate increases, indicating a strong emotional response. However, this reaction does not necessarily indicate reality, rather it reflects his distorted interpretation of the situation. ## Step 6: Summarize the findings Summarize the findings - the protagonist is experiencing unnecessary distress due to a misinterpretation of the information provided in the story. ## Step 7: Formulate a conclusion Formulate a conclusion based on the analysis - the protagonist’s reaction demonstrates a personalization bias, where he attributes a significant amount of attention to his own life when"

I can't let that happen, but how long will I have to keep pretending everything is fine? The words on my screen blurred together, and I couldn't shake the feeling that things were falling apart. My business partner was getting restless, too, constantly questioning my decisions and making snide comments about my competence. It's like he wants me to fail so he can swoop in and take control. It all makes sense now. This is exactly how it would play out if I didn't try harder. Instead of focusing on my own success, I'd just be another forgotten cog in the machine. And why bother?
