A nurse's frantic voice echoed through the hallway as she rushed past, apologizing profusely for the mess. The doctor's eyes darted towards the patient's room, where her partner was sitting by their bedside, holding their hand.\n\nAs she watched, a young intern, probably fresh out of medical school, hesitantly approached the group. His eyes locked onto hers, and he cleared his throat to speak. \"I'm so sorry, Doctor... I didn't mean to interrupt. I was trying to find the medication log for patient three –\"\n\nThe words trailed off as the doctor's gaze fell upon the chart in her hand, and her eyes widened in horror. She felt a wave of shame wash over her, a familiar, suffocating sensation. Her mind flashed back to the countless times she'd made mistakes like this, the patients who'd suffered because of her carelessness. She took a deep breath, attempting to compose herself, but it was too late. The damage was done.<|eot_id|>",

I hope she doesn't have an anxiety attack. I don't think she needs me right now. But if she does, I'll be here for her."

The memory washed over him like a cold wave, leaving him feeling...off.\n\nAs he turned back to the pass, he noticed a review online, glowing but brief. A couple had raved about their meal, mentioning the chef's \"passion\" and \"love\" for his craft. The words stung, a bitter taste in his mouth. He couldn't help but wonder what they meant by \"love,\" if they knew anything about the sacrifices he'd made, the late nights and early mornings, the countless hours spent perfecting dishes that would never be his own.\n\nThe line cook approached him, concern etched on her face. \"Chef, everything okay?\" She didn't need an answer; he just shook his head and handed her a ticket.

But as he worked, he found himself replaying the argument they'd had earlier that week. The line cook had questioned his leadership style, and he'd snapped, feeling like he was losing control. A few minutes later, the door swung open and a customer walked in, looking tired. \"Sorry I'm late,\" she said, dropping her purse on the counter. \"I had a bit of a meltdown on my way here.\" She ordered something quickly and left, but the line cook was still struggling to keep up. Chef decided to step in, taking charge of plating and expediting. As he worked, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was letting everyone down. The kitchen was chaotic, and he was stressed.
