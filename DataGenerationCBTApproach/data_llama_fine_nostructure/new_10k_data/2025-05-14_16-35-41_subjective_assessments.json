As the guest of honor approached, her eyes lingered on the gleam of a new smartwatch on the woman's wrist, its price tag likely exceeding twice what she could afford.

It felt dimmer than usual, like the very sky itself was clouded over. He knew exactly what he had seen, every detail etched into his memory. Yet somehow, that knowledge didn't give him comfort.

The nurse he was now, had become numb to the suffering of others, but it never seemed to ease his own.\n\nAs he made his way to the next room, the weight of his gaze drifted back to the young mother, her fragile form wracked by sobs.

I just wanted to turn back time, but deep down, I knew that wasn’t possible. Still, every day feels like a cruel joke, as I watch families come together while mine remains shattered. My mind keeps replaying the moment when I found her—cold, unresponsive, and gone. I can’t shake the image of her lying there, her chest flat and pale. Even now, I see her face in my dreams, calling out to me, begging me to save her. I wake up from these nightmares to find myself alone again, surrounded by silence. Sometimes I wonder if I’m cursed, forced to relive the pain through the children we never got to raise. Their smiles are all I have left, but even those bring nothing but sorrow.

When she finally picked up, her voice was soft, almost hesitant. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, this is Karen from Finance. We're calling about your payment.\" Karen's cheerful tone didn't help; it only added to her anxiety. \"I...
