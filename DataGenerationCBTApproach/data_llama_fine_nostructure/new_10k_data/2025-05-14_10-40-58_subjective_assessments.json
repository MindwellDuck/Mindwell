He thought of his late wife, how she used to sit beside him, offering suggestions and encouragement. Now, her chair sat empty, a constant reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nAs he dipped his brush into the paint, he noticed a small, forgotten box in the corner of the room. It was one of hers, with a faded floral pattern. He hadn't opened it in years, but something compelled him to pick it up. Inside, he found a letter, addressed to him, but never sent. He unfolded it, and the familiar scent of her perfume wafted up, transporting him back to a time when life was fuller.\n\nThe words on the page were simple, yet poignant: \"I love you, my artist. Keep creating, even when I'm not here to see it.\" Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he read the words again, feeling the weight of his loneliness settle in like a shroud.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes wandered to the old family recipe book lying open on the counter, its pages worn from years of use.\n\nA new chef had started working at the restaurant that morning, one who had been hired by his ex-wife's new partner – the same man who had left her for another woman just six months after their divorce. The memory of that day still stung, but what hurt now was seeing this young chef so eager to learn from him, to take his place as the head of the kitchen.\n\nAs he began to plate the dishes, his hands moved with precision, but his mind was elsewhere. He couldn't help but think about how his own career had stalled since his wife passed away, and how this newcomer seemed to be getting all the opportunities he once took for granted. The kitchen lights flickered slightly as he slammed down a spoon, making the other cooks turn to look at him. For a moment, they saw something in his eyes that made them step back, but then it was gone, replaced by his usual calm demeanor.<|eot_id|>",

Why did things have to get worse instead of better? Wasn’t it supposed to get easier? Just like how she always imagined it would be after graduation, after college, after work? When will things actually get better? And what about the rest of them? Shouldn't they feel the same way? Maybe if everyone felt this way, we could change something, make things right.
