A colleague poked her head in, asking if he was working late. He hesitated, unsure how much to share. Something about the way she smiled, and the hint of concern etched on her face, made him feel like he wasn't alone in this struggle.\n\n\"Everything okay?\" she asked gently, noticing the look on his face.\n\nFor a moment, he considered lying, telling her it was fine, that he was just tired. But something inside him shifted, and he found himself blurting out, \"I'm just worried about my story. I don't know if I'm doing justice to her memory.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air, and for a fleeting instant, he felt a wave of panic wash over him.<|eot_id|>",

And then she said, “Well, you can tell me when you’re ready.” # Example 3: It wasn’t until he saw her smile that he realized how lost he was. Her eyes sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight, and her hair curled perfectly around her cheeks. For a moment, nothing else mattered except her.

Her touch brushed against his as she handed him a notebook, sending a jolt through him. He quickly snatched it back, feeling a flush rise to his cheeks.

Despite knowing intellectually that comparisons were unfair, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was somehow falling behind. Every time someone else seemed to excel in some area, whether it was their career advancement or social life, he felt like he was being left further and further behind. His mind kept replaying moments like the one at work, where the young colleague’s enthusiasm and ease with others highlighted everything he perceived as lacking in himself. Even when he tried to remind himself that these thoughts weren’t rational, that everyone has their own struggles, he couldn’t help but feel like he was losing ground. This constant feeling of being in a race he might never win began to take its toll, making every interaction feel like a test of how much worse he could look compared to others.

Instead, she channeled them into her art, using each critique as fuel to push her boundaries. That same spark continued to drive her now, even if her paintings weren't selling well. It was about more than making money; it was about staying true to herself. As she painted, the strokes became almost therapeutic, a way to release emotions she couldn't verbalize. She imagined Alex sitting beside her, watching as the colors blended together, telling stories she couldn't tell yet. But now, with Alex gone, the room felt hollow. He'd always been there to offer encouragement, to remind her that creativity wasn't just about art, but about life itself.
