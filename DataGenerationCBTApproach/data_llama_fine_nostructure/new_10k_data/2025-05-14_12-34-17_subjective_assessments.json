As she waited for the barista to hand over the change, her phone slipped from her fingers and landed face-down in the puddle of spilled milk on the counter. The barista's eyes widened in surprise, and she let out a soft giggle before quickly handing Aiden her change and apologetically gesturing toward the milk-soaked phone.<|eot_id|>",

Why would anyone be so clumsy? Does she have trouble holding onto things, or is she just trying to distract us from her true intentions?"

He tried to straighten it, but the cashier raised an eyebrow, her expression a mixture of impatience and annoyance. \"Sir, do you need some help?\" she asked, her tone polite but firm.\n\nSomething about her tone rubbed against him the wrong way, and he felt a familiar surge of irritation rising up inside. His wife always told him to relax, but he couldn't seem to shake off the feeling that no one understood how frustrating this was.

He felt the familiar lump in his throat, but managed to keep his voice steady. \"Thanks, Mike. It's just...she was more than just my mom.\" A pause followed, before he continued, \"She was the one who taught me how to shoot, how to drive, even how to tie my shoes when I was a kid.\"\n\nMike nodded sympathetically, but said nothing. The office fell silent once again, with only the distant sound of typing on computers breaking the stillness. The officer's eyes lingered on the photo on his desk – a faded Polaroid of himself and his mother, taken on a family vacation years ago. His grip on the pen tightened, and for a moment, it felt like the whole world had come crashing down around him.<|eot_id|>",

Why did people always bring up comparisons when they were supposed to offer comfort? Didn't they understand what it was like to lose someone you loved? How could they say things like \"at least you weren't shot\" or \"it could've been worse\"? Those words cut deeper than any bullet ever could. In the end, he couldn't help but feel a deep resentment toward them. They didn't know anything. They hadn't experienced what he had, and yet they dared to minimize his pain with their careless remarks. They thought they were helping, but all they really did was make him feel like an outsider. Everyone else was talking about their families, sharing stories of how they'd lost loved ones, but when he tried to contribute, he was met with indifference. \"I don't think anyone is comparing themselves to you,\" Mike said softly, his voice barely above a whisper. \"We're just trying to support each other through this tough time.\" But the officer knew Mike was lying. He could hear the guilt in her voice, and he saw the pity in her eyes. They were just pretending to care,"

A pang of anger stirred within her, but she quickly suppressed it, attributing it to frustration rather than any personal animosity.\n\nHowever, when she saw the boy's smiley face photo on his file, taken with his father by their side, something snapped inside her.

She hadn't even considered that he could have an equal, if not superior, relationship with someone else. But why would they? He had never shown her anything like that before. His parents must have done everything right to create such a loving family. It didn't matter that she knew his father was well-respected in the community or that he had high expectations for his son. What mattered was that this student had achieved more than her. She felt like she was just a placeholder, a temporary stop on his path to greatness. The thought sent a chill down her spine, making her realize just how far behind she truly was. Even her own achievements seemed insignificant now. She couldn't help but wonder what other advantages her student had, whether it was a supportive home life or simply being the favorite child. Whatever it was, she knew she couldn't compete. She was just another teacher, after all, while he was destined for greatness."
