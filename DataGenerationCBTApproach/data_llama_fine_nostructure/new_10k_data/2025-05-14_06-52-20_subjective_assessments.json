The tone suggests that the protagonist is aware of what he \"should\" be doing, but isn't doing it, which reinforces the distortion. The use of phrases like \"the words 'not good enough"

It was a look that made him feel like he'd never quite grasp the nuances of the trade, like there was always someone better, someone more talented, who seemed to effortlessly excel.

She absent-mindedly stirred the coffee grounds, her eyes drifting back to the canvas. Her mind began to wander through all the rejections she'd faced over the years, each one a tiny notch in the armor she'd built around her insecurities. What if this was the one that finally made people lose interest? What if no one else saw the beauty in her art anymore?\n\nAs she hesitated, a gentle tap on the door interrupted her thoughts.

Her gaze drifted toward the empty space on the wall, where her latest masterpiece was supposed to go. It was meant to be a showstopper, a piece that would cement her reputation once and for all. But now, with another rejection letter, she wondered if it was worth it. Maybe she’d been deluding herself all along - maybe she was just wasting her time. Just then, a knock at the door interrupted her reverie. It was her daughter, holding a bunch of sunflowers and looking cheerful. But even the bright flowers couldn’t chase away the feeling of being unwanted. She thought about all the times she’d tried to get her work noticed, only to be met with rejection after rejection. Now, it seemed like everyone was against her, including those closest to her.

She hadn't mentioned anything positive about his work throughout the night, and now, standing there, he realized how much time and energy he'd invested in creating something beautiful for her, only to have her bring it down with a single comment. She might have been right; maybe this piece wasn't perfect. Maybe I shouldn't have painted it if I knew it would disappoint her.

If the phones were compromised, maybe even the store's security cameras could be tampered with. This was getting out of hand; there must be more going on behind the scenes than met the eye.
