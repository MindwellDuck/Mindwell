He wondered if the pain would ever subside, or if it would remain a constant reminder of his failure to move on. The brushes lay still, the paints untouched, as he struggled to reconcile the man he once was with the one who now sat before him—a shadow of his former self, forever trapped in a sea of sorrow.

It was as if time itself had slowed, each tick marking another passing moment, a reminder that nothing would ever return to how it once was.

As soon as she received the call, she felt a wave of panic wash over her. She couldn’t help but think that the inspector would find fault with everything she did, from the lessons to the way she organized the classroom. This fear took hold of her mind, causing her heart rate to increase and her breathing to become shallow. Despite knowing intellectually that these worries were unfounded, she found herself spiraling deeper into them. Each passing second felt like an eternity, filled with the constant hum of self-doubt.
