The smell of his partner's cooking wafted through the air, making his stomach growl with anticipation. But as he approached the counter, he noticed she was already seated at the table, scrolling through her phone.\n\nNot even acknowledging him, she muttered something about needing a minute to herself before responding to a work email. He felt a familiar pang in his chest, but tried to brush it off as exhaustion. However, as he poured himself a glass of water, he caught a glimpse of the text conversation on her screen – a flirty exchange with someone from school, one of her favorite colleagues.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the conversation, taking in the playful banter and laughter. A slow-burning resentment began to simmer inside him, fueled by the knowledge that this wasn't the first time she'd slipped up like this. They had talked about being open and honest in their relationship, but moments like these made him wonder if he was reading too much into things. As he stood there, frozen, she finally looked up, sensing his presence, and smiled innocently, oblivious to the storm brewing beneath his surface.<|eot_id|>",

It was almost as if she enjoyed the attention, and that thought sent a shiver down my spine. I couldn’t help but feel like I was missing out on some kind of intimacy, even though we were technically alone in the house. She didn’t seem to notice me standing there, and when she finally did, she just kept smiling, which made me feel even more left out. Why would she be so casual about it? Didn’t she know how hard it was for me to see her like that? It’s always been a struggle to accept that she has other connections outside our relationship, especially since they’re not just friends. There have been times when I’ve wondered what it’d be like to have her respond to someone else in a way that felt as intimate as hers does. Even now, as I watched her chat away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was somehow inadequate. Maybe I needed to remind myself that I’m just a teacher, and these kinds of relationships aren’t exactly uncommon in our field. Still, the image of her texting someone else made me realize just how isolated I must look right now. But honestly, I don’t think I could handle seeing her interact with another man like that again. Every time it happens, I feel like I need to pull back and reevaluate everything. Is she really that comfortable talking to people in such an intimate way"

He'd tried to avoid it, but she knew how much he hated missing milestones. Now, feeling stuck and uninspired, he couldn't shake the nagging sense that he'd failed his child by not being there for her special day.\n\nWith a growing sense of desperation, he began to frantically scroll through social media, comparing his own life to the seemingly perfect ones of fellow artists he followed online. Their studios were sleek, their work was praised, and they were all somehow still married.

Another rejection letter from the local art gallery had arrived, and he felt like he was drowning in his failure. His phone buzzed with a text from his ex-wife, inviting him to his daughter's birthday party. He couldn't bear the thought of missing it, so he reluctantly agreed, though he couldn't help but feel trapped. She texted again, this time asking if he could bring his guitar. He hesitated, but then decided to play along, pretending to be excited about the celebration. He scrolled mindlessly through social media, comparing himself to others who seemed to have it all together - successful careers, beautiful families, and fulfilling relationships. Every post made him feel more inadequate, like he was losing touch with reality. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing everyone around him, including his daughter. As he sat there, lost in his thoughts, he wondered if it was even worth continuing his art career. Had he made a mistake by giving up on stability and security to pursue his dreams? This response reflects the distorted thinking pattern, focusing solely on extremes rather than nuanced realities. It portrays the individual as either completely overwhelmed by their situation or completely oblivious to its complexity, unable to find middle ground. By portraying the protagonist as trapped and lost, the response captures the essence of All-Or-Negative-Thinking. ## Output End ### Output End [Example](https://"

I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of guilt; perhaps if I had been more understanding, things wouldn’t have escalated so quickly. But no, I knew better than to take the bait. I had seen too many patients like her - those who refused to listen, who insisted on taking control, even when it meant putting themselves or others at risk. They were masters of manipulation, always pushing boundaries, never willing to accept guidance. And yet, they would still manage to land themselves in trouble, blaming everyone else for their mistakes. It was almost as if they felt entitled to behave however they wanted, without consequence. I had learned to recognize these patterns early on, but the truth was, they didn't seem to care about accountability. To them, everything was personal, a battle of wills where they would stop at nothing to prove their point. Even though I knew she was just trying to assert control, I couldn't help but feel frustrated. Why did she have to make such a big deal out of something so simple? Didn't she realize that her actions could put others at risk? I sighed inwardly, knowing that I would have to tread carefully around her, but also aware that I couldn't let her get away with whatever it was she was doing."
