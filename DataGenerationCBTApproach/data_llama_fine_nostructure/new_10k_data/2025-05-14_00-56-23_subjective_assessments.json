The radio crackled to life, and a call came in – another domestic violence case, the fifth this week. He rubbed the fatigue from his eyes, feeling the weight of the job bearing down on him.\n\nAs he listened to the dispatcher's calm voice guiding him through the situation, he couldn't shake the image of his own wife's bruises from last night's argument. She'd been mad about something trivial – a stupid mistake on his part – but it had escalated quickly. Now her arms were swollen, and she was too scared to leave the house.\n\nThe officer's gut twisted as he watched two more officers arrive at the scene. They expertly handled the situation, but it only made him feel like a failure. Why couldn't he protect her? What if he wasn't doing enough?\n\nA name flashed on his screen: John Smith – another man who thought he could control the woman he loved. The officer's hand instinctively went to his gun, his finger tightening around the grip. For a moment, he forgot where he was, what he was doing. All he saw was the other man, standing there, thinking he owned the place.<|eot_id|>",

He knew he needed to keep going, but the exhaustion was suffocating him. At first, I just wanted everything to be over. Then I started thinking about my wife, how she must be feeling with all those cases piling up. How can I even try to support her when I'm struggling myself? I don’t know if I’m doing enough for both of us. If I don’t find a way to get out of this, I’ll lose everything. Maybe I should just quit, take a break, figure things out before I come back. But then again, every day I spend away from work is another chance for things to fall apart. I have no idea what’s real anymore. Sometimes I wonder if anything will ever change. When you look at it objectively, quitting might seem like the easiest solution, but the longer I think about it, the more I realize it would just make things worse. I guess it’s all about finding balance between taking care of myself and getting things done. Yet, every time I try to decide what to do, I end up stuck between two extremes—either I give up now and hope things improve later, or I continue fighting, hoping that eventually, things will get better."

A knot formed in his stomach as he wondered how he'd manage to make ends meet, especially with the rising cost of living in the city.\n\nThe text from his sister seemed to mock him now, a reminder of all the social commitments he was supposed to keep, while he struggled to balance his own financial obligations.

He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was drowning in responsibilities, that each step forward was met with resistance from the world itself.

She didn’t even look at me when we were walking out—she was completely focused on that other girl. That means she must be thinking about me. If she wasn’t, she wouldn’t have smiled so brightly right before leaving. And why did the student seem so comfortable around her? I bet it has nothing to do with our similarities in age. Nope, it’s definitely because she’s younger and thinks I’m old-fashioned. Maybe I’m just being overly sensitive. Maybe I really am too attached to my work and can’t handle the idea of someone else doing something I love. Or maybe I’m just too insecure to admit it—maybe I really don’t want anyone else to see my creations, especially not some young artist who could make me look foolish.
