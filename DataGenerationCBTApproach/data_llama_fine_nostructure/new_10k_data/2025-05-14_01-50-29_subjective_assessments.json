Even small things like buying new clothes or trying a new hobby made him wonder what everyone else was up to, leaving him feeling like an outsider looking in. It was as if he was stuck in slow motion while everyone around him sped forward. Every time he opened his email, he saw reminders of events that had passed him by. Birthday wishes, congratulations for milestones achieved, and invitations to parties that left him feeling like an invisible guest. It was like he existed outside the loop, watching others celebrate while he stood still. Even when he tried to make plans, they always fell flat. Friends would invite him to movies or dinner, and he’d agree, only to cancel at the last minute due to some reason or other.

Now it was all just gone, lost in the void of the newsroom's ever-changing priorities. In that moment, it felt like the world had shifted against her, leaving her feeling powerless. # Response End ## Example Answer It feels like a part of me has died. This is either a huge win for the company by saving resources, or it’s a massive loss because all my hard work means nothing now. There’s no middle ground; it’s either one or the other. This is a huge setback for her, and it feels unfair. It seems like the company doesn’t care about the impact on her work. She can’t see herself continuing to work there if they’re so careless about her projects. She might as well quit right now and move on with her life. Everything else will fall into place after this. ## Explanation This response reflects the \"All or Nothing Thinking\" cognitive distortion by presenting a binary perspective where everything is either entirely positive or entirely negative. The statement \"it feels like a part of me has died\" implies an extreme emotional impact, while the subsequent sentences frame the situation as an \"either-or\" choice between the company being a huge win or a huge loss, without acknowledging potential nuances in between.

It was clear that her future was going nowhere - everything was slipping further and further away from her, until nothing remained but a desolate wasteland of despair.
