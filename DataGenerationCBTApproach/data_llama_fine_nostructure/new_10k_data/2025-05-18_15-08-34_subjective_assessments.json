And what did he do? He threw it all away, citing 'unforeseen circumstances' as his excuse for abandoning her and their young daughter.\n\nThe memories still stung, but they were nothing compared to the rage that churned within her now. She felt like screaming, like tearing her hair out and destroying everything in sight. But she didn't. Not yet. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down, but it was no use.\n\nHer eyes welled up with tears as she thought about the letter he had left behind, the one where he told her he couldn't do it anymore, that he needed space. Space! From her, from their daughter, from the life they had built together. It was a masterclass in selfishness, and Emily seethed with anger.\n\nShe turned off her computer, pushed her chair back, and stood up, her legs trembling beneath her. She felt like she was going to collapse, like the weight of her emotions was crushing her. She stumbled towards the kitchen, grabbing a glass of water from the tap, and splashed some on her face.\n\nBut it wasn't enough. The rage wouldn't subside. It only intensified, burning hotter with every passing moment. Emily felt like she was drowning in a sea of fury, unable to find a lifeline to cling to. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. Left her gasping for air, feeling empty and hollow inside.\n\nShe sat back down at her desk, her hands shaking as she tried to process the chaos that was brewing inside her. She knew she needed to get out, to clear her head, but her legs refused to move. They felt heavy, weighed down by the chains of her own emotions.\n\nEmily slumped forward, her forehead hitting the desk, and let out a low, muffled sob. The world around her melted away, leaving only the echoes of her own despair.<|eot_id|>",

Six more months before he could even think about downsizing this bloody mansion, let alone selling it.\n\nThe memories came flooding back - the laughter, the tears, the countless nights spent arguing over whose turn it was to do the dishes. He couldn't believe she was really gone. It had been three years since her passing, but the pain still felt like an open wound.\n\nHe thought back to their wedding day, when he'd promised to love and cherish her until death did them part. And now, here he was, left to pick up the pieces of a life that no longer made sense.\n\nHe slammed his fist onto the counter, making the bills rattle. 'Six months!' he bellowed at the top of his lungs. 'That's all I get? A paltry six months before I'm forced to face reality?'\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.\n\nDr. Thompson took a step closer to the window, his eyes fixed on the garden below. His wife used to tend to those flowers every morning, and the sight of them always brought a smile to her face. Now, they just seemed to mock him, their beauty a cruel reminder of everything he'd lost.\n\nHe turned back to the bills, his eyes scanning the numbers with a mix of anger and desperation. How was he supposed to make ends meet on his pension? How was he supposed to keep this house, this life, going?\n\nThe words 'you're not good enough' echoed in his mind, a constant reminder of his own inadequacy. Inadequate husband, inadequate father, inadequate scientist. It was a never-ending cycle of self-doubt, one that threatened to consume him whole.\n\nWith a snarl, Dr. Thompson crumpled the first bill in his hand, watching as it fluttered to the floor. 'I don't want your money,' he growled, his voice barely above a whisper. 'I just want my life back.'<|eot_id|>",

It was as if an unseen force had taken hold of my stomach, causing it to twist into knots.\n\nI took a deep breath, attempting to calm my racing thoughts, but they refused to be still. My mind wandered to the countless sleepless nights spent poring over lines of code, the weight of our company's future resting squarely upon my shoulders. What if we failed? What if our revenue plummeted, leaving us on the brink of financial ruin?\n\nMy gaze drifted toward my wife, seated across from me, her expression serene and reassuring.

I felt a wave of panic wash over me, my vision beginning to blur at the edges. My mind screamed at me to act, to do something, anything, to mitigate this impending disaster.

The thought sent a chill coursing through my veins, freezing my heart in its tracks.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had begun, everything went silent.

I mean, I love her, but seriously, can't she see I'm trying to adult here?\n\nI finally manage to get some coffee down, and I'm starting to feel somewhat human again.
