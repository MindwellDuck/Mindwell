The restaurant was already busy, but he still felt like he'd never be able to get everything done on time. His mind began to wander to all the things that could go wrong - a kitchen fire, a food poisoning outbreak, a table of picky customers.\n\nJust then, one of the line cooks called out that they were running low on the key ingredient for the special of the day. He cursed under his breath as he realized he had ordered too little and now had to scramble to find a replacement supplier. The phone started ringing, and he knew it would only be the supplier calling to tell him that their delivery was hours late.\n\nAs he tried to juggle the orders and make calls, the fire alarm went off in the walk-in fridge. The staff rushed to evacuate the building, leaving him alone to deal with the chaos. The stress of it all suddenly felt suffocating, and he could feel his heart racing in his chest.<|eot_id|>",

He thought about the countless interviews he'd conducted with widows and orphans, but none of them had prepared him for this quiet desperation creeping into his own life.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional chirp of a bird outside.

The once-familiar routine of making breakfast for the kids now felt forced, like he was just playing a role. She walked by, handed me my phone, and I saw the message from our daughter. She wanted us to come pick her up early so we could spend some quality time together before school started. But even that didn’t fill the void inside me. Instead, I felt like I was just delaying the inevitable, putting off the moment when reality would finally hit me. We got in the car, and she started driving. My hands were shaking, and I couldn’t look her in the eye. She asked if I was alright, but I just shook my head. What was the point? We wouldn’t last much longer anyway.
