The perpetrator was described as someone who targeted homes of high-net-worth individuals, always leaving behind a small note with no demands or signatures.\n\nMike leaned against the edge of his desk, crossing one leg over the other. 'We're looking for anyone who might be connected to these jobs. No leads so far.'\n\nA quiet frustration simmered beneath his surface as he processed the case details.

He'd seen it all before – the same MOs, the same suspects, the same excuses.\n\n'Meet me outside,' he said curtly to Mike, already heading towards the door.\n\nAs soon as they stepped out into the cool morning air, he pulled out his phone and dialed a number. It rang several times before a smooth voice answered. 'Detective James speaking.' His eyes narrowed at the familiar tone, his mind already racing with possibilities.<|eot_id|>",

He wants attention, maybe even revenge.\" Mike's eyes widened. \"Revenge?\" Detective James continued, \"I think he's targeting people who are close to those who wronged him.\" Mike's expression darkened. \"Do you know who he's going"

It was one she remembered her mother using when she was a child – a comforting trinket now filled with yellowed letters and faded photographs.\n\nThe soft ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway seemed to grow louder as she opened the box, releasing a whispered sigh. She gently ran her fingers over the worn pages of the letters, feeling the weight of years of love and loss.
