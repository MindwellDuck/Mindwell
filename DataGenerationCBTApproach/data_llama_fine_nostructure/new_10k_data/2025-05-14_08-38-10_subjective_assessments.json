She spotted her partner, Alex, already seated at their usual table, scrolling through his phone. He caught her eye and smiled, but it felt forced, like he was trying to reassure her without actually being present.\n\nAs she approached, the line for the breakfast buffet began to move, and she found herself stuck behind a group of rowdy interns, loudly discussing their weekend plans. The noise and chaos were overwhelming, making her feel anxious and claustrophobic. She fidgeted with her gloves, feeling like she was about to lose it.\n\nAlex finally stood up, gathering his things, and headed towards her. But instead of taking her hand or asking how her day was going, he simply said, \"I've got to run, I have a meeting.\" And with that, he turned and left, leaving her standing alone in the crowded cafeteria, feeling more isolated than ever.<|eot_id|>",

Would she really leave him for someone else? Or would she realize he wasn’t worth it? The thought sent a shiver down his spine. If he did that, would she stay, or would she finally see him for who he truly was? He wiped down the counter with a flourish, as if the action could somehow erase the doubts that plagued him. But they lingered, refusing to be washed away. He knew he needed to get moving, but the question kept echoing in his mind: What if he never cleaned up after himself again? What if she got tired of waiting for him to step up? The silence in the kitchen seemed oppressive now, a reminder that some things were better left unspoken. He rinsed off, dried his hands, and headed back to the living room, wondering what other questions he might ask himself."

It implies that she is intentionally leaving him behind while she explores new adventures with others, even though there is no direct evidence to support this claim. This interpretation creates a negative outlook about the situation, reinforcing the distorted belief that the partner is actively distancing herself from him. By focusing on perceived abandonment rather than actual facts, the person exhibits the tendency to predict a negative outcome in advance, thereby confirming their preconceived notion."
