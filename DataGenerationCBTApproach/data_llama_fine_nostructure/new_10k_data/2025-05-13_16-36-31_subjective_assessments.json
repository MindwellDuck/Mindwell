The kitchen was quiet, except for the ticking clock on the wall, its steady rhythm now racing in his mind. A food critic from the local newspaper had called earlier, requesting a table for one tonight, and he'd spent hours preparing for it.\n\nAs he expertly plated the dish, his hands began to shake, and the tines of the fork clattered against the plate. He forced himself to take a deep breath, but the air seemed to get stuck in his lungs. What if the critic hated everything? What if he'd forgotten some crucial ingredient?\n\nThe door swung open, and a young waitress approached him, a bright smile plastered on her face. 'Table ready,' she said, her voice like music to his ears, but it only made him more anxious. He handed her the check, his hand trembling as he signed his name.<|eot_id|>",
