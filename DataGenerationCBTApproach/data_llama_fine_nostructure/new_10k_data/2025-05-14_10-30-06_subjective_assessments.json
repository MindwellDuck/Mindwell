It couldn't be anything serious; he'd just been in such high spirits during our last conversation. As I waited for him to speak, I thought back to our previous interactions - how we'd talked about our shared goals, how he'd praised my work, how everything seemed so perfect between us. I don't know what's going on with you lately. Your behavior has changed since you started working here. You seem distant, and your attitude is different. I've noticed you're taking longer breaks, and sometimes, you're absent from meetings. I understand that life can get busy, but these changes are affecting your performance. We need to discuss this further. Let’s schedule a meeting to talk more about it."

He felt a pang in his chest, but it wasn't nostalgia. It wasn't even sadness. It was something else entirely – a seething resentment that had been building for years.\n\nWhy did they still keep her memory alive? Why did they still celebrate their love, as if she were still among them? The silence between them grew thicker, more oppressive, as he reached for the glass of wine at his elbow.\n\nHis eyes met those of the young bride, her smile radiant, her laughter infectious. And for a moment, he saw himself – 30 years ago, full of hope and promise. Now, he was just a relic of the past, a reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe room seemed to spin around him, the colors bleeding together in a mad dance. He took a step back, his hand grasping for the edge of the table as if it were a lifeline. But it was too late. The words had already spilled out of him, a bitter laugh that cut through the room like a knife.<|eot_id|>",

I remember how cold her fingers were against mine as we held hands, but she didn’t let go. We talked until the sun dipped below the horizon, and she shared stories of our ancestors, of struggles and triumphs, of sacrifices made and dreams realized. She spoke of our great-grandmother, who had traveled across oceans to build a new home, of our grandfather, who fought for freedom, and of our parents, who worked tirelessly to give us every opportunity. Her voice cracked as she talked about her own childhood, about how she and her siblings had grown up in poverty, yet found strength in each other. As night fell, she pulled me close, her eyes shining with tears. “Remember,” she whispered, “we may have come from nothing, but our family is built on love.” In that moment, I understood that no matter what life threw our way, we would always stand together. When she passed, I felt like I’d lost part of myself. Her legacy lived on through me, but now, I just felt empty. This party, with everyone laughing and smiling,"
