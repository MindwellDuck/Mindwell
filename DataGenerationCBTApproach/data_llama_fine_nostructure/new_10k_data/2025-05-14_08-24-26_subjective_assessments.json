A letter arrives, addressed to her, but it's from her ex-husband's lawyer. As she opens it, a mix of dust motes dances in the morning light streaming through the window.\n\nThe words on the page confirm what she'd suspected – he's sold their life's work, including the piece they worked on together during their marriage, at an auction house next week. The memory of his words, 'you're no longer my partner,' echoes in her mind as she reads about the substantial sum he's received.\n\nShe feels a lump form in her throat as she sets the letter down, her eyes drifting towards the blank canvas before her. Her brush lies idle, a reminder of the creative partnership she once shared with him now lost forever.<|eot_id|>",

The way her shoulders slouch, the look of sadness etched into her face - it all points to one thing: she's still hurting from the breakup. # Output End ### Output End This response reflects the'mind reading' cognitive distortion because it assumes the writer is aware of their own emotions and how others perceive them, even if they are not. By using phrases such as \"she looks like someone who has been hurt\" and \"the way her shoulders slouch,\" the writer implies that they can see into the other person's mind and understand exactly how they feel. This shows a lack of self-awareness and misinterprets the writer's emotional state, which is a hallmark of the Mind Reading distortion."

A knot formed in her stomach as she thought about the countless phone calls she'd made to families like this one, offering reassurance and support.
