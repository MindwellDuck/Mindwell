As the sizzling onions filled the kitchen, she couldn't help but think of all the meals she used to cook for her ex-husband when he was home from work. He'd always loved her cooking, and she took pride in making him happy.\n\nAs she glanced at the clock for what felt like the hundredth time, her mind began to wander to the countless nights he'd left her waiting, the takeout menus piling up, and the promises he never kept. She remembered the way he'd complain about her cooking, how it wasn't \"good enough\" for his friends, and how she'd tried so hard to please him.\n\nThe door finally opened, and her child walked in, apologetic and distracted. \"Mom, I'm sorry I'm late,\" they said, barely acknowledging her presence as they began to rummage through their bag for their phone charger. The smell of burnt food wafted from the stove, and for a moment, she felt a pang of resentment, wondering if anyone else even noticed the effort she put into cooking dinner for them.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't just about being late; it was about feeling forgotten, ignored, and unappreciated. Every small oversight, every missed opportunity, every unmet expectation—it all boiled down to the same thing: she was just an afterthought. It made sense, though. Her child didn't know how much stress they were causing, how many times they'd pushed her to the edge. And now, here they were, standing there with their phone charger, completely oblivious to the emotional turmoil brewing inside her. They didn't care that she was burning dinner, that she had spent hours cooking and planning, only to see it go to waste because they weren't even home yet. No, they were too busy, too caught up in their own world to notice. It wasn’t just about being late; it was about feeling abandoned. Every small mistake became a big deal, every missed chance a personal failure. She felt like she was drowning in her own expectations, suffocating under the weight of responsibility. And now, as she watched her child walk by, distracted and oblivious, she wondered if anyone would ever truly understand how much pressure she was under, how much love she poured into these moments that seemed so insignificant to everyone else."
