The colors seemed duller now, the brushstrokes less confident. She hadn't touched it since he passed away six months ago.\n\nAs she gazed at the painting, memories of their last vacation together flooded her mind – the laughter, the arguments, the quiet moments they shared by the ocean. She remembered how he'd always encouraged her art, how proud he was of her latest exhibitions.\n\nShe absent-mindedly picked up a nearby brush and began to mix colors, but instead of creating something new, her hand instinctively reached for the old palette where he used to store his favorite paints. Her fingers closed around the familiar weight of the tube, and for a moment, she felt like he was still there, holding her hand, offering words of encouragement.\n\nThe gesture caught her off guard, and tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. She quickly wiped them away, trying to compose herself, but the pain lingered, a reminder that some wounds would never fully heal.<|eot_id|>",

We both know she’s not happy here, but does she really think she has the right to decide what happens to our home? And another thing, why does she get to keep all these memories? She’s the one who moved back in after college, so she gets to hold onto everything from when we were kids. But I’m the one who’s had to pick up the pieces ever since he died. I can’t even go out without feeling like everyone is staring at me because of my beard. Do you know how hard it is to find a job when no one wants to hire someone with a face like this? It’s just ridiculous. I feel like I’m carrying everything on my shoulders, but does anyone ever ask me how I’m doing? No, she just keeps pushing me further and further away.

She felt a familiar tug of guilt and anxiety, wondering if she was doing enough, if she was neglecting her responsibilities as a wife and mother.\n\nHer eyes landed on the calendar, where a scribbled note read 'Pick up soccer practice' in red ink – it was tomorrow afternoon. She hadn't even checked the schedule for the kids' activities this week.
