I'm cooking up a storm today, just like I always did when we were together. \n\nHer favorite dish, the one she'd always beg me to make for her birthday, sits on the counter untouched. The recipe's still scribbled on the same old card, her handwriting all over it like a fingerprint. I can almost smell the bouquet garni she loved so much.\n\nI start chopping the onions, my hands moving on autopilot as my mind replays every argument we had about this exact dish. She said it was too spicy, I said it wasn't spicy enough. We went back and forth until...until...\n\nUntil she walked out of my life. Left me here with nothing but these two empty chairs at the table. And now, to make matters worse, her brother comes walking in, ordering his usual, never asking if I want anything. Thinks he can just waltz in here and expect me to fawn all over him because of what our family's lost.\n\nHe takes a seat at the counter, smirking at me as if he knows some secret. 'Hey, chef,' he says, his voice dripping with condescension. 'Still got your magic touch?' Magic touch? Does he know how hard I've been working, day and night, trying to keep this kitchen running?\n\nI slam the knife down onto the cutting board, making us both jump. 'What do you want?' I growl, trying to keep my cool. But inside, I'm seething. Seething like the soup I used to make for her, simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over.\n\n'Just thought I'd drop by and say hi,' he says, oblivious to the storm brewing inside me. Hi? To who? Not to me, that's for sure. Never has, never will. He gets up, leaving me with this lingering sense of resentment, like a bad sauce that refuses to clear.<|eot_id|>",

Or, 'I don't feel well, maybe I'm coming down with something.' She even canceled plans last week because she didn't feel like getting ready. I know she's busy, but it feels like an excuse every time. It makes me wonder if she's being honest with herself. I remember how she would always cancel plans at the last minute, saying she couldn't get babysitting done or needed to go shopping. Now, suddenly, everything is an emergency? It feels like she's using excuses to avoid hanging out. Maybe she doesn't really care about spending time with me anymore. Maybe she's just too stressed from school to enjoy socializing. Whatever the reason, I'm starting to think she's just taking advantage of me. I told her I understood, but honestly, it feels like she’s just making excuses to stay home. It’s like she thinks she can handle everything on her own without anyone else noticing. It makes me angry that she doesn’t appreciate my help. If I took care of things for her, she wouldn’t need to make such a big deal about it. And why does she always have to call me at 11 PM, expecting me to be up late listening to her problems? Doesn’t she realize I have my own stuff going on? I’m so"

I made pancakes.'\n\n'Pancakes?' he repeated, raising an eyebrow. 'Can't you see I'm still trying to wake up?'\n\nShe chuckled. 'You're always like this in the morning.

And what's with all these toys everywhere?'\n\nSarah's expression changed from amused to annoyed. 'Hey, our kid has toys. What did you expect?'\n\n'Toys everywhere? That's exactly what I expected. But do you ever clean up after him? It's like you just leave it all scattered around.'\n\nSarah's voice rose. 'That's not fair. I clean up after him every day.'\n\nHe crossed his arms. 'Every day? Really? Because it looks like it's been weeks since I've seen a clean floor.'\n\n'Fine,' she snapped. 'If you're so concerned about cleanliness, why don't you help out more?'\n\nHe threw up his hands. 'I do help out. I work long hours, remember? You're always on my case about something.'\n\nSarah's eyes flashed. 'Maybe if you spent more time at home taking care of our family instead of gallivanting off to work, things would be different.'\n\nHis anger boiled over. 'Excuse me? Gallivanting? You have no idea what I do or how hard I work.'\n\nThe air was thick with tension as they stood there, locked in a silent stare-down.
