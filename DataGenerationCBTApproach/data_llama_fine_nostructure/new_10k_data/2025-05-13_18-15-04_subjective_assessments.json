The once-promising journalist felt stagnant, like he was drowning in a sea of rejection letters. He couldn't help but think about the photo on his desk—a picture of a younger version of himself, holding a Pulitzer Prize alongside colleagues who now seemed like distant memories. The image sparked a mix of emotions—pride, nostalgia, and regret. Had he let time get the better of him? Was he clinging to the past instead of embracing the present? The phone on his desk rang, breaking the silence. He hesitated, unsure if he wanted to answer. Maybe someone would finally see the value in his work, maybe they'd give him one last chance. Or perhaps he was just grasping at straws, refusing to accept reality. Either way, the call seemed like a reminder that his career was slipping away, leaving him with nothing but dust and forgotten dreams. # Feedback Please provide feedback by commenting on the post.

A pang of anxiety fluttered in her chest as she felt a familiar sense of inadequacy wash over her. She thought about all the late nights, the rejections, and the struggles she'd faced over the years, and wondered if she'd ever be good enough.\n\nThe phone on her desk rang, breaking the spell. It was a gallery owner calling to discuss the commission. For a moment, her heart skipped a beat as she hesitated, unsure if she could face another rejection. But then she took a deep breath and answered, her voice steady as she began to talk about the piece.
