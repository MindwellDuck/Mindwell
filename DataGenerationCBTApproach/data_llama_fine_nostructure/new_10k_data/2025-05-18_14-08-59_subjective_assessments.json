It had been six months since her divorce, yet the sense of unease lingered, like a perpetual hum in the background of her mind. She tried to focus on the lines of code streaming across her screen, but her thoughts kept drifting back to her ex-husband's parting words.\n\nThat evening, as she was driving home from work, Rachel noticed a black sedan tailing her. At first, she dismissed it as mere paranoia, but as the minutes ticked by, the vehicle remained steadfast, its presence making her skin crawl. When she arrived at her apartment complex, she hesitated before getting out of the car, half-expecting the sedan to follow suit.\n\nRachel quickened her pace, her eyes darting about the deserted parking lot. As she entered her building, she caught a glimpse of herself in the elevator mirror – her hair disheveled, her eyes sunken from lack of sleep. For a fleeting instant, she could have sworn her reflection seemed... off, as if someone had subtly altered her features while she wasn't looking.\n\nUpon reaching her apartment, Rachel fumbled for her keys, her hands trembling slightly. She locked the door behind her, feeling a strange sense of vulnerability wash over her. As she began to unpack her groceries, she couldn't shake the feeling that unblinking eyes were watching her through the peephole. The sensation sent a shiver down her spine, and for a moment, she wondered if she'd truly left her past behind.\n\nThe dim glow of her phone's screen illuminated her face as she scrolled through social media, searching for reassurance. But amidst the curated smiles and laughter, one post stood out – a photo of her and her ex-husband, taken on their last vacation together. The caption read, \"Missing you both already.\" A chill coursed through Rachel's veins, leaving her breathless and uncertain.<|eot_id|>",

It was a fragrance she'd always worn, one that now seemed to hold a deeper meaning. Maybe it was just my imagination, but I couldn't help but wonder if there was more to this encounter than met the eye. Rachel's eyes, once bright and full of life, now seemed dull, as if they'd lost their sparkle along with our relationship. They sparkled when she laughed, but now they looked tired, drained of all joy. It was as if the fire that once burned so brightly within her had flickered out, leaving only a smoldering ember. Her smile, once warm and inviting, now seemed... guarded. There was something guarded about it, as if she was holding back, waiting for the right moment to let her true feelings show.

This perspective shift reveals a deeper issue—her inability to separate her own experiences from others. In her mind, everything was about her, and anything less than perfect was a personal failure. This tendency to view the world solely through her lens made her react impulsively, fueled by uncontrolled emotions. Though she may have felt justified in her outburst, the reality was far more complex. Rather than confronting the root causes of her frustration, she chose to project them onto the gallery, believing their decisions were a direct reflection of her worth. This distorted thinking prevented her from recognizing that rejections are common and inevitable for many artists, regardless of talent. By assuming each rejection was a personal attack, she created a cycle of self-perpetuating anger, making it difficult to move forward.
