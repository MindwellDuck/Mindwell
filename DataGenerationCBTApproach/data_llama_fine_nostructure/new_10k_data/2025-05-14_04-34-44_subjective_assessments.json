Her eyes scanned the schedule, noting the parents of her former students – now grown and successful – who would be attending these meetings.\n\nOne name caught her attention: Mrs. Johnson, the mother of Emma, whom she had taught 15 years ago. Back then, Mrs. Johnson had been overbearing and critical, often questioning A's academic abilities during parent-teacher conferences. \n\nAs she began to read through the meeting notes, she felt a familiar knot form in her stomach. She recalled how she had gone above and beyond to support Emma, only to see her graduate from college and land a well-paying job while A struggled to find stable employment. The disparity stung, and the memory brought out a bitter taste in her mouth.<|eot_id|>",

She always looks so put together, but I know there must be more going on beneath the surface. I wonder if it has anything to do with how things turned out between us? Maybe she still feels hurt because I left the school. Or maybe she just doesn’t like me anymore. I tried talking to her once, but she wasn't very receptive. I didn't push the issue since she seemed busy. It's funny how people change over time - they can become completely different. Sometimes I think they just pretend to be someone else to get what they want. Like how she acted when our kids went to school together. She'd complain about everything, and it sounded like she wanted everyone to dislike each other. But then she'd turn around and say nice things to them. I'm not saying she's bad; she's just... complicated. Maybe I'm just reading too much into it? I don't know why I feel this way. I've known her for decades, but lately, it seems like she's acting differently. She might have lost someone close to her, which could explain why she seems so distant. I remember how sad she was after her husband passed away - she barely spoke to anyone."

Over the past year, John had become increasingly distant, often disappearing during meals without explanation. At first, she tried to brush it off, thinking maybe he needed some space. However, these moments kept happening, and the silence between them grew thicker than the soup she'd served. One day, while out running errands, she stumbled upon a flyer for a local cooking class. Intrigued by the idea of learning new recipes, she signed up for the next session. When John returned home, she mentioned her plans, expecting excitement and support. Instead, he became agitated, his tone cold. \"Why would you sign up for something like that? We're already overcooked.\" He didn't even try to hide his disdain, and it cut deep. She realized that this wasn't the first time he'd dismissed her interests, and it wouldn't be the last. Every little thing she did seemed to upset him, and now she wondered if she'd lost touch with her own desires. Maybe she was too focused on pleasing others, forgetting what brought her joy in the first place."
