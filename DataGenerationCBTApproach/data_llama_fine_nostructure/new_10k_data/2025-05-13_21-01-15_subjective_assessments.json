A text from Alex, her art mentor, had appeared out of nowhere - an invitation to join their gallery group show in two weeks. As she read through his message, nostalgia washed over her.\n\nHer eyes landed on the photo of them standing together at last year's exhibition, beaming with pride. She remembered how he'd taken her under his wing, guiding her through the ups and downs of her fledgling career. But now, as she scrolled through their past conversations, she realized Alex had been offering more than just constructive feedback - he'd been pushing her to take credit for his own work, subtly shifting the spotlight onto himself.\n\nA bitter taste formed in her mouth as she recalled the way he'd dismissed her ideas, saying they were'amateurish' and 'unoriginal.' The sting of those words still lingered, and now, as she looked at Alex's text, she felt like she was being offered a slap in the face - a reminder of all the times she'd sacrificed her own vision for his approval.\n\nThe room began to spin, and she felt a wave of nausea wash over her. Her hands trembled as she typed a hasty response, apologizing for her absence but making it clear she wouldn't be able to attend the show after all. As she hit send, a cold sweat broke out on her forehead, and she couldn't shake the feeling that a part of her was dying inside.<|eot_id|>",

The text from him still glowed on her screen, its soft light mocking her. It was probably better off ignored anyway. She thought about all the times he’d belittled her, making her feel like nothing more than a pawn in his game. As she sat there, lost in her thoughts, she wondered why she ever let herself get so caught up in something that didn’t seem to want me. Why did I think I needed him? What was I thinking when I agreed to work with him in the first place? She thought back to the early days, when she'd been so eager to prove myself. Alex had seemed like the perfect opportunity - someone who knew the industry, someone who could help her succeed. But now, looking back, it seemed like a mistake. He'd been using her all along, taking advantage of my desperation to boost his own reputation. And now, I'm stuck here, wondering what I did wrong. But maybe this isn’t entirely her fault. Maybe Alex has always been like this - always putting himself first, never really considering others. Maybe he’s just too busy to care. She sighed inwardly, trying to convince herself that everything would work out eventually. After all, it wasn’t like anything had actually happened yet. There was still time to change course, to figure things out before it was too late"

He frantically brushed it off, trying to play it cool, but his eyes met Rachel's, and she burst into laughter.\n\nJust then, their boss walked by, flashing a critical glance at the disheveled journalist before moving on to greet other colleagues.

She'd always been like this, never letting things slide—now it seemed she had no choice but to leave, and it was all because he'd let her down. As the day went on, he couldn't shake the feeling that she'd changed her mind about staying. Maybe she was just waiting for him to make a move, to prove that he cared. But deep down, he knew she wouldn't go back on her promise. It wasn't fair to expect him to fix everything when he felt so broken himself. At lunchtime, he tried calling her, hoping against hope that she'd answer. When she didn't, he wondered if she was trying to avoid him. Hadn't she said something like that before? \"You're just making excuses,\" she'd said, her voice cold. \"It's time you faced reality.\" Was she right? Could he really blame her? In the end, it was probably for the best. If she stayed, he'd only hold her back. Besides, there were other women out there who"

In this moment, nothing was certain except for the echoes of what had been left unsaid, the silences that spoke louder than words ever could. The camera remained silent, but its presence was a constant reminder that some truths were better left unseen, that some things are meant to stay hidden, locked away in the darkness of memory.
