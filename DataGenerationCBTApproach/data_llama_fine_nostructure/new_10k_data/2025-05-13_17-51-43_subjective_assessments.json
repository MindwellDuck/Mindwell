She remembered when her husband used to help her manage their patients' medications, but he'd passed away five years ago. Now, she felt like she was alone, struggling to keep up with the workload.\n\nThe new nurse looked frazzled, and the hospital's noise levels were reaching a boiling point. The patient continued to resist, making it clear that no one was taking him seriously. In this moment, our nurse felt like she was failing everyone – herself, the patient, and the entire team.\n\nHer eyes drifted to the empty chair beside her husband's, where she would have sat if he were still by her side. Her gaze lingered, and for a fleeting instant, she wondered if she was truly capable of handling this situation on her own.<|eot_id|>",

It seemed like everyone else handled situations like this effortlessly, while she struggled to keep up. Even the doctors, who barely spoke to her, moved through the room with an air of confidence they seemed to possess naturally. Meanwhile, the new nurse, despite being overwhelmed, remained composed. It made her feel inadequate, wondering how someone so inexperienced could navigate these intense moments so smoothly. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was falling behind. Every time she glanced at her colleagues, she saw them moving forward with ease, while she felt stuck in neutral. It was as if she was racing against people who didn't even know she existed. The more she compared herself to them, the further behind she felt. She began to doubt whether she had what it took to succeed here, especially now that her husband wasn't there to support her. She missed his steady hand, his reassuring presence, and the way he always knew just what to say to calm things down. Without him, everything seemed harder, and she couldn’t help but wonder if she’d ever be able to fill the void he left behind."

Just then, another nurse casually mentioned a minor incident involving a medication error from last week – nothing out of the ordinary, yet it sent a spark of indignation through the doctor. Her mind flashed back to the countless hours she'd spent reviewing the hospital's protocols, ensuring every detail was perfect.

Her anger towards her colleagues grew with each passing day. They seemed to be taking her husband’s situation lightly, almost as if they’d seen worse. She caught snippets of conversations where people joked about his prognosis, saying things like “Well, at least he’ll get a good story out of it.” Or, “Maybe he’ll finally get to see what heaven looks like.” It made her sick to her stomach. Every time she heard one of these comments, she felt a wave of resentment wash over her. Why did they have to make light of such a serious situation? Didn’t they understand how much pain her family was going through? One day, while working at the hospital, she found herself standing in the nurses’ station, listening to the morning report. A doctor was discussing a patient who’d suffered severe injuries in a recent accident. As I listened, I felt a mix of emotions: sadness for the patient, concern for my own husband (who’d been involved in a similar accident), and frustration toward the doctor for focusing so intently on the patient"

She didn’t have to work so hard; she could afford to relax, take a break whenever she wanted. Meanwhile, I was juggling multiple jobs just to make ends meet, always worried about when I’d next go hungry. But as we settled into the car ride home, I realized that maybe my anger was misplaced. Maybe she hadn’t noticed how stressed I was because she didn’t see things the same way. She was probably too busy enjoying her success to realize how hard I worked behind the scenes. At least she never complained about the long hours. When I told her about the latest job I landed, she simply smiled and said, “That’s great!” But what about all the times I’ve asked her to help? All the nights I spent worrying about bills and deadlines while she sat at home binge-watching TV? Did she ever think about how hard I was struggling?

No one who would appreciate the effort, the time spent pouring over every brushstroke. The fact that she hasn't sold anything recently doesn't mean much - it's just because nobody wants to buy bad art. The idea that she might feel inspired again someday is absurd. There's no point holding on to hope now. There's always going to be some other failure waiting for her around the corner, another disappointment to add to the pile.
