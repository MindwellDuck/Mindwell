Another long day of dealing with entitled teenagers and bureaucratic red tape was about to consume me whole.\n\nAs I poured myself a lukewarm cup of coffee, I noticed the new nurse, Rachel, chatting up our team leader like they were old buddies. Newsflash: she'd been here six months, and we still hadn't figured out how to train her properly.\n\nMy mind began to wander back to my late husband, God rest his soul. He used to come with me to these meetings, offer advice, and make everyone laugh. Now, he was just a memory, and it felt like everyone was trying to fill the void he left behind – except for me.\n\nRachel caught my eye and flashed that fake smile again, no doubt thinking she was some kind of nursing prodigy. Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart: I've seen it all. I've bled with the best of them, cried with the sickest of them, and comforted the grieving families of the dead. You think you're special? Please.\n\nShe walked over to me, coffee in hand, and said, \"Hey, Mrs. Johnson, can I get your input on this patient's chart?\" Input? Ha! She couldn't even spell'medication' correctly, let alone understand the nuances of human suffering.\n\n\"Listen, kid,\" I growled, \"you want to learn from someone? Come sit down, and I'll show you what real compassion looks like. Not this sugarcoated, feel-good crap you're peddling.\"\n\nFor a moment, our eyes locked, and I saw a flicker of fear. Maybe it was the cuss word slipping off my tongue, or maybe it was just the weight of my disappointment. Either way, it was enough to give me a spark of satisfaction. This young, naive nurse had no idea what was coming.\n\nBut then, the team leader swooped in, intervening before things escalated further. \"Now, now, ladies, let's keep the discussion professional.\" Professional? Are they kidding me? \n\nAs I watched Rachel slink away, defeated, I couldn't help but wonder if anyone would ever truly understand the toll this job takes on people like me – people who've given their hearts and souls to healing others, only to have it broken time and time again.\n\nI took a sip of my cold coffee, feeling the bitterness burn my throat.

Even when I try to be positive, there’s always a part of me wondering if things will really get better. I guess I just figure that if you don’t know where you stand, you might end up getting taken advantage of. Plus, being bitter helps you prepare for the inevitable disappointments that come with life. If you’re too optimistic, you might miss those opportunities to learn and grow. I’d rather be honest about my expectations than waste time pretending everything is okay when it’s not. People often call me jaded, but I see it as resilience. When you’ve been burned once, twice, three times, you start to realize that nothing comes easily. Life doesn’t owe you anything, especially not happiness. And sometimes, you have to take matters into your own hands. Being bitter keeps me grounded. Of course, it’s not healthy to stay stuck in negativity forever. But after years of watching good people fall apart because they tried to be too perfect, I realized that embracing bitterness is actually a strength, not a weakness. When you know where you stand, you can protect yourself from people who’ll use you for their gain. And when the world gets tough, you’re ready to fight back. So yeah, I’m bitter.

Her gaze lingered on one picture in particular – her and John standing side by side at her first teaching job, their arms wrapped around each other, beaming with pride.\n\nAs she reached out to gently touch the glass, a faint scent wafted through the air – a mix of sandalwood and cedar, transporting her back to lazy Sunday afternoons spent together in their cozy home.

She turned to see a stack of letters, tied with a faded ribbon, nestled among the stacks of old files and textbooks. Her heart skipped a beat as she recognized the handwriting – her husband's.\n\nWith trembling hands, she untied the ribbon and began to read the contents, her voice barely above a whisper as the words spilled out onto the page:\n\n\"I'm so sorry it has to end like this. I know how much you hate the way things are, but please... don't hate me.\"\n\nThe words cut deep, leaving her breathless and cold. A chill crept up her spine as she felt the weight of years of resentment and anger slowly seep into her bones. For the first time in decades, she allowed herself to feel the hatred she'd been suppressing all these years – towards him, towards life, towards everything that had torn them apart.\n\nIn that moment, the room seemed to shrink, the shadows closing in around her like a shroud. The silence was oppressive, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved pain. As she finished reading the last letter, a sob escaped her lips, and she knew she wasn't alone in her sorrow – or her rage.<|eot_id|>",

My ex, Alex, had left me a text saying he was moving on – no surprise there – but what really got my blood boiling was that his new partner was a pediatrician. A pediatrician!\n\nI thought about how we used to talk about our future kids, and now she was practically holding a mini-me in her arms.

Her gaze drifted back to the receipt, her mind racing. Maybe he wanted to remind her that life went on, even after their divorce. Perhaps he genuinely wanted to share a happy memory. She felt a pang in her chest, but pushed the thought aside. She knew she was being silly, letting emotions get the better of her. Taking a deep breath, Emma stood up and began to gather her things. She figured it would be best to leave the receipt alone, focusing instead on the task at hand. As she headed toward the door, she caught a glimpse of Rachel watching her.

        "Generated Assessment": "Are you kidding me? I’ve spent all morning planning this lesson, and now it’s ruined because my goddamn printer decided to crap out on me. I swear, that thing must hate me. First, it jams every five seconds, and then it just stops working altogether. Great, just what I needed. A classroom full of rowdy teenagers waiting for me to get my act together. I glance around the room, expecting to see a sea of expectant faces. But instead, I see a bunch of kids staring at their phones, completely unimpressed by my misfortune. Typical. Great job, universe. Just peachy. My carefully crafted lesson plans go down the drain because of your incompetence. Thanks a lot. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the frustration. Maybe it’s not the end of the world. Maybe I can still salvage this lesson. But as I look around the room, I realize that everyone else seems to be having more fun than me. Even the kids who are supposed to be learning today are getting a kick out of my misery. Well, excuse me for not being able to pull off a superhero impression like everyone else. Can’t a girl even get a break around here?"
