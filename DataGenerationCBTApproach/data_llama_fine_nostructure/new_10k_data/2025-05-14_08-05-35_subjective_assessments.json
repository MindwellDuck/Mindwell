Her husband had helped with the cleanup, but she'd insisted on finishing the task herself, wanting everything spotless before he got up for work. Now, as she gazed out the window, watching her children playing in the backyard, she felt a familiar ache – a sense of being forgotten, of not being seen.\n\nHer mind began to wander to all the times like this – when she was too busy with work or taking care of the kids to notice his absence, to remember his birthday or his favorite foods. She thought about how many nights they'd eaten takeout because she didn't feel like cooking, or how often he'd fallen asleep on the couch while she watched TV alone.\n\nThe dishes still needed washing, but her attention drifted away from them, lost in thoughts of feeling invisible. The silence between her and her family seemed to grow thicker, heavier, until it felt like a weight pressing down on her chest.<|eot_id|>",

The silence was deafening, punctuated only by the occasional chirp of a bird or the rumble of traffic. He felt like a ghost drifting through his own home, invisible and alone.

As he continued looking at the pictures, he found himself wondering what other things might have been different if they hadn't lost each other. Would they still be there today? Would they still be able to share meals or play games together? Were they really meant to spend their days alone, or was everything supposed to work out differently somehow? But then again, who knows? Maybe he wouldn’t have met her if they didn’t lose each other. Or maybe he wouldn’t have known her if they weren’t apart.
