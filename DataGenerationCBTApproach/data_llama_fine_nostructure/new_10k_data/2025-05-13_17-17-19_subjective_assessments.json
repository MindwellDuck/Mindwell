He hesitated before answering, knowing it would be another call from the department about a case gone wrong. Again. He took a deep breath and answered, his voice detached as he listened to the officer on the other end.\n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mix of excuses and half-truths. He couldn't remember the exact timeline, but he knew he'd been late, again. And again. The officer's tone remained calm, but the words cut deep.\n\nHe hung up, the phone slipping from his fingers as he slumped against the counter. Water dripped onto the floor, a steady beat that echoed the pounding in his chest. He stared at his reflection in the mirror, eyes that seemed foreign, eyes that didn't belong to him.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot he wasn't alone. He saw his wife standing behind him, her gentle smile and quiet reassurance washing over him like a wave. But when he turned around, she was gone, leaving only the echoes of his own failure.<|eot_id|>",

But this wasn't about him; it was about the system that seemed determined to keep him from doing anything he wanted. He thought of all the patients who didn't have access to decent healthcare, who suffered because they couldn't afford the medications he took every day.\n\nThe nurse's voice trailed off as she backed away slowly, her eyes darting toward the intercom on the wall.

Well, I’ve got news for you, pal: you can take your holier-than-thou attitude and shove it where the sun doesn’t shine! You want to talk about getting upset? How about when I had to deal with the same thing you did yesterday? And you know why?
