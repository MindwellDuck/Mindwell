Three years of therapy, of trying to move on, of telling myself I was better off without her – and yet here I am, still questioning everything.\n\nI stared at the stack of files in front of me, the ones I'd spent weeks researching, the ones I was supposed to be working on now. But they just seemed so... pointless. Like I was wasting my time, like someone was playing some twisted game with me.\n\nI glanced around the cramped, cluttered office, feeling like I was being watched. The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy, casting eerie shadows on the walls. Every creak of the old building, every rustle of papers, made me jump.\n\nAnd then I saw it – a small note, tucked between the pages of my notebook. 'Meet me at the coffee shop at 5.' No signature, no explanation. Just a simple, straightforward message.\n\nWho could have written it? And why? Was it some kind of prank? A joke?\n\nI felt my mind racing, spinning out of control. I thought I knew who might have left it – my ex-wife, maybe, or one of my colleagues. But what if it wasn't anyone I knew? What if it was something more?\n\nI glared at the note, my eyes burning with frustration. Why did this have to happen now? Why couldn't I just leave it alone?\n\nWith a growl, I crumpled the note in my hand and tossed it into the trash can. But as I stood up, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror behind my chair. My eyes were wild, my face pale.\n\nAnd suddenly, the whole room seemed to spin around me. I stumbled backwards, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nWhat was going on? Who was watching me?

It had been five years since John's passing, yet the ache in her chest still felt like an open wound.\n\nHer eyes wandered to the hospital's community garden, where a group of volunteers were tending to a small plot of flowers and herbs. A young mother, no more than twenty-five, was kneeling beside them, gently coaxing a wilting bloom back to life. Margaret felt a pang of guilt as she watched the woman's tender touch, remembering the countless times she had forgotten to water the plants in their own backyard.\n\nShe recalled the day John passed away, how she had promised herself she would take better care of their garden, just as he had always taken care of her. But life had other plans, and now their home stood empty, a constant reminder of her failure to fulfill that promise.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, the sound of rustling leaves and chirping birds seemed to mock her, transporting her back to the happy times they shared together. She remembered the way John would wake her up every morning with a bouquet of fresh flowers from their garden, and how they would sit together on the porch, watching the sunset and talking about their dreams.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized she had spent decades putting others' needs before her own, while neglecting the one person who truly mattered. The weight of those unfulfilled promises crushed her, leaving her feeling lost and alone once again.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Margaret turned away from the window, her gaze drifting to the stack of unpaid bills on her desk. She knew she needed to face reality, but the thought of starting anew, without John by her side, was almost too much to bear. The guilt threatened to consume her, suffocating her beneath its oppressive weight, as she wondered if she would ever find peace again.<|eot_id|>",

Some even speculated that he had made enemies among the occult crowd, and that these people might have had a hand in his demise.

She had always been sensitive to things like this, and the idea that someone could die in such a brutal manner left her shaken. It wasn't just the news article itself that unsettled her; it was the feeling of being connected to the events unfolding. She imagined the victim walking down a dark alleyway, followed by unseen forces that would eventually lead him to his fate. She pictured the scene vividly, the darkness seeming to swirl around him like a living entity. The air grew thick with tension, and Margaret felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up as she sensed something sinister lurking just beyond the edge of perception. Suddenly, she heard a knock at the door. It was her neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, who looked worried. \"Have you heard?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \"There's been another incident.\" Margaret nodded, her mind still"
