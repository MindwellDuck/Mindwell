As he browsed through the aisles, his eyes landed on a new set of high-quality brushes he'd been eyeing. But when he reached for them, he noticed they were from a brand his late wife had always raved about – one she'd bought him years ago before her passing.\n\nThe memory of their happy moments spent painting together flooded back, and for a moment, he felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him. However, as he picked up a brush, the faint scent of lavender wafted off it, a fragrance his wife used to love but hated herself. The sudden clash of emotions made his stomach turn, and he felt a bitter taste in his mouth. He quickly set the brushes back on the shelf, unable to bear the sight and smell anymore.<|eot_id|>",
