It was the last day of school before summer break, and she had always enjoyed this time of year. However, as she scanned the room, her eyes landed on a stack of ungraded papers and a reminder on her phone about the upcoming parent-teacher conferences.\n\nHer mind started racing with thoughts of all the parents who would be expecting detailed feedback from her, but she knew she still hadn't finished grading most of the assignments. She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach as she thought about the looming deadline and the worry that she wouldn't be able to meet it.\n\nAs she turned to leave the classroom, one of her students approached her, asking if they could discuss something about the upcoming math test. She forced a smile and nodded, trying to reassure them that everything would be fine, but inside, her anxiety was spiraling out of control. The student's question was just the spark that set off a chain reaction of panic, leaving her breathless and wondering how she was going to get everything done on time.<|eot_id|>",

But what really caught my attention was the way she kept glancing at her watch, like she was counting down the seconds until she could go home. It made me wonder if she was stressed because she wasn’t used to working hard, or maybe she’s just really bad at managing her time. Either way, it didn’t look good for her students who were waiting for their grades. I bet some of them will even ask for extensions if they don’t like their results. This is why I wish teachers took more breaks during the school day—they need to relax sometimes! It’s pretty clear that she won’t make it through the week without needing an emergency coffee refill. Maybe she’ll even skip work tomorrow and come back late on Monday, which would put everyone behind schedule."

Instead, a half-finished mess of burnt oranges and purples stared back at her.

She recalled the countless hours they'd spent together, side by side, painting and laughing. Now, those memories felt like a distant dream.\n\nAs she gazed at the canvas, her eyes landed on a piece she'd completed years ago, one that had brought her critical acclaim and a small fortune. It was now framed and hung proudly above her desk, a painful contrast to the unfinished work before her.\n\nThe doorbell rang, breaking the silence. It was her daughter, calling to remind her about the upcoming art show at school. A pang of resentment hit her chest as she thought about how her ex would likely attend and get to relive their past through his own child's accomplishments.\n\nWith a swift motion, she dipped her brush into the paint and scrubbed it across the canvas, erasing the last remnants of what could have been a masterpiece. The sound echoed through the room, a harsh reminder of the bitter taste in her mouth.<|eot_id|>",

As he sipped his latte, he noticed people around him enjoying their own drinks. Some were chatting with friends, while others sat alone, reading books or working on their laptops. There was even a group of children playing quietly near the window, their laughter filling the air. But he just felt sad again, remembering how he used to enjoy these moments with her. She loved coming to this café whenever she could, always ordering the same drink as me. Nowadays, it's just another reminder of what I've lost. I wish I could still see her smile or hear her laugh.

I assumed that Rachel's warm smile was genuine, but why did my heart skip a beat when she approached? Wasn't it just because I was excited for our date tonight? No, no, it must be something deeper. Her words were laced with a subtle warmth, almost as if she was trying to reassure me. But then again, maybe she was just being polite. Maybe everyone noticed how we interacted, and it made them uncomfortable. That would explain why they kept glancing over at us. Or perhaps...perhaps they admired how well we worked together, how our banter added a spark to the kitchen. But why did that thought make me feel even more anxious? What if Rachel didn't mean anything by her comment? What if it was just a reflexive thing, something she said without thinking?
