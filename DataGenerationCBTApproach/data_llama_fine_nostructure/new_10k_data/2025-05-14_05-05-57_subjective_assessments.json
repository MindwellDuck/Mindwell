He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach, a sense of frustration and helplessness that he hadn't experienced since his own divorce.\n\nThe teacher next to him shot him a sympathetic glance, but even her understanding expression only made him feel more annoyed. Why did parents think they knew better? Didn't they realize that he was trying his best?\n\nThe phone rang, shrill and insistent, breaking the tension momentarily. It was the school administrator, reminding him about the upcoming parent-teacher conference that would have to take place despite his protests. The teacher let out a quiet sigh, feeling the weight of responsibility bearing down on him once again.<|eot_id|>",

Either way, I knew she was hiding something. And I was going to find out exactly what it was. I watched her as she sat in her office, trying to look confident while I heard her talk to a patient. They seemed so calm, so trusting. It was almost...too good to be true. My gut told me that whatever she said, it would end badly. I could practically see the disaster brewing inside her.

His coworker noticed his gaze drifting toward the couple and asked if everything was okay. I just miss my ex-wife, he replied, his voice tinged with sadness. She would have loved that new smartphone. He remembered how excited she was when he surprised her with one last year. It wasn’t much, but it made me feel happy. I never thought I’d be stuck working alone again, especially after our divorce. My coworkers seemed content with their relationships; they didn’t have to work long hours. Even though I enjoyed the quiet time, I couldn’t help but feel left out. Whenever I saw couples like the ones who came into the store, I wondered what it would be like to have someone by my side. It’s hard not to compare myself to others when everyone around me has found love. Their happiness feels like a slap in the face, making me question whether I’ll ever experience something similar. I try to push those thoughts aside, focusing on my work instead, but it’s difficult not to let jealousy creep in. Every day, I see couples laughing together, holding hands, or sharing romantic moments. Meanwhile, I’m here alone, waiting tables, and dreaming of what could’ve been. Sometimes, I wonder if I’m meant to be single forever, but deep down, I know that’s not true. It’s just hard to shake off these feelings of loneliness."
