He had been looking forward to this event all week, hoping to reconnect with some old colleagues from his residency days. As he scanned the room, his eyes landed on a familiar face – Dr. Rachel Patel, who had been his closest friend during med school.\n\nShe caught his eye and smiled warmly, but before she could make her way over, another woman stepped in front of her, laughing at something one of the younger residents said. The woman was young, probably in her mid-twenties, and radiated confidence and charm. Dr. Patel's smile faltered, and she excused herself to refill her drink, leaving Dr. Thompson feeling awkward and overlooked.\n\nAs the evening wore on, Dr. Thompson found himself gravitating toward the periphery of the gathering, feeling like an outsider looking in.

It wasn't that he didn't want to have fun; it was simply that he couldn't shake off the feeling of being left behind. The more he tried to join in, the more it seemed to slip through his fingers, like sand between his toes. It wasn't just the lack of connection that bothered him; it was the way everyone else seemed to fit seamlessly into the group. They were having so much fun—laughing, spinning around the dance floor, and even taking selfies together. Meanwhile, Dr. Thompson felt like an outsider, stuck on the periphery, watching everything unfold. He couldn't help but think that maybe he was just too old for this kind of thing. Maybe he needed to accept that he'd always be on the outside looking in. It wasn't fair to expect himself to keep up when no one else seemed to care about his presence. After all, if they wanted to hang out, they would have invited him sooner. Now, it seemed like they thought he was just there as a nostalgic afterthought—a relic of a bygone era. Why bother trying? There was nothing he could contribute, and it wouldn't change anything anyway."

My father passed away when I was young, but I still feel like I've been living in a state of limbo ever since. It's no wonder I'm so lonely now.

You’re doing great.\" Note: This response reflects the distorted thinking pattern \"emotional reasoning\" because it lets the emotions of the situation guide the attitude and judgment, rather than objective facts. By saying \"You're doing great\", the speaker is expressing empathy and support based solely on the emotional state of the individual (sadness) rather than providing a more neutral assessment of their situation.
