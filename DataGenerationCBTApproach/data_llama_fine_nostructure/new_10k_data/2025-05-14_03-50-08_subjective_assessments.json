He knew he had to shake off the feeling, to focus on the patients still waiting for help, but his legs felt heavy, unresponsive to his will. As he turned away from the sink, his gaze fell upon a photo on his desk – a picture of himself and his wife, smiling and happy. It seemed like a lifetime ago.<|eot_id|>",

He remembered the desperate look in her eyes, the tears she’d tried so hard to hide. It seemed cruel that he’d been unable to save her, especially after all he had promised. He wondered if there were things he could have done differently, if there was anything he could’ve said or done that might have changed the outcome. The questions swirled in his head, refusing to settle, much like the endless stream of patients he struggled to keep track of. Every moment felt like an eternity, and yet time slipped through his fingers like sand. He felt overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a doctor, burdened by the weight of those whose lives he touched. In this state, nothing seemed right; even the simplest tasks felt impossible. The silence in the hospital seemed oppressive, a physical force pressing down on him. It made him wonder if anyone truly cared about the patients anymore, or if we’re all just going through the motions. He thought about the photo of him and his wife, smiling and content.

The woman had been a young single mother, diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\nAs the nurse watched, a news report flickered across the TV screen behind the counter, highlighting a breakthrough in immunotherapy treatments for rare childhood cancers. Memories of her late colleague flooded back: the countless sleepless nights, the endless meetings with families, and the quiet moments of connection with patients like Sarah, who had left behind two young children.\n\nThe sound of clinking dishes and muted conversations faded into the background as she stared blankly at the TV, her eyes welling up with tears.

I'm just an invisible presence, always watching, always waiting for something better. But it never comes. It never will. I'll keep going through the motions, pretending to be okay, but inside, I'm dying. The world keeps spinning, and I'm just along for the ride, silently suffering. Why can't anything ever get better? Why does everything have to stay the same? It's not like I'm looking for answers. I just wish I could turn off my emotions sometimes. I wish I could forget how much I hurt. I wish I could stop feeling like I'm drowning in sadness. But no, instead, I'm trapped here, alone, with nothing but my thoughts. And those thoughts are screaming for help, begging someone to listen.

If anyone else had treated me like that, they’d be facing legal consequences. But because I’m just a poor single mom trying to make ends meet, no one cares about me. I'm sick of people like her who think they're above the law. This whole experience has left me feeling drained and frustrated. When will things ever get better? I hate dealing with people like her who don’t care about others. They’re all selfish and arrogant, always thinking they can walk all over us whenever they feel like it. Life is never fair when you have people like her around. No wonder I’ve developed anxiety – it’s exhausting dealing with situations like these constantly.

Honestly, I think my outburst was more due to the fact that I was tired from a late night and just needed some caffeine to wake me up. Maybe if I'd gotten my coffee sooner, I wouldn't have been so short-tempered. But no, instead, I let my frustration boil over and snapped at the poor barista. That wasn't fair to him, and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. But I guess I just couldn't help myself in that moment. Anyway, this whole thing has left me feeling pretty crummy about myself.
