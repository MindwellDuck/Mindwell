Plus, my brother-in-law has a friend working as an art consultant in town. Maybe he can help me get my foot in the door. She had been struggling to make ends meet as an artist, but her sister's steady job made things easier. Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was failing somehow. Every rejection felt like another reminder that she wasn’t good enough. As she packed away her paints, she wondered how many other artists struggled just like her – some even more than her.

They could share the load together, support each other, and maybe even find comfort in knowing they weren't alone. Meanwhile, she was left to navigate the world by herself, struggling to keep up with the endless tasks that came with caring for her two children.

But now, standing amidst the chaos, I could see glimpses of the real her - impatient, maybe even careless when it came to things that didn't directly impact customer satisfaction. That messy herb spill wasn't just an accident; it was a symptom of something deeper — a lack of attention to detail that had been building up inside her for months. ## Explanation This response reflects the cognitive distortion 'Labeling/Global Labeling'. It starts by presenting the individual as a whole, with the intention of painting them negatively. This is done through phrases such as 'perfect candidate,' which labels the person based on their potential for advancement, implying they are either capable or incapable. Then, by describing her as 'impatient, maybe even careless,' it applies a fixed, negative judgment to her entire personality, suggesting she lacks the necessary level of professionalism required in the workplace. This behavior is then linked to a specific incident (the"
