The hospital was understaffed again, and the team was already stretched thin. A new patient had been admitted overnight – a young mother of two, critically injured in a car accident.\n\nAs he scanned the chart, his mind began to wander to his own family. His ex-wife had been absent from their children's lives for months now, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt every time he saw another frazzled parent rushing through the hospital doors. He thought about the missed birthday parties, the forgotten bedtime stories, and the silence that filled their home on weekends.\n\nJust then, the shift supervisor called out his name, assigning him to the trauma unit. As he made his way to the OR, the beeping of machines and the murmurs of anxious families created a cacophony of stress. He felt his anxiety spike, mirroring the chaos around him, and wondered if he was cut out for this job anymore.<|eot_id|>",

As their eyes met, she playfully rolled hers and whispered something in his direction, causing him to feel a familiar sting of resentment. He had always thought he was the center of attention, the love of her life, and now it seemed like she'd moved on with someone who didn't even try to hide his infatuation.\n\nAs the group began discussing their upcoming tournament, he couldn't help but notice the way his opponent, a young doctor, was effortlessly explaining complex medical concepts to the table. It was almost as if he thought himself superior, just like some of the patients he'd dealt with over the years. The young doctor's smug expression made him think of all the times his own expertise had been overlooked by his late wife, who had always taken a more nurturing approach to medicine.\n\nThe conversation turned to their favorite sports team, and he found himself disagreeing with everyone except one other player, an older woman who shared his passion for the game. She teased him about being a grumpy old man, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that she was trying to outdo him, to prove that he wasn't as relevant as he once thought.<|eot_id|>",

And when he heard they were going on vacation together soon, he imagined her cuddling with him in bed while the new guy stood guard outside. Every little thing seemed like a cruel joke, making him feel like the biggest fool alive. The worst part? Everyone around him seemed to be moving on with their lives, while he was still stuck in this dark place. Even the people at work who used to talk about having kids with their partners now seemed to have given up on finding love. It was like they’d accepted their fate and were just waiting for the inevitable. Meanwhile, he was still holding on to hope, which only made things worse. Now, whenever he saw couples walking hand-in-hand, he couldn’t help but feel like he was missing out on something so basic.

But today, as he watched the young couple browse through the electronics, something inside him snapped. Why were they so perfect? They seemed to have it all together, with their effortless banter and affectionate touches. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out how to pay bills on time. How could someone like me expect to feel anything else but resentment? It's just that everyone around me has moved on—friends, family, even coworkers. They've found partners who make them happy, while I'm stuck here, watching them live their best lives. Every time I see couples like that, it feels like another punch to the gut. I don't know why I bother coming back to work if no one is ever going to care about me. Maybe I'll just quit and move away; maybe I'll get better off being alone. But deep down, there's a part of me that wishes things could be different. Maybe if I had been more attractive, or successful, or just...better, then I wouldn't be stuck here. Instead of feeling resentful, perhaps I could try to understand where I went wrong."

As he watched the liquid spread across the counter, he wondered if there was something deeper going on, some subconscious message from his past that kept getting in the way of his success. Maybe it was more than just accidents; maybe it was a sign that he was never meant to succeed, that he was destined to fail because he was flawed. The thought made him angry, and he started to wonder if he deserved better, if someone who truly cared would have prevented these mishaps from happening. But the more he thought about it, the more he realized that maybe he didn’t deserve good luck anyway, that everyone else was just waiting for him to slip up so they could say “I told you so.” He shook his head, trying to clear the thoughts, but the image of the broken microscope stayed with him, fueling his anger and sense of injustice. The frustration was starting to get to him, making him wonder if he was even cut out for this job, if he was just pretending to be a scientist until he could find the real one.

Like she was pretending to teach, but I could tell she was somewhere else entirely. She barely looked at my notes, let alone tried to engage with the class. Even when I asked her questions, her responses were quick and distracted, as if she was just going through the motions. I wondered if she was okay, if everything was alright. But whenever I tried to ask more, she would brush me off, saying she needed to focus on the lesson. It felt weird, almost as if she was trying to avoid talking to me.
