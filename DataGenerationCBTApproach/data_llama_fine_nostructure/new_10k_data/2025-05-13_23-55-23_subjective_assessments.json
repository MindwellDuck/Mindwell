Didn't he understand that I was suffocating under the weight of all this responsibility?\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of overwhelm, but it only seemed to intensify as I gazed out the window, watching our two-year-old play happily in the park below.

It was exhausting, and I was running out of steam.\n\nAs my husband gave me a gentle nudge back towards the task at hand, I forced a weak smile onto my face, knowing that I couldn't let anyone see the desperation creeping in. But the truth was, I didn't know how much more I could keep holding on before everything came crashing down.<|eot_id|>",
