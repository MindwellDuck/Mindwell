Why did they think he could handle this much stress alone? And yet, he knew better than to speak his mind. Not after what happened last time. So instead, he went about his rounds, silently seething. The parents deserved a piece of his mind, but he kept it locked away, letting frustration simmer beneath the surface. As he moved from room to room, he saw the worst-case scenarios unfolding before his eyes. A patient with a history of abuse, screaming because no one understood them. A family torn apart by illness, blaming doctors like him for their pain. He tried to remain detached, to focus on the task at hand, but it was hard when every interaction felt like a betrayal. In the end, it was just another exhausting shift, filled with pointless arguments and unfulfilled needs. Dr. Lee couldn't shake the feeling that he was losing himself in the process, that he was becoming exactly what he hated - a bitter, resentful man.

These thoughts are normal, but we need to separate them from reality. Let's focus on what we know for sure: 1. **Your wife is there because she loves you**: Think about how much time you've spent together, all the memories you've created, and the love you share. This foundation is strong, and it doesn't change just because you have some doubts. 2. **There's no evidence of other people**: You haven't seen anyone else flirting with Sarah, and you're confident in your own worthiness. 3. **You're doing well today**: Focus on the positive aspects of your day, like finishing the project and enjoying the evening with Sarah. Don't let these thoughts distract you from the good things happening around you. Try to ground yourself in what you know for certain. Remember, relationships involve ups and downs, but the core connection you share with Sarah remains strong. Take a deep breath and enjoy the rest"
