The adrenaline still pulsed through her veins from the high-speed chase they'd just ended, but it was quickly giving way to a cold, hard anger.\n\nIt wasn't the first time he'd done this – shrugged off her feelings like they were nothing more than a minor inconvenience – but it still stung. She'd tried to talk to him about it before, during their shift, when they were supposed to be supporting each other, not pushing each other away.\n\nNow, as the cool evening air wrapped around her, she felt a familiar burn building in her chest. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down, but her eyes remained fixed on the taillights disappearing into the distance.<|eot_id|>",

Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his heart rate quickened. He rubbed the fatigue from his eyes, feeling the weight of his responsibilities bearing down on him.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his lab partner.

But after two years of marriage, he'd grown disenchanted with her dedication to work, saying it made him feel like he wasn't a priority.\n\nAs she entered patient data into the computer, her eyes landed on a recent message from her ex, asking about their daughter's birthday party schedule. A pang of sadness hit her chest, and she felt a lump form in her throat.

The conversation turned to social media, where everyone was sharing photos of happy families and couples. One post in particular caught her eye – a picture of her ex-husband and his new girlfriend, smiling and holding hands at a beachside resort.\n\nFor a moment, she felt like she was drowning in despair, unable to catch her breath.
