The data was inconclusive, and the project was running behind schedule. Her partner, Rachel, was expecting their first child in six months, and the pressure to deliver results was mounting.\n\nAs she watched, her colleague casually mentioned the breakthrough they'd made last week, one that they hadn't shared with anyone yet.

It's really weird because we used to be friends back when we worked together. We even hung out outside of work a few times, but I guess those days are behind us now. When he got laid off, I offered to let him stay at my place until he found a new job, but he declined. Maybe he didn't want to put himself in a situation where he'd have to rely on me again? Either way, it looks like he's moved on and is focusing on his own career now. That makes sense - after all, life moves fast, and people can change a lot in just a short amount of time. Who knows what brought him down this path? Maybe it's just one of those things that happens when you get older and realize there's more to life than just doing what you love. Anyway, it's clear he's not the same guy I knew, but maybe that's good. People grow up, and they evolve. You can't keep holding onto the past forever.
