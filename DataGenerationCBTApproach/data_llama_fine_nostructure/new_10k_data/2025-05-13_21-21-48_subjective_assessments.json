She tries to focus on scanning the next item, but her eyes drift towards the clock on the wall – 4:45 PM. Her shift ends in less than an hour, but it feels like an eternity.\n\nAs the customer leaves and the store grows quiet, the cashier's thoughts turn to her own uncertain future.

It's hard not to feel like an outsider when everyone else is so close to their \"final days.\" They've already received their final paychecks, and some have even started planning their post-work life – moving back home, traveling, or simply enjoying their free time. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, wondering what could happen to me. I've seen my friends let go over the past few years, and now I'm starting to worry that I'll be next. I try to push those thoughts aside and focus on my work, but it's difficult. Every time I see someone chatting with a friend or laughing with another coworker, I feel like I don't belong. It's not just the layoffs; it's everything else too. When I think about the store closing down entirely, I can't help but wonder if I'll lose my apartment, my car, and everything else I've worked so hard for. My anxiety builds, making it harder to concentrate. The noise around me fades away, and all I can hear are my doubts whispering in my ear. \"You're going to get laid off"

As she speaks, a veteran sergeant from decades ago interrupts, loudly disputing the details of a high-profile case, claiming it was mishandled by the younger officer's team.\n\nThe sergeant's words cut through the somber atmosphere, and the older officer's eyes narrow as memories long buried resurface. She recalls the countless nights spent working late shifts, struggling to make ends meet after her husband's passing, and the senseless loss of her partner in that same high-profile case – all triggered by the very mistakes this young officer now faces.<|eot_id|>",

He even questioned the officer’s integrity for handling a case that went horribly wrong. It's hard not to think that he might have some personal vendetta against our new generation of officers. But honestly, we're all so proud of them for stepping up and taking on the tough cases. We know they've worked tirelessly to get everything right—especially when things got really rough after [partner's death]. They shouldn't be made to feel like they’re being scrutinized again. It's such a shame that someone would bring up those painful memories at this time. Instead, let's focus on honoring our fallen officers and celebrating the good work of our current ones. It feels like everyone else in the room understood that too, but somehow, it wasn't enough. Now, I'm left wondering if anyone else saw how uncomfortable that must have been for them.

I might as well accept that marriage was a lost cause forever. This realization made me feel relieved, actually – relieved that I wouldn’t have to deal with the disappointment and pain of failed relationships or divorce. Not having a partner meant I wouldn’t have to worry about those things. My decision was final: I would never get married, and I knew it with absolute certainty. There’s no way I’ll ever find a wife. I’m too old for that anyway. And besides, I’ve been alone for so long that I don’t think I can ever recover from it. There’s no use trying – I’m simply not meant to be married. I’ve accepted that my life will remain solitary, and I won’t let myself hope anymore. The idea of finding love is nothing more than a distant dream, which I can safely dismiss.
