It was a gesture he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months – a reminder that some things still brought him joy, even in the midst of grief.\n\nAs he gazed at the flowers, memories of his wife flooded his mind. He remembered the way she used to smile when they walked through fields of sunflowers together, their children laughing and chasing after butterflies. The sound of her laughter still echoed in his ears, but it was a bittersweet reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nA patrol car pulled up beside him, its siren blaring softly as the officer inside called out, \"Hey, buddy, need a ride?\" He hesitated, unsure if he could face another day of paperwork and meetings, of pretending everything was okay when it wasn't.\n\nThe officer's voice broke the spell, and he forced himself to take a deep breath. He nodded curtly, tucking the bouquet into his pocket as he followed the officer to the cruiser. As they drove away from the precinct, the sunflowers seemed to wilt slightly in his pocket, a poignant reminder of the fragility of beauty and the depth of his sorrow.<|eot_id|>",

But it wasn't her name on the title slide – it was her ex-husband's.\n\nThe words 'Collaboration on Neuroregulation Project' stared back at her, accompanied by a photo of him smiling beside their former research partner. A chill ran down her spine as she recalled the way he'd taken credit for her work, effortlessly gliding into their joint paper like they were a single unit.\n\nHer gaze narrowed, tracing the lines of text where his name appeared. Each word felt like a personal affront, a deliberate attempt to erase her contribution. She clenched her fists beneath the table, her knuckles white with suppressed rage. For a moment, the only sound was the soft hum of machinery and the quiet hiss of air conditioning.\n\nThen, her fingers began to move, scrolling through the slides with a calculated precision. Every click, every swipe, seemed to fuel her growing resentment. The presentation morphed into a digital representation of the countless nights she'd spent pouring over data, only to have him swoop in and claim it as his own.

But honestly, I've been working double shifts since the last project. Is it really too much to ask her to pay attention? When I asked her if everything was okay, she just shrugged it off and said, “You know how it is.” Well, I don’t know how it is, because every single time she leaves out something, it’s like she wants me to fail. And it's not like I haven't made mistakes either; I just try harder than she does, and she takes credit for everything. It's so unfair. This isn't the first time she's done something like this. Last week, she forgot to pick up my favorite snacks, and then had the nerve to act like nothing was wrong when I confronted her.

Even his old college roommate, Alex, had started a successful business and moved to California, leaving him behind with nothing but regrets. He wondered if Mike would even notice him if he showed up at his wedding. Would he care enough to put down his glass of champagne and listen to his ramblings? Even his own family didn't seem to understand him anymore. His parents were distant, and his younger sister barely recognized him when she visited home. They never asked how his day was or what he did after work – they just assumed he spent his evenings watching Netflix alone again.
