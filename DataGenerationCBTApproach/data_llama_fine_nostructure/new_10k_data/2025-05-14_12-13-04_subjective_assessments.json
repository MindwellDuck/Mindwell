It wasn’t fair that they got off so lightly, especially when they knew better than most adults how quickly things could spiral out of control. As he watched them walk away, he couldn’t help but feel frustrated and resentful towards the system. Why did some people get away with everything? What made this kid’s life seem easier than everyone else’s? It wasn’t just about the vandalism; it was about how they treated authority figures like they owed them nothing. That smirk from the teen, the way they laughed and joked while ignoring the warnings, it all added up. He knew there were other incidents just like this one – and it never seemed to end well for anyone involved. Even if they managed to avoid trouble now, he wondered if they would eventually pay the price for their actions. It was unfair that they didn’t understand the gravity of their mistakes until it was too late. Why did some people think they were above the law?
