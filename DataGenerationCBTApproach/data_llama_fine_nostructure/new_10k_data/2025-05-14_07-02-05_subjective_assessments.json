The stench lingered long enough to make her wrinkle her nose, and she shot him a disapproving glance. He was used to her fussiness about presentation, but this seemed particularly egregious – he'd always been diligent about taking out the trash before cooking.\n\nHer eyes narrowed as she began to re-garnish the dishes, trying to distract herself from the lingering smell. But every time she caught his eye, she felt a twinge of annoyance. She knew it was irrational; he wasn't intentionally trying to upset her. Still, the memory of the overpowering stench lingered, making her skin prickle with distaste.<|eot_id|>",

If she had just taken out the trash before starting prep, none of this would have happened. Instead, she lets him leave the trash can open until right before plating, which makes everything smell terrible. She even knows I hate strong smells—why does she have to ruin my day with such thoughtlessness? And now, because we're in high-pressure mode tonight, she's being way too hard on me. This is all just an excuse for her to feel superior since I messed up the garnishing earlier."

But when the dish was presented, she hesitated, then politely declined, saying it didn't sound appetizing anymore. She opted for something else instead.

As she worked, her mind wandered to the upcoming anniversary, and how she would spend it alone.\n\nJust then, her phone rang, shrill in the stillness. It was her daughter, calling to check in before dinner. A warm smile spread across her face, but it faltered when she heard the tone of concern in her voice. Her daughter asked about the new recipe book, one that promised to simplify classic dishes. \"I thought you'd like it,\" the daughter said, \"but I guess I wasn't thinking.\"\n\nThe chef's hands stilled, the knife hovering above the cutting board. For a moment, she forgot where she was, lost in memories of her husband's eyes lighting up over a perfectly cooked meal.
