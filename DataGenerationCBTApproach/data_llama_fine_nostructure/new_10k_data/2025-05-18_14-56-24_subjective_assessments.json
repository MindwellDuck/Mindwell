Another day, another dollar, another chance to pretend I care about these mindless shoppers who think the world revolves around their damned opinions.\n\nI clocked in, exchanged pleasantries with Karen from accounting – because, of course, we had to have small talk before the chaos ensues – and began restocking the shelves. My back ached from yesterday's lifting, but what did it matter? It wasn't like anyone cared.\n\nSome moron comes up to me, hands me a can of expired soup, and asks if I can 'find something similar.' Similar?! This thing's been sitting on clearance since the Clinton administration! They must've thought they were buying some sort of gourmet delicacy.\n\nI took it, smiled, and muttered something about 'let me check,' all while seething inside. As I scanned it at the register, my eyes wandered to the wanted posters on the wall – 'Most Wanted' in all caps, featuring the faces of customers who'd tried to return products after the time limit expired. Ha! Like that'd happen to me.\n\nA kid, probably around 10, looked up at me with those big, innocent eyes and asked if Santa was coming this year. What a joke. I forced a smile, lied about the magic of Christmas, and wondered when someone was gonna come along and tell him the truth – that his old man's too busy working for minimum wage to buy him any presents.\n\nAnother day, another dollar, another reminder that life's just one long, never-ending cycle of disappointment.\"<|eot_id|>",

We were supposed to hang out tonight, but she cancelled at the last minute. Again. She says she's busy with her family or whatever, but I know it's just because she doesn't want to deal with me.\n\nI'm driving home, feeling like crap, when I see him – my ex, Alex. He's standing outside the mall, laughing with some chick who looks way too young for him. My heart sinks and I slam on the brakes, but it's too late. He sees me and gives this smug little smile.\n\nHe gets out of the car and starts walking towards me, all nonchalant like we're old friends or something. Newsflash, Alex: we're not friends.

I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of misery and you're just standing there, smiling at me like we're buddies.\n\nSuddenly, his eyes flicker to my face and he seems to realize what's going on. His expression changes, and for a split second, I see a glimmer of the pain and regret he used to show me.\n\nBut it's too late. The damage is done.

And I was supposed to pick up the pieces? Please.\n\nI thought about all the times she'd promised to help, to support me, but it was all just empty words. She'd show up when it suited her, and then disappear again. Left me to deal with the orders, the customers, the stress. All by myself.\n\nI remembered the first time she'd walked out on us, leaving me to clean up after her. I'd tried to make it work, to convince her to stay. But she'd just laughed, said I was too controlling, that I didn't trust her enough. Like that was my fault.\n\nNow, as I looked around this kitchen, I saw all the reminders of what we'd lost. The faded recipe cards, the worn-out pots, the knives she'd broken. It was all just a mess, just like our marriage.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm down. But it was no use. I was furious, hurt, and angry all at once. Why had she done this to me? Why had she left?\n\nI slammed my hand against the counter, making the pots and pans jump. Stupid kitchen, stupid life. Who needed all this drama anyway? Not me, that's for sure.\n\nBut as I stood there, frozen in anger, something inside me shifted. A tiny spark of sadness ignited, and I felt the weight of my neglect bearing down on me. I wasn't taking care of myself, not really. I was just going through the motions, waiting for someone else to come along and fix everything.\n\nThat realization hit me hard, like a ton of bricks. I realized I'd been neglecting my own needs, my own happiness. And now I was left with nothing but this emptiness, this hollow feeling.\n\nThe kitchen seemed to spin around me, the air thickening with unspoken emotions. I felt like I was drowning in my own regret, my own failures. And in that moment, I knew I had to do something. For myself. For real.<|eot_id|>",
