She forced a faint smile onto her face, exchanging pleasantries with the cashier as the line inched forward, yet couldn't shake the feeling that she was invisible.<|eot_id|>",

They'll be fine until they run out of food. I can't wait for them to realize they made a mistake getting married. At least the cashier didn't think I was being rude. I tried to be nice, but what does it matter? It’s all just an illusion. We’re all just going through the motions, pretending to be happy so we don't look foolish. The cashier is probably just humoring me because she feels sorry for me. If I looked more pathetic, maybe she'd give me a discount. But honestly, it's not like I need groceries right now. My wife... well, let's just say she doesn't care about groceries anymore either. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have better things to do than stand here and waste time feeling sorry for myself.

That would mean he didn't even bother cooking this time. Or maybe I'm just too picky about everything lately and expecting too much from him. Maybe if I told him how much I appreciate his cooking, he wouldn't have gone out of his way to prepare dinner. Now he feels obligated to keep doing it, and I'm just ruining things between us. I feel terrible for letting him think that. Maybe I'm overreacting again, and we're fine. But still, why did he have to cook such an unappreciated meal?

She seems so confident, and I feel like I’m losing ground. I know I’ll bounce back eventually, but it’s hard not to wonder if I’ve missed my chance.

She'd mentioned feeling overwhelmed, but it sounded more like she was struggling to accept the complexity of the cases. When asked for her thoughts on how to manage the workload, her response had been vague, lacking the clarity he expected from someone so new to the team. Her evasiveness made him question whether she truly understood the demands of working in the ICU. The sudden change in his mood caught him off guard.
