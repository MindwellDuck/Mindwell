You're close to exposing them.\"\n\nBut he shook his head. \"I don't know if I can do anything. The system is rigged against us. We'll never get justice for the people who were affected.\"\n\nThe words felt like a punch to the gut, leaving him breathless and defeated.

The cashier seemed nice enough, but she was clearly amused by my attempt to pay with cash. She smiled and said something about needing to see a manager, which meant I had to stand there, embarrassed, while someone else handled the transaction. It’s just annoying because I know I’m being unreasonable. I can’t control everything, and sometimes I need to accept what happens. But it doesn’t make it easier. This is all part of the stress I’ve been carrying around. If only I could get my life back under control… This whole experience feels like a perfect example of how my life isn’t fair. I always seem to end up in these situations where people are looking at me differently than usual. Like the time I spilled coffee on myself and got dirty looks from strangers, or when I accidentally bumped into someone and they looked annoyed. It’s like no matter what I do, I can’t catch a break. And then I’ll think about how I went to therapy recently and they told me I needed to focus more on positivity,"
