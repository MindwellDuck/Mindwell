Her face was red, and her eyes seemed to bore into my soul. That's all because she's so jealous. If she really loved me, she wouldn't have gotten mad over such petty stuff. This isn't our problem; she's the one who always wants to go out. Why can't she understand that we're busy? You never listen when I explain everything. What am I supposed to do? Just stay home and cook dinner while I'm working? It's not fair. You always act like I'm the one who needs help. Like I'm not capable of taking care of ourselves.

A story about a local business owner who had been fined for environmental infractions caught his eye. The owner was someone he had interviewed several times for articles, and their story had always seemed sympathetic.\n\nAs he read the article, a comment from one of his colleagues popped up – a well-known investigative journalist who had worked on several high-profile cases. The comment was scathing, implying that the fined business owner was guilty of gross negligence and should have known better.\n\nA surge of anger and resentment washed over him. He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach as he thought about all the times he had defended this person in his articles, and now they were being vilified by someone he considered a friend. His mind began to replay past conversations, wondering if he had been naive to see things from the business owner's perspective.\n\nThe coffee cup slipped from his fingers, and he knocked it against the counter, making a small splash of liquid.
