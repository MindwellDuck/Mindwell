The kitchen was warm, the scent of garlic and lemon wafting through the air. Her husband, sitting at the table, looked up from his phone and smiled, expecting his favorite dish.\n\nAs she began to serve, her mind wandered back to the fight they'd had two nights prior – the one about his late mother, and how he still missed her so much it felt like a gaping hole in their lives together. The way he spoke about her, with such reverence and love, made her stomach twist with a familiar ache.\n\nHer hands moved on autopilot, the knife slicing through the vegetables with precision. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing him, that no matter what she cooked, it wouldn't fill the void left by his mother's passing. A single tear rolled down her cheek, unnoticed by her husband as he took his first bite, his expression a mask of gratitude and appreciation.\n\nThe silence between them grew thicker, like a fog rolling in off the ocean, until finally, he reached across the table and took her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers in a gentle caress. \"I know,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator. \"I know you're trying.\"<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't until I heard her sob quietly while cooking that I realized something was wrong. I assumed she was upset because I hadn't called her enough since my mom passed away, but when I asked if everything was okay, she just shook her head and said, “It’s fine.” Like that would be enough. I figured she must have been thinking about my mom too, missing our Sunday dinners as much as I did. But why was she acting so distant? When I suggested we order pizza instead, she hesitated before agreeing. As we sat down to eat, I noticed she kept glancing out the window, almost as if she was watching my parents drive by. I couldn’t help but feel hurt and confused—wasn’t she happy that I had finally found someone who cared? Why was she so distant? Did she think she could replace my mom somehow?"

They had been there together just a year before she passed away, and now it felt like an eternity since he'd last held her hand.\n\nThe teacher's phone buzzed, breaking the silence. It was his sister, checking in to see how his week had gone. He hesitated, unsure if he wanted to talk about it, but something about her gentle tone put him at ease. As they chatted, he found himself opening up about the emptiness of his classroom on Fridays, and the feeling of being completely alone in his new life.\n\nHis sister listened attentively, offering words of comfort, but as they said their goodbyes, he couldn't shake off the crushing sense of loneliness that had settled in. The darkness outside seemed to close in around him, and he felt like he was drowning in the quietness of his own home.<|eot_id|>",

We've tried everything, but...it's just not happening.'\n\nHer mind felt like a foggy room – no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't seem to grasp what was going wrong.

Her careless request made him feel like she didn’t respect the work nurses put into their meals. As she walked away, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of frustration. Maybe it was because she had a cute outfit on, which made him feel like she was flaunting her status by getting served first. Or maybe it was how she talked about her job, as if it was easier than anyone else’s. Whatever it was, he couldn’t help but feel resentful whenever he saw her. It wasn’t until later, though, that he realized his true issue lay elsewhere. When they were working together, she always seemed so confident, so sure of herself, while he struggled to keep up.
