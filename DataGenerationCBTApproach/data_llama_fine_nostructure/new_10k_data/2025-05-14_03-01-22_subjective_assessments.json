A shiver ran down his spine as he wondered if she had been here, sneaking around while he slept.\n\nThe classroom seemed quieter than usual, the silence oppressive. He checked the clock on the wall – 8:05 AM. It was too early for the students to arrive. Suddenly, he heard a faint creaking sound from the hallway outside his classroom. His heart racing, he froze, his ears straining to pinpoint the source of the noise.<|eot_id|>",
