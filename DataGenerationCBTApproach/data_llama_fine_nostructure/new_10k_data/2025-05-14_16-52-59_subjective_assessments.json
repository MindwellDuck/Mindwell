The cashier's tone dripped with annoyance as she continued to ring up the new customer's purchases. \n\nA small child began whining loudly, and the mother apologized profusely while trying to soothe it.

My mind started racing with thoughts of how often he'd been late, and I felt myself getting anxious about whether today would be different. My anxiety wasn't just about being late; it was about the emotional toll of those moments. Every time he missed our plans, I felt left behind, like I was waiting for someone who didn’t want to meet me. That moment made me realize how many times he'd done something like this, and how much it affected me. It wasn't just one incident; it was a pattern that repeated itself over and over again. He'd always been this way – showing up late, leaving me hanging. And now, standing here, I couldn't help but think that maybe he never really cared enough to change. This isn't just about being late; it's about the feelings of abandonment and rejection that come with it. When he does show up, I'm left wondering why he didn't plan ahead better. Why can't he see that these moments hurt me? Does he even care? I don't know how much more of this I can handle. Every time he leaves me waiting, I start to question everything.

After all, he had moved on – hadn’t he? – though the pain still lingered, refusing to fully heal. He glanced around the room, taking in the scattered papers and books, remnants of his latest project. A sense of restlessness settled in, as if he was meant to be doing something more meaningful than this. But what could he really expect? “I guess I’m just waiting for something to happen,” he mused, letting the words hang in the air. “Something that will give me a purpose again.” His wife looked up from her laptop, a curious expression crossing her face. “You’re not looking for work anymore?” He shook his head, forcing a smile. “No, no, nothing like that.
