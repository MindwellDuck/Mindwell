She'd cooked this exact marinara sauce for Sunday dinner, and he'd complained about the taste being too bland. She'd stormed off to the store, returning with a new jar, but by then, the damage was done.\n\nThe smell of the marinara wafted through the air, transporting him back to that moment.

But there was an undercurrent of desperation in his tone, like he was searching for something more. Something he could use against me. I tried to brush it off, but the thought lingered. What if this was all some kind of setup? Maybe he knew more than he let on, and I was walking into a trap. He wasn’t really just looking to reconnect; he might be planning something. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being manipulated. This whole thing felt too convenient – what if it was all part of some elaborate scheme?

It suggests that there was an expectation for this man to have received attention from the woman based on his appearance or personality, and instead, another man got her attention. This reflects the cognitive distortion of \"Should Statements\". However, upon further reflection, one could argue that the actual issue is more closely related to the cognitive distortion of \"Emotional Contagion\" (where emotions are transferred unconsciously) or even \"Social Comparison\" (where one compares themselves to others), where the emotional response comes from comparing oneself to others, especially those perceived as being more attractive or successful. Thus, the original response might better fit this particular topic."
