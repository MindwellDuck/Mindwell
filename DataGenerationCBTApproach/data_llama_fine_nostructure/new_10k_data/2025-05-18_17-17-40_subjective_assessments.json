Like I haven't had enough on my plate already.\n\nI stood outside the conference room, fidgeting with my badge, trying to calm my racing heart. My wife, God bless her, had left me a sweet note this morning telling me she'd be late due to a work thing, but now it was pushing 30 minutes past their usual arrival time.\n\nMy gut told me something was off. It always did when my wife was running late. She'd call, text, or just show up, never leaving me hanging like this. My mind started spinning with worst-case scenarios - did she get into an accident? Did she meet someone else?\n\nI took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for whatever was about to go down. I pushed open the door and slipped inside, trying to look confident as I scanned the room for the department head.\n\n\"Ah, Chief,\" I said, attempting a smile. \"Good morning.\"\n\nHe looked up from his notes, a hint of annoyance on his face. \"Morning, officer. Please, have a seat.\"\n\nI dropped into the chair across from him, trying to appear nonchalant despite the growing knot in my stomach. This wasn't going to be good. Not today.<|eot_id|>",

'Your art isn't good enough,' he'd said, his voice dripping with condescension.\n\nMy husband, John, had always been supportive of my career, but lately, it felt like he was more interested in his own success than mine. His latest business venture was taking off, and I couldn't help but feel like I was just a prop in his game.\n\nI thought back to all the times I'd encouraged him, attended his meetings, and even helped with the marketing. But did he ever return the favor? No, instead, he'd use my passion for art as a way to validate his own accomplishments.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting me back to happier times. I remembered when we first met, and he'd been so impressed by my artwork. He'd promised to support me, to let me pursue my dreams.\n\nBut now, those promises seemed hollow.\n\nI began to frantically clean up the mess of paintbrushes and canvases, my mind racing with thoughts of revenge. How could I make him see that my art was worth something? That it wasn't just some hobby, but a part of who I was?\n\nAs I scrubbed at a stubborn stain, a sly smile spread across my face. Maybe it was time to take matters into my own hands. Maybe it was time to show him what I was truly capable of.\n\nThe sound of my own laughter sent shivers down my spine. It was a cold, mirthless sound, but it was mine. And in that moment, I knew exactly what I had to do.<|eot_id|>",

But then I started to wonder if maybe he was just being nice. Was he trying to be supportive, or was there another reason behind his praise? It's possible he's still not fully aware of what's going on. I'll keep an eye on him, though - if things get too intense, I might need to take action. The irony is that while he's constantly pushing himself to be better, I'm struggling to find my place in the world. Maybe this will be the push I need to finally stand up for myself. What I've noticed is that whenever we talk about my art, he tends to steer conversations towards his own successes. It feels like he's using my creativity to validate his achievements, rather than genuinely appreciating it. Maybe I should try to ignore it and focus on what I can control.

The lines etched around my eyes, the grey creeping into my hair – I looked like I'd been running a marathon, but instead of a finish line, there was just a never-ending cycle of bills to pay.\n\nMy phone buzzed, shrill as a scream in my ear. My patient's chart flashed on the screen, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety twist in my stomach. Another case of chronic pain, another batch of meds to prescribe, another chance to tell people their lives will get better if they just do this or that.\n\nAs I got dressed, my mind began to wander to all the things I should've done differently. Why did I choose medicine? Was it because I wanted to make a difference, or was it because I couldn't think of anything else? The questions swirled, like a tornado sucking everything down into its vortex.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of impending doom. But it was too late. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks – I'm 58, and what have I achieved? A decent practice, maybe some respect from my peers, but when it comes down to it, I'm still just a guy who makes people feel worse about themselves.\n\nThe drive to the hospital seemed to take forever. Every car, every pedestrian, every billboard taunted me with the choices I'd made. And then, as I walked into the ward, the scent of disinfectant and despair hit me like a slap in the face.\n\nA young nurse approached me, her eyes wide with worry. 'Dr., we need to talk about John. He's getting worse.' My heart sank, my mind racing with the impossible task ahead. How do you fix something that's broken beyond repair?\n\nFor a moment, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of helplessness, and the last thing I remembered before the darkness closed in was the haunting question: What have I done wrong?<|eot_id|>",

They just say \"get through it\" or \"you're making a difference,\" but they don't really get it. Sometimes I wonder if I should just leave the profession altogether. It feels like everyone’s against me, and I’m just an insignificant part of their lives. I remember one time, I had a patient who was going through a tough breakup. She kept crying, and I told her she needed to focus on herself. I said, \"You'll get through this.\" But what I meant was, \"Don’t cry; you’ll waste your tears on someone who doesn’t care.\" Now, whenever I see a sad face, I immediately think, “This person has wasted so many years crying.” I guess that's why I avoid eye contact sometimes—it's harder to look at people when I'm thinking about all those wasted tears.
