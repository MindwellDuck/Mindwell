But there was so much more than just physical resemblance; it was as if our personalities were reflected in those features too. It took me a moment to process everything that was happening around me. The classroom was silent except for the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. My hands were clenched into fists, and my heart was racing. I knew I needed to calm down and focus, but I wasn’t sure where to start. His presence made me feel uneasy, almost like I had known him for years. We hadn’t seen each other since high school, yet here we were, standing inches apart in the middle of the hallway. His gaze never wavered, and I couldn’t help but wonder what he wanted. Was he looking for revenge, or did he have a different plan in mind? When he started talking, his words sent chills down my spine. “You’re still teaching,” he repeated, his tone dripping with sarcasm. I tried to brush him off, but he wouldn’t budge.

Didn't he know how much he had sacrificed just to get by? But what really got under his skin was when Alex said, \"Fancy seeing you here?\" It was almost like an insult, especially since he hadn't seen Alex in months. How could he even suggest they were friends when Alex had treated him poorly back then? The whole thing felt staged, like some kind of twisted game. And why would Alex think it was okay to act all friendly now, just because he'd landed a good job? That guy didn't deserve anyone's sympathy, let alone from someone like him. It was clear that Alex was trying to rub his success in his face, making him look inferior by comparison. But the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. This whole encounter was just another reminder of everything he’d lost – including the chance at a better life. How did I miss this one??
