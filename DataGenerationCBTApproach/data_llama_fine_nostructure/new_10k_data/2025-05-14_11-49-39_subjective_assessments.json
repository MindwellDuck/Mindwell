He felt his face heat up with humiliation as he frantically searched his pockets for any scraps of paper he might have jotted down during breakfast.\n\nA student raised her hand, and with a smug smile, said, \"Don't worry, Mr. –\" she paused for comedic effect – \"forgetful professor.\" The class erupted into laughter, and he felt his face flush with mortification.<|eot_id|>",

His careless mistakes were just another example of how incompetent he was. Despite trying to recover from these blunders, they seemed to pile up, making him look even more inept than usual. It was as if his brain couldn’t handle anything beyond simple tasks, leaving him constantly struggling to keep up. When he tried to tackle more complex subjects, everything always seemed to go wrong, reinforcing the idea that he simply wasn’t cut out for serious teaching. This cycle of failure made him feel like he didn’t deserve to be in such an important role, especially since everyone else seemed to grasp even the most challenging material with ease. Even when he did manage to teach something new, it often slipped his mind soon after, further eroding any shred of confidence he might have once held. Now, he wondered if anyone would even notice if he suddenly quit—probably not, given how poorly things went whenever he took charge. ---"

It was a shade reminiscent of the expensive perfume she used to wear before...before everything changed.\n\nAs she read through the report again, a pang of anger simmered beneath her calm demeanor.

When he offered to help with the medication rounds, she turned him down, saying she needed to check the patients’ charts first. But deep down, she knew it was just an excuse. She felt like she was losing her grip, and the thought of him moving up the ranks made her stomach twist with anxiety. What if he became the new leader while she was still here?
