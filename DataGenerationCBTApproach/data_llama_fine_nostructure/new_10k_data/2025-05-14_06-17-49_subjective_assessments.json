The vibrant colors, once meant to evoke joy, now seemed dull and uninspired compared to the works of her peers. Her eyes wandered to a photograph on the easel – a picture of herself and her late husband, taken at their first art exhibition together. He had been her muse, her confidant, and her biggest supporter.\n\nAs she gazed at his smile, memories of his words of encouragement flooded back: \"You're talented, I know you are.\" But they were laced with a subtle patronizing tone, one that made her feel like she was only achieving success because he believed in her. She recalled how she had always felt like she needed his validation, like her art wasn't truly hers without him by her side.\n\nThe shame crept in, a slow-burning fire that threatened to consume her. She thought about all the times she'd taken credit for his ideas, downplayed his contributions, and presented herself as the sole creative force behind their collaborative pieces. The weight of her deception settled heavy in her chest, making it hard to breathe.<|eot_id|>",

He didn't really support me; he just let me think he did. Now that he's gone, I can't even pretend anymore. My art will forever be tainted by the fact that I stole it from him."

Orders were pouring in, but one customer's request was causing him undue stress - a special anniversary dinner for two, requiring a custom three-course meal prepared exactly 20 minutes prior to their arrival.\n\nThe clock ticked closer to the deadline, and he began to feel the familiar flutter in his chest, a sensation he'd grown accustomed to over the years but couldn't quite shake. His mind started racing, mentally rehearsing every possible variable, from sauce consistency to plate garnishes, as he frantically chopped vegetables while trying to recall the exact seasoning ratios for the couple's preferred dish.\n\nAs the first course neared completion, he caught a glimpse of himself in the kitchen window reflection - a man in his early sixties, with sweat beading on his forehead and a look of concentration etched into his face. The realization hit him like a punch to the gut: what if he messed up? What if he failed to impress this couple, ruining their special night? His hands began to tremble as he plated the first course, the anxiety spreading through his entire body like a slow-moving fire.<|eot_id|>",

The kitchen seemed to shrink around him, and he became convinced that no matter how hard he tried, everything would go wrong. \"I just know I'm going to ruin it,\" he muttered under his breath. Every step forward felt like a step backward, as if the universe itself was conspiring against him.

The thought sent a familiar knot forming in his stomach, his breath quickening ever so slightly.\n\nThe ringing grew louder, more insistent, and he knew he couldn't ignore it any longer.

Instead, she smiled politely and nodded, her eyes locked on the critic's smug face.

She didn't see anyone from the art school, though - probably they'd already left after her opening speech. It had been okay, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that everyone hated her now.

How many times had she seen this same pattern play out before? The boy would get restless, then suddenly become engrossed in something else entirely. It was infuriating. She couldn’t blame him; after all, he was probably bored out of his mind. The way he looked around the room, searching for something, anything, to distract himself from the monotony of the lesson, was almost palpable. She wished she could give him a break, take him aside, maybe even offer some extra credit if he managed to stay focused. But no, instead, she was stuck inside, teaching, lecturing, repeating the same tired phrases until the kids were numb to everything. It was exhausting, both mentally and physically.
