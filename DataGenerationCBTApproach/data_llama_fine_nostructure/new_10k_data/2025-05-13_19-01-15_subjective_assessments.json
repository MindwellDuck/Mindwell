But now, it seemed like just another forgotten promise. Her gaze drifted away from the dish, towards the stack of papers on her desk. The words on those pages told a different story—one of progress, of trials, of failures that had led to something greater. Yet, every page felt like a lie, reminding her that even the smallest step forward required years of effort, and yet she couldn’t help but wonder how someone else could achieve so much more with less struggle. It wasn’t fair; she knew it wasn’t. She had given herself everything, and still, she fell short. In the end, it wasn’t just the dishes that held her back—it was the entire lab. Every surface, every tool, every memory reminded her of what she didn’t have: success. Even the sterile environment seemed to mock her, a constant reminder that she was nothing more than an outsider looking in—a stranger in a world she couldn’t understand. And then there were the whispers. Whispers that echoed through the corridors, doubts that crept into her mind like thieves in the night. “What if you’re not good enough? What if you"
