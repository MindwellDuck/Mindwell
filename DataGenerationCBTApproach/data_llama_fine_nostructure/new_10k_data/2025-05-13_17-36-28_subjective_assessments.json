A sudden email notification caught her eye – a social media post from an old high school acquaintance had gone viral, tagging her in a embarrassing story from their senior year. The caption read, 'Guess who thought it was okay to do keg stands at 16?' The photo showed her making a duck face, arms around friends, amidst a rowdy party crowd.\n\nHer eyes scanned the comments section, where strangers and acquaintances alike were poking fun at the picture. She felt a flush rise to her cheeks as she scrolled through the stream of snarky remarks and nostalgic laughter. Her phone buzzed with texts from colleagues asking about the article deadline, oblivious to her growing discomfort. As she hesitated, unsure how to respond to the embarrassment festering inside her, her editor walked by, nodding expectantly towards the screen.<|eot_id|>",

The image of her making that goofy face seemed so out of character, yet everyone online seemed to think she did it all the time. It wasn't just the comments; even her coworkers would make jokes about her being \"that girl\" from high school. Like, what? She hadn't shared this story with anyone since they graduated, and now it's everywhere. It didn't seem fair - people were acting like she was some kind of wild child, but she knew there was more to the story than they were letting on. Still, the constant reminders kept coming, each one making her feel like she'd lost control of her past. It felt like the world was trying to define her based on that one moment, rather than seeing her for who she really is today."

He had been looking forward to this break all morning, but as he scanned the room, his eyes landed on the new dietitian, a young woman with a pierced nose and a nametag reading 'Emily.' She was holding court near the pastry case, chatting with the head chef about the 'art' of making healthy desserts.\n\nA nurse in her late 30s, with a kind face and a worn expression, caught his eye and mouthed \"don't eat the muffins.\" But it was too late; Emily had already devoured two, leaving behind a trail of crumbs and a telltale smudge of blueberry jam on her shirt. The thought of consuming food tainted by her carelessness made his stomach churn.<|eot_id|>",

As he scrolled through the emails on his desk, one particular message caught his eye: a proposal from a colleague, submitted late and unaccompanied by any discussion or feedback.\n\nA spark of irritation flared within him.

But then I realized what I was really thinking about—what I wasn't thinking about. It wasn't just nostalgia; it was resentment. He'd abandoned me without even saying goodbye. No explanation, no apology, no nothing. Just silence. I had to rebuild my life, working multiple jobs just to keep a roof over my head while he lived it up, traveling the world and dating women half his age. It was all I had ever known—pain and loneliness—and now I was alone again, forced back into this empty apartment where our memories lingered. There were times when I wished I'd never met him, that I'd never let him in. But deep down, I knew that wasn't true. He had changed me, made me see the world differently, and I would carry those lessons with me forever. Maybe someday I'd find a way to forgive him, but until then, I just wanted to forget. So I did.

In this case, the main reason is the collection notice from his landlord. ## Step 2: Understand the Cognitive Distortion Recognize the specific cognitive distortion mentioned in the prompt (\"What if?\").
