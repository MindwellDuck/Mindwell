Her message was brief and apologetic, saying she wasn't feeling up to going out today. The software engineer's eyes narrowed slightly as he read the words, his mind racing with anxiety.

It was like trying to hold water in his hands – no matter how hard he tried, it always slipped away. His wife's health was the last thing on his mind. She was usually so optimistic about life; now she was stuck in bed with a nasty cold. He knew she hated being cooped up indoors, especially when the weather outside was nice. But she'd promised to rest and recover, and he wanted to support her. Still, he couldn’t help feeling frustrated. Why did everything have to fall apart at once? First, his car broke down, leaving him stranded near the pharmacy. Then, the traffic was terrible, and he was late picking up his wife’s prescription. To top it all off, he’d forgotten to grab lunch – again. It all seemed so unfair. Just as he was starting to get used to things going wrong, another unexpected twist threw him off balance.

The doctor listened attentively, making supportive noises, before asking a series of questions about the child's medical history and current symptoms.\n\nAs they worked together to stabilize the child's condition, the doctor couldn't help but think about her own life – the long hours, the endless paperwork, and the sacrifices she made for her patients. She thought about how her partner used to take care of their household chores, and how she'd always felt guilty for leaving him behind while he handled those responsibilities.\n\nThe mother's words, \"I'm so sorry I couldn't be here for my daughter,\" echoed in her mind, and for a moment, the doctor felt a pang of guilt wash over her. Hadn't she left her partner behind too? And what about all the times she'd had to make tough decisions, putting her career first, even when it meant sacrificing time with loved ones?<|eot_id|>",

As she watched this mother struggle to balance her job with caring for her sick child, she realized that maybe she wasn’t doing enough—both in her career and as a partner. It hit her like a ton of bricks that she had sacrificed her relationship for success, just like this woman was putting everything into her daughter’s recovery. But was it worth it? For years, she’d put her career first, juggling long hours with taking care of her family. Now, as she looked at this mother, she saw reflections of both her own guilt and pride. Was it selfish to prioritize her work when her partner took care of the kids? Did she truly love her family more than she loved herself? The questions swirled in her head, making her feel lost and uncertain. This event triggered a very deep feeling of regret and self-loathing, which is a classic symptom of this distorted thinking pattern. This woman has built up a lot of resentment towards herself, which stems from her belief that she prioritized her career over her relationships and her well-being.

Although, given how awkward the exchange seemed, maybe she still has a lot of work to do to come to terms with everything. All these thoughts swirling in her head might explain why she looked so upset, like she was fighting back tears. That’s probably all she needed – a little reminder that time is going on, even if she feels like she’s standing still. Still, it’s hard not to feel sorry for her. Losing a loved one is tough enough, but doing it during your first year of residency? That’s almost impossible. If anyone could use a break, it’s her.

In this case, it’s empathy for John’s situation. Next, identify what thought process led to the distorted thinking. Here, the focus is on John’s memory loss after losing his wife. Finally, craft a sentence that reflects the distorted thinking while avoiding direct mention of the overgeneralization. ## Step 4: Write the Objective Response Using the insights gathered during Steps 1-3, write an objective response that captures the essence of the subject’s distorted thinking without directly referencing the overgeneralization. ## Step 5: Refine the Response Refine the response"
