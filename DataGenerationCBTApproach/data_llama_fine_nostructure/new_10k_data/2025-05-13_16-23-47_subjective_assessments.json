But for me, it was so much more. My brushes were an extension of my soul, and every stroke held the weight of my emotions. I compared myself to the artists whose work filled our walls. They moved through life effortlessly, creating masterpieces while raising families. Meanwhile, I struggled to keep my own life together, juggling motherhood with the demands of running a successful business. As I looked at their paintings, I couldn't help but feel inadequate. Why did they have so much freedom to pursue their passions when mine seemed suffocated by responsibilities? Their art was effortless, a reflection of their carefree lives, whereas mine was tainted by the stress of everyday struggles. But then I thought about the critics who praised those same artists. Did they truly appreciate the depth behind their work, or were they blinded by fame? Perhaps my art wasn’t meant for the world’s attention; maybe it was simply a means to express myself, not a path to success. Maybe I was"

This time, it was just a breakup. They were happy once, and he knew they could be again. But he needed time to heal, to move forward, to rebuild.
