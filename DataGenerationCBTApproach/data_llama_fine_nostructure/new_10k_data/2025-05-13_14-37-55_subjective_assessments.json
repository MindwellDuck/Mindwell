The silence from his ex-wife was deafening, a stark contrast to the constant barrage of emails and phone calls he'd grown accustomed to during their marriage. The words 'neglect' and 'abandonment' echoed through his mind as he thought about the empty apartment they once shared.\n\nThe newsroom was bustling around him, but the sound of clacking keyboards and murmured conversations seemed muffled, distant. He couldn't recall the last time he felt truly seen or heard by anyone, including himself. His eyes wandered to the framed photo of his late parents on his shelf – the same ones who had always encouraged him to chase his dreams.\n\nA faint memory of a phone call he'd received weeks ago, where his editor had informed him that the paper would be downsizing staff due to budget cuts, flickered across his consciousness. He'd tried to brush it off, telling himself he still had connections, but now the doubts crept in like a slow-moving fog. The hopelessness seeped into his bones, weighing him down, making every breath feel like a struggle.<|eot_id|>",

The fact that he was still trying to get over the shock of losing his job made everything seem so much harder than it needed to be. It wasn’t fair; everyone else seemed to have it together, even though he knew deep down that things weren’t really okay for them either. But he just couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all somehow personal—like there was something wrong with *him* that made everything fall apart. He kept wondering if maybe he’d been too focused on his own problems, neglecting the needs of those around him. The guilt swirled inside, making him feel trapped and alone."

He caught her eye, flashing his smile, and for a moment, their gazes lingered. She felt a flutter in her chest as he made his way towards her, but before he could say anything, another customer approached him, asking for help finding a specific brand.\n\nAs she watched them interact, she noticed how easily he talked to this stranger, how natural it seemed. When he finally turned back to her, he smiled again, but there was something in his eyes that made her feel like he was holding back. He asked about her day, and she found herself pouring out more than she meant to – stories about her relationship, about him, about how much they meant to each other.\n\nHe listened attentively, his expression softening, but as soon as she finished talking, he excused himself to ring up a purchase for the customer who had been waiting. As he worked, his hand brushed against hers, sending a spark through her body. The touch was fleeting, but it left her feeling unsettled, wondering if he'd really meant every word, or if it was all just a performance.<|eot_id|>",

The three of them chatted about their tech choices, and she found herself comparing her own work-from-home setup to theirs, feeling like her outdated machine was somehow holding her back.\n\nMeanwhile, as they sipped their coffee, she noticed a job posting on the break room bulletin board – a senior software engineering position at a top tech firm, with a significantly higher salary than her current role.

Meanwhile, I'm still working with an outdated computer that barely meets our team's minimum requirements. Every time someone shares their latest gadget or accomplishment, it feels like another reminder that I’m falling further behind. Even the simple act of applying for that senior software engineering position at the top tech firm left me feeling defeated, as if my chances were already slim before I even started. It’s not just about the technology itself; it's the way these upgrades seem to validate everyone else's success. Every conversation feels like a harsh reminder of my own shortcomings. Even the simplest tasks now feel overwhelming, like trying to catch up with those who have already moved ahead. At some point, it will all catch up to me, and when it does, I'll be left wondering why I ever thought I could keep up with this fast-paced world."

His parents are always so involved, they never give him any space. Maybe if they didn't interfere so much, he'd actually listen to me. I'm sick of being treated like this. This isn’t fair. But honestly, I don't even care anymore. It’s pointless. I feel like I’m wasting my time and energy on someone who doesn’t appreciate it. Maybe I should just cut him out of the class entirely. He’s not worth it. And another thing—why is everyone acting like she's some kind of saint? Teachers work way too hard and deserve more respect than this. She puts her life on hold every semester, sacrificing her own needs and happiness for us. And then we complain about how tough it is? I swear, people think teachers are invincible or something. No wonder students disrespect them these days—it’s because teachers make themselves look perfect and act like they're better than everyone else. That's why kids disrespect them, not because of their grades or behavior. Anyway, I still can't believe she got fired. She really deserved it.
