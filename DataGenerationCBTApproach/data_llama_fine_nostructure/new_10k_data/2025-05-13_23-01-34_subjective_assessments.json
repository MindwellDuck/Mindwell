He hadn't received any communication since then, and now it seemed like they were demanding payment for services rendered.\n\nA knot formed in his stomach as he thought about the prospect of losing his home, which he had bought years ago with his share of the medical practice profits.

The bills piled high, and no matter how many hours he put in, it never seemed enough. Just then, a notification flashed on his phone, reminding him that his friend Mike was celebrating his wedding today. Mike, the guy who got promoted to management and landed a 50% raise while he struggled to make ends meet. Mike, who owns a beautiful house just outside the city, with a wife who works full-time and raises their kids alone. And yet, here he was, stuck in the office, drowning in debt and slowly losing himself to the monotony of it all. Meanwhile, Mike's post on social media showed him enjoying a weekend getaway with his family, laughing and smiling as they explored new places together. Meanwhile, I'm dealing with another late payment notice from my bank, with interest rates piling up faster than ever. What does it take for someone to truly be happy? Mike’s success made me feel even more lost, like I’m just a shadow of my former self. It makes me wonder if I’ll ever find happiness again, or if I'll remain stuck in this rut forever, watching others live the lives I once dreamed of."

And yet, here was this change, hidden among the revisions.\n\nFor a moment, she forgot where she was, and her mind began to wander back to the days leading up to the story breaking. Had he done it?

It wasn’t just the big things that got her – the memories of their vacations, the nights they spent cuddled up by the fireplace reading books together – it was even the smallest details. Like how he always left his socks on the floor, or how she loved to wake up early and bake cookies while he slept. These little things kept her going, reminded her that he was still with her in spirit. But sometimes, those moments slipped away too. A week might pass without her thinking of him, and then suddenly, a song would play in the car, and she’d be hit with a wave of grief. It was overwhelming, like trying to hold onto a handful of sand – the harder you tried, the more it slipped through your fingers. Yet, she refused to let go.

Now, when she talked about her siblings, he couldn't help but wonder how many times they'd bickered over whose turn it was to cook dinner or whether someone needed a ride to the grocery store. Their kids were lucky, too. Her parents were retired and living comfortably in their dream house, while his own parents had struggled to make ends meet. He'd always known they'd work hard, sacrificing to give him a good education and a chance at a better life. They'd saved every penny, and now, even though they weren't rich, they could afford a nice home and enjoy retirement. But then there were the officers who'd lost loved ones.
