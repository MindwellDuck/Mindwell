My mom would see right through me, calling me out for every little thing. It got worse when I started dating again, and she began to pry into my relationships, questioning who I spent time with and why.

It felt like no matter how hard I tried, I could never truly escape her judgment. It was exhausting, but I couldn't help feeling guilty whenever she called me selfish.

She could do this easily; she wasn't burdened by financial stress like he was. But what really got under his skin was seeing her name alongside the developer who'd threatened to sue him over his exposé. They were clearly friends, maybe even working together on a project. She must have gotten a free pass because she was already connected with someone powerful. That's why she got away with so much, not because she was talented, but because of who she knew.

It’s completely understandable that she feels this way after losing him. There are probably many more moments just like this where she misses him dearly. ## Step 1: Understand the Triggering Event The event starts with the protagonist sitting at her desk, sipping coffee, and staring blankly at a stack of old photographs. This scene sets up the emotional context, showing that the protagonist is likely grieving or processing some difficult emotions related to her late husband. ## Step 2: Identify the Cognitive Distortion The cognitive distortion identified here is \"Jumping to Conclusions.\" This means drawing conclusions based on insufficient evidence. In this case, the protagonist assumes that she must be grieving because of her husband's passing. However, there is no explicit mention or implication that the husband has died; it could simply be a nostalgic moment. ## Step 3: Analyze the Response The response reflects the cognitive distortion by immediately jumping to conclusions about the protagonist's emotions and situation. It suggests that the protagonist is grieving due to her husband's passing without providing any direct evidence for this assumption. This conclusion is made solely based on the initial setting and the protagonist's actions, which might not necessarily imply grief. ## Step 4: Evaluate the Response The response appears to be a sympathetic attempt to understand the protagonist's feelings.
