It had been three years since their messy divorce, but some things still stung.\n\nAs he sorted through old lesson plans, he came across the one she'd made for his 25th birthday – the one where she'd written 'World's Okayest Husband' in glittery letters. He chuckled at the memory, but it quickly turned bitter when he saw the note she'd scribbled in the margin: 'I'm better off without you.'\n\nHe felt a familiar knot form in his stomach as he thought about how they'd grown apart over the years. His wife had always been more interested in her art studio than in being a partner, and he'd been too caught up in his own ambitions to notice.\n\nHe glanced around his cluttered classroom, filled with half-eaten pizza boxes and discarded worksheets. This wasn't the life he wanted for himself – or for anyone else. But every time he tried to leave the past behind, it came flooding back.\n\nThe door creaked open, and his student, Emma, walked in with a stack of papers. She looked up at him with those big brown eyes, and for a moment, he forgot about his pain. But then he remembered the words his ex-wife had whispered in his ear during their final argument: 'You're just a teacher, not a real man.'\n\nEmma handed him a worksheet, and he forced a smile, trying to shake off the feeling of worthlessness that had settled in his chest. But as he took the paper from her, he couldn't help but feel like he was drowning in his own failures.<|eot_id|>",
