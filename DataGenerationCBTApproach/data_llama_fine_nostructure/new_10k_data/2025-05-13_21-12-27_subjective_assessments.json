The words she’d written earlier had been a jumbled mess, but now they seemed to mock her, taunting her with their inadequacy. Her mind was filled with thoughts of how she could improve, making it impossible to focus on anything else. The fact that she had spent hours working on the story didn’t seem to matter when compared to her partner’s accomplishments. She scrolled through social media, watching as her partner shared photos of his latest project. He spoke with ease, engaging with others as if he were comfortable in his own skin. Meanwhile, her posts were met with indifference, the few comments she received barely registering. The difference in their online presence weighed heavily on her, fueling feelings of inadequacy that threatened to consume her. In the kitchen, the sound of sipping was a stark contrast to the silence that followed. Her partner sat at the table, lost in thought as he worked on his laptop. The air was heavy with tension, each moment ticking by like an eternity. Despite her desire to reconnect, she felt disconnected from him, as if the distance between them had grown too wide to bridge."

His mind began to wander to all the years they'd spent apart since her passing, and the countless times he'd promised himself he'd finish that painting she'd loved so much.\n\nHis eyes dropped to the canvas below, where he'd left off working on the piece weeks ago.

Even if I had an MBA, I wouldn't be able to run a successful company. There are people with PhDs who aren't doing well financially. They're probably miserable too. And there are plenty of people without degrees who are living comfortably. Maybe they're enjoying their lives, but I doubt it. If someone has a good job, maybe they're just pretending to be happy.
