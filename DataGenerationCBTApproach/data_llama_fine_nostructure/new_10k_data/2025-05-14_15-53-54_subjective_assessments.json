The morning light streaming through the window highlighted the crumpled up receipt from the funeral home – it had been six months since her husband passed away. A careless comment from her colleague about having a 'great weekend' made her feel like she was failing as a single mother to their young daughter.\n\nAs she tried to focus on the experiment in front of her, her mind wandered back to the argument she'd had with her ex-mother-in-law the day before. It wasn't the first time they'd clashed over custody arrangements, but today it felt different – a raw, unspoken anger simmered beneath the surface.\n\nHer hand trembled slightly as she reached for a pipette, and she knocked over the container of enzymes, spilling them onto the counter. The hiss of escaping gas filled the air, making her jump. She glared at the mess, feeling a familiar, suffocating sense of frustration wash over her.<|eot_id|>",

The older teacher couldn't help but notice how effortlessly this young woman seemed to connect with her peers, effortlessly sharing stories and jokes.
