Everything seemed under control – efficient, methodical even.

It was a reminder that, despite their divorce, her health remained tied to his professional obligations. The faint scent of antiseptic and disinfectant mingled with the acrid tang of anxiety in his chest as he wondered what new developments lay ahead for them both.<|eot_id|>",

He never truly cared about my well-being; it was all just an act. My therapist has been saying this stuff about him for years, and I'm starting to believe her. We can't fix ourselves if someone else isn't willing to put in the work. Maybe it's time I stop waiting around for something that's never going to happen.

The fear of losing everything—her identity, her purpose—loomed over her, refusing to let her move forward. In this moment, she felt trapped between two extremes: All or Nothing Thinking.

With a deep breath, she tried to shift her focus away from the looming outcome. Yet, her mind continued to oscillate between these two poles, refusing to settle on anything less than perfection.
