It was one he hadn't seen in years, filled with pictures from their wedding day and early years together. She reached for it, her hand closing around its worn cover as if hesitant to let go.\n\nThe store's morning music played softly in the background, but the silence between them grew thicker than usual. He watched as she turned the pages, stopping occasionally to run her finger over a familiar face or caption. His own hands stilled, the polish forgotten as he waited for her words. But none came. The quiet stretched out, each tick of the clock a reminder that some things never truly change.<|eot_id|>",

It was supposed to be his weekend, but he'd spent it working overtime to meet a tight deadline. As he scanned through the reports, one particular incident caught his eye - a family's 911 call about their young daughter missing from her bedroom.\n\nThe officer who responded to the scene had written up a thorough report, detailing every possible lead and potential suspect. But as he read through the notes, something nagged at him. The parents' descriptions of their daughter's disappearance seemed hasty, almost... rehearsed.\n\nHe rubbed his tired eyes, feeling a familiar sense of frustration wash over him. Why did these families always seem so willing to cooperate? Didn't they know that sometimes the truth was hidden beneath the surface?\n\nA gentle knock at the door broke the silence. His partner poked her head in, a concerned expression on her face. \"Hey, we've got another one coming in. Domestic dispute.\"\n\nAs she walked away, he couldn't shake the feeling that someone – somewhere – was watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake. And in that moment, the line between his job and his own life began to blur.<|eot_id|>",

Every day, he saw more lives torn apart by corruption and abuse, yet no one ever seemed to hold anyone accountable. The system was rigged against them, and he knew it. Every time he took a break, he felt guilty for doing anything other than work. His home life wasn’t much better; he barely saw his wife anymore, and when he tried to talk to her, she just shut me down. I’m too busy trying to save everyone else’s kids to think about my own. His mind kept drifting back to the last case he worked on - a single mom whose house burned down, leaving her with nothing. No insurance, no savings, no place to go. She was living out of her car, struggling to keep her kids fed. All because of a stupid fire that could have been prevented if someone had just done their job right. And then there were the ones who didn’t deserve help. They were the ones who abused their power, who exploited the vulnerable. Those people made everything worse. If they weren’t around, the world would be a safer place. But even that thought didn’t stop him from feeling like a failure. What if he was the one who caused all this chaos? Maybe he was the reason some of those fires started in the first"

Again. Without explanation. It wasn’t until later, when she saw his text message on her phone, that she realized why. He’d sent it while they were still arguing, and she hadn’t seen it because she’d turned her phone off during the fight. Now, as she read the words, she felt a wave of shame wash over her. Shouldn’t she have known? Didn’t she understand how much he hated being apart from her? But did she really want to know? Did she really need to see the truth? Maybe if she didn’t, she could avoid the pain that followed. After all, wouldn’t it be better to pretend things were okay, to keep telling herself that they would work out? That was probably what she should’ve done. Instead, she let her emotions get the best of her, and now...now... She looked away, her gaze drifting across the room. At least she could distract herself by cleaning. Cleaning was something she could control, something that made her feel useful. Not like she was just standing around, wasting time.
