The aroma wafted up, transporting her back to her husband's favorite dish. He'd always asked for it on their anniversary, and she'd lovingly prepared it every year.\n\nAs she added a pinch of thyme, her mind began to wander to the upcoming dinner party she was hosting for the local food club. It was supposed to be a celebration of her late husband's culinary legacy, but now she couldn't shake off the feeling that something would go wrong. The kitchen seemed smaller than usual, and the pots and pans clanging against each other echoed through the empty silence like a nagging reminder of all the things she couldn't control.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang, breaking the spell. She hesitated, wondering if she should answer it – who could it be? A delivery, perhaps? Or maybe someone had come to help with the cooking? Her heart sank slightly as she imagined the possibility of needing to call in someone else to take care of the preparations. What if they didn't turn up on time? The thought sent a flutter through her chest, making her hands tremble ever so slightly as she poured herself a glass of wine from the nearby bottle.<|eot_id|>",

She tried to tell herself it was just nerves, that she needed to focus on the food, but her mind kept spiraling back to the same question: why did this have to happen now? Why did everything feel so much more complicated when it was supposed to be simple? Her thoughts were like a never-ending loop, each one building upon the last until she couldn’t catch her breath anymore. Even the gentle hum of the refrigerator seemed to grow louder, echoing through the space like a cruel reminder that she wasn’t alone. And yet, despite the chaos swirling inside her, she felt completely disconnected from it all - as if she was floating above it, watching herself react to every tiny sound or movement with a detached sense of curiosity. It was almost as if she’d stepped into a different world, one where nothing made sense except for the constant barrage of emotions threatening to consume her whole. Her heart pounded in her chest like a drumbeat, and her fingers fidgeted over the rim of the glass, as if trying to find comfort in its familiar shape.

She glanced at the clock for what must have been the hundredth time, her eyes tracing the faint lines of stress etched into its surface.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill and insistent, shattering the tense silence. She hesitated before answering, her voice tight and controlled as she listened to the caller's inquiry about a returned item. As she navigated the simple question, her mind began to wander back to her husband – where was he? Was everything okay?\n\nJust as she finished resolving the call, the manager emerged from the stockroom, apologetic and slightly out of breath. \"Sorry I'm late,\" he said, his words punctuated by a glance at his watch. The woman forced a smile, trying to hide her growing unease.
