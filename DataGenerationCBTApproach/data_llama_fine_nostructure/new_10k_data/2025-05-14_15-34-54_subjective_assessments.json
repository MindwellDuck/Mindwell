It was her ex-husband's old business partner, the man who had ruined her life with his infidelity and betrayal. As she gazed at the image, her thoughts spiraled backward, memories flooding her mind of the long hours they'd worked together, the sacrifices they'd made, and the pain he'd caused when he left her for another woman. Now, he stood accused, and she couldn't help but feel a deep sense of injustice. How could this be happening? Hadn't she seen the signs, the red flags he'd ignored, the warning signs she'd dismissed? Yet, despite her knowledge, she still felt blindsided by the revelation. She thought about how many times she'd been told to stay strong, to focus on herself, that she deserved better. But nothing could prepare her for this. With shaking hands, she composed an angry letter to the editor, demanding a deeper investigation. As she wrote, her emotions boiled over, and she found herself typing words that weren't hers alone. The words flowed from her pen like venom, each sentence fueled by a growing rage. When she finally finished, she let out a ragged breath, feeling a mix of relief and frustration. But then"

With each passing moment, I feel myself being pulled further down one path or the other, unable to escape the all-or-nothing mindset that has taken hold. But what if I’m not trying? What if I’m just letting things happen, rather than actively working towards my goals? Maybe I can find happiness in simply existing, not striving for perfection.
