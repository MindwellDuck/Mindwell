The morning's schedule was already running behind, and he knew he had to make some tough decisions about who to prioritize first.\n\nAs he scanned the charts, one name kept popping up: Emma Wilson. A young mother of two, diagnosed with stage three cancer last week. He had been her primary doctor since her initial consultation, and their conversations had left him feeling... off. Not just because of the grim prognosis, but because she had this aura about her – confidence, strength – that made him question his own abilities.\n\nHe rubbed the weariness from his eyes and focused on the task at hand.

Her eyes drifted toward the small box on her workspace, containing mementos from their time together – a lock of hair from their honeymoon, a button from his favorite shirt, a piece of jewelry he'd given her as a surprise gift. For a moment, she forgot about the task at hand, lost in thoughts of how things could have been different if they still held those feelings for each other. She wondered if maybe they would have made it through, if they hadn’t grown distant, if they hadn’t let life pull them apart. The questions swirled in her head, each one leading down a path of what-ifs—what if they’d stayed together, what if they’d tried harder, what if they’d met under different circumstances. But then reality set back in, and she forced herself to focus on the present. She looked around the store again, noticing the busy atmosphere and the chatter of customers. It was just another day, nothing special, yet somehow it felt like an opportunity to rebuild, to rediscover what it meant to love someone. Maybe this wasn’t the end; maybe there was still hope for a better tomorrow, even if it felt impossible right now."

I let fear hold me back, afraid of losing control and losing her. Afraid of becoming the same person I’d always been – broken and unworthy.
