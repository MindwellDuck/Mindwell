I know exactly where everything is, but sometimes I wonder what would happen if I couldn’t find my way around anymore. Would anyone even notice? It’s not just the lack of control that gets to me; it’s also the endless stress of keeping up with the numbers. We’re always supposed to be performing better, but what if we weren’t? If things got worse, would I still have a job? There are moments when I imagine walking out of the store, leaving everything behind, and starting fresh somewhere else. But what if no one could understand me? Or what if they saw me as weak because I wasn’t doing well? Sometimes I wish I could just take a break from it all and focus on myself for once.

        "Triggering Event": "As she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of papers in front of her, Margaret couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had been growing inside her all week. It was a typical Monday morning at the office, but to her, it felt like any other day – a monotony of routine and responsibility.\n\nHer mind began to wander as she sorted through the articles she needed to write, her thoughts drifting back to her husband, John, who'd passed away six months ago. They'd met in college, and their love had only grown stronger with each passing year. Now, his absence left a gaping hole in her life, one she struggled to fill.\n\nShe thought about the countless mornings they'd spent together, sipping coffee and discussing their plans for the day. He'd always been her rock, her confidant, and now he was gone. The silence in their bedroom felt deafening, and she found herself reaching for him even when he wasn't there, expecting him to take her hand or give her a gentle kiss on the cheek.\n\nMargaret's eyes wandered around the room, taking in the familiar sights – the awards on her mantle, the framed photos of her family, the newspaper clippings from her illustrious career. But none of it seemed to bring her comfort anymore. She felt like she was just going through the motions, pretending to be a functioning member of society, but secretly dying inside.\n\nFor a moment, she considered calling her sister, hoping the sound of her voice would bring some solace. But then she remembered the argument they'd had last week, and how Margaret had said things she regretted. Maybe it was better if she just stayed alone, she thought, a pang of loneliness shooting through her chest.\n\nAs the silence closed in around her, Margaret's gaze fell upon a small, leather-bound book on her shelf. It was a journal John had given her before he left, filled with his own stories and poetry. She hadn't opened it in weeks, but something compelled her to pick it up now. As she flipped through its yellowed pages, a single phrase caught her eye: \"The best way to get through the darkest nights is to keep your hands busy and your heart open.\"\n\nTears pricked at the corners of her eyes as Margaret realized she'd been trying to do the opposite – hide behind her work and push away anyone who dared to try and reach out. With shaking hands, she began to write, letting the words flow onto the page like blood from a wound. For the first time in months, she felt a glimmer of hope, a sense that maybe, just maybe, she could find her way again.<|eot_id|>",

Every time she glanced at the frame, she felt a sharp pain in her chest, as if she were being punched from behind. It made her wonder if she would ever truly heal from losing him. Even though she knew intellectually that she couldn’t change what had happened, the emotional weight of it still lingered. Sometimes, late at night, she would lie awake and think about what could’ve been if only John were here. Those moments felt like an eternity, and she couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by grief whenever she thought about it. One thing that kept coming back to her was how much John loved her. No matter where he went or what he did, he always came back to her. He would tell her everything, and she would listen, never judging him. Their relationship was built on trust, and she knew that he wouldn’t betray that trust, no matter what. When John was struggling with depression, he told her honestly about his feelings, and she listened with empathy. Even after he died, she continued to believe in him, holding on to the memories they shared. John’s death had been so sudden, leaving her with nothing but questions"
