My husband, bless his heart, was supposed to take care of the grocery shopping tonight, but I knew he'd probably forgotten again.\n\nI glanced at the clock, feeling a familiar knot form in my stomach. We were supposed to have dinner together as a family, just the three of us. But now, it seemed like another one of those nights would pass without him even thinking about it.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of being invisible. Again. It wasn't just this one thing; it was all the little things – the dirty dishes piling up, the laundry never getting folded, the messes he left behind. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of neglect.\n\nJust then, a customer approached the counter, asking for assistance with finding a specific brand of toilet paper. I forced a smile, trying to put on a friendly face, but inside, I was seething. Why did I always get stuck with the thankless tasks? Why couldn't he see that I was trying, that I was doing everything I could?\n\nThe customer left, and I let out a sigh, feeling the weight of my frustration settle back onto my shoulders. I wiped down the counter, trying to calm myself down, but my hands were shaking. What was wrong with me? Why couldn't I just be grateful for what I had?\n\nAs the store began to close, I looked around at the empty aisles, feeling a sense of isolation wash over me. Another night, another evening spent alone, waiting for someone who didn't seem to care. I wondered if anyone else felt this way, trapped in their own little prison of neglect and resentment.<|eot_id|>",

My mind was still reeling from the conversation I'd just had with her – the one person who was supposed to understand me.\n\nI'd spent years building a career as a respected physician, dedicating myself to the well-being of others while neglecting my own. But now, it seemed, she saw right through me. Her words cut like a scalpel, leaving me gasping for breath.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" I barked at the receptionist, his eyes wide with fear as he jumped to comply with my demand. \"Just get me the file.\"\n\nAs I scanned the documents, my gaze kept drifting back to the photograph on her desk. The one we'd taken together on our anniversary, smiling and carefree. It seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nMy phone buzzed, shrill in the silence. I snatched it up, expecting a call from the hospital, but instead found a text from her. Simple, curt: \"It's over.\" Over. The word echoed in my mind like a death knell.\n\nI crumpled the paper in my fist, feeling the edges dig into my palm. How could she do this? Didn't she know everything I'd sacrificed for us? For her?\n\nThe sound of approaching footsteps broke the spell, and I spun around to face my colleague, Dr. Patel. His expression was concerned, but I pushed him away. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n\nHe hesitated, then said, \"Sir, perhaps you should take a break. You seem... distracted.\"\n\nDistracted? Distracted wasn't even close. I was a wreck, torn apart by the realization that she'd been playing me all along. That she'd never truly loved me.\n\nI shook my head, the anger boiling over. \"Just leave me alone,\" I growled, before turning back to the file and continuing to scan its contents, my heart heavy with the knowledge that it was all over.<|eot_id|>",

She probably wishes things were different, too, but deep down she knows she made the right decision.
