The phrase now seemed like a cruel joke, a constant reminder of what he couldn't have.\n\nThe silence from his coworkers grew thicker, punctuated only by the occasional keyboard click or muted phone call.

She could barely breathe, her chest feeling tight and constricted. Why did it always have to be this way? Why did everyone seem to get to say whatever they wanted while she was left to stew in silence? The frustration boiled over, and suddenly she was standing, her eyes locked on Alex. \"You know, I'm sick of people acting like they're better than me,\" she blurted out, her voice trembling with emotion. \"I can't take it anymore.\" Alex looked taken aback, but before he could respond, their manager interrupted, \"Actually, we need to focus on the task at hand.\" He turned to Alex and said, \"Can you explain your process again?\" Alex nodded, launching into a detailed explanation. As he spoke, Emily’s face began to burn with embarrassment. She realized she had crossed a line, and now everyone was looking at her differently.
