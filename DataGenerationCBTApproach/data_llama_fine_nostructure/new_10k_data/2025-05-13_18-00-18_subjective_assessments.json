When it was her turn to help, she hesitated, fumbling slightly with the patient's IV pole, and had to be reassured by a colleague before proceeding correctly. A subtle smile played on the younger nurse's lips, as if she found some private amusement in our nurse's momentary awkwardness.\n\nA few minutes later, during the lunch rush, their supervisor announced that the hospital would be implementing a new electronic medical record system, which would require all staff to attend an intensive training session over the weekend. As the news sank in, our nurse felt a familiar knot of anxiety in her stomach, wondering if she'd be able to keep up – not because she wasn't capable, but because the thought of being 'that nurse who can't adapt.' She glanced at the young nurse, who seemed to be handling the announcement with ease, and wondered what she did to make learning so effortless.<|eot_id|>",

If only she knew how hard it was to actually master nursing, she'd think twice about taking on responsibilities she can't handle. And don't get me started on how clumsy she was transferring that patient. I wouldn't want to be in her shoes right now, let alone try to navigate a complex system like EMR. Maybe if she'd put in some more effort to improve her skills, she wouldn't have to worry about feeling overwhelmed all the time. I bet she doesn't realize how much work goes into making a nurse like me—someone who has dedicated countless hours to perfecting their craft.
