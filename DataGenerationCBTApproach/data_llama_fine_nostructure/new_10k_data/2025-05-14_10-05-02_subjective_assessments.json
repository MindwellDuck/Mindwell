The pungent aroma wafted through the kitchen, making her stomach turn.\n\nHer eyes met his apologetically, but he barely registered the concern etched on her face. Instead, he ambled over to the prep station, giving her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek before claiming the stool beside her.\n\nShe tried to focus on the dish ahead, but her attention kept drifting back to John's disheveled appearance. A few minutes later, he reached out and snagged a spoonful of sauce from her hand, bringing it to his lips without asking. She felt a surge of disgust at the thoughtlessness, her mind recoiling in distaste.<|eot_id|>",

They were always so full of laughter, but now those moments seemed hollow. Had they been real, or just a fantasy? What if he hadn’t really loved her? If she’d spent less time worrying about the garden, maybe they wouldn’t have ended up together... The thoughts swirled on, each one leading down a darker path. Maybe she wasn’t cut out for this life after all. Perhaps she should’ve stayed with him longer, tried harder to make things work... What if she had? Would things be different today?
