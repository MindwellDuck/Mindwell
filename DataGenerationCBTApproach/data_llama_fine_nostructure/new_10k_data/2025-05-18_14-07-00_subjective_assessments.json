A whole week alone, doin' whatever she wants... I'm stuck here, watchin' the clock tick away till retirement.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, my sister starts tellin' me about this CEO's \"visionary leadership\" and how it's gonna \"transform\" the hospital.

Noticing her partner, Alex, sitting by the window sipping on his latte, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance.\n\nTheir friends had been planning this impromptu brunch gathering for weeks, and she'd spent hours agonizing over what outfit to wear. She'd finally settled on a bright yellow sundress, thinking it would be the perfect way to shake off the monotony of their routine lives.\n\nAs she waited in line, she noticed the couple next to her, laughing and holding hands. They looked so carefree, like they were actually living life. Meanwhile, she was stuck in a relationship that felt more like a comfortable habit than a passionate connection.\n\nWhen it was her turn to order, she stumbled over her words, mumbling something about a cappuccino. As she waited for her drink, she caught Alex glancing at his phone, his brow furrowed in concentration. She assumed he was working on some project, but then she saw the text conversation on his screen – a flirtatious exchange with someone named 'Samantha'.\n\nHer heart skipped a beat as she watched him respond with a cheeky emoji. For a moment, she felt a pang of jealousy, but she quickly pushed it aside, telling herself she was being ridiculous. After all, Alex loved her, right?\n\nAs she took a sip of her cappuccino, she noticed the woman from the couple next to her now sitting across from her, striking up a conversation. It seemed they shared a love for travel and adventure, while she found herself nodding along, pretending to be interested.\n\nBut when the woman asked her about her job, and she began rattling off stories about her latest exposé, she felt a spark of resentment. Why did everyone always ask her about work? Didn't they know how exhausting it was to constantly chase down leads and meet deadlines?\n\nAs the conversation drew to a close, the woman excused herself to grab another cup of coffee, leaving her feeling a little bitter. Maybe it was just the caffeine kicking in, but suddenly, everything seemed to taste slightly sour.\n\nAlex slid onto the bench beside her, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. \"Hey, sorry about that,\" he said, noticing her distant expression. But before she could respond, he leaned in and whispered, \"I have a surprise for you tonight.\"<|eot_id|>",

The fact that he'd gone out of his way to find a quiet spot to share the news suggested that whatever he had planned might be worth forgiving him for. Her initial annoyance melted away as she imagined the possibility of him taking her on an unexpected weekend getaway. The idea of exploring new places together felt exciting, even if it meant temporarily putting her own needs on hold. For now, she decided to let go of her frustration and focus on the potential benefits of this surprise. Perhaps it was time to remind herself that relationships weren't always about being perfect; sometimes, it was about embracing the imperfections and finding joy in the journey. At least, she hoped that's what Alex was trying to tell her."

A text from Alex saying 'hey, love you' and nothing more. No apologies for leaving early again, no explanation for why he's been MIA all week.

Her kid's got a concussion from playing hockey, and now she's breathing down my neck about how I didn't document everything properly. Like, hello! I've been doing this job for five years, and I know what I'm doing. But does anyone listen? Nope.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

It's been months since she passed away, but some days it feels like just yesterday.\n\nI pulled into the driveway, already knowing what I'd find inside. My mind had been racing all day about the lecture I gave to one of my residents this morning. Something about bedside manner... she always got under my skin when it came to that. I swear, she thought she knew it all.\n\nAs I stepped out of the car, a gust of wind hit me, sending papers flying everywhere. I sighed and bent down to gather them. That's when I saw it - a small package with no return address, sitting on the porch. My heart sank.\n\nIt wasn't until I opened the box that I realized what it was. A framed photo of her and our kids at the beach. We used to take vacations together every summer. Now, those memories feel like a cruel joke.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked around the yard. Everything looks different now. The flowers are wilting, the trees are bare... even the birds seem to have stopped singing. It's like nature itself is mourning the loss of my wife.\n\nI'm trying to hold it together, but it's getting harder by the minute. I keep thinking I see her standing behind me, watching me, waiting for me to let go. But she's really gone. I know that.\n\nI need to get inside, lock myself in the study and try to make sense of all these emotions swirling inside me. Maybe then I can start to heal. But for now, I'm stuck in this never-ending nightmare, reliving every moment we shared, every argument we had... every memory that haunts me.\n\nI took a deep breath and forced myself to move towards the house. As I walked through the door, I noticed something else on the kitchen counter. A note, scribbled in hasty handwriting:\n\n\"I'll never forget you.\"\n\nMy eyes welled up with tears as I read the words over and over again. Who wrote this? And why? Is this some kind of sick game they're playing?\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. Every step feels like a betrayal, every breath a reminder that I'm still alone. The bitterness is suffocating me, crushing me beneath its weight.\n\nAnd yet... I'm angry too. Angry at the world for taking everything from me. Angry at the universe for being so cruel.
