She noticed the way he glanced at his phone, then back at her daughter-in-law, before quickly hiding it behind his back. A faint scent of her perfume lingered on his sleeve, where he'd touched her hand earlier that morning during breakfast.\n\nHer daughter-in-law turned to face her, a look of genuine warmth on her face, as if expecting a greeting. For a moment, the three of them stood there, awkwardly suspended in a shared space. Then, her husband excused himself to grab something from his office, leaving her alone with his wife.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes kept darting between his daughter-in-law and her, and she wondered if he even remembered their argument over the weekend. He seemed completely absorbed in their conversation, like nothing had changed. Yet, every time he looked up, he flashed that same forced smile, one that made her stomach twist with anxiety. His body language screamed indifference, but she sensed a hidden current, one that flowed beneath the surface. This wasn't about being jealous—it was about feeling abandoned, left out of something fundamental. A flicker of curiosity ran through her, but she pushed it aside. What did she really want? To confront him? She wasn't ready for that kind of confrontation, especially not now. Instead, she decided to leave the room, hoping to clear her head outside. As she stepped away, she heard her daughter-in-law call out, \"Come join us!\" But the invitation felt hollow, like a trap.

Now, as he sat alone in his apartment, staring blankly at the TV, he couldn’t help but feel that he was just like his father—a man who had spent his life searching for love and connection but always coming up short. The past few months had been tough; she had broken up with him after discovering another guy in our bed, and he had struggled to cope with the rejection. But now, as he gazed out at the city lights, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this time might be different. This time, he was ready to give everything he had, to make her happy and prove that he wasn’t just a failure like his dad. But then, he remembered how his dad had failed to live up to expectations, how he had died alone and broken, never finding true happiness. And suddenly, it all seemed too much to handle. Why bother trying again? This isn't about being optimistic, but rather about staying focused on your goals while also maintaining a healthy mindset. I hope you find it helpful!"
