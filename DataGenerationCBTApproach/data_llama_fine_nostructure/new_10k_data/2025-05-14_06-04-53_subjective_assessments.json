As she approached the counter, her eyes landed on the half-eaten pizza box from last night's Netflix binge-watching session. The leftover slices were still piled high on the plate, with a few crumbs scattered around.\n\nAs she poured herself a glass of water, Alex caught her eye and smiled lazily. \"Hey, want some?\" he asked, holding out the plate. But as she took in the sight of the congealed cheese and dried sauce, her stomach twisted into knots. She felt a sudden urge to gag, and her mind began to reel at the thought of eating something so... unappetizing.\n\n\"Uh, no thanks,\" she muttered, trying to play it off nonchalant while her body recoiled in distaste. Alex looked taken aback by her reaction, but said nothing, simply shrugging and putting the plate away.<|eot_id|>",

It was the first day back after winter break, and he had spent hours preparing lesson plans and grading papers. As he started to take attendance, one student – a boy from last year who had been struggling to meet expectations – sauntered in late, his backpack slung over one shoulder.\n\nThe teacher had given him extra time to complete assignments, but apparently, he'd seen it as an invitation to slack off. The teacher felt a familiar knot form in his stomach as he watched the boy drop into his seat, barely acknowledging him before starting to chat with friends. He took a deep breath, trying to keep his tone neutral as he asked the boy to raise his hand, but instead of responding, the boy continued to talk over his colleagues, completely disregarding the classroom rules.<|eot_id|>",

The woman's eyes lit up, and she began telling stories about how great Alex was – always volunteering for extra shifts, being super friendly, and helping out around the store.\n\nAs she continued talking, a coworker chimed in, sharing a story about how Alex had flirted with one of their female coworkers during a previous work event. The woman's expression changed, her smile fading as she glanced away, fidgeting with the receipt in her hand.

They're such a great guy! But what if he wasn't interested in me? What if he was already dating someone else? Or worse, what if he was gay? It's hard to imagine him flirting with another woman, especially since we've heard rumors about some other coworkers being very attractive. Maybe Alex is shy or doesn't have many friends outside of work. I wish I could ask him directly, but I'm not sure how to approach him without making things awkward. I'll try to forget about it and focus on my own tasks, but it's hard not to wonder what might happen if..."

She had bought the apron herself, thinking it would be a nice touch to their kitchen, but now it seemed tacky next to the elegant table setting and fine china. Her mind wandered back to when they first started dating, and how her mother had always been the center of attention; she couldn't shake the feeling that her husband was making her feel like she needed to live up to someone else's expectations.<|eot_id|>",

The studio was quiet, the only sound the hum of the air conditioner and the soft jazz playing in the background. \n\nAs he gazed out the window, his eyes landed on a flyer for a local art show – one he had submitted months ago, but hadn't heard back about yet. A nagging sense crept over him as he thought about all the other artists who had received acceptance letters already. He replayed his conversation with his best friend, Alex, who had offered to help him promote his work, but now seemed distant.\n\nThe brush slipped from his grasp, leaving a faint smudge on the edge of the canvas. He felt a familiar knot in his stomach, one he'd grown accustomed to in recent weeks. It started after he turned down a chance to collaborate with a promising new client, citing concerns about losing creative control. His inner voice whispered that maybe he'd been selfish, and that this opportunity could have helped launch his career.<|eot_id|>",

My brother hated me, and now he had broken my favorite guitar strings right before our band’s big gig. All because he wanted to try out some new effects, which he swore would make our music sound better. But every time we played live, people complained about how different it sounded from our usual stuff. Maybe they just didn’t like change, but still, it felt like he was doing this to spite me. I tried to talk to him about it, but he just rolled his eyes and told me to focus on my own part. So I did, even though I knew he wasn’t going to listen. This was the same thing that happened last week when we rehearsed together. He kept messing up my cues, so I stopped playing altogether. Now I’m the only one practicing, and our whole set is starting to feel empty. I guess it doesn’t really matter what he does or says; nothing ever goes well with him. He always ruins everything, whether it's my music or just life in general. I swear, sometimes I wish he was born deaf, so I wouldn’t have to deal with his annoying attitude."
