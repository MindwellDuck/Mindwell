As she approached the nurse's station, she caught snippets of conversation from coworkers chatting near the windows, discussing everything from weekend plans to their favorite TV shows. It seemed like they were all having a great time, while she felt stuck in her own little bubble of worry. Her gaze drifted back to the window, where she saw people laughing together outside. One group in particular caught her eye – they were sitting on benches, enjoying each other's company. It wasn't just a coincidence; it felt like they were intentionally trying to look happy. Meanwhile, her own life seemed dull by comparison. When she finally arrived at the nursing station, the manager greeted her warmly, asking how her day was going. \"It's fine,\" she replied curtly, trying to brush it off. But as she began reviewing the patient's chart, she couldn't help but feel like she was missing something important – like everyone else was living this amazing life, while she was stuck in her own tiny world of anxiety."

She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach, and her grip on the cup tightened as she thought about how this would affect her already tight budget.\n\nJust then, her phone buzzed on the counter.

Her heart sank as she saw his response to her earlier texts – he was running late due to work meetings, and now she had to deal with this mess before their meeting at the conference room later that day.

Even worse, she didn't even apologize; she simply left the bathroom and went back to her seat, completely ignoring everyone else around her. It felt like she was flaunting some secret joke she knew no one else shared, leaving me to wonder if she was even bothered by what she'd done. Meanwhile, she was chatting with her friend like everything was fine, laughing about something entirely unrelated to the spill. Even when we were paired together for our project, I noticed how effortlessly she handled every task, never making mistakes or showing signs of stress. In contrast, I was struggling to keep up, my anxiety always getting the better of me. It was frustrating to see her so calm and composed, especially during presentations where I could barely hold my head high. She seemed to thrive under pressure, handling complex discussions with ease, while I felt overwhelmed by even simple questions. It wasn't fair to compare us; she naturally excelled at these things, making it hard to measure myself against someone who consistently performed better than I ever did. Despite knowing she was more capable, I still found myself comparing our work, wondering why I couldn't match her level of confidence and skill.

She had nothing else. This was all she had left. It didn't matter if she made mistakes or struggled. The pressure never ended. No one understood how hard it was, how much she wanted to break down.
