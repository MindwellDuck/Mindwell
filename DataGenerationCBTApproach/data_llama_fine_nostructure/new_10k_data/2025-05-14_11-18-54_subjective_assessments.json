A message from her boss's assistant caught her eye - a reminder about the upcoming project deadline. She had been working on it for weeks, but her husband had 'accidentally' deleted the crucial design files last night while organizing their garage.\n\nAs she read the reminder, her eyes widened in frustration. Her husband walked into the kitchen, oblivious to the tension in the air. \"Good morning, dear,\" he said, giving her a peck on the cheek. \n\nThe assistant's tone was overly cheerful in the email, and the phrase \"let's work together\" grated against her. She felt a surge of contempt for the person who didn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation or the effort she had put into the project. Her husband continued to chat about his day, unaware of the storm brewing inside her.<|eot_id|>",

But first, let me explain why your actions were so irresponsible.\" He looked hurt, saying, “I thought we agreed that you would handle all the work. Now I feel like I’ve ruined everything.” She shot back, “This isn’t about agreeing to anything. It’s about how my work has been undermined because of your carelessness.” Their argument escalated until they stood nose-to-nose, voices raised. Finally, he broke the silence, “Maybe if you weren’t so focused on the project, you’d see things clearer.” She retorted, “Clearer? Are you kidding me? This isn’t clear – it’s chaotic. And I’m not focusing on anything except trying to salvage what’s left of our work.” His face reddened, and he slammed his fist on the counter. “Fine. If you want"

She let out a soft sigh, feeling the familiar ache in her chest. It had been five years since his passing, yet some days felt like an eternity without him.\n\nAs she gazed at the photo, memories flooded her mind – the laughter, the adventures, the quiet moments they shared together.

If only my boss hadn't laid us off, or if my husband hadn't spent our savings on his stupid hobbies, none of this would've happened. But no, instead, I'm left to deal with the consequences, and I'm so fed up with it all. Why do these things always happen to me? I try to keep everything together, but somehow, it all falls apart anyway. It's just too much to handle anymore. I don't know how much more I can take before I completely break down. This is all so unfair. But I won't give up. I'll get through this, even if it kills me. Because when I think about the people who really matter – my family, my friends – they're always there for me. They care about me, support me, and love me unconditionally. That means something. Right? Maybe then I'll finally feel better, maybe I'll learn to move on from all this pain.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she turned the pages, memories long buried rising to the surface.\n\nThe silence of her home felt oppressive, punctuated only by the ticking clock and the distant hum of the refrigerator.

When we're short staffed, he sometimes gets so quiet that you have to ask him what's wrong. And even then, he doesn't really say anything.
