The message was brief - a simple \"Hi, how are you?\" - but it caught him off guard. He hadn't seen the man's face before, but the tone seemed friendly enough. It wasn't until he glanced around the apartment, taking in the faint scent of his ex-wife's perfume lingering on the couch cushions, that his anxiety spiked.\n\nAs he scrolled through old photos on his phone, memories flooded back - birthday dinners, family vacations, lazy Sundays together. His mind began to wander down a familiar path, rehashing what could've been if they'd stayed together. He felt the familiar knot forming in his stomach, a mix of anger, sadness, and frustration. He quickly silenced his phone, not wanting to get sucked into the vortex of emotions again. But the damage was done; his heart rate had already begun to quicken, and he knew he needed to take a few deep breaths to calm himself down.<|eot_id|>",

He couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d somehow failed her, that he’d let things fall apart due to his own shortcomings. His mind kept drifting back to all the times she’d criticized him, the way she’d made him feel like he wasn’t good enough – not just as a husband, but as a person. She’d always found fault in everything he did, from the way he cooked dinner to the way he handled household chores. Even when he thought he was doing well, she’d find something to complain about. Now, sitting here alone with nothing but his thoughts, he couldn’t help but wonder if she was right. Had he really been so bad? Was he truly the problem? His gaze drifted towards the small box on the mantle, a reminder of happier times. They’d picked it out together, filled with sentimental trinkets from their first date to their wedding day. Inside, there were a handful of keys – hers, his, and one keychain with a charm shaped like a bird. It reminded them of their honeymoon trip to Hawaii, where they’d spent hours watching birds fly overhead, laughing and joking together. That day still stood out as one of the best of their relationship – carefree and full of joy. Why then did she leave? He sighed, letting the weight of those questions settle deeper into his chest. Maybe I didn’t"
