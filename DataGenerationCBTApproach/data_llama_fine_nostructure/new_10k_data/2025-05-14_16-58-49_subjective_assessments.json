It was as if his body was trying to tell him something, but he ignored it until it was too late. Now, she felt guilty for not learning from his mistakes. Was it really just bad luck, or was there more to it? She thought back to the countless times her mother had warned her about the dangers of smoking and excessive drinking. Why did she keep pushing those warnings aside when she knew better? It wasn't just her father’s health that made her think. She remembered her childhood friend who died of cancer at age 35. That loss weighed heavy on her, especially since she knew the girl had smoked cigarettes throughout high school. Maybe if she had listened to her parents’ advice, she could have avoided some of the same pitfalls. But what if she had simply been living life to the fullest? Hadn't her father enjoyed every moment, despite his struggles with illness? And hadn’t her friend loved every second"
