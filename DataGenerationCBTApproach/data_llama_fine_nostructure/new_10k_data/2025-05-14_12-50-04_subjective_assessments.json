My wife, God bless her, had left me a sweet note this morning telling me she'd be late due to a work thing, but now it was pushing 30 minutes past their usual arrival time.\n\nMy gut told me something was off. It always did when my wife was running late. She'd call, text, or just show up, never leaving me hanging like this. My mind started spinning with worst-case scenarios - did she get into an accident? Did she meet someone else?\n\nI took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for whatever was about to go down. I pushed open the door and slipped inside, trying to look confident as I scanned the room for the department head.\n\n\"Ah, Chief,\" I said, attempting a smile. \"Good morning.\"\n\nHe looked up from his notes, a hint of annoyance on his face. \"Morning, officer. Please, have a seat.\"\n\nI dropped into the chair across from him, trying to appear nonchalant despite the growing knot in my stomach. This wasn't going to be good. Not today.<|eot_id|>",

His latest business venture was taking off, and I couldn't help but feel like I was just a prop in his game.\n\nI thought back to all the times I'd encouraged him, attended his meetings, and even helped with the marketing. But did he ever return the favor? No, instead, he'd use my passion for art as a way to validate his own accomplishments.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting me back to happier times. I remembered when we first met, and he'd been so impressed by my artwork. He'd promised to support me, to let me pursue my dreams.\n\nBut now, those promises seemed hollow.\n\nI began to frantically clean up the mess of paintbrushes and canvases, my mind racing with thoughts of revenge. How could I make him see that my art was worth something? That it wasn't just some hobby, but a part of who I was?\n\nAs I scrubbed at a stubborn stain, a sly smile spread across my face. Maybe it was time to take matters into my own hands. Maybe it was time to show him what I was truly capable of.\n\nThe sound of my own laughter sent shivers down my spine. It was a cold, mirthless sound, but it was mine. And in that moment, I knew exactly what I had to do.<|eot_id|>",

He says I need to stop being jealous of his success, but I keep thinking about how he didn’t appreciate all the little things I did for him when he was starting out.

The lines etched around my eyes, the grey creeping into my hair – I looked like I'd been running a marathon, but instead of a finish line, there was just a never-ending cycle of bills to pay.\n\nMy phone buzzed, shrill as a scream in my ear. My patient's chart flashed on the screen, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety twist in my stomach. Another case of chronic pain, another batch of meds to prescribe, another chance to tell people their lives will get better if they just do this or that.\n\nAs I got dressed, my mind began to wander to all the things I should've done differently. Why did I choose medicine? Was it because I wanted to make a difference, or was it because I couldn't think of anything else?

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks – I'm 58, and what have I achieved? A decent practice, maybe some respect from my peers, but when it comes down to it, I'm still just a guy who makes people feel worse about themselves.\n\nThe drive to the hospital seemed to take forever. Every car, every pedestrian, every billboard taunted me with the choices I'd made. And then, as I walked into the ward, the scent of disinfectant and despair hit me like a slap in the face.\n\nA young nurse approached me, her eyes wide with worry. 'Dr., we need to talk about John. He's getting worse.' My heart sank, my mind racing with the impossible task ahead. How do you fix something that's broken beyond repair?\n\nFor a moment, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of helplessness, and the last thing I remembered before the darkness closed in was the haunting question: What have I done wrong?<|eot_id|>",

I remember when I started working here, I thought I could handle it. But now...now I doubt everything. I'm starting to wonder if I chose the right field.

The fact that he’s drinking alcohol to cope also points towards a possible emotional avoidance mechanism. John's thoughts seem to be stuck in the past, reliving memories of his relationship. This fixation on the past may be an attempt to distract himself from the present moment. Perhaps he's using nostalgia as a coping mechanism to avoid confronting the reality of his current situation.
