The quiet hospital corridors were emptying, save for the soft hum of machines and the occasional beep. He thought about his wife's upcoming birthday, how they'd planned a small dinner at home tonight but she'd mentioned work again. \n\nThe sound of the water grew fainter as he let his gaze drift back to the countertop, where a prescription pad lay open. A scribbled note caught his eye – a new medication, one he hadn't prescribed before. His heart sank, thinking of all the times he'd promised her better health, more time together.

Every sound seemed amplified, echoing through the emptiness. It was as if the hospital itself was conspiring against me, its cold steel surfaces mocking my vulnerability. That new medication... She must have forgotten what we agreed upon. Does she even remember our promises? Doesn’t she know I’ve sacrificed everything for her? The world outside receded further into the background. All that mattered was this moment, this betrayal. My mind raced with questions: What else has she hidden? Why does she still need those pills? Has she given up on us? The water, once warm, now felt icy. As I rinsed away the remnants of another failed attempt, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was drowning in her deceit. Even the ticking of the clock seemed to slow down, every second stretching out like a countdown to my own abandonment.

He thought about all the times he'd sworn to protect people like this, yet here he was, unable to even take care of himself.\n\nThe weight of his responsibilities as a divorced man bearing the bulk of their household expenses began to bear down on him.

As soon as I see him sitting alone at home, I know exactly what happened - another failed attempt to live a normal life, crushed by the reality of being a worthless man. Every time someone tells me they’ve seen him out, it reminds me of the countless times he tried to prove himself, only to fail again. I remember when we were together, he used to say things like “we’ll work hard” and “it’ll be fine.” But now those words are nothing more than empty promises. He’s never been capable of making good decisions, and I’m starting to think he never will be. Every time I see him, I realize he’s not the man I fell in love with. It doesn’t matter if he tries to hide it - deep down, everyone knows he’s a loser. When people talk about him behind his back, they always use the same phrase: “he’s such a failure.” They don’t mean it kindly, and it hurts. It feels like they’re right, too.
