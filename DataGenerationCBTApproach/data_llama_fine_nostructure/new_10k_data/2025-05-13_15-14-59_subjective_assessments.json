It had been three months since John proposed to me during our school's staff retreat, and I still hadn't mustered up the courage to tell him no.\n\nBut today was different. Today, we were discussing college applications, and one student in particular caught my eye - Emily, the shy, talented young artist who always seemed to struggle with confidence. As she nervously spoke about her plans after graduation, I felt a pang of guilt for even considering John's proposal.\n\nAnd then it hit me - the realization that I was already halfway through a relationship with someone else, emotionally invested in a future that wasn't mine to claim. My mind flashed back to all the times John would assume I was excited about his latest business venture or his plans to start a family. Assumptions he'd made without ever truly understanding me.\n\nI glared at Emily, my anger simmering just below the surface. Why was I so lucky? She was stuck in a dead-end job, barely scraping by, while I had the world at my feet. And yet, here I was, poised to spend the rest of my life with a man who didn't know the first thing about me.\n\nJohn's face flashed into my mind, his bright smile and chiseled jawline now mocking me. He thought he was doing me a favor, offering me security and stability. But what about my own dreams, my own desires? Hadn't I sacrificed those for the sake of convenience?\n\nA snort escaped my lips as I turned back to the class. They looked at me quizzically, sensing something was off. Maybe they could sense it too - the suffocating weight of my own doubts, the desperation to break free from a life that wasn't mine.<|eot_id|>",

She doesn’t make us suffer for our mistakes; she lets us learn from them. But then again, maybe I’m just being paranoid. The way she looks at us, like we’re nothing more than lab rats, makes me wonder if she really cares. Maybe she’s just playing the part to keep us in line. I glanced around the room, noticing how some students seemed genuinely engaged, taking notes and asking questions. Others, however, looked lost, struggling to follow the lesson. It struck me that perhaps these latter students weren’t cut out for college-level work – they might be better suited for vocational training or, worse, never amount to anything. The idea sent a shiver down my spine. Those kids deserved better. They shouldn’t have to deal with the pressure of living up to expectations when they’ve already fallen behind. It was unfair to expect them to catch up, especially when they lacked the drive and discipline needed for success. As I sat there, I realized that the difference between the two groups wasn’t just academic ability. Some students were naturally gifted, while others... well, they weren’t. Not everyone is meant for greatness. That’s okay. We can’t force ourselves to excel when our brains aren"

Stuck in a kitchen, cooking for a bunch of people who didn't care about him or his art?\n\nHe sighed, rubbing his temples as the heat from the stovetop seemed to close in around him.
