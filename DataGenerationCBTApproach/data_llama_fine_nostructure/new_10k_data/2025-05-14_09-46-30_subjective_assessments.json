A food critic from the local paper was scheduled to arrive soon, and she wanted everything perfect.\n\nAs she plated the final course, her phone buzzed with a text from Alex, asking if he could stop by the restaurant tonight after work. She had agreed to meet him earlier that week, but now she wasn't so sure. He had been acting distant all day, and she couldn't shake the feeling that he might be seeing someone else.\n\nJust then, a server walked by and whispered something in her ear about Alex being there already, sipping on a drink at the bar. Her heart skipped a beat as she watched him laugh and chat with another woman. The chef's hands began to tremble, and she felt a knot form in her stomach.<|eot_id|>",

And what about the time he showed up late for dinner? Didn't he always seem more interested in his own life than hers? It seemed like every time they hung out, he'd have some excuse—“I'm too busy” or “My dog needs me”—and when she tried to make plans, he just ignored her calls. It didn't matter how much effort she put into getting ready; he never made an effort to show up on time. Just because he occasionally made it to the restaurant didn’t mean anything. And why did he even bother coming tonight? Was it just a coincidence that he happened to be there when she needed him most? Maybe he was just trying to get rid of her before things got serious between them. She realized that no matter how hard she tried, Alex would probably never change. She deserved better than someone who treated her like this."
