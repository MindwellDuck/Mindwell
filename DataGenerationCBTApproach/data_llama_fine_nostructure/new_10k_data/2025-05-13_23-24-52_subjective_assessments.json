His wife used to love watching him work, sitting beside him as he explained his latest discoveries to her.\n\nA sudden chill ran down his spine as he recalled the day she passed away – the feeling of emptiness, the silence that followed every conversation. He shook off the thought, focusing on the sample in question. But his mind kept drifting back to their last project together, one they'd been working on for months but never completed.\n\nThe microscope's LED light flickered, casting an eerie glow over the room. As he adjusted it, his eyes wandered to the framed photo on the edge of the bench – a picture of them both, smiling and holding hands.

She had promised him she would get to it, but every time she tried, something else seemed more important – like finishing this painting or reorganizing her art supplies.\n\nAs she stared at the canvas, her mind wandered back to the last conversation they'd had about the garage. He had said it was embarrassing, that people would think they were sloppy because of the mess. The words stung, and suddenly her paintbrush felt heavy in her hand. She dipped it into the paint, but instead of starting to work, she let it drip onto the floor. It formed a small puddle, a tiny mirror image of the mess in her heart.<|eot_id|>",

He thought about all the times he'd promised himself he would prioritize his art, only to let other things take precedence. The nagging voice in his head began to whisper that he was failing as an artist, that his lack of dedication was a reflection of his own worthlessness.\n\nThe brush slipped from his fingers, and he let out a soft sigh, the sound echoing through the room like a whispered confession.<|eot_id|>",

What if their findings were met with skepticism, or worse, ridicule? The more he read, the more words blurred together, and the numbers began to dance in his head like a bad omen.\n\nThe phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill and insistent. He hesitated for a moment before answering, hoping to clear the fog from his brain. But as he listened to the voice on the other end, his anxiety spiked – another researcher was running late, and their equipment wasn't calibrated correctly, which meant delays and potentially disastrous results.\n\nWith each passing minute, his breath grew shallower, and his vision narrowed.

Now, I can finally leave him and start my new life. My heart feels heavy with relief, but I still wonder what could’ve been if I’d stayed. Maybe I wouldn’t have gotten so depressed after he left. Maybe things would’ve been better between us. It’s all or nothing – either I’m with him forever, or I walk away from everything that matters. There’s no middle ground.
