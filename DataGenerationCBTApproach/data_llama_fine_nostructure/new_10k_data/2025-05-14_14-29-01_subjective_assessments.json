His wife had passed away six months ago, but the weight of managing their modest retirement savings still felt overwhelming.

He hadn't been able to afford the premiums, thinking they wouldn't affect them since she was receiving her own benefit. Now, with no income coming in, he felt like he was staring into an abyss.

The kitchen was warm and chaotic, the smell of sizzling meat and fresh herbs filling her senses. Her sous chef, Maria, sidled up beside her, a look of concern etched on her face.\n\n\"Hey, I know you're doing great out there,\" Maria said, her voice low, \"but it's been two months since your last shift off. You need some time to recharge.\"\n\nThe comment struck a chord, and she felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach. She'd promised herself she'd take more breaks, but work had always been her comfort, her escape. Now, with the divorce looming, every hour felt like a countdown to another empty apartment, another lonely night.\n\nAs she plated a perfect soufflé, her mind wandered to the calendar on her phone – today was supposed to be her day off. She hadn't told anyone yet; not even Maria knew about the upcoming therapy appointment. The thought made her feel like she was failing, like she wasn't good enough to get back on track.\n\nWith a flick of her wrist, she sent the dish flying onto the counter, shattering into a hundred pieces. The kitchen fell silent, all eyes on her. For a moment, they just stared, unsure of what to do next. Then, Maria stepped forward, her expression softening.\n\n\"Maybe we can adjust the schedule?\" she suggested, her voice gentle. \"You don't have to work tomorrow.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air, a tiny crack in the wall she'd built around her emotions. But as she looked at Maria, she saw only kindness and understanding, not judgment. And for a fleeting instant, she let herself believe that maybe, just maybe, things could get better.<|eot_id|>",

As he walked down the hallway, he heard the sound of pots and pans clattering, followed by the murmur of hushed conversations. “Maybe we shouldn’t have hired him,” one of the waiters whispered. “Yes, maybe we should’ve kept him working the front of the house,” another replied.
