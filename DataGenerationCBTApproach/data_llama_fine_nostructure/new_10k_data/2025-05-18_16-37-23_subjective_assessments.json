The tension between them had been building up all week, but nothing could have prepared John for this.\n\n\"You're telling me we can't participate in the experiment?\" she repeated, her voice rising. \"After months of planning and preparation?\"\n\nJohn rubbed his temples, trying to ward off the headache brewing inside. \"We just don't have enough funding, honey.

Our research has the potential to change the world. Why won't anyone give us a chance?\"\n\nJohn sighed, feeling like he was walking on eggshells around his wife. He knew better than to argue with her when she got like this. \"It's not about us, it's about the politics and bureaucracy. Sometimes I think the system is designed to keep people like us down.\"\n\nHer gaze snapped back to him, a mix of anger and desperation burning in her eyes. \"That's exactly what I'm talking about!

It was clear that this was more than just a disagreement – it was a symptom of a deeper frustration with the world outside their lab-coated bubble.<|eot_id|>",
