He let it slide initially, but when she attempted to pay with a credit card that was clearly declined, his irritation flared.\n\nThe cashier apologized profusely, calling for a manager, while the woman grew defensive, insisting she hadn't tried to pay with a declined card.

If I just kept asking her questions, like “What if you forgot your wallet at home today?” or “If you were going to buy that wine, why did you put it in your bag after paying already?” Would she get upset about it? Or maybe she’d realize how much she was overpaying and be willing to fix things herself? It’s always better to think ahead and plan for every possible scenario, isn’t it? I’m thinking about calling my friend who works there next time I go shopping. Maybe she can handle it better. After all, what if I made her feel uncomfortable by confronting the customer? That might make things worse. I don’t want to risk losing business over one annoying customer, especially since they’re already overpriced anyway. But still, I wish she would’ve thought of that before putting those bags on the conveyor belt. I guess some people just don’t know how to handle simple situations. What if I just told him to take the whole thing back and give me a refund? Wouldn’t that be easier? Maybe I’ll just avoid this store from now on. At least I won’t have to deal with her again.
