They often mention how these experiences have led them to believe that they’re somehow broken or unlovable, which makes me wonder if they might be overreacting. Is it really fair to say that every time something goes wrong, it’s because of their own fault? It feels like whenever someone shares a sad story, they tend to assume it’s all their fault. Even if things seemed fine at first, they’ll later look back and say things like, \"If only I’d done X, Y, Z,\" or \"If only I could’ve seen the signs then, I wouldn’t have gotten hurt.\" This pattern keeps repeating itself, and I’m starting to feel like maybe they need to take a step back and reevaluate what they're thinking. Are they truly blaming themselves for everything, or is there more going on? One thing that stands out is how often they use phrases like \"this is all because of me\" or \"I messed up again.\" These statements give off a vibe that suggests they're looking for an excuse rather than taking responsibility.
