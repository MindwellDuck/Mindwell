She'd worked this beat for twenty years, seen generations grow up and move out, but the patterns remained: the same entitled attitudes, the same lack of accountability.\n\nAs she began to read through the latest report, her mind flashed back to her own childhood, to the way her father's fists used to fly when he was drunk.
