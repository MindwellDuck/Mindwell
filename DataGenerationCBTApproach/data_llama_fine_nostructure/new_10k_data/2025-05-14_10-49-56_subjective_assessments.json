As he waited in line, his mind began to wander to her - where she was, what she was doing, who she was with now. The couple next to him ordered their lunch, laughing and chatting effortlessly, while he stood there, zoning out.\n\nThe doctor in front of him finally paid and moved aside, revealing a spot open at the counter. He stepped up, only to realize they were out of his favorite sandwich. A familiar ache started to build in his chest as he scanned the menu, his eyes drifting back to the empty space beside him.\n\nA woman with a bright smile and an air of confidence took the spot, ordering a salad with a quiet confidence that seemed almost arrogant. Her words cut through his reverie, and for a moment, he felt a pang of envy, wondering if he'd ever be able to find himself in that same place again.<|eot_id|>",

I'll never be able to understand why some people can just let go of everything, while I'm still drowning in this sea of pain. What if she's trying to tell me something by smiling like that? Maybe she knows more than I think she does, maybe she's been there too, but she doesn't want anyone else to know because then she'd have to face her own demons again. If only she could see how lost I am, how broken I've become. She thinks it’s easy to forget, but she has no idea what it’s really like to lose everything. I wonder if she feels as trapped as I do, stuck between the memories of our past and the fear of what might come next. Or maybe she just doesn’t remember what it’s like to truly love someone until you’ve lost them. Does she ever feel alone, even when surrounded by others? That guy in front of her seemed so happy, so content with his meal. It looked like he was enjoying every bite, savoring each flavor. But what if he knew more than he was letting on?

She'd always been the one to hold things together, to keep the household running smoothly while he pursued his career. Now, she was the one struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAs she turned away from the mirror, their eyes met for a fleeting moment.

What if they still had a chance to work through their issues? She remembered the day she quit, how the tears had streamed down her face as she walked out the door. Her mind replayed the moments leading up to it – the fights, the broken promises, the desperation that had finally driven her to leave. It wasn't just the money; it was the sense of purpose. As a nurse, she felt needed, valued, and connected to others. But when she switched to administrative work, she felt like she was losing touch with why she started working in healthcare in the first place. Now, standing there, looking at him, she wondered if she had made a huge mistake. Had she let fear take over? Was she letting her doubts about her worth and abilities cloud her judgment? The question lingered in her mind as she gazed at him, wondering if he ever thought about her. Did he ever miss her? Or was he too busy being the perfect husband to notice? She knew she shouldn't dwell on these thoughts. After all, she had moved on. But deep down, she couldn't help but wonder what could’ve been if only things had worked"
