The crunch of gravel beneath her feet was the only sound breaking the stillness.\n\nAs she passed by the community garden where her late husband used to volunteer, she noticed a group of younger volunteers meticulously pruning the flowers. A sense of detachment washed over her as she observed their laughter and camaraderie.\n\nOne of them caught her eye - a young woman, probably in her early twenties, with a bright smile and a messy bun. She looked familiar, but the name eluded her. The woman's eyes sparkled as she held up a freshly pruned rose, admiring its beauty.\n\nFor a moment, something inside her shifted. It was as if she'd been transported back to a time when life was simpler, when love and joy weren't tinged with loss. Her gaze lingered on the young woman, and for an instant, she felt a pang of...of what? Not sadness, exactly, but something akin to it.\n\nThe feeling dissipated as quickly as it appeared, leaving her with a hollow sensation in her chest. She continued walking, her eyes fixed on some point ahead, her mind numb. The sound of children's laughter drifted from a nearby park, and she quickened her pace, her heart beating slightly faster.\n\nIt wasn't until she reached her car that she realized how long she'd stood there, frozen in thought. The sun had dipped below the horizon, casting the world in a deep blue hue.

She was so distant, like she was just going through the motions, not really living in the moment. It made me wonder if she even knew where she was going. And yet, despite all this, there was something about her that tugged at my heartstrings. Maybe it was the way she smiled faintly, or the small smile she gave herself when she got into the car. Whatever it was, it made me feel like I needed to help her, to make things right again. But she didn’t want anything from me; she was too busy pushing away anyone who tried to get close. I couldn’t blame her, though – we’d both suffered so much. Still, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was hiding something, that there was more to her than met the eye. When she finally drove away, I watched her go, wondering if I would ever see her again. I hoped they were okay, but deep down, I knew things wouldn’t be easy.

They'd told me that her estate was being settled, and that I would receive a modest sum as a token of their appreciation for the years we spent together. A paltry sum, barely enough to cover the mortgage on our small house, let alone provide for my two children's education.\n\nI felt a familiar knot begin to form in my stomach as I scanned the room, searching for some distraction from the crushing weight of my financial uncertainty.
