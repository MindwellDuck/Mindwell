Their instructor had given them a glowing review of their recent clinical rotation, praising their teamwork and dedication.\n\nAs he waited in line, his gaze lingered on the students' triumphant smiles, and he felt a pang of resentment towards those who had received recognition while he had struggled to keep up. When it was his turn to order, he gruffly asked for his usual coffee, his tone slightly sharper than necessary.\n\nOne of the students, a girl who had consistently gotten praise for her skills, caught his eye and smiled brightly as she handed him his coffee. He took the cup from her hand, his fingers brushing against hers, and for a moment, they locked gazes. The girl looked away, seemingly unaware of the tension, but he could feel his anger simmering just below the surface.\n\nAs he turned to leave, he knocked over his chair, spilling coffee all over the floor. The students gasped in unison, and one of them quickly jumped up to help clean the mess. The girl rushed over to assist, and as they worked together, he couldn't help but notice the way she moved with confidence and precision – a stark contrast to his own struggles in the program.\n\nThe cleanup effort seemed to drag on forever, and when it was finally over, the girl smiled sweetly at him and said, \"Don't worry, we've all been there.\" But he knew that she hadn't been there, not really. And in that moment, he felt a spark of vengeful anger ignite within him.<|eot_id|>",

I can tell by the look in her eyes that she feels sorry for me, but honestly, what does she care? She doesn't know what it's like to be in my shoes, to struggle through every single day. I bet she thinks I'm just jealous of her natural talent. Maybe she even wonders why I'm still in school after failing so many classes already. When she said, \"Don't worry, we've all been there,\" I think she meant it as an attempt to comfort me, but I can sense that she's secretly thinking, \"This guy is just plain incompetent.\" When I spilled coffee all over the floor, I'm pretty sure she saw right through me. Her smile was fake, and I can tell she thinks I'm just trying to make myself look better by acting dramatic. I mean, come on, who spills coffee on purpose? She probably sees this whole thing as some kind of performance, and I'm just playing along. When she helped me clean up, she did it out of pity rather than genuine concern. I know she thinks I'm just trying to get attention, but deep down, I think she’s just mad that someone else got recognized instead of her. It’s obvious that she feels superior to me, and I’m pretty"

His daily routine was now a monotonous ritual, a reminder of the emptiness that had been building inside him for months. \n\nAs he checked his phone, a notification from his ex-wife flashed on the screen - her birthday was today. He hadn't received a gift or even a card from her in years. The thought of another day spent alone, celebrating what could have been a special occasion with someone who no longer shared his life, felt like a knife twisting in his gut.\n\nThe coffee finally ready, he poured himself a cup and stood up, but his eyes drifted back to his phone. A message from his colleague, inviting him to lunch, suddenly seemed hollow. Another social engagement, another opportunity to pretend everything was fine when it wasn't.<|eot_id|>",

The same routine played out every day: wake, check the phone, pour coffee, wait for the morning rush, then return to the endless cycle of work. A notification from her flashed on the screen, her birthday today. No gift, no card. It was a small thing, but it felt like a knife twisting in his gut, a painful reminder that time kept moving forward while he remained stuck. He couldn’t shake the feeling that if he didn’t act soon, he would lose her forever. His phone buzzed again, this time an invitation from a coworker. They were supposed to meet for lunch, but he hesitated, unsure if he wanted to join. Was this just another empty gesture? Had they forgotten about him too? These moments of quiet desperation fueled his anger. Why did he still hold on? Didn’t he deserve better than this? But every door he opened led to more walls. He wondered if he would ever find peace, or if he was trapped in this cycle of loneliness forever. The coffee was ready, but he couldn’t muster the energy to care. As he sipped, his mind wandered further down the rabbit hole, each step deeper into the void. He began to question whether he had the right to celebrate anything at all."
