The scribbled notes from the resident, meant to be a kind gesture, now burned with vitriol.\n\n'Failed to diagnose correctly', the note read. 'Patient suffered irreversible damage due to doctor's incompetence.'\n\nHe felt the familiar sting of embarrassment, but this time it was different. This time, it wasn't just his mistake; it was the mocking tone behind the words. He thought back to all the years of medical school, the countless hours spent studying, the endless rotations through the hospital. All for what? So some young, cocky resident could come along and reduce his decades of experience to a single, damning sentence?\n\nA low growl built in his chest as he clenched his jaw. What was wrong with him? He'd always prided himself on being a professional, on keeping his emotions locked away. But here he was, seething like a child who'd just been told he couldn't have ice cream.\n\nFor a moment, he considered ripping up the chart, tossing it in the trash where it belonged. But something held him back – maybe the memory of his wife, her eyes flashing with disappointment when he came home late, again. Maybe it was the fear that if he let go, he'd lose control completely.\n\nWhatever the reason, Dr. Thompson took a deep breath and forced himself to stand up straight, to put on a mask of dignity. After all, he was a doctor. He didn't let patients or colleagues get under his skin. Not anymore.\n\nBut as he turned to leave, his gaze caught on a small inscription on the wall, one he'd never noticed before. It read: 'Humility is the virtue of the wounded'. A shiver ran down his spine as he realized, too late, that some wounds ran far deeper than others.<|eot_id|>",

What if the resident was right—what if Dr. Thompson really was incompetent? What if he lost his license? He tried to shake off the thoughts, but they lingered. His heart rate increased, and he felt a bead of sweat trickle down his forehead. His hands tightened into fists, and he clenched his jaw so hard he worried it might crack. As he left the room, Dr. Thompson couldn’t help but wonder if he’d made another terrible mistake. What if he kept going like this? What if he continued to make errors, and eventually, no one would trust him again? The questions swirled in his head, fueling his anxiety. Dr. Thompson knew he needed to calm down, but he couldn’t seem to stop spiraling into these dark scenarios.

And though I may look back and wonder if I’ve made mistakes along the way, I know deep down that these choices were necessary.
