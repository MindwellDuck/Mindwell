The way his ex-girlfriend laughed with the other guy seemed so natural, as if they were old friends catching up. Their banter was light, playful, and completely carefree—nothing like how their relationship used to be. At first, he couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. Why did this stranger get to have such a perfect moment while he was left with painful memories? But then he realized that maybe he wasn't supposed to feel anything at all. Maybe this whole thing was meant to remind him that he deserved better. After all, he was still grieving the loss of their relationship, and seeing her with someone else just made things worse. So, instead of dwelling on what could’ve been, he decided to focus on moving forward. It was time to put the past behind him and start fresh."

Every time she opened the fridge, she felt like she was opening a door to the past, and every ingredient reminded her of him. She started to cry, but then she remembered how much joy he brought to our life. He made me feel loved in ways I never imagined possible. His passion for food was contagious, and his kindness inspired me to be a better version of myself. When we were together, everything felt perfect – even when we disagreed, our arguments became opportunities for growth and deeper understanding. We balanced each other out, and our relationship taught me valuable lessons about forgiveness and patience. I realized that true happiness comes from within, and I’m grateful for every moment we spent together.

The wrapper seemed normal enough, but something about the compact shape and lack of branding made him pause.\n\nAs he turned the package over, a faint scent wafted out, making his stomach turn. He felt a sudden urge to spit, and his mind began to wander to all the places this could have been – food courts, public transportation, hospitals like his own.\n\nA shiver ran down his spine as he carefully set the package back on the counter, his hand instinctively reaching for the nearby trash can. His gaze drifted towards the kitchen table, where his wife had left a half-eaten meal earlier that day.
