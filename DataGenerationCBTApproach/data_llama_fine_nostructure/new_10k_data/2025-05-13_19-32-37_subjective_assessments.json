But I'm sure it's just an excuse for her to avoid dealing with the reality of loss. She probably doesn’t even want to admit how much she misses their daughter. She must be struggling to come to terms with what could’ve been. That lab bench looks empty; she might as well be grieving again. I bet she wishes she could turn back time and change everything. I feel sorry for her. She lost her chance to save someone important. What would her life be like now? I wonder what her daughter would say if she knew about all these failed attempts. Maybe she’d forgive her someday, but I doubt it. I hope she realizes that there’s more to life than just saving people. This isn’t going to end well. She should just give up.

She hadn't cooked that dish in years, but something about seeing it again brought up feelings of regret – regret for letting things fall apart, regret for not being able to hold onto what they had.\n\nThe phone rang, breaking the silence, and she hesitated before answering.

This leads to feelings of inadequacy and frustration. ## Step 2: Determine the Cognitive Distortion In this case, the protagonist views herself as either completely ignorant or a mastermind who understands everything perfectly.

We want the reader to understand that her feelings are extreme and possibly irrational. ## Step 4: Write the Response Here’s the rewritten response: She stared blankly ahead, her mind numb to the lecture unfolding before her.
