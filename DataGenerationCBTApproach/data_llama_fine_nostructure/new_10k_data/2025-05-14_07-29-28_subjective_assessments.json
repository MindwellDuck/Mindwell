A chart slipped from her hand, papers spilling onto the floor as she rushed to grab it. As she bent down to gather the scattered sheets, her heel caught on the edge of a nearby bed frame.\n\nHer phone rang, shrill in the sudden silence. Apologetic, she picked up, only to hear the unmistakable voice of Dr. Thompson on the other end – her former husband's name still familiar to her ear. He'd called earlier that week, asking to speak with her about the patient he was transferring care to; they were no longer married, but the connection still lingered.\n\nAs she listened, mortified, her colleagues began to stare, their faces a blur of concern and curiosity. The humiliation washed over her like a cold wave – the public exposure, the professional awkwardness, the painful reminder that some wounds never fully healed. She let out a tight breath, the sound echoing through the room, and hastily ended the call.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't just the fall itself, but the way everyone looked at her—judgmental, critical, and disgusted. Her colleagues seemed to be watching her every move, waiting for another slip-up so they could point it out. Even the doctor who'd transferred the patient, a man she'd once considered a friend, couldn't hide his disdain when he spoke to her. His words were laced with condescension, making her feel even more inadequate. She knew she needed to apologize, but the thought of facing him made her stomach twist into knots. Every glance, every comment, made her feel like I’m a complete failure, one mistake away from being fired."

She picked up the scattered items, handed them back one by one, her expression a mix of annoyance and impatience.\n\nAs the woman took her belongings, she caught a glimpse of the barista's name tag – \"Emily\" – and felt a pang of embarrassment. This was the third time this month she'd had a public mishap, and it seemed like every time, Emily was there to witness it. Something about Emily's knowing look made her feel like she was being singled out.<|eot_id|>",
