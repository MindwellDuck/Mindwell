The restaurant was bustling, but she was in her element, the sizzle of vegetables and the aroma of roasting meats a familiar comfort.\n\nJust then, the headwaiter approached, his expression apologetic but insistent. \"I'm so sorry, Chef, but we're running low on fresh herbs. Can you make do with what we have?\"\n\nHer hands clenched into fists as she gazed at the wilted bunch of parsley before her. She had spent years cultivating relationships with local farmers, building a reputation for using only the freshest ingredients. This...this was unacceptable.\n\nThe waiter's voice cut through her thoughts, asking again if she could accommodate the request. Her response was curt, a single word that sent the poor man scurrying away, looking mortified. For a moment, she forgot about the kitchen, forgot about the dinner service, and all she could think about was the injustice of it all.<|eot_id|>",

The way he apologized, looked up to her like she was God herself, and still asked for more—like he didn’t know better. How could someone be so clueless? He knew exactly why she wouldn’t let him have those herbs. It wasn’t just about being a perfectionist; it was about respect. Respect for her craft, respect for her time, and respect for the hard work she put into every dish. And yet, here he was, acting like this was some kind of personal failing. It wasn’t just about the herbs; it was about everything. The way he rushed through orders, the mistakes he made, the constant questions about timing and preparation—it was all an insult. His incompetence was wearing her down, making her doubt her own abilities. She felt like she was constantly fighting against him, trying to keep him in line, but no matter how many times she reminded him to follow procedures, he continued to mess things up. The look on his face when she told him to stop apologizing and start cooking was priceless—the realization dawning on him that he was out of his league. But instead of taking responsibility, he tried to shift the blame back onto her. He acted like he thought she did it on purpose, like she wanted to see him fail. That’s when she realized something was very wrong—a deep-seated resentment that went far beyond just frustration"

He tried to brush it off as mere curiosity, but the way she stood there, arms crossed, made him feel like he was being sized up.\n\nWhen his phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number, he hesitated before answering. The message was brief – \"You're being watched\" – followed by nothing else. The words sent a shiver down his spine, and for a moment, he wondered if someone was indeed onto him.<|eot_id|>",

They were chatting with coworkers, laughing, and going about their days with ease. Meanwhile, he was stuck in his own thoughts, worried about potential problems and overthinking every interaction. This subtle comparison had taken hold of his mind, making him feel even more anxious. It wasn’t just the text; it was how everything seemed to be falling into place for everyone else, while he struggled to keep up. He felt like he was missing out on something essential, like he was living in slow motion compared to those around him.

For now, he took another sip of his lukewarm coffee, trying to distract himself from the growing sense of discomfort.

Why did she get to experience all these wonderful things while he was left behind? When he looked at the same photo again, this time focusing more closely, he saw the small cracks in the image. One student sat slightly off-center, looking less enthused than the others. Another child’s hand was tucked into her pocket, as if hiding something. Rachel’s smile seemed forced, and her eyes looked tired. For the first time, he wondered if everything wasn’t so perfect after all. Maybe he wasn't missing out, but rather, he was just seeing a different side of reality."
