A 'friendly' visit from my ex-wife and her new little boyfriend.\n\nI'm walking out of the ER, still trying to scrub the smell of death off my hands, when she's waiting there with this smug little smirk on her face. Like, what did I ever do wrong? Did I not provide enough alimony? Did I not give her the perfect kids?\n\nAnd then he shows up, this muscle-bound meathead who thinks he can just waltz in here and steal my family away from me. Newsflash, buddy: I'm the one with the medical degree, not you.\n\nShe starts rambling on about how we're'moving forward' and 'healing together', whatever that means. Healing together? Are they fucking insane? They think I haven't been healing myself for years, dealing with the aftermath of their toxic relationship?\n\nAnd the worst part? My hospital ID badge. She's holding it, laughing like it's some kind of joke. 'Guess you'll never see this again', she says, her eyes glinting with triumph. Never see this again? This badge has seen more blood than either of them will ever see in their entire lives.\n\nI feel my anger boiling over, my mind racing with all the ways I could take them down. But no, I'm stuck here, frozen in place like a goddamn statue. Because what does a 46-year-old doctor do when his ex-wife and her new boyfriend show up at the hospital, taunting him with his own ID badge? Absolutely nothing.\n\nJust stand there and watch as they walk away, laughing and holding hands like a couple of idiots. I swear, I'd rather die than live through another minute of this crap.\"<|eot_id|>",

It's understandable that you would want to protect yourself from being reminded of those experiences, though. I'm sure it can be overwhelming to deal with the emotional fallout of your job. It sounds like you're feeling pretty upset right now, which is totally valid. However, I think it's worth considering whether your reactions might be influenced by your personal circumstances. For instance, how does it make you feel when someone else gets to share stories about their relationships while you're dealing with the challenges of being single? Or maybe the fact that your ex-wife is moving on so quickly makes you wonder if you're missing something important? I understand why you'd feel frustrated after seeing her with someone new. It's natural to compare our situations to others and try to figure out what we're doing differently. But perhaps instead of focusing on what you perceive as unfair comparisons, you could explore what these moments reveal about your own growth and resilience. Maybe there’s even an opportunity for self-reflection here—what do you hope to learn or achieve by acknowledging these feelings?\""

He'd worked tirelessly to keep her legacy alive, but some days felt like an insurmountable burden. Today was one of those days.\n\nAs Ms. Patel carefully poured the final vial of solution into the reaction vessel, Dr. Thompson couldn't help but think about the countless hours they'd spent together working on this project.

His proximity had always made her feel seen, heard.\n\nEmily, on the other hand, was new to the team. A bright-eyed, ambitious young woman who seemed to have effortlessly captured John's attention. As the meeting concluded, Margaret found herself involuntarily watching as John walked Emily out of the conference room, exchanging pleasantries and laughter.\n\nShe forced herself to focus on the task at hand, yet her mind kept drifting back to the way John's fingers brushed against hers as they worked together. The sensation still sent shivers down her spine. \n\nLater, as she packed up her things, Margaret caught John's eye across the room. For a fleeting moment, their gazes locked, and she could've sworn she saw a flicker of something – guilt? Regret? – before he looked away, lost in conversation with Emily once more.\n\nA pang of rejection settled in the pit of her stomach as she collected her belongings and made her way out of the office.
