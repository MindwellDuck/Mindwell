The beeping of machines and sterile scent of the hospital hung heavy around her.\n\nA young mother, exhausted and red-eyed, turned to thank the nurse before rushing out to catch a flight home. The nurse gave her a reassuring smile and a pat on the hand, but our nurse's gaze lingered on the departing patient, her eyes burning with a mix of frustration and anger.\n\nThe phone on the counter jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, listening to the voice on the other end – a doctor's order, yet again, that could have been prevented if only the ER had called sooner. Her eyes met those of her coworker, who was trying to stifle a snicker. Our nurse's jaw clenched tighter as she forced a neutral expression onto her face, but the words died on her lips, lost in the hollow echo of the hospital's corridors.<|eot_id|>",

I'm still waiting for someone to pick up the paperwork from her shift, so we're both stuck with the same pain and stress. At least she gets to leave soon. Maybe she'll get some rest after all that.

I try to say no, but then I get guilt-tripped until I give in. I feel trapped by all these expectations and responsibilities. Maybe I’ll just take another break tomorrow.
