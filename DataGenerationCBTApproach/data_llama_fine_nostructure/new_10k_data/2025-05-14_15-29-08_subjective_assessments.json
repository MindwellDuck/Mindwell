It seemed like every decision he made had led to this moment, the realization that he might never see her smile again. As he looked around the room, he felt lost. Every object reminded him of her—every note she left, every memory they shared, every laugh. Even the smell of coffee didn’t feel the same; it now just reminded him of mornings we spent together, sipping our cups before bed. But what did it matter? She was gone, and no amount of nostalgia would change that. He thought about all the times she’d said she needed space, how he’d pushed her away, trying to make sense of it all. Had he been too much? Too little? The questions swirled in his head, each one leading him further into despair. Maybe if he’d done things differently, if he’d been more patient, more understanding— But then he remembered the fights, the arguments, the moments when she told him she couldn’t handle it anymore.

The sterile smell of disinfectant hung heavy in the air as he gazed out the window at the grey sky. His wife, expecting their first child soon, had called earlier that morning to discuss their nursery plans – and how they couldn't afford any new furniture.\n\nAs he stared blankly into space, the soft hum of the refrigerators provided an uncomfortable contrast to the weight settling in his chest.

We’ve got bills to pay and student loans to worry about. # Cognitive Distortion: Mind Reading ## What is it? Mind reading is a type of cognitive distortion where people assume they understand someone else's thoughts or feelings without having direct access to that person's inner world. ## Why does it happen? This happens when people are trying to make sense of social situations and want to avoid feeling uncomfortable or awkward. It often occurs when there’s a power imbalance, such as between parents and children, bosses and employees, or teachers and students. ## How does it affect us? When we engage with mind-reading, we tend to focus on our own emotions and biases rather than genuinely understanding other people. This leads to misunderstandings and miscommunications, causing unnecessary stress and conflict. ## Can we overcome it? Yes, by being more aware of our thoughts and feelings, we can learn to let go of mind-reading and develop empathy instead. Here are some tips: * Practice self-reflection to better understand your emotions and needs. * Ask open-ended questions to encourage honest communication from others. * Listen actively and try to see things from different perspectives. * Recognize when you're using mind"

His partner had left a note on the kitchen counter - 'I need space' - after a heated argument about their art project last night. The painting he was working on now seemed trivial compared to the frustration building inside him.\n\nAs he stared at the blank canvas, his mind began to wander back to the conversation.

He recalled all the late nights spent pouring over techniques, all the sacrifices made to bring his vision to life. \n\nThe brush slipped from his grasp as he clenched his jaw, sending a glob of paint crashing onto the floor.

The diagnosis was one she had seen countless times before – a routine case of hypertension, easily treatable. Yet, as she scanned the notes, something nagged at her.\n\nThe patient's blood pressure had spiked significantly since admission, and a quick glance at the ECG revealed a concerning arrhythmia. She felt a pang in her stomach as she realized she had missed a crucial reading during the initial assessment, an oversight that could have led to this complication.\n\nHer mind began to wander back to the last time she'd spoken to her ex-husband, a cardiologist himself, about the similarities between their patients' conditions. They had exchanged a knowing glance, and he'd mentioned his concerns about her approach to managing blood pressure. A spark of defensiveness ignited within her, but she quickly suppressed it, attributing it to fatigue.\n\nAs she continued to review the patient's chart, the nagging feeling persisted, echoing through her thoughts like a gentle hum. It wasn't until she heard the soft beeping of the monitor signaling the patient's heart rate had increased again that she finally acknowledged the source of her unease – the what-ifs that lingered long after the initial diagnosis, and the lingering doubt that crept into her mind whenever she thought about her own decisions as a doctor.<|eot_id|>",

That phone call from her sister might have been more than just small talk—it could’ve been an attempt to remind her of everything she’s missing. I wonder what she’s really saying beneath the surface—“We’re all growing older, and you’re still here, alone.” Her eyes keep drifting back to the clock, which ticks away the moments until tomorrow morning.
