The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare, illuminating the empty spaces between tables where friends and family had once joined her. A young couple walked by, hand in hand, their conversation hushed but joyful; she felt a pang in her chest as they vanished into the crowd.\n\nThe doctor next to her caught her eye, flashing a tired smile before returning to his phone. She watched him type out a message, then glance up at the clock on the wall – already 30 minutes past their scheduled break. The hospital was quieting down, but she remained seated, unsure why she hadn't gotten up to leave like everyone else. The silence from the other attendees grew thicker, punctuated only by the occasional clinking of cups or rustling of papers. Her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number, but she let it go unanswered, lost in the weight of her own solitude.<|eot_id|>",

His mind went blank, and all he could think about was how out of touch he felt with his peers.

It wasn't just the lack of confidence showing in front of his boss that bothered him; it was the sense of being left behind by those around him. As he sat there, watching his colleagues seamlessly navigate the conversation, he found himself wondering what would happen if he tried to contribute. Would he get flustered and stumble over his words, making things worse? But then again, what if he managed to articulate his thoughts clearly? Maybe he wouldn’t look so foolish after all. Maybe the boss would see the effort he put into understanding the material, and appreciate his willingness to learn. Perhaps she’d even offer some valuable feedback to help him improve. Then again, what if he failed to explain his point effectively? What if his attempts came across as forced or awkward, revealing his lack of expertise? What if that made everyone else uncomfortable, leading to further embarrassment? These thoughts swirled in his head as he sat silently, lost in speculation about potential outcomes. He wasn’t sure what was more daunting – the fear of saying something wrong or the anxiety of feeling like he didn’t belong in the group. As the meeting concluded, and everyone began to disperse, he realized he hadn’t spoken up once. Had he missed an opportunity to showcase his skills, or did he avoid it because he was too afraid of looking silly?

He thought maybe, just maybe, things were going back to normal. But then she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, \"I brought your favorite flowers.\"\n\nHis eyes dropped to the ground, and his feet seemed rooted to the spot.

Why is everyone always bringing me stuff when I never ask for it? Doesn't anyone realize how much I hate this kind of thing? I can't believe she actually went out of her way to bring me something. What’s more, she probably thinks I'll just ignore it or pretend to be happy for her sake. Like, why would I bother with that? Who cares if she brings me flowers? It's pointless. There's no use in smiling or pretending to appreciate it because nothing will change anyway. At least, that's my opinion. And another thing, why are people always doing these things? Don't they know that everything bad will happen next? Maybe she wants me to feel better so she can feel guilty about herself later. Or perhaps she really believes that flowers make everything okay. Whatever her reason, I know it won't work. Nothing good comes from such gestures, and it's ridiculous to think otherwise.

It's been months since we last spoke, and I'm starting to wonder if she's still living in our parents' house. Maybe she's avoiding me because of something I said during our last conversation. Shouldn't she be calling more often? I think about how much I miss seeing her, and it makes me sad that she hasn't reached out lately. I guess I'll just have to wait until she gets around to sending me a message again. Or maybe I should try calling her instead. She might need some time to open up, but I hope we can catch up soon. # Response End ## Explanation This response reflects the cognitive distortion 'Should Statements'. The speaker is experiencing disappointment when scrolling through their Facebook newsfeed, where they don't see any updates from their sister. They start wondering if their sister is avoiding them due to something they said earlier. This triggers a series of thoughts about missing their sister and hoping to catch up soon. The speaker seems unaware of their biased thinking, focusing solely on their expectations rather than accepting reality as it is."
