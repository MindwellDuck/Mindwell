It was the same old swill she'd been serving up for years, and I'd long since given up trying to get her to change it.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more my stomach churned with distaste. How did someone so lovely, so intelligent – and yet, how could she possibly enjoy this...this abomination?

And neither were their two children, off at college, too busy with their own lives to worry about hers.\n\nThe presenter from the university's geology department cleared his throat, interrupting Rachel's reverie. 'Dr. Kim, if I may?' His tone was polite, but Rachel detected a hint of condescension beneath the surface. 'Your methodology appears...unconventional. Care to explain?'\n\nA cold sweat broke out on Rachel's forehead as she fumbled through her notes. Conventional? Her approach had yielded groundbreaking results, ones that challenged the prevailing wisdom in the field. But how could she articulate them when faced with skepticism from someone who seemed to possess all the answers?\n\nFor a moment, Rachel felt like she was drowning in a sea of uncertainty.
