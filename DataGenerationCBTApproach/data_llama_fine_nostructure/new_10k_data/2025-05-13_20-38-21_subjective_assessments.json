Instead, the weight of her indifference left him feeling drained, as if time itself had become a burden rather than a gift. Their once-steady rhythm seemed to have slowed down, leaving them drifting apart like two ships passing in the night. He couldn't shake the feeling that their lives were moving faster than ever, yet somehow, nothing else mattered except this one small mistake. For someone who usually prided himself on being patient, he found himself growing increasingly frustrated with the way things were unfolding—a frustration that seemed to deepen with every passing day. As he looked back on their conversation, he couldn't help but wonder if there was more to it than he let on, if perhaps he’d been trying to hide something all along. But what could he possibly hide? They'd already talked about everything, hadn’t they? Still, the question lingered, haunting him like a whisper in the darkness.

They saw something in me that I didn't even see myself, and they were trying to prepare me for the worst. # Output End ## Explanation: This response reflects the cognitive distortion 'Fortune Telling'. It appears to be a random statement made by the teacher, but it has a profound effect on the narrator. Instead of being seen as an objective assessment, the comment is interpreted as a personal attack. The narrator feels attacked because the statement seems to suggest that their fate is sealed, and there's nothing they can do to change it. This interpretation reveals the narrator's deep-seated fear of failure, which is rooted in their own self-doubt. By attributing the teacher's words to her intuition, the narrator creates a narrative where the teacher is somehow predicting their downfall, rather than simply making an observation. The use of phrases such as \"staring directly into my soul\" and \"piercing through me like an icy dagger\" reinforces this idea, implying that the teacher has supernatural abilities that allow her to read minds. These exaggerated"
