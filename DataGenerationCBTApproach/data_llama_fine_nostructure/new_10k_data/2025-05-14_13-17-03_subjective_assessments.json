A pause, then, 'I'm afraid your proposal has been rejected.'\n\nAs he packed up his belongings, the whispers turned into outright laughter.

But those were just memories – he wasn’t here anymore. He was gone, and I was left with nothing but tears. It didn't make sense. We were happy once. We were in love. He loved me. Why had he changed? What had I done wrong? I replayed every conversation they had, every argument, every moment we spent together, wondering what I could have done differently. It wasn't fair. None of this was fair. I deserved someone who loved me back, someone who held me close instead of pushing me away. But then there was the other girl. His new girlfriend. She was everything I wasn't.

The silence between them had grown thicker, and she could almost hear it.

Each time they spoke, the tension grew, and she felt like she was drowning in it. Even small conversations turned into fights, with him saying he needed space, but she knew it was more than that. ## Step 3: Look for Patterns She noticed that whenever they talked about anything related to their relationship, it quickly escalated into full-blown arguments. He would say something, and before she knew it, they were at each other's throats, with nothing resolved. It felt like they were stuck in some kind of never-ending cycle. ## Step 4: Consider the Consequences If they didn't figure out what was going on soon, she might lose him completely.
