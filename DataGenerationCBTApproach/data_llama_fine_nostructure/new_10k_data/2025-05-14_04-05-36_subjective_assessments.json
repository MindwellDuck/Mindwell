He'd brushed it off, saying he was taking care of other financial responsibilities.\n\nNow, as he scrolled through his phone, he saw her text him: \"Hey, where r u?

She seemed to be taking pleasure in making him feel like he was somehow failing, like he needed to prove himself all over again. It made him angry, but he didn't know why. It was so hard to understand why she would act like this, especially after everything he had done for her. He remembered the countless hours he spent helping her find the perfect job, the way he supported her through tough times, and the ways he always made sure she felt comfortable in their little home. He thought about all the good things they shared – the laughter, the late-night conversations, the quiet moments when they could just be themselves. All those memories flashed before his eyes, and yet, none of it seemed to matter now. They were nothing but a distant past, overshadowed by the present moment of frustration. He felt like he was drowning in this sea of resentment, unable to catch a breath. It was all so confusing. But then, I realized what was really going on.

He continued to rant, convinced that his life was spiraling out of control. Eventually, his mom suggested he take a break, but even that didn’t calm him down.
