They were supposed to spend two weeks at the beach house they'd rented last summer, but the weather forecast had been showing a chance of severe storms moving into the area during that time.\n\nShe glanced up from the screen as her partner walked into the exam room, chatting about his day. He mentioned he'd almost forgotten his lunch at home and asked if she wanted him to swing by the pharmacy to pick one up on the way back. She hesitated, feeling a knot form in her stomach as she considered how their travel plans might be affected. The storm warnings seemed to be intensifying, and now she was worried about whether they'd even make it out of town alive.<|eot_id|>",

A week-long retreat at a luxury resort, complete with expensive meals and activities designed to \"boost collaboration.\" The irony wasn't lost on him - he'd spent years building his career on solo projects and had never needed such exercises.\n\nAs he scrolled through the itinerary, his mind began to wander back to his divorce. His ex-wife's new partner, someone he'd never met but somehow knew better than himself. They were moving forward, starting anew, while he was stuck here, alone, and still trying to pay off their combined debts.\n\nThe email mentioned a \"team dinner\" at the resort, where they'd all be expected to mingle and get to know each other better. The phrase made his stomach twist into knots. He thought about calling in sick, but something stopped him. Maybe it was the sense of obligation, or maybe it was the realization that he couldn't afford to take time off anyway.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the email, the words blurring together as his anger simmered just below the surface.<|eot_id|>",

He rubbed his eyes, thinking it might be fatigue, but when he looked again, the mark was still there. The faint outline of a single letter, almost imperceptible.\n\nA shiver ran down his spine. Who could have done this? And why? The letter didn't look familiar; he knew all the editors' and colleagues' handwriting. He tried to focus on the story, but every time he glanced up from his notes, he felt like he was being pulled into a trap.\n\nJust then, his phone rang. An unknown number.

Their bright yellow petals seemed to mock him, a painful reminder of everything he was missing. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, his breath catching as memories of her laughter, her touch – the smell of her perfume – came flooding back.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. It was the gallery owner, reminding him about the overdue payment. He hesitated, then picked up, trying to shake off the feeling of desperation creeping in.

She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself she was being ridiculous, but it only seemed to fuel her anger.\n\nHe noticed her expression and turned to her, a questioning look on his face. 'Is everything okay?' he asked, his voice low and concerned.\n\nBut she just shook her head, her eyes fixed on some point beyond him. She couldn't speak, couldn't think straight.

Maybe if he had been like this all along, none of this would have happened. But then she thought about how many times he'd disappointed her - the missed deadlines, the forgotten anniversaries, the arguments that left her shaking. He hadn't changed; he'd just become better at hiding it. Her eyes snapped back to her husband, who was now standing by the window, staring out at the city. His shoulders were tense, and his jaw was set, but he didn't seem angry. At least, not openly. As she looked closer, she saw the faintest hint of relief in his eyes, like he was trying to convince himself that everything was going to be okay. But Aisha knew better. She knew what it meant when someone smiled to hide pain. This time, though, something shifted inside her. Maybe it was the way the sunlight caught his profile, making his cheekbones stand out, or maybe it was the memory of how he used to make her laugh.
