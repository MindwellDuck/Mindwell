They'd been married for 45 years, and he still remembered the day they brought home their first child.

He remembered when his wife used to look at him like that – full of hope and excitement for their future together.\n\nThe young couple walked out of the store, and he was left alone with his thoughts. His wife returned, placed a gentle hand on his arm, and said, \"Hey, hon, how's your day?\" But he just nodded, lost in his memories.

It seemed so overwhelming that he just wanted to forget it all. To shut off his mind and let himself drift into unconsciousness. But then he remembered the phone call from the school, and how she’d asked about his job. She didn’t know I was working 24/7, juggling everything by myself. I’m trying my best here! He thought, but the voice inside kept telling him he was failing somehow. That he wasn’t doing enough. The bills piled higher, and his anxiety grew. He felt trapped between reality and the fear that gripped him. Like he was stuck in a nightmare, unable to wake up. He thought about how much easier life would be if someone else were handling things. If only she were here... But then, the idea hit him. Why wait? He decided to call the electric company right then and there. Not because he needed the electricity, but because he couldn’t bear the uncertainty anymore. He picked up the phone, dialed the number, and waited for someone to answer. The silence felt deafening, but he held on, determined to find some answers. And maybe,"

Shouldn't we spend more time together? I've started noticing little things too - like how she doesn't seem to care that I'm trying to cut back on work-related stuff. She just says \"oh, you're stressed again\" whenever I try to explain why I need some downtime.
