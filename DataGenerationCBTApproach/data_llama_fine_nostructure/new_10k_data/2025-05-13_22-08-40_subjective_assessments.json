This was more than just a simple mistake - it could cost them everything. The funding agency wouldn't hesitate to pull their support if they saw even a hint of negligence. A's mind reeled as he tried to process the magnitude of failure. Everything seemed to fall apart now that this small oversight had been exposed. The entire project hung by a thread, and there was nothing he could do about it. Panic set in, making it hard to think straight. He knew he couldn't fix things on his own; he needed help, but he also knew he couldn't afford to wait much longer. The pressure was suffocating, and he felt trapped, unable to escape the crushing weight of responsibility. In this moment, A realized how far off course he'd strayed. The deadlines, the mistakes, and the missed opportunities all blended together into a single, overwhelming truth. He couldn't keep going down this"

He recalled the countless calls he'd made to his own children about responsibility, about keeping their lives together. Now, here he was, standing alone before the very place where it all started.\n\nA faint scent of fresh-cut grass wafted through the air, transporting him back to summers spent helping his father. But it wasn't the smell of happy memories; it was the bitter taste of regret. What had he taught his own kids? Had he passed on the lessons he'd learned from his father?\n\nThe old man's eyes wandered to the spot where his family once gathered, laughter and shouts filling the air. Silence now filled the space, a stark contrast to what he'd known.

Maybe they pushed too hard, but that's no excuse for how you've turned out. If anything, their pressure probably kept you grounded and focused. So, it's not entirely fair to say that you're blaming them when you look back on your childhood. Sure, maybe there were some rough times growing up, but so many people can relate to that. It doesn't necessarily mean your dad was at fault. You've built a successful life for yourself, after all! That says something about your resilience, don’t you think?

The tears she'd dried so quickly, the forced laugh they'd shared.\n\nNow, as he gazed at the crumpled card, he felt a pang of regret wash over him. What if he'd been more present? More supportive?
