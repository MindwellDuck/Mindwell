His eyes wandered to the old photo on his break room wall – a picture of him and his late wife, taken on their anniversary. He hadn't looked at it all day.\n\nThe doorbell above the entrance jingled, signaling the arrival of a customer. A young woman, probably in her early twenties, walked in, scanning the aisles with a look of disdain. She approached the electronics section, where he was helping another customer. As she waited, she checked her phone, rolling her eyes at something on the screen.\n\nThe other customer finished his purchase and left. The young woman turned to him, her expression sour. \"I'm looking for a new TV,\" she said, her tone dripping with annoyance. \"Do you have any recommendations?\" Her gaze flicked to the older model TVs on clearance, and her smirk deepened. \"I bet those old things would be perfect for someone like me.\"\n\nSomething inside him shifted, like a key turning in a lock. For a moment, he felt nothing. Then, a coldness spread through his chest, and he replied, his voice even but laced with a hint of steel, \"Actually, I think you might find our top-of-the-line models more... fitting.\"<|eot_id|>",

Her words were laced with a subtle sarcasm that caught his attention. At first, he thought maybe she was just tired and stressed, which wasn’t uncommon for people on weekends. However, her behavior continued to raise an eyebrow. She had glanced at the old TVs on clearance before asking about them, almost as if she was mocking the idea of buying such an outdated model. Her comment about being perfect for someone like her struck a chord within him. It reminded him of how she had checked her phone earlier, seemingly annoyed by what she saw. This time, however, her expression suggested she was deliberately trying to show off her superior status. It was almost as if she wanted to make everyone else feel inferior by flaunting her modern tastes. That realization sparked a chill down his spine, and suddenly, everything about her changed. Instead of seeing a potential customer, he now viewed her as someone who cared little for others, preferring to show off her wealth instead of kindness. In that moment, his mind started filtering out anything positive about her, focusing solely on her arrogance. It was as if he had switched to a different lens, one that highlighted every annoying detail rather than letting her be seen as a regular shopper. Now, he found himself thinking, What is wrong with this girl? Why does she act like"

The morning light streaming through the window highlighted the dust particles dancing in the air, but he barely noticed. His mind kept drifting back to the conversation he'd had with his former student's parents yesterday – the one where they'd thanked him profusely for helping their child overcome their struggles in class.\n\nAs he mechanically began to grade, the weight of those words settled heavy on his shoulders. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was all a lie – that he hadn't really made a difference, that he'd just been going through the motions. The thought sent a familiar pang of shame creeping up his neck.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from a parent whose child had also struggled in his class. They asked about his weekend plans, and for a moment, he hesitated before responding with a bland, \"I'm doing okay.\" But as he hit send, the message hung there, taunting him with its insincerity.<|eot_id|>",

Then there were the students who never seemed to put in any effort, yet they always got good grades. And what about the kids who worked so hard that they spent every free moment studying? Didn’t any of them deserve recognition? It was all just a cruel joke, wasn’t it? Like when you’re sitting in class and someone starts talking about how they have a new video game, everyone else will say something nice, but you know deep down they don’t care. You can see the look in your friend’s eyes, the way they think they’re above it all. It’s like they think they’re better than everyone else just because they’ve got some cool stuff. Or maybe it’s just me, but I feel like sometimes people pretend to be interested in what you have to say, but really they’re just humoring you because they feel guilty for not caring. Maybe I’m just too sensitive, but it feels like nobody actually cares about anything except themselves. Every day is just another reminder that life doesn’t make sense.

I heard they're interested in your work.\"\n\nA knot formed in her stomach as she thought of the divorce lawyer who had called to discuss the settlement. He was supposed to be about the finances, but she knew what this was really about – the art, and how it would divide between them.\n\nThe painter felt a surge of frustration as she listened to his rehearsed words. Why did he get to decide how her art was represented?

Why does she always have to go alone and leave me behind? And why doesn’t she listen to me when I try to talk about these things? When we were getting married, I didn’t mind that she handled most of the planning. But now, it feels like she has complete control over everything – including how people perceive her. It’s just not right. And it makes me feel so hurt because I can’t help feeling like I’m losing her. I wish she could see how much this means to me. We were happy together, but now it feels like she doesn’t care about anything anymore. Maybe if she just listened to me and understood where I was coming from, we wouldn’t be here. But no, instead, she keeps blaming everyone else for her problems. First, she blamed her parents for being too controlling, then she blamed her friends for making her life difficult, and now she blames me for not supporting her enough. It feels like she thinks I don’t want her to succeed with her art. That I’m just jealous of her talent. But I am not. I love her, and I support her. But sometimes I wonder if she wants me to be a part of her success."

The familiar sense of frustration began to simmer beneath the surface as he read the generic email, the words blurring together on the page.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. He answered, expecting a colleague calling to discuss the story, but instead found himself speaking to a telemarketer peddling a timeshare in Florida. His annoyance spiked, and for a moment, he felt a hot flush rise to his cheeks.\n\nAs he hung up the phone, his gaze drifted back to the article, now stained with coffee rings and a faint smudge of tears.

The call from the telemarketer was just another reminder of how much he hated his life. Why did he even bother trying anymore? Every door he approached was slammed shut in his face, every opportunity snatched away. Even the people he thought were friends turned out to be fake, using him just to get what they wanted. They don't care about you, they only care about themselves. And then there's the time-share, just an excuse for them to rip off some poor fool and make a quick buck off his desperation.

She winced, feeling a jolt of pain and anxiety. For a moment, her thoughts were consumed by visions of her ex's face, his voice echoing in her mind as he'd said those words she couldn't shake: \"You're never going to be happy, you'll always be stuck in this rut.\"\n\nThe water from the faucet stung her cut, but it was nothing compared to the sting of those memories.

The security cameras seem to loom over him, their silent presence making him feel like an outsider. He wonders if anyone could access the feeds, maybe even use them for nefarious purposes. His instincts scream at him to leave, but he can’t bring himself to walk out of the room. The fear of what might be happening elsewhere, of other classrooms filled with unknown dangers, makes him stay. In the evenings, after the day’s lessons are over, he finds himself checking the cameras again. He’s convinced that someone must have accessed the feed, watching him, studying him.
