They exchanged brief pleasantries before Karen launched into a detailed account of her new staff, making snide comments about the younger nurses' lack of experience.\n\nAs Karen spoke, she continued to order her colleagues around, demonstrating her usual condescending attitude towards those she deemed inferior. The familiar sting of Karen's condescension was quickly replaced by annoyance at being treated like an incompetent herself.<|eot_id|>",

A deep breath escaped her lips as she answered, her tone professional but guarded.\n\n\"Thank you for calling our store,\" she said, already knowing where this was going.\n\nThe woman on the other end of the line began to complain about a purchase she'd made months ago, claiming it was defective and demanding a full refund. The employee listened patiently, taking notes as the woman's voice rose in anger.\n\nAs the conversation escalated, the employee's grip on the pen tightened, her knuckles whitening. She could feel her heart rate pick up, her palms growing sweaty beneath her uniform.\n\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I've reviewed your order and everything seems to be in order,\" she said, trying to remain calm.\n\nThe woman scoffed, her words dripping with venom. \"You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart. You're going to regret the day you ever crossed me.\"\n\nFor a moment, the employee felt a spark of recognition – a glimmer of understanding that this woman wasn't just some entitled customer, but someone who had been hurt before, deeply enough to make them want revenge. And in that moment, something inside her shifted, a tiny crack forming in the armor she'd built around herself.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn’t fair; he was already overworked as it was. But now, with his wife lying in bed, he felt like he was drowning in responsibilities.
