As he reached the front of the line, he noticed they had ordered cappuccinos with precisely 17 pumps of foam – a minor detail that was impossible to execute accurately.\n\nThe barista smiled and asked if he wanted whole milk, skim milk, or a non-dairy alternative, prompting him to correct her, explaining that it was simply 2% milk. The young woman playfully rolled her eyes and whispered something in her partner's ear, causing him to chuckle awkwardly.\n\nAs he received his own coffee, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance at being inconvenienced by this pair's perceived lack of consideration for others. The barista handed him his drink, and as he took a sip, he noticed the young man had left his phone on the counter, displaying a text message that read \"I'll be late.\"<|eot_id|>",

It had been six months since the divorce, but some days still felt like an eternity. His mind kept drifting back to the argument they'd had at the laboratory where he worked – the one where he'd accidentally left his phone charger plugged into the wall, causing their entire project to go up in flames.\n\nHe remembered the look on her face when she walked in, the way her eyes narrowed at him before turning away in disgust. He'd tried to apologize, to explain, but it was too late. The damage was done.

As he gazed at the stack of unpaid bills, he wondered if this latest setback was another sign that things would never be right between them. He thought about how he could have avoided all these problems if he hadn’t been so careless, but deep down, he knew that wasn’t entirely true. In fact, he recalled the numerous times she’d gotten upset over small things, and how easily she seemed to move on from those incidents. Yet, here he was, drowning in guilt and regret, unable to shake off the feeling that he was the sole cause of their troubles. Maybe if he’d been more careful, they wouldn’t be facing financial struggles now, but that didn’t seem to matter much anymore. All he could think about was what could’ve been if only he had been more mindful."

But they were also tinged with a deep sense of loss and longing. Her mother had passed away five years ago, and her father just last month.\n\nThe pain hit her like a punch to the gut. She felt a searing anger rise up, directed at no one in particular. Why did people keep bringing up the past? Why couldn't they understand the depth of her grief?\n\nJohn, oblivious to the storm brewing inside her, continued talking, his voice chipper and carefree. She forced a smile onto her face, but her mind was racing. The words he spoke next cut through her composure like a knife: \"I wish we could've met your parents when I was younger.\"\n\nSomething snapped inside her.

Their conversations were easy, filled with laughter and stories. But she knew the truth. She was drowning in grief, carrying a burden that neither man could ever fully comprehend. Every moment with them felt like an insult, a reminder that life went on while hers stagnated. She felt trapped in a never-ending cycle of sadness, unable to escape its grip. The more she thought about it, the more she realized that everyone else seemed to be living a fairy tale. They laughed together, shared meals, and enjoyed each other's company. Meanwhile, she was stuck in this dark, endless forest, searching for a way out. Her heart ached with every passing day, feeling like it was slowly suffocating under the weight of her own sorrow. Why did people get to live such full lives? Didn't they feel the same emptiness she did? Didn't they wonder why life kept moving forward, leaving her behind? Her thoughts spiraled further, fueled by frustration and desperation. She couldn’t help but think that maybe they didn’t really know what it meant to carry this much pain.

I'm sure she's moved on by now, probably found someone who loves her more than I ever did. I guess I'll just have to accept that she's gone. After all, everyone moves on eventually. Maybe someday I'll find someone new, someone who'll love me just as much as I loved her. Until then, though, I'll just keep looking back at old photos, remembering what she looked like when she was mine. It's almost too painful to look at them, but I can't seem to stop myself. I suppose I'll just keep going through the motions, waiting for something better to come along. At least that's what I tell myself, anyway.
