The patient's name was crossed out, replaced by a hastily scrawled note: 'Code Blue – Failed Resuscitation.' A faint scent of disinfectant lingered, mingling with the faint smell of her husband's cologne on her uniform.\n\nHer mind replayed the frantic phone call from the nurse, the urgency in her voice still echoing in her ears. 'We've lost him, Doctor... we couldn't get his heart back...' As she'd rushed into the room, she'd seen her husband slumped over the bedside table, his eyes frozen in a permanent stare.\n\nA wave of guilt washed over her, followed by a creeping sense of dread. She thought about the countless rounds of 'Do-not-resuscitate' orders they'd discussed before his admission, the assurances he'd given her. But had she really believed them? Had she ever truly accepted the possibility?\n\nThe sound of footsteps outside broke the silence, and she turned away from the chart, her gaze drifting toward the door as if searching for an escape from the memories that threatened to consume her.<|eot_id|>",

Her eyes felt dry, as if the tears she’d cried earlier were now evaporating into thin air. It was all just a simulation—a cruel game she was forced to play every day. Every life she touched, every death she witnessed—it was all just another number in a never-ending cycle of pain and suffering. And yet, here she was, standing alone in this cold, impersonal room, pretending to care for someone who was already gone. The sound of footsteps echoed down the hallway, a reminder that even in death, there was no peace. No one came to comfort her; they all left her behind, like a ghost haunting the halls of the hospital. She wondered how long it would take for her to forget, for the pain to dull enough that she could walk through these rooms again without feeling like she was drowning in the sea of suffering. But until then, she was trapped in this endless loop, playing the role of a doctor, a healer, a guardian of life. Yet, the more lives she saved, the more deaths she watched—each one a harsh reminder that time was running out for everyone. In this place, where life and death walked hand in hand, she was just a fleeting moment, a brief flicker of hope in a world filled with darkness. And when the end finally came, she’d be here again, holding hands with strangers, praying for"

The officer's name was listed, and the description of the stop was spot-on, but what struck her was the tone used by the clerk when describing the interaction. \"Aggressive\" and \"condescending,\" they'd written.\n\nAs she read on, the words blurred together. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach, a growing sense of indignation that quickly escalated into something more. A smirk twisted her lips, and she crumpled the paper in her fist.

Maybe she found it funny because it showed how much we cared? As I stood there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that everyone in the room knew what I was thinking – that I was mortified by my mistake. They probably saw right through me, and I wished they wouldn’t. But then again, maybe they were all feeling like I did – anxious about being judged. Maybe I imagined the whole thing, and no one really noticed anything except the trophy falling. Or maybe I’m just reading too much into everything. It’s possible that everyone else is oblivious to whatever I’m thinking, and I’m the only one who feels this way. I'm wondering why I keep getting these thoughts about everyone's reactions to me.
