The faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the break room brought back bittersweet memories of our quiet mornings together, where I'd lovingly prepare each cup just so. Those simple moments now feel like a distant dream, one that I cling to as a reminder of happier times. But it wasn't always like this. Before my wife passed away, life was full of laughter and warmth. We shared countless moments, some funny, some sad, all precious. Even now, amidst the emptiness, those memories sustain me. My daughter still talks about her mom’s favorite recipes; my friends remember how we’d spend hours talking about everything and nothing. And then there were the small things – how she always knew exactly how to make me laugh, even on my worst days. It’s these little details that keep me going, though they also remind me of what I’ve lost.

The memories lingered, refusing to be silenced, and with them, the guilt. As I sit here, surrounded by these notes, I can't help but think of all the things he did wrong. He never took our relationship seriously enough; he always prioritized his career over us. Now, I'm alone, left to pick up the pieces of a life he built without me. It’s like I’m drowning in a sea of regret, and I know I’ll never find my way out. But then there are the moments he shared with me, the laughter we enjoyed together, the quiet nights spent reading books. Those memories are bittersweet, reminding me of what I’ve lost.
