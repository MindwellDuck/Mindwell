The feedback had been lukewarm, and she couldn't shake off the feeling that it wasn't good enough. Her ex-husband, Alex, had always been supportive, but he'd passed away six months ago. Now, every critique felt like a personal rejection.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into the paint, her eyes landed on a small, unassuming gallery poster on the wall – one she'd forgotten was there. It was from an upcoming exhibition featuring local artists. A woman who looked vaguely familiar smiled back at her, accompanied by a quote about finding inspiration in unexpected places. The image sent a pang through her chest, and for a moment, she wondered what would have happened if she'd met this artist when she was still part of a couple, still building a life together.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe I wouldn’t be struggling now, wondering why my art just isn’t enough. But then again, maybe I never would have found out how much I truly hated him. He always said my paintings weren't good enough, that I should give up on my dreams. And yet, every time I tried to leave, he held me back, telling me our relationship was worth fighting for. Or so he claimed. After all, he did say those things while being physically abusive. So, was I really better off without him? Or am I just trying to convince myself that I deserved more? Her gaze drifted away from the poster, but the thought lingered. What if she hadn’t ended things? Would they still be together? Would she be living in a different house, with different memories? Would she even know where to start rebuilding? All these questions swirled inside her head, making it hard to focus on anything else. She picked up her brush, trying to shake off the emotions that seemed to be overwhelming her. But the more she painted, the more lost in thought she became. She couldn’t help but wonder what could’ve been if she’d stayed. Was she just deluding herself, or was something real missing from her life?

It was his editor, asking him to write a piece on the new traffic light installation downtown – supposedly a major improvement for commuters.

The tone is absolute, with little nuance or consideration of potential middle ground.
