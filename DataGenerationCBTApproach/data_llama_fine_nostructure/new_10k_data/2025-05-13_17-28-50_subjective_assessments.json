He never seemed interested in anything beyond the precinct, but now that thought nagged at her. What if he was hiding something? Her mind couldn't stop conjuring up scenarios where Mike was secretly working for some outside agency, feeding them information about their operations. What if he was playing both sides against each other? She pushed those thoughts aside, telling herself they were just wild speculations fueled by exhaustion. Yet, the more she tried to ignore the feeling, the stronger it grew. It was as if her brain had become a jumble of possibilities, each one more disturbing than the last. Even when she focused on the day ahead – the training session, the meeting with Captain Harris – her mind wandered back to Mike. What if he was planning something big? What if he was using this new recruit to gather intel? It was exhausting to keep replaying these worst-case scenarios, especially since she couldn't pinpoint anything concrete to fuel her worries.

A pang of longing washed over him; he remembered the countless afternoons spent taking his late wife's hands while their children played outside.\n\nThe cashier handed him the receipt, her friendly tone a stark contrast to his jumbled thoughts.

When he turned back to her, his eyes locked onto hers, and for an instant, she saw what she wanted most—a sense of belonging. But instead, all she got was a gentle reminder that she was still standing at the edge of the table, watching him navigate this new connection with ease. Her mind started racing, comparing every detail—the way he moved, the way he spoke, even the way he looked at her. Every little thing made her feel smaller, like she was just another guest at a dinner party where everyone else was already seated. It didn’t help that the woman’s presence brought out feelings she’d long tried to bury. The way he greeted her, the way he listened attentively, it all felt so familiar, yet so far away.

The sound of sizzling meat and clinking pots created an unsettling tension, making her feel like an outsider in her own home.

The older cook, who had shown kindness earlier, approached her again, asking if everything was alright. This time, she couldn't hide her tears, which flowed freely down her cheeks. The cook listened attentively, offering words of support and encouragement that left her feeling seen and understood.
