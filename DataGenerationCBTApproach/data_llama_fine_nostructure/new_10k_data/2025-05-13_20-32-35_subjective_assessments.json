A woman about her age, with a similar face shape, walked by, glancing longingly at a few remaining summer dresses. As our protagonist watched, the other woman picked up a dress, examined it briefly, and then carefully placed it back on the rack.\n\nThe woman's eyes lingered on the empty space where the dress had sat, and for a moment, she seemed to pause, lost in thought. Our protagonist felt a pang in her chest as their eyes met – a fleeting connection, perhaps, but enough to make her heart skip a beat. The woman looked away, and our protagonist continued restocking the shelves, trying to shake off the sense of disconnection and longing that followed.<|eot_id|>",

It's not like anything will happen between us. I need to focus on my own life instead of getting caught up in these pointless fantasies. I can't let myself get distracted from work. This is all just a waste of time. My job is more important than some daydreams. I shouldn't even be thinking about something like that right now. I need to concentrate on restocking these shelves properly. If I stop working, everything will fall apart. People won't buy anything. I'll lose my job, and then I'll have no one to blame but myself. I might as well keep pushing through and ignore these thoughts. They're not worth considering. There are probably other things I could be doing with my time. I should just forget about this whole thing and move on. I'm better off focusing on what I actually care about – my job, my family, my friends.

The other woman smiled wistfully, saying she was planning a similar trip with her partner, who had recently landed a promotion.\n\nThe teacher's eyes lingered on the women's smiling faces before shifting to the empty spaces around him, where his late wife would have sat if she were still by his side.

The morning sunlight filtering through the window highlighted the dust particles dancing in the air, but she couldn't muster the energy to clean. It had been three weeks since her partner passed away, and the routine of their daily lives felt like a cruel joke now.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, memories of their walks together flooded her mind – the way he'd always hold her hand, the sound of his laughter when she'd make a bad joke. She remembered the day they met, too – the way her eyes locked onto his across the crowded room, the spark that ignited between them.\n\nHer phone buzzed, breaking the spell. It was a text from her colleague, inviting her to join a training session today. She hesitated, feeling the familiar weight of her grief bearing down on her. Why bother? What was the point? She pushed the cup aside and stood up, walking over to the sink where she poured herself a glass of water. As she turned back to the table, a photo caught her eye – a picture of her and her late partner taken during their vacation last year.

After all, it wasn’t worth risking her mental health by forcing herself to be around others when she still felt so lost. Every time she thought about joining, she felt overwhelmed—like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. If she attended, it would mean pretending everything was okay, which just seemed impossible. On the other hand, staying home meant avoiding the pain of remembering happy moments with him. Her heart sank as she realized this was exactly what she’d done every day since his passing—avoiding anything that might remind her of life before, but also missing out on opportunities to reconnect with friends and colleagues. It seemed like no matter what she chose, she was either choosing pain or avoidance. And honestly, why choose either? The world outside began to feel like one big, overwhelming mess—a never-ending cycle of suffering, each moment more unbearable than the last. Her mind kept drifting back to the same questions: Would attending have made things better, or would it have been another step towards drowning under the weight of her grief? Wasn’t she already drowning anyway? In the end, she closed her laptop, letting the screen go dark. It was pointless to try to find answers; some wounds would always run deep. All she could do was keep moving forward, one small step at a time, even if that meant constantly fighting the tide of emotions threatening to sweep her away."

He obliged, trying to maintain his usual smile and charm. But when he handed her the revised plate, she took one look at it and sent it back again, citing a different issue this time.\n\nThe second request sparked something inside him – frustration, annoyance, and a growing sense of resentment. He began to feel like he was stuck in some kind of never-ending loop, where no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't please anyone.
