It’s like no matter how hard I try, everything I pick ends up being a disaster. My clothes look terrible, and I have nothing to talk about anyway because I never go anywhere. I really wish I could get dressed up like everyone else, but I can’t afford to waste money on new clothes. And honestly, even if I could, would it make a difference?

Every memory he recalled—every laugh, every tear, every late-night conversation—seemed to fade into insignificance before this stark reality.

Hadn't they once talked about how life was full of those moments where you couldn't tell if it was raining or just mist? But now, as he looked at his wife, he saw nothing but extremes. She was either fighting for her life, or she was gone. If she died, would anything remain of their relationship? Would there be any point in continuing? The questions swirled in his mind like a vortex, pulling him down into a sea of despair. And yet, even amidst this chaos, he clung to the notion that things could only be one way or another. Life was either beautiful, or it was meaningless. You were either happy, or you were broken. This binary thinking fueled his anguish, refusing to acknowledge the messy complexity that lay between.
