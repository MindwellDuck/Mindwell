He's standing outside the mall, laughing with some chick who looks way too young for him. My heart sinks and I slam on the brakes, but it's too late.

As I drove home, I felt so upset. Why does it always happen to me? I know things aren't perfect, but why can't anyone else ever leave me alone? It's like everyone’s against me. And then, I started thinking about my parents. They’re always on my case about getting a “real” job. What even is that? Just another reason I hate this place.

And I was supposed to pick up the pieces? Please.\n\nI thought about all the times she'd promised to help, to support me, but it was all just empty words. She'd show up when it suited her, and then disappear again. Left me to deal with the orders, the customers, the stress. All by myself.\n\nI remembered the first time she'd walked out on us, leaving me to clean up after her. I'd tried to make it work, to convince her to stay. But she'd just laughed, said I was too controlling, that I didn't trust her enough. Like that was my fault.\n\nNow, as I looked around this kitchen, I saw all the reminders of what we'd lost. The faded recipe cards, the worn-out pots, the knives she'd broken. It was all just a mess, just like our marriage.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm down. But it was no use. I was furious, hurt, and angry all at once. Why had she done this to me? Why had she left?\n\nI slammed my hand against the counter, making the pots and pans jump. Stupid kitchen, stupid life. Who needed all this drama anyway? Not me, that's for sure.\n\nBut as I stood there, frozen in anger, something inside me shifted. A tiny spark of sadness ignited, and I felt the weight of my neglect bearing down on me. I wasn't taking care of myself, not really. I was just going through the motions, waiting for someone else to come along and fix everything.\n\nThat realization hit me hard, like a ton of bricks. I realized I'd been neglecting my own needs, my own happiness.
