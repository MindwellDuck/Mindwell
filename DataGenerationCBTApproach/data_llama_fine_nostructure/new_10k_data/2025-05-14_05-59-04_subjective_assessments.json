The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the anxiety building in her chest. Her eyes landed on the police report from last night's call – a domestic dispute at a nearby apartment complex.\n\nAs she began to read through the details, her gaze wandered to a photo of herself and her ex-husband, taken on their wedding day. It had been two years since they'd split, but some things still lingered. She felt a pang in her stomach as she read about another woman's accusations, another shattered home.\n\nThe dispatcher interrupted her thoughts, asking for her input on the case. She hesitated, unsure if she was ready to re-enter the world of conflict resolution. A colleague noticed her unease and approached her desk. \"Hey, you okay? You seem a little off.\" Her response was automatic: \"Just need a coffee.\" The words felt hollow even to her own ears.<|eot_id|>",

When asked how she was doing, she simply shrugged it off with, “Just tired.” Her coworker looked concerned, but she didn’t elaborate further. Instead, she picked up her pen and started scribbling notes on the report. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, like a storm brewing just beneath the surface. But she pushed those thoughts aside, telling herself she needed to focus on the task at hand. After all, she’d always prided herself on being strong, capable. What if this job wasn’t meant for her? The thought hung in the air like a challenge, daring her to confront the doubts that had been growing inside. Yet, she refused to let them consume her. She forced a smile onto her face, telling herself she could handle anything life threw her way. But the mask felt tight, suffocating. She wondered if she was ready to face whatever lay ahead.

The annual police awards ceremony was always a highlight of the year, but this time it felt different. She had spent months working tirelessly to solve the Smith case, pouring over evidence and interviewing witnesses. And now, as she accepted the commendation, she couldn't shake off the feeling that someone else had deserved it more.\n\nAs she stepped down from the stage, she noticed him – standing in the back of the room, his arms crossed and a look of quiet satisfaction on his face. It was Jack, her partner of five years. They had worked together on countless cases, and he had always been there to support her. But tonight, he seemed distant, his eyes fixed on some point beyond hers.\n\nThe music started, and the crowd erupted into applause once again. She forced a smile onto her face, trying to shake off the growing sense of unease. As they made their way through the throng of people, Jack stopped suddenly, his hand reaching out to brush against hers. For a moment, their fingers touched, and she felt a jolt of electricity run through her body.\n\nBut then he pulled away, his expression unreadable. \"I'll meet you outside,\" he said, his voice low and detached. Without another word, he turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving her standing alone, feeling lost and uncertain.<|eot_id|>",

Sometimes she looks like she's still got a spark left in her, but other times...other times, she just looks empty. Like all the excitement has drained out of her.
