Why did I have to be such a fucking idiot?!\n\nI stared at my wife's face, her eyes blazing with anger and disappointment as she stood in front of me, hands on her hips. 'How could you do this, John?' she spat, her voice dripping with venom.\n\nI knew exactly what she was talking about – the email I had sent to our company's CEO, bragging about how we landed the Smith account without telling them I'd been using their proprietary software to get ahead. It was just one little white lie, but now I was paying the price.\n\nMy mind flashed back to when I first started working there, struggling to make ends meet, and I thought I saw a way out by bending the rules. But now, looking into my wife's accusatory stare, I realized I had become someone I didn't want to be – a liar, a cheat, a coward.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of my eyes as I felt a wave of shame wash over me like a tidal wave crashing down. What kind of man does this? I thought, my heart racing with anxiety.\n\n'You're a joke, John,' my wife continued, her voice heavy with disdain. 'A joke who got caught red-handed.'\n\nThe room spun around me, and I felt like I was going to vomit. My stomach churned with nausea, and I couldn't catch my breath. How did it come to this? We were supposed to be happy, supposed to be building a life together. Instead, I'd brought shame and doubt into our home.\n\nI opened my mouth to apologize, but no words came out. All I could manage was a strangled gasp, a pathetic attempt to escape the crushing weight of my own guilt.\n\nAnd then, everything went black.\"<|eot_id|>",

They'd been discussing their shared daughter's birthday party, and he'd casually mentioned how she was seeing someone new.

It was days like this that she wondered why she even bothered.\n\nAs she trudged through the kitchen, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror.
