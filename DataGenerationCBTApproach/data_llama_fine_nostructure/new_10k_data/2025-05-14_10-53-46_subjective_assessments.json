Newsflash, ladies: your kids are going to grow up eating ramen noodles and playing Fortnite just like mine did!\n\nMeanwhile, I'm over here trying to teach them actual history and literature, but no one cares. They'd rather play video games than learn about the significance of the American Revolution. I mean, what's wrong with these kids today?!\n\nMy husband always says I'm too hard on them, but he doesn't understand – I'm not teaching them how to be successful, I'm teaching them how to be decent human beings. But does anyone appreciate it? No, of course not. All they care about is getting good grades so they can get into Harvard and make their parents proud.\n\nI guess what really gets my goat is when they come back after college and start raking it in, making six figures while I'm still scraping by on my meager teacher's salary. It's just not fair. Not fair at all.\"<|eot_id|>",

My partner, Alex, had been nagging me all morning to take a break and get some fresh air, but I knew what they really wanted – to get away from me.\n\nI'd been working on this piece for weeks, pouring my heart and soul into it. It was my masterpiece, my magnum opus. But every time I stepped back to admire it, Alex would swoop in, critiquing my every stroke, telling me I was being too bold, too reckless. They didn't understand the vision I saw; they just saw a bunch of squiggles on paper.\n\nAnd now, as I stood there, seething with frustration, I could feel their eyes on me, watching me, waiting for me to crack. I glanced around the studio, half-expecting to see them lurking behind the easel, whispering lies in my ear. The door creaked open, and Alex walked in, a patronizing smile plastered on their face.\n\n\"Hey, sweetheart, how's it going?\" they said, their voice dripping with condescension. \"Just taking a little breather, huh?\"\n\nI spun around, my heart racing. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Just thought I'd bring you some lunch,\" they said, holding out a sandwich, their hand brushing against mine. For a moment, our skin touched, and I felt a jolt of electricity run through me. Then, I pulled away, my eyes narrowing.\n\n\"You're trying to control me, aren't you?\" I spat, my voice rising. \"You think you can dictate what I create, what I say, what I do?\"\n\nAlex took a step back, their eyes widening in surprise. \"What are you talking about? Of course not.\"\n\nBut I knew better. I knew exactly what they were doing. And I knew exactly what I was going to do next.<|eot_id|>",

Not my parents, not their friends, not even their teachers. Just a never-ending cycle of entitlement and poor parenting.\n\nMy husband tries to calm me down, telling me I'm overreacting, but he doesn't understand.

He doesn't get to just 'forgive' everything and expect everything to magically work out.\n\nAnd another thing, why did he think it was such a great idea to buy her that video game in the first place?

She took a deep breath, trying to push away the doubts creeping into her mind. But they lingered, like a nagging voice in her head.\n\nWhen she arrived at the hospital, her colleague, Rachel, stopped by to chat before their first shift. \"Hey, how's it going?\" Rachel asked, concern etched on her face. \n\n\"You know,\" Sarah replied, forcing a smile. \"Just trying to keep up.\" She glanced down at her hands, noticing the faint lines etched between her knuckles from years of gripping patients' arms.\n\nRachel changed the subject, but Sarah couldn't help but feel like she was being judged. Every glance from her colleagues made her wonder if she was still good enough. As they started their rounds, Sarah found herself second-guessing every decision, from medication dosages to patient care plans.\n\nJohn walked through the hospital doors just as she was reviewing charts for a new patient. He gave her a reassuring kiss on the cheek, but Sarah felt like he wasn't really seeing her - or the woman she'd become. She pushed him aside, not wanting his concern right now. \n\n\"Why do you always assume I'm not doing my job?\" she snapped, the words spilling out before she could catch them.\n\nJohn looked taken aback, but then his expression softened. \"I just want what's best for you, sweetheart.\"\n\nSarah shook her head, feeling a lump form in her throat. Why did he need to remind her? Didn't he trust her anymore? The doubt crept back in, suffocating her like a shroud.\n\nShe excused herself, needing some fresh air before things escalated further. Outside, she lit a cigarette, the smoke swirling around her as tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. What was wrong with her? Was she losing her edge? Or was it something more... personal?\n\nFor a moment, she stood there, letting the uncertainty wash over her, wondering if she'd ever find her footing again.<|eot_id|>",

But as she gazed out the window, a faint smile creeping onto her face, she felt a shiver run down her spine. It wasn't until she heard the creak of the old wooden floorboards behind her that she turned around, her heart skipping a beat.\n\nHer granddaughter, Sophie, had been over for dinner the night before, and Emma couldn't recall if she'd left the back door unlocked.
