The hospital was swarming with patients, and the ER was backed up with emergency cases. Her partner, Alex, was supposed to be home from his shift by now, but the traffic had been a nightmare.\n\nJust then, the charge nurse called out her name. She rushed to the room of a patient who'd been admitted overnight, only to discover they needed a specific medication that wasn't available yet due to a supply chain issue. The doctor was breathing down her neck, demanding an update on the patient's condition.\n\nAs she frantically searched for a solution, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was Alex, calling to check in. But when he answered, he heard the chaos in the background – beeping machines, muffled conversations, and the sound of sirens outside. He immediately sensed something was wrong, and his voice grew concerned.\n\nShe tried to reassure him it was fine, but her words felt hollow. She couldn't shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed, the weight of responsibility bearing down on her shoulders. The stress crept in like a cold mist, seeping into every pore.<|eot_id|>",

It was from one of his students, scrawled in messy handwriting: \"I don't think you're a good teacher.\" The words cut through the quiet classroom like a knife, and for a moment, he felt his face freeze. He thought about the countless hours he'd spent preparing lessons, the patience he'd shown with difficult kids, and the pride he took in watching his students grow. But as he looked up at the student who had written the note – a bright-eyed kid who usually beamed with excitement – he saw only a smirk.\n\nSomething inside him shifted, and before he knew it, his hands were clenched into fists, and his mind was racing with all the times he'd been belittled or underestimated by others. His breathing quickened, and his vision began to narrow. The noise around him receded, leaving only the sound of his own ragged breathing.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe they were having a bad day too. Or maybe they just didn’t understand how hard it was to teach. But why would anyone say something so hurtful? And why did it feel like it hit him straight in the chest? It wasn't fair. Not even close. Just because I stood there, grading papers, didn't mean I deserved some stranger's judgment. And what was he doing here anyway? This was my class, my responsibility. They shouldn't have done this. Why would they? They weren’t even paying attention during the lesson; they were slumped over their books, staring blankly at the floor. Who cares if they’re bored? They can always fall asleep later. And besides, I worked hard to get them here. I put in the time, made the effort to prepare. So why would they disrespect me like this? I gave them everything I could, and this is how they repay me? By saying something like that? Without thinking? This isn’t personal. No way. I know I’m a good teacher. I’ve seen the smiles on their faces when we did projects together. I"
