As she reached for the garlic press, he caught her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers.\n\n\"Hey, I almost forgot,\" he said, handing her a note. \"I made reservations at Le Coeur for our anniversary tomorrow night.\"\n\nA pang of unease settled in her stomach as she glanced down at the reservation confirmation. The restaurant was one of her favorite spots, but it was also where they had first met – over a plate of escargot and a glass of wine.\n\nJohn noticed her expression and pulled her close. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice low and concerned.\n\nShe tried to brush it off, but her mind started racing with thoughts of other women, smiling faces, and warm touches. She knew it was irrational, but the seed of jealousy had been planted.<|eot_id|>",

The water was lukewarm, but it didn't matter – his mind was still simmering. He thought about her, how she'd left him with two kids and a mortgage, and how he was barely scraping by.\n\nJust then, a coworker walked into the kitchen, chatty as always, asking if anyone wanted seconds. He turned off the faucet, his eyes locking onto hers. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the air thick with unspoken tension. Then she smiled, oblivious, and said, \"Oh, sorry, I forgot you're working today.\"\n\nThe sound of clinking dishes and muted conversation snapped him back to reality.

She had this way of making even the most awkward conversations seem light, like she could turn anything into a joke. Her smile was infectious, and before long, even he found himself chuckling along with her. But what really struck him was when she asked him if he wanted to grab lunch together. She knew exactly where to find him, and it was clear she hadn’t forgotten about our plans. The fact that she invited him, despite having already planned something else, spoke volumes about her character. She wasn’t one to forget easily, especially since we’d talked about it earlier. So, when she suggested we meet up, it meant a lot to me. I felt grateful for someone who truly understood me, and it made me want to be around her more.

He watched as she took a seat at the bar, her eyes fixed on her phone.\n\nThe rest of the meal passed in a blur, with the critic making fleeting comments about each dish.

Her hand hovered over the pen, hesitating for a moment before moving to write something on the back of the receipt.\n\nAs she handed him the receipt, their fingers touched briefly, and he felt a spark of electricity run through his body.

The thought made his stomach twist into knots. What if this was just another trick? What if she was plotting against him, using every opportunity to undermine him? And then there were the words themselves—the way she seemed to be studying him, almost as if she knew exactly how he felt. It was unnerving, like she could see right through him. What if she was reading his thoughts, waiting for him to slip up so she could pounce? What if this whole encounter was nothing more than a setup, a clever trap designed to expose him?
