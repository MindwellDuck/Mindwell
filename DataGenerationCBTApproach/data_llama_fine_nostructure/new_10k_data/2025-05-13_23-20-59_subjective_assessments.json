He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he headed out the door, his hand instinctively resting on the grip of his gun.\n\nThe rain-soaked streets seemed to stretch on forever as he drove to the scene, his thoughts racing with worst-case scenarios. What if this was another copycat? What if someone was trying to provoke him? The more he thought about it, the tighter his jaw got, and the harder his heart pounded.

To have been a part of something bigger than himself.\n\nAs he rinsed the pot, his mind wandered back to the day he'd finally taken it off – twenty years ago. The weight of it had been crushing at times, but now...now it seemed like a lifetime away. He set the pot down, his hands shaking ever so slightly as he dried them on a towel.
