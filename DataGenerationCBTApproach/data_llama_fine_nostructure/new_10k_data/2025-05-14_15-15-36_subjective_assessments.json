The young resident beamed with pride, her eyes sparkling with a sense of validation. He felt a pang of inadequacy, his mind flashing back to when he'd been in her shoes, eager to prove himself.\n\nAs he turned to continue down the ward, he accidentally knocked over a nearby trash can, spilling its contents onto the floor. The sound echoed through the corridor, and the room fell silent. The new residents' faces flickered with surprise, before their expressions softened into sympathetic smiles. His colleague rushed over to help him clean up the mess, but it was too late – the damage was done. The memory of his earlier humiliation lingered, a bitter taste in his mouth.<|eot_id|>",

The morning sunlight cast a dull glow over the room, but his eyes felt weighted down by the darkness gathering inside him.\n\nHis wife had been on him about the gallery opening tonight, pushing him to sell more pieces and make a name for himself. But what was the point? He'd poured his heart into every painting, every sculpture, and yet no one seemed to truly see it. The doubts crept in like a slow-moving fog, seeping into every pore and corroding his confidence.\n\nAs he rinsed the plate, the water swirled around him, a miniature echo of the turmoil churning within. His mind began to wander to all the rejections, the unfulfilled commissions, and the endless hours spent waiting for someone, anyone, to notice his work.

You always say I need to ‘succeed’ in this field, but when I try, you criticize me. It feels like you don’t believe in me.\" He shook his head, his expression softening. \"That’s not true.

This event has left him feeling numb and disconnected from the chaos around him. ## Step 2: Analyze the Cognitive Distortion The cognitive distortion being targeted here is Blaming. The protagonist is directing blame towards others (the newspaper management) instead of taking responsibility for his own emotions and actions. By blaming others, he avoids acknowledging his own role in the situation and takes away some control over his emotions. ## Step 3: Generate a Subjective Reaction Reflecting the Cognitive Distortion Subjective Reaction: \"He stared blankly at the worn keyboard, his mind numb from another sleepless night.

Her handshake was firm, but it lingered a fraction of a second longer than necessary, drawing attention from those nearby.\n\nHer husband smiled, genuinely pleased for her, and offered words of congratulations.
