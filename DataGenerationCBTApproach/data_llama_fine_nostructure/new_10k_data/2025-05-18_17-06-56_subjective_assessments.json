We'd planned it out perfectly – wine tasting, candlelit dinner, the works.\n\nBut as soon as she walked in, I knew something was off. She was fiddling with her phone, trying to sneak in a few quick texts while pretending to examine her nails. And when I handed her the glass of wine I'd poured myself, she barely even acknowledged me, just gave me this half-hearted smile before going back to scrolling through her phone.\n\nIt wasn't until we sat down to eat that things really started to unravel. She complained about how stressed I'd been lately, how I never made enough time for her anymore, like I'm just some kind of robot who can magically balance work and personal life. Newsflash, honey: I'm human. I have bills to pay, patients to care for, and I don't get paid enough to cater to your every whim.\n\nAnd then, to top it all off, she had the nerve to suggest we take a weekend trip to visit her sister instead of celebrating our anniversary together. Like, what even is the point of being married if you're just going to go gallivanting off with other family members whenever you feel like it?\n\nAs we were finishing up dessert, I let my frustration boil over. \"You know, maybe if you actually listened to me for once, we could figure out a way to make this work,\" I snapped, trying to keep my voice from rising too high. But she just rolled her eyes and told me to calm down, like I'm some kind of unstable mess.\n\nI swear, sometimes I wonder if anyone actually remembers why they got married in the first place. It feels like no one cares about anything except their own needs and desires these days. Well, let me tell you something: I do remember why I got married. It's called love. And right now, it feels like she's more interested in her own selfish desires than in actually loving me.<|eot_id|>",

If she wants attention, maybe she should put in some effort herself instead of constantly nagging me about it."

I glanced around the dimly lit warehouse, my eyes scanning the rows of identical-looking boxes and dusty display racks. Every creak of the floorboards made me jump, every faint rustle of packaging sounded like footsteps.\n\nI tried to focus on the task at hand, but my mind kept wandering back to the strange conversation I'd overheard earlier that day between two coworkers. They'd been huddled near the break room, their voices low and urgent, but I'd caught snippets of their discussion about \"the new manager\" and \"how she's been making waves.\"\n\nSomething about it didn't add up. They seemed genuinely concerned, but there was an undercurrent of...I don't know, maybe resentment? Anger? I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nNow, as I worked, I felt like I was being pulled into some kind of game. Like everyone was playing along, waiting for me to slip up so they could pounce. My heart rate quickened, and my hands trembled as I placed a box of socks on the shelf.\n\nWhy did this have to happen now? Why did I always get stuck with the night shifts? And what was going on behind closed doors that made people act like this? I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind was racing.\n\nSuddenly, the fluorescent lights above us flickered and died, plunging the warehouse into darkness. I froze, my ears straining to pick up any sound. In the silence, I swore I heard footsteps – heavy, deliberate footsteps, coming from the direction of the stockroom.\n\nMy skin crawled as I realized I wasn't alone.

His once-active mind now struggled to keep up with the pace of modern science, and his research team had dwindled to just one young assistant.\n\nAs he poured himself a glass of whiskey, the liquor burning its way down his throat didn't provide much comfort. He thought about all the things he'd never get to experience again – watching his children grow old, holding grandchildren in his arms, or simply enjoying a quiet evening at home without the burden of loneliness.\n\nA faint scent of decay wafted from the trash can, where he'd thrown away his favorite pipe smoker.

She'd abandoned him when she moved out, and now she'd broken off contact altogether. If she cared at all, she would've stayed longer, maybe even helped him through this difficult period. But no, instead, she'd chosen to pursue her own life, leaving him behind. It wasn't fair. He felt betrayed, not just by her actions but by the entire universe. What kind of cruel joke was this? To lose everything he loved and still have nothing to hold onto? Even the small comforts, like his pipe smoker, were lost to him. He couldn't stand the smell anymore, blaming it for reminding him of happier times. It was just another reminder of how cruel fate had been.
