The sea of blank spaces seemed to mock him, a constant reminder of the students he'd never meet, the parents he'd never talk to, and the lessons he'd never get to teach.\n\nAs he scanned the list, one name caught his eye – Emily Wilson, who had been absent for weeks, ever since her mother's passing. He remembered calling her mother, offering condolences, but never speaking to Emily again. Now, the absence felt like neglect, and the guilt began to creep in.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the creaking of old wooden floorboards beneath his feet. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd failed somehow, that he'd let down another student who needed guidance and support. The weight of his own inadequacy pressed down on him, making it hard to breathe.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe if he’d called her sooner, things would’ve worked out better. Shouldn’t he have been there for her? His mind kept replaying the missed opportunities, each time ending with the same thought: What should’ve I done differently? His gaze drifted toward the attendance sheet again, where Emily’s name still sat blank. She must think he doesn’t care about her or her family. Shouldn’t he feel guilty for not checking in more often? Why hadn’t he tried harder to connect with her? The questions swirled in his head, each one building upon the last, until he felt overwhelmed. He wondered how many times he should’ve shown up just to make Emily feel seen, to prove he cared. Shouldn’t he have tried harder to reach out? The room grew darker, and the shadows deepened. It was as if the space itself was reflecting his inner turmoil. He knew he shouldn’t let these thoughts consume him, but they did anyway. Each moment ticked by, leaving him with the haunting question: How could he have messed up so badly?"

The memory brought a lump to her throat, and for a moment, she forgot about the pressure of the competition.\n\nBut as she began to plate the dish, reality set back in.
