The family member claims she was left unattended during her bathroom break.'\n\nHis heart rate quickened as he felt the weight of scrutiny settle upon him.

He couldn't help but think that this woman didn't understand even the basics of his job – how hard it was to balance a million different priorities at once.\n\nThe colleague hung up the phone and turned to him with a bright smile. \"Hey, did you hear about the new hospital protocol? I'm so excited to start implementing it.\" Our doctor forced a brief smile back, trying to feign interest, but inside, he seethed at the thought of yet another thing to learn and adapt to, another obstacle to overcome.\n\nAs the colleague walked away, he noticed a young resident hovering nearby, looking uncertain. Without thinking, our doctor began to offer unsolicited advice, his tone condescending. The resident looked taken aback, and our doctor realized too late that he'd come across as dismissive and superior.<|eot_id|>",

The things they once shared, the laughter, the simple moments of connection - all seemed to fade away like the light outside, lost in the darkness of his deadlines. John tried to reassure her, saying he knew exactly what she wanted - a life filled with warmth and love. But every time he said those words, she saw the faintest hint of desperation behind his eyes. It was as if he genuinely believed he could fix everything, that one more project would bring back the happiness they once shared. Still, she couldn’t help but feel that their relationship was slowly unraveling. Every night, she lay awake, wondering when they’d find themselves again, but the silence was deafening. Even when he did come home, exhausted, there was always a tinge of sadness in his voice, a reminder that he was still chasing the perfect paper, no matter the cost.
