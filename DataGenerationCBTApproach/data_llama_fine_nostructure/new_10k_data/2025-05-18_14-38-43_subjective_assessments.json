But then I saw him - my partner, Alex, standing there, looking at me like he knew exactly what I'd been doing.\n\nWe were at the grocery store, just grabbing a few things for dinner. He's always so chill about these things, but I could tell something was off. We started chatting about nothing, just small talk, and I felt myself getting more and more anxious by the minute.\n\nAnd then I remembered. I remembered that email I sent to Dr. Lee last week. The one where I asked her about the new experiment we're working on. And how she responded. How she said maybe it wouldn't work out after all. And how I didn't follow up on it. Because, you know, priorities.\n\nAlex was asking me if I wanted ice cream or cake for dessert, and I just stood there, staring blankly at the rows of frozen yogurt. I couldn't think straight. I kept thinking about what would happen if our research didn't pan out. If we lost funding. If...if...\n\n\"Hey, babe?\" Alex said, his voice low and concerned. \"Are you okay? You seem really distracted.\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear it. \"Yeah, sorry. Just tired, I guess.\"\n\nBut he looked at me, really looked at me, and I swear I saw a flicker of doubt in his eyes. Doubt that I'm good enough. That I'm capable.\n\n\"I'll just go grab us some ice cream,\" he said finally, and walked away.\n\nI watched him go, feeling this crushing weight settle in my chest. Why did he have to look at me like that? Why did he have to see right through me? I took a deep breath and followed him to the ice cream counter, trying to play it cool, but inside I was dying.<|eot_id|>",

They were saying I wasn't being helpful enough, which is ridiculous because I've been putting in extra hours lately. But now that I think back, he hasn't been saying much of anything, except complaining about the workload, so why bring it up now? He seemed pretty calm when we talked earlier, but maybe he was just being polite. I don't know. All I know is that I feel like crap. I can't even eat anything right now. It's hard to swallow. I tried calling him, but he didn't answer. So I just stayed home, and went to bed early. Now I'm sitting here, wondering if I'll ever get back together. Maybe I shouldn't have even tried.

Another day, another dollar, another excruciating reminder of his failed life.\n\nAs he clocked in, the familiar scent of stale coffee and desperation wafted through the air, making his stomach turn. He couldn't shake the memory of his ex-wife's perfume, still lingering on his skin from their last argument. How could she do this to him? Leave him high and dry like yesterday's trash?\n\nHis manager, Karen, greeted him with her saccharine smile, oblivious to the toxic waste he was about to unleash upon the store. \"Good morning, honey! Isn't it just lovely today?\"\n\nLovely? Are you kidding me? The rain-soaked streets outside seemed to mirror the despair welling up inside him. He forced a weak smile, but Karen just assumed he was tired from the commute. Little did she know, the real storm was brewing within.\n\nThe first customer of the day approached, a chatty woman clutching a cart full of overpriced household goods. She chirped on about her \"amazing\" new vacuum cleaner, completely unaware of the stench emanating from its dirty filter. He felt a wave of disgust wash over him, his mind recoiling at the thought of touching anything so tainted.\n\n\"Ugh, can I just get a refund?\" he growled, trying to keep his cool. The woman looked taken aback, but Karen swooped in, her voice dripping with condescension.\n\n\"Oh, sweetie, you need to understand—\"\n\nHe cut her off, his voice rising. \"No, I don't need to understand. I need a clean product, not some germ-infested monstrosity masquerading as a vacuum.\"\n\nThe store fell silent, all eyes on him. For a moment, he thought he'd crossed a line, but then something inside him snapped. He grabbed the vacuum and tossed it back onto the shelf, shattering the silence.\n\n\"I quit,\" he spat, his chest heaving with rage. \"I'm done with this toxic crap.\" And with that, he stormed out into the rain, leaving the chaos behind.<|eot_id|>",
