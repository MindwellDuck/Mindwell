The kitchen had been quiet all morning, except for the occasional clang of pots and pans from the line cooks prepping for the lunch rush.\n\nAs he slid the pastry onto a wire rack to cool, the phone rang. He let it go to voicemail, assuming it was probably another inquiry about catering for a private event or a question about the menu. But when he picked up to check, he heard his wife's voice on the other end, her tone tight and worried.\n\n\"Hey, I'm running late. Traffic is a nightmare. And I just got into a fight with my sister over something stupid.\"\n\nThe words caught him off guard, and for a moment, his focus wavered. He felt a familiar knot tighten in his stomach as he thought about how this could affect their dinner plans tonight. They were supposed to try out a new recipe together, and now...<|eot_id|>",

His wife would get upset over nothing, and then she'd expect him to take care of it. It wasn't fair. Why did she always have to be the one to worry about everything? She was late because of traffic? That meant she wouldn't be able to make it home before dinner. So what if she had a fight with her sister? What difference does it really make? It's just small stuff. If anything, he was more stressed than her—after all, he was working hard to get everything ready for the restaurant. He deserved some understanding, not complaints. If she wanted to cook something else instead, fine. There were plenty of recipes online they could follow. She wasn't going to ruin his perfect day by letting her emotions dictate every little thing. This wasn't the first time he'd felt like this; he knew she'd eventually calm down once she realized how silly she was being."

He couldn’t shake off the feeling that everything was falling apart, just like the papers scattered across his workspace. Guilt crept in as he glanced at the notebook belonging to Emily. It looked so much neater than his own, with crisp lines and organized sections. Her handwriting was elegant, a stark contrast to his messy scrawl. Even the margins were tidy, whereas his notes were crammed together with no room for breathing. She must be doing so much better than me, he thought, comparing himself to this picture-perfect notebook. It made him feel inadequate, like a child holding a book meant for adults. Emily’s work seemed effortless, while his own struggled under the pressure of perfectionism. Every mistake felt like a failure, every success a fleeting moment of validation. The knock on the door interrupted his self-pity, but he didn’t want to face reality. Maybe Emily wasn’t as successful as it seemed. Maybe she was struggling just like him, but her calm exterior hid the same turmoil he felt. But deep down, he knew it was unfair to assume that. After all, Emily was already receiving support from their mentor, while he was left to fend for himself. Still, the comparison lingered, making him question whether he was truly doing enough"
