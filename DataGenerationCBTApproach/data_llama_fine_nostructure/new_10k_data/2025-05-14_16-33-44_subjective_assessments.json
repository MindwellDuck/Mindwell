His words hung in the air like a challenge, each phrase carefully chosen to make her feel inadequate about her art. \"It's not bad, but it's not you.\" He didn't even look up from his phone, his eyes fixed on some invisible screen.\n\nAs he continued to speak, she felt the familiar spark of irritation ignite within her. Why did he always have to minimize her efforts? Didn't he understand that this was what she was passionate about? She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down, but the frustration lingered, her mind racing with thoughts of all the times he'd made similar comments.\n\nHer hand began to shake slightly as she set the brush down, the paint splattering onto the floor. The mess seemed to mirror the chaos inside her, and she knew she needed to get out of there before things escalated further. She quietly excused herself, leaving the studio and the argument behind, but the feeling of irritation lingered, refusing to be shaken.<|eot_id|>",

This time, when he said, \"It's not bad, but it's not you,\" she felt like he was rubbing it in. She tried to push those feelings aside, but they lingered, making her question whether she was doing something wrong. Maybe she was just too sensitive? But then again, hadn't he told her once that she was being dramatic? As she cleaned up the spilled paint, she couldn't shake off the nagging suspicion that maybe he wasn't even paying attention to her work. After all, he never left his phone alone, and she'd seen him scroll through social media while giving her critiques. Now, as she looked back at the painting, she wondered if he was just humoring her by saying it was okay. Hadn't she heard him say, \"People who create stuff for fun are usually terrible artists\"? That had been his opinion years ago, but now, when she thought about it, it seemed more accurate than ever. She didn't know what to think anymore - part of her wanted to believe he was still supportive, but another part of her kept telling her he was just being kind."
