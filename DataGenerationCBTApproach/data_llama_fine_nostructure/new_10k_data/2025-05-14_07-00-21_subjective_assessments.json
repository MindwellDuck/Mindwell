Her words were music to his ears.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he thought about all the unfinished projects, the ideas left unexplored, the art that would never be created because she was no longer there to share it with.

As I flipped through its pages, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of sadness and nostalgia. She had always been my partner in every sense of the word—artist, friend, confidante, and most importantly, my soulmate. We met in college, bonding over our shared love of art and life’s simple pleasures. Over the years, we built a life filled with creativity, adventure, and joy, but nothing could have prepared me for the loss she faced just a year after graduation. She was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which took everything from us too soon. I remember the day she passed, feeling like I’d been punched in the chest by a hurricane. Our dreams, plans, and hopes were all shattered into a million pieces, leaving me numb and heartbroken. The days that followed were a blur, as if I was living in a dream world where reality didn’t apply. Even though I knew intellectually that she was really gone, my mind struggled to accept it. It was like trying to hold water in your hands—it kept slipping away, no matter how hard you tried. But then came the realization: What if I hadn’t seen that particular sunset on our last trip together? Maybe I wouldn’t have been so drunk on the beauty of nature that night, maybe I wouldn’t have taken her hand, and maybe"
