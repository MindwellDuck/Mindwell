But as he began to write on the board, his mind kept drifting back to her – the way she used to smile at him, the way she'd always know how to make his kids laugh. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, one he thought he'd long since untangled.\n\nAs he started handing out the lesson plans, he noticed the new teacher standing by the door, observing the class with an air of superiority. Her eyes scanned the room, lingering on each student before moving on. A fleeting glance caught his eye, and he could have sworn she raised an eyebrow, implying he was somehow behind.\n\nSomething inside him snapped. The years of resentment, the feeling of being erased from his own life, all came flooding back. He watched as she effortlessly commanded the attention of his students, while he struggled to recall even the simplest lesson plan. His hands trembled as he tried to hand out the papers, his mind racing with memories of what he'd lost, what she'd taken from him.\n\nThe silence in the room grew thicker, heavy with unspoken tension. For a moment, no one moved, everyone waiting to see if he'd snap further, if the anger would consume him. Then, without a word, he turned and walked away, leaving the lesson unfinished, and the class staring after him in confusion.<|eot_id|>",

As he looked around, the empty space where she was seemed almost palpable. She hadn’t said anything about him, had she? Had she forgotten? His eyes drifted toward the whiteboard, now blank except for a few scribbled notes. What if he couldn't teach anymore? What if he wasn't cut out for this? The thoughts swirled, making his head spin. He wondered if he was just jealous – maybe he didn't deserve to be here. Maybe I'm not good enough to replace her, he thought, the doubt seeping in. When he finally turned to leave, the classroom fell silent, the students exchanging uneasy glances. It was as if they were all wondering what would happen next, whether he'd come back. But he knew he wouldn’t. At least, not today."

Don't you ever get tired of looking like you just rolled out of bed?\"\n\nThe other teacher chuckled, and one of the newer instructors chimed in, \"I'm surprised you can still fit into them.\" The room fell silent as all eyes turned to her, their smiles now tinged with amusement.

She felt a pang of sadness, wondering if this was all there would ever be - just memories of what used to be. # Output End ## Explanation: This response reflects the cognitive distortion ‘Personalization’. Although the author is aware of the situation (he got a new job), they are unable to distinguish between their own feelings and the reality of the situation. This results in their misinterpretation of the facts as evidence that the situation concerns them personally, when in fact, it does not. The text has been written in a way that makes it difficult for the reader to discern the personal interpretation of the writer, which is why I have included this explanation. ## Step-by-Step Solution: 1. Identify the trigger event. 2. Reflect on how you perceive the situation based on your emotions. 3. Check whether your perception aligns with objective facts. 4. If not, try to reframe your perspective based on the objective facts. ## Step-by-Step Solution: 1. Identify the trigger event"

The doctor had essentially dictated how the nurse was supposed to care for a patient, disregarding years of experience and training. \n\nAs the administrator began to discuss the doctor's 'improvement plans', the nurse felt a familiar itch in his chest, a sense of irritation building in response.

Then there was the meeting where everyone pitched ideas, but the CEO rejected all of them except his own. That was hours of work down the drain. That was nothing compared to today's task list. Fixing code, attending meetings, and handling emails took away from real development work. If she spent too much time on it, the company wouldn't even notice. So why bother? They didn't care about the details anyway – they just wanted results. But then came the email: Another delay. This time because someone decided to add features that weren't needed. Again, the project manager told her to go back and fix everything that wasn't perfect yet. Like I'm going to do that again after working late for days, he said. Not to mention, he doesn't understand how hard it is to meet deadlines. He just wants us to keep delaying. The email ended with the usual phrase, \"Let me know if you have any questions.\" Like he does. He's the reason we're behind schedule again. I swear, no one cares about the code.
