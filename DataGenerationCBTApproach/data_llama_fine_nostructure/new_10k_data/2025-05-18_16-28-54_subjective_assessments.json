That morning, he had been preparing for weeks, meticulously organizing his notes and researching new treatments. Yet, no one seemed to acknowledge his hard work.\n\n\"Hey, Doc, can I have a word?\" the young nurse asked, hovering beside him.\n\n\"What is it?\" Dr. Lee replied curtly, already distracted by the conversation unfolding in Conference Room A.\n\n\"It's about your patient list,\" she said, hesitating before continuing, \"Dr. Smith has... rearranged some of your cases.\"\n\nHis grip on the cup tightened, a cold resentment spreading through his chest.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't unusual for doctors to change cases, especially during shifts. Still, he couldn't shake off the feeling that Dr. Smith had deliberately altered his schedule. \"I see,\" he said, taking another sip of his coffee. \"That makes sense.\" The nurse nodded, seeming relieved that the conversation was going smoothly. \"If you need anything, just let me know.\" She smiled and quickly left, leaving Dr. Lee to ponder the arrangement of his patient lists."

We'd been divorced for five years, but it still felt like an open wound. She was moving on, and I wasn't.\n\nWe stood there for a moment, awkwardly small talk about the weather. I could feel my anxiety building, my heart racing like a jackrabbit. Why did this have to happen today?
