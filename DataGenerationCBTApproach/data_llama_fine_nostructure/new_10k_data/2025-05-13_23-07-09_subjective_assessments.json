I'll try to make more time for us.\"\n\nBut she wasn't buying it. She knew him too well. And as she watched him continue scrolling through his phone, she felt a familiar sense of contempt wash over her – for the man who claimed to love her, but seemed to value his work above everything else they shared together.<|eot_id|>",

He thought about all the years he'd spent trying to build connections with others, only to have them fizzle out.\n\nAs he read about the happy family's plans for the future, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow wash over him. It was as if he'd missed his chance at building something meaningful, something that would last a lifetime. The cursor blinked slowly on his screen, a reminder of the stories he still wanted to tell, but the silence was deafening.\n\nThe phone on his desk rang, shrill in the quiet room. He hesitated for a moment before answering, hoping it wasn't another telemarketer or unwanted call from an old acquaintance. But when he heard the familiar voice on the other end – his high school sweetheart's – his heart sank.

No matter how hard he tried, things never seemed to work out for him. Just reading about happy families made him feel even more isolated. Why did they get to live their dreams while he was stuck here? It wasn't fair. He'd given everything to make these relationships work, pouring his heart into each connection, only to have it crumble apart.
