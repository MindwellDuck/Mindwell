As she made her way to her desk, she noticed a couple holding hands outside the break room window. The woman's bright smile and effortless laugh caught her attention, and for a moment, she felt a pang of jealousy. But as she turned away, her gaze fell upon a discarded coffee cup with a faded lipstick stain - a reminder of her own failed marriage.\n\nThe woman's eyes narrowed slightly as she recalled the countless nights she'd spent alone, wondering if someone like him was out there for her now. A faint scent of cologne wafted through the air, sending a shiver down her spine. She quickly looked away, trying to shake off the unwanted emotions, but the image lingered, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth.<|eot_id|>",

The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became that this was exactly what happened after her last breakup. He had moved on so quickly, and she couldn't help but wonder if he was doing it to spite her. But then she remembered how easily he settled back into his old routine, never really showing interest in getting to know her better. It didn’t seem like much effort to him, which meant she probably wasn’t worth it either. Maybe he’d been using her all along, playing the part of the “devoted husband” just to make things look good for his friends. And when she finally realized what was going on, she must have come across too clingy, making it easier for him to drop her altogether – like he always did. That’s why I’m starting to think this is exactly how it went down. They probably met at some bar, and he just wanted something casual before returning to his life. When she confronted him, he would have laughed it off, telling her she was overreacting. It would’ve been another easy win for him, allowing him to move on and leave her heartbroken once again. This isn’t about me; it’s about how people treat others. There are plenty of women who get treated like this all the time, and maybe I’m"

The officer's partner, still processing the victim's statement, hesitated before turning to her for guidance.\n\nThe woman's eyes locked onto hers, and for an instant, they were connected by a shared understanding of the chaos that lay ahead – the paperwork, the bureaucracy, the weight of another senseless crime.

His expression darkened as he took in the scene – a child, so reckless and uncontrolled, and yet this stranger seemed to be handling it like a pro.\n\nFor some reason, the sight of this man's effortless calmness sent a wave of resentment crashing through him.
