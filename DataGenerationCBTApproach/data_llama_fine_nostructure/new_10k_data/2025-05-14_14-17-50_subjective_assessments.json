The thought sent a familiar knot of worry twisting in her stomach, making her grip on her purse tighten.\n\nJust as she was starting to think about calling her friend to check in, the barista called out her order – a simple latte – and A took her place at the counter, trying to push aside her worries as she handed over her card.

Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate how I react to these situations.&#x200B; But then again, what if I am just too sensitive? What if people are genuinely ignoring me, and I’m just picking up on things that aren’t there?&#x200B; It's weird how easily one thought can spiral into a whole web of assumptions.

My mom says I need to focus on my career, but I feel like she doesn’t care about anything except herself. And my dad is just distant, never talking to me unless there’s something he wants. I tried to tell my wife how I felt during our last argument, but she dismissed it, saying I was overreacting. Does she even listen to me? Doesn’t she see how hard it gets?
