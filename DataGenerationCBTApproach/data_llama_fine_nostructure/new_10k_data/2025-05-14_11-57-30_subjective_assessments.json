It’s almost as if time hasn’t changed much for them; they seem just as comfortable around each other as they were all those years ago. Her mind keeps drifting back to how he used to be so attentive to her, how he would listen to everything she had to say, making her feel seen and heard in ways no one else ever has. But now, every glance from her feels forced, every conversation awkward, like a reminder of something she can never get back. It hurts to see him with someone else, especially after all the things she’s gone through alone. She tries to push these thoughts aside, but they linger, making her feel like she’s losing herself in the process. The pain of watching him move on is almost unbearable, and she can’t shake the feeling that she’ll never find her place again."

His thoughts swirled with possibilities – perhaps he could move back in with his parents until he got back on his feet. But then again, what if they turned him away, forcing him to rely even further on the meager government assistance he already received? The lab's dim lighting seemed to amplify every worry. He rubbed his tired eyes, wondering how someone like Dr. Thompson, who had built such a promising career within these walls, ended up struggling to make ends meet. As he gazed out into the night, he began to imagine scenarios where he might be forced to return home, living with his parents once more. At first, it didn't seem so bad – just taking care of his mother and father – but soon the thought grew heavier, like the weight of the bills piling higher by the day.

Despite acknowledging her emotions, she remains unsure whether he truly understands her struggles, perpetuating doubts about his empathy. Her focus on potential negative outcomes (\"What if...\") suggests an avoidance mechanism, where she is more concerned with protecting herself than engaging openly with her feelings and concerns. This subtle reflection of the distortion indicates an ongoing struggle with emotional regulation and intimacy, highlighting the need for self-awareness and open communication in relationships."
