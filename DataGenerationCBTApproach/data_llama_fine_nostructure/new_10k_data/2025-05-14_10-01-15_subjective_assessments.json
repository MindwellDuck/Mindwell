It was a milestone – twenty-five years together. She couldn't remember the last time they'd planned anything special. The kids were grown and moved out, their schedules too hectic for them to make it work.\n\nShe thought about all the little things he used to do for her, the small gestures that made her feel loved and appreciated. Like bringing home her favorite flowers on Fridays. Or surprising her with dinner reservations at that new restaurant she'd been wanting to try. Now, those kinds of surprises felt like a distant memory.\n\nA gentle knock at the door broke her reverie. It was the mailman, holding a package with no return address. Inside, a handwritten note read: \"Happy Anniversary, my love. Can't wait to celebrate tonight.\" But there was no card, no gift – just the words, scribbled in familiar handwriting.<|eot_id|>",

I wonder if he got it right away or had to go back inside to get another copy since it says \"Can't wait to celebrate tonight\" but it doesn't say when. Maybe he forgot to put the date? I'll have to ask him again when we talk later. That would explain why it wasn't signed with our names. He probably meant to sign it, but got distracted before putting it down. Anyway, I'm grateful for this surprise, even if it feels a bit late. It still shows how much he cares!"

It was an old picture of herself and her late husband, taken during their honeymoon. The faded colors seemed to intensify as her eyes met the smiling couple.\n\nA customer approached, asking about a sale, but her response was automatic, distracted by the memory. She didn't notice the woman standing behind her, waiting to be helped. The sound of the cashier ringing up the customer's purchase snapped her back to reality.\n\nAs she began to ring up the woman's items, she fumbled with the scanner, struggling to focus on the screen. Her mind kept wandering back to the photo, replaying moments they'd shared before he passed away. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, and she hastily looked away, trying to compose herself.<|eot_id|>",

Her mind kept drifting back to the conversation she'd had with her colleague earlier that day – about the new grant they were competing for. He'd mentioned that if they won, it would be a significant boost to their research, but also a major stress test for him.\n\nAs she dried her hands, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was somehow holding him back. That her recent work wasn't living up to his expectations. She thought about all the times he'd taken credit for her ideas, all the late nights she'd spent working while he slept.\n\nThe water in the sink turned cold as she stopped drying her hands, her gaze dropping to the small notebook on the counter. It was filled with notes and equations, but one entry caught her eye: 'Project Eagle', written in her husband's handwriting before he passed away. A project they'd started together, but never finished.\n\nA faint smell of old books wafted through the air as she felt a familiar ache in her chest. She tried to push the thoughts away, but they lingered, refusing to be washed down the drain like the dirty dishes.<|eot_id|>",

As she sat there, trying to decide whether to go back inside, she couldn't help but wonder what her sister was doing right now. Probably laughing with friends, enjoying life. Why did she have to spend her days alone? Her sister had always been the more outgoing one, and this latest move to the city meant she wouldn't be able to hang out as much anymore. They used to talk every night, sharing stories and secrets, but now...now it just felt like a chore. Like she was bothering someone else instead of being part of something special. It didn't take long to realize that the \"chore\" was really just her own guilt. Guilt over leaving everything behind - the comfort, the familiarity, the security. Maybe she could've stayed in the suburbs, built a better life there, but then she wouldn't have met him. And yet... There was no use in dwelling on the past. Instead, she needed to focus on the present. On the job interview tomorrow, and how she could nail it. But the questions swirled in her head like a tornado, making it hard to think straight. What if she messed up? What if she came across too perfect, too polished? Then what? Would she get hired? Or would she end up back where she started, stuck"

He had helped with the dishes before going out with friends, but now they seemed to be accumulating faster than he could keep up with.\n\nHis wife finally looked up, breaking the spell, and smiled weakly at him. 'I'm just tired, dear,' she said, her voice barely above a whisper. 'I need to take care of myself today.' Without another word, she turned back to the TV, leaving him feeling like he was walking on eggshells, unsure of how to bridge the gap between them.<|eot_id|>",

He didn’t know what he was apologizing for – the mess, the lack of connection, or maybe even the fact that he needed to leave the house and give her space? She hadn't said anything, but her expression spoke volumes. There were so many things he wanted to tell her, so many questions swirling inside him, yet none of them seemed relevant in this moment. He felt lost, unable to grasp the thread that would lead him back to her, back to their life together. As he stood there, frozen, the silence grew thicker. It was as if time itself had slowed down, making each second feel like an eternity. In that pause, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he wasn't looking at the situation correctly. Maybe he was letting his feelings dictate what he thought he saw, rather than trying to see things more clearly. But then again, who needs clarity when you have memories? When you can relive those moments, when you can hold onto the past? That’s where real love lies—"

Maybe she was silently judging me, wondering why I wasn't taking things seriously enough. I felt like I could read her, like I knew exactly what she was thinking. It was almost as if I could hear her whispering doubts in my ear - \"You're not doing your job right.\" But then again, maybe I was overthinking things. Maybe she was just being understanding because she knows how stressful this time is for us. Maybe she didn’t think anything at all. I pushed aside the doubt, telling myself I needed to focus on getting my act together before we left for the station tomorrow.

He wanted to know how I felt about being passed over for the leadership role, how I coped with the constant criticism, and what drove me to continue fighting despite everything against me. But he wouldn't hear it. He wouldn't see it. All he would hear was the echo of my frustration, the desperation that threatened to consume me every time we met.

Behind closed doors, I knew the truth: he didn't care about me or my struggles. He cared only about the power struggle unfolding within these hospital walls, where alliances were forged and broken with ruthless efficiency. This was a game he played with ease, always staying one step ahead of the competition, never once stopping to consider the human cost of his actions.
