We'd been arguing all day about something stupid - who left the dishes in the sink again.\n\nBut it wasn't just that. It was everything. School had been killing me lately, and I'd come home feeling like I was drowning in paperwork and parent-teacher conferences. My wife seemed distant, too, like she was always trying to please everyone else but me.\n\nAs I glared at her, she looked up, concern etched on her face. 'Hey, what's wrong?' she asked, setting down the knife.\n\n'Nothing,' I growled, turning away from her. But I could feel my eyes stinging, and I knew I was lying.\n\nShe came over beside me, wrapping her arm around my waist. 'Come on, let's talk about it.'\n\nBut I shook her off. 'Just leave me alone, okay? I need some space.'\n\nAnd with that, I stormed out of the kitchen, leaving her standing there looking lost and worried. I slammed the door behind me, feeling a rush of adrenaline course through my veins.\n\nFor a moment, I just leaned against the wall, letting the silence wash over me. It was a familiar feeling, one I'd grown accustomed to over the past few months. But tonight, it felt different. Tonight, it felt like I was suffocating under its weight.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling. I was fine. I was just stressed. Yeah, that's it.\n\nBut as I turned to head upstairs, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And for a second, our eyes met - hers, from downstairs, and mine, from here.\n\nIn that moment, I saw the emptiness staring back at me, and it made my heart ache.<|eot_id|>",

That means she must have wanted attention and stability, which is why she chose someone else over a stable relationship with Dr. Thompson. It’s pretty clear that she thinks she deserves better, but she doesn’t realize that Dr. Thompson isn’t going to change for anyone.
