A customer, middle-aged and well-dressed, approached her, examining a display of kitchen appliances. As she began to ask questions about the products, the woman noticed the faint scent of perfume on her wrist – a fragrance she hadn't worn since her divorce five years ago.\n\nThe customer asked if they carried any models like hers, and the woman hesitated before responding, her voice laced with a mixture of defensiveness and sadness. The customer, seemingly unaware of the subtle cues, continued to press for details, and the woman's eyes welled up with unshed tears as she realized she'd been alone for nearly half her life.<|eot_id|>",

Her eyes darted up to his, a fleeting expression of annoyance crossing her face before she quickly looked away.\n\nAs he rang up her groceries, he noticed she was buying a large bottle of wine, accompanied by a box of chocolates. The total came out to be more than twice what she had initially stated, but when he politely brought it to her attention, she became belligerent, claiming the cashier must have made a mistake.\n\nThe woman's voice rose, and she began to lecture him on how incompetent he was, despite the fact that he had double-checked the calculation. As he remained calm and apologetic, trying to resolve the issue amicably, she continued to berate him, her tone dripping with disdain.\n\nJust then, a customer approached them, asking if they needed assistance.

She seemed frustrated that you would make such a big deal about something so simple. It’s like she just wanted to get home and relax, and the fact that she ended up paying almost double what she thought was meant to be is infuriating. I think there might be some anxiety behind this behavior— maybe she feels overwhelmed or stressed lately? Sometimes people lash out when they’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Maybe she’s having a tough day and isn’t handling it well? Or perhaps she simply doesn’t want to pay more than necessary, and the way she acted suggests she felt cornered into doing so. Whatever the reason, it’s clear that she’s upset about the price, and she didn’t handle it very well."

The article mentioned a colleague who had made the discovery, but she couldn't help but think it was more than coincidence - he was the one who had stolen her husband away from her all those years ago. \n\nHer eyes narrowed as she gazed at the photo, the corners of her mouth twisting into a snarl. She recalled the countless times her late husband had spoken fondly of their former colleague, never once mentioning the pain he had caused her.

Or perhaps, she thought bitterly, he would have simply abandoned her when she got pregnant, leaving her to face parenthood alone. The possibilities swirled in her head like a maelstrom, each one a reminder of how much she had lost.

My boyfriend had just broken up with me because I couldn’t handle the pressure of being in a relationship. He said it was too early for us, that we were moving too fast. He didn’t want to ruin our friendship, so he ended things with me while still being friends. I thought we could still hang out, but he refused. We hadn’t spoken since then, and now he’s dating this other girl who looks exactly like me. It hurts to see him move on so quickly. I know I shouldn’t be upset, but I can’t help how I feel. Every time I hear he’s going on dates with her, it feels like I’m losing myself. I’ve tried talking to him, but he doesn’t seem interested. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. How can one person cause so much pain? Every time I think about him, I start crying again. I don’t know how to stop feeling this way. I wish I could turn back time and change what happened.
