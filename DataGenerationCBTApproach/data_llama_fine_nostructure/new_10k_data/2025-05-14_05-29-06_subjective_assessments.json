It had been six months since the call went out, but some days still felt like yesterday. As she made her way to her desk, she noticed a stack of files with a name she hadn't seen in years - Jenkins. The same department he worked in. Her hand instinctively reached for the pen on her desk, and she began to tidy up the papers, her mind replaying the words from the captain's briefing that morning.\n\n\"Killed in the line of duty,\" the captain had said, his voice firm but laced with a hint of sadness. She remembered how it sounded then, but now it echoed in her ears like a mantra. As she smoothed out a wrinkle on the file, her fingers brushed against a faded photograph of herself and him, taken during their last leave together. For a moment, she forgot where she was, lost in the memories they'd shared. The silence around her grew thicker, heavy with unspoken thoughts, until she looked up to see her partner watching her, concern etched on his face.<|eot_id|>",

Did she think I was the one who messed up? Or maybe she saw something else entirely? My mind raced as I tried to read between the lines, but all I could grasp was the uncertainty in her eyes. Without thinking, I reached out to touch her arm, hoping to clarify what was going through her mind. But before I could say anything, she turned and walked away, leaving me wondering if I'd overstepped."

As she picked up a new smartwatch, he noticed her eyes lingering on the price tag – $500 more than the model they had in stock. \n\nThe woman, seemingly oblivious to the discrepancy, continued to examine other items before finally making her way to the checkout. When it was her turn, she casually mentioned, \"I'm looking at upgrading my phone.\" The cashier, a younger employee, enthusiastically recommended the exact same model the woman had been eyeing earlier.\n\nAs the woman waited for her change, she glanced over at him and smiled blandly. He felt a surge of annoyance, wondering if she knew about the discontinued model and was deliberately trying to get the newer one. The cashier handed her the receipt, and as she took it, their fingers touched briefly. The woman didn't seem to notice, but he could have sworn he heard a faint, condescending tone in her voice when she said, \"Thanks, dear.\"<|eot_id|>",

We need you ASAP!\"\n\nWithout hesitation, she rushed out the door, leaving him alone once again. He slowly rose from the chair, feeling the familiar knot of helplessness tighten in his chest.

Maybe it's because I'm not important enough for her to worry about. Maybe she thinks I don’t matter. She doesn’t know anything about my situation. It can't be personal; I’m not some high-priority case that requires immediate attention. If this happens again, maybe I'll get better care. Maybe then no one will ignore me. I guess that’s why they call it a ‘Code Blue’. They’re trying to tell me something. Maybe it means I’m not worth saving. Maybe I deserve to die. This isn’t fair. Why does it always happen to me? I try so hard, but nothing ever goes right. I feel like I’ve failed everyone around me, including myself. I wish I could go back in time and change everything. But I know I won’t succeed. That’s why I keep avoiding tasks. It’s easier to pretend I don’t exist than face another disappointment. What if I’m too much trouble for them to handle? Maybe they’re tired of dealing with me.
