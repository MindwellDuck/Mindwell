Why did he always seem so carefree? Why couldn’t I be happy too? The questions swirled in her mind, but she knew the answers. They weren’t simple. Life was complicated, and every decision made by both of them contributed to their situation. But still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling of guilt. Was it really her fault? Did she have any control over this mess? She sighed, letting out a deep breath. Maybe she needed to focus on what she could change. Instead of dwelling on the past, maybe she could find ways to improve their future. But as she looked back at the bills, a wave of sadness washed over her. How would they ever escape this cycle of debt? How could someone who didn’t carry the weight of these responsibilities feel so at peace? Didn’t he know how much stress it caused her? Didn’t he understand how hard it was to keep everything together? But he just kept smiling, oblivious to all the pressure she faced every day. Every time she thought about leaving, he’d come after her, telling her she was being selfish and that she needed"
