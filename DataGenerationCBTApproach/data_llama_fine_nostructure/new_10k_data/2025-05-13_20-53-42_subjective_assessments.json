The mother had been calling her all morning, frantic about getting the kids off to school on time. The father, usually so calm and collected, was frazzled and apologetic.\n\nAs she stepped inside, she noticed the messy room, the dirty laundry piled high, and the unwashed dishes stacked in the sink. She felt a pang of guilt, remembering the countless times she'd tried to help the family with meals or errands when they were overwhelmed. But every time, they'd politely declined, saying they needed some space.\n\nThe nurse took a deep breath, trying to focus on the task at hand – writing up the patient's discharge notes. But her mind kept wandering back to the mother's worried voice on the phone, and the father's tired eyes, which seemed to hold a silent plea for help. As she began to write, her hand trembled ever so slightly, betraying her attempt to maintain a professional composure.<|eot_id|>",

The touch of their hands lingered, and for a moment, she felt a pang of discomfort. \n\nAs she delivered Alex's food, their conversation flowed effortlessly, discussing everything from sports to music.
