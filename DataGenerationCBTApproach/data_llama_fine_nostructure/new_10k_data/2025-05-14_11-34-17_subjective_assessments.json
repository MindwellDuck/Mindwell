I know I'm still learning, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of creating something meaningful. This isn't some amateurish piece meant for children's birthday parties. My art speaks to the heart of our community, and yet...and yet, everyone seems to be against me. Even my wife, she didn't say anything. She looks disappointed, almost ashamed. I feel like I let her down. Shouldn't she be proud of what we accomplished together? Maybe I shouldn’t have shared it with anyone, especially not with someone like the mayor. They’re used to getting what they want, and I’m just an outsider who dared to challenge them. No wonder they wouldn’t understand. And those people gathered around us, whispering among themselves—I can hear them even from here. Their voices carry on the wind like daggers, cutting through my confidence.

Her eyes glazed over, and her voice became a monotone recitation of procedure, leaving him feeling like he was talking to himself all over again.\n\nJust then, the hospital's PA system crackled to life, announcing the arrival of yet another family member seeking updates on their loved one's condition. A young woman, likely in her early twenties, approached him with a mixture of concern and entitlement etched on her face. She demanded to know why her relative hadn't received the latest test results yet, despite being told they were available just hours prior.\n\nThe nurse beside him rolled her eyes discreetly before turning back to her task, but the woman's question cut through the air like a slap in the face.

Just then, the PA system interrupted the chaos, calling out a name from the list of families waiting to see their relatives. As the woman approached, he could sense her anxiety growing, and he felt a pang of guilt. Wasn’t it his job to make sure she got the latest updates? Why did these people always seem to find ways to make him look bad? The woman’s question about the delayed test results hit him like a punch to the gut. Didn’t they already tell her that the tests were ready? Did she really think he was playing some kind of cruel joke on her? And what was with the entitled tone?

It felt like they didn't trust her, like every conversation was a battle to prove herself. Even when she received positive feedback from colleagues, it only served to fuel the fire. They'd say something nice, but then remind her that everyone had their doubts, that she wasn't perfect, that no one could do everything perfectly. It made me feel like I was losing myself in the process. Like I was just a cog in a machine, a replaceable part. When I tried to set boundaries, to prioritize my own needs, people would assume I was being selfish. That I didn’t care about their children. But they’d never ask how I was really doing, what I needed from them. Instead, they kept piling on, expecting me to juggle too many things at once.

Her heart sank; she'd seen it happen before. The same pattern always played out – someone would lash out in anger, and the other would try to stop them. It never ended well. This time, though, it seemed different. The woman sounded panicked, and the man's voice was raised, threatening to hurt her if anyone tried to intervene. As she pulled over to the side of the road, she spotted the couple standing outside their apartment building. They were arguing again, their voices louder than usual. She hesitated for a moment before getting out of the car, her hand instinctively reaching for her pepper spray. But something felt off. The woman didn't seem scared – she looked almost defiant. And the man...he wasn't yelling anymore. He just stood there, his eyes fixed on hers, his expression unreadable. She watched as he slowly backed away, disappearing into the darkness. She waited until the coast was clear, then stepped inside the apartment. What she found shocked her – no signs of violence, just two people sitting on the couch, holding hands.
