We've seen it before, even though our protocols are supposed to prevent it.\" \"Protocols?\" My voice rose. \"You mean the ones that require approval from doctors?\" \"Yeah, those,\" she replied. \"But sometimes, we get overwhelmed, and procedures slip through the cracks.\" \"Overwhelmed? You're telling me that patients have been taking medications without proper authorization because you guys are too busy?\" \"Well, yes...\" My anger boiled over. \"This isn't about being busy; it's about negligence!

She had this annoyed expression on her face, almost as if I was bothering her for no reason. I could tell she thought I was being petty, but honestly, I just wanted my change back. When the cashier apologized, I couldn't help but think it was all an act. They probably did it on purpose to make me angry. It's ridiculous how upset I am. One minute I'm just paying for my stuff, and the next, I'm feeling like I've been disrespected. This whole thing feels like something out of a movie, where the hero is always right and everyone else is just trying to mess with them.

It was all so clear now - everything he'd done, every choice he'd made, it was all leading up to this moment. And what did it mean? It meant that he was nothing more than a pawn in someone else's game. That he didn't really matter at all. He was just another faceless drone in a world full of people who cared less for him than they did for themselves. Everything he'd worked for, everything he'd sacrificed - it all meant nothing. There were no exceptions, no gray areas. You either supported the system, or you were against it. You either cared, or you didn't. And if you didn't care, then why bother trying? He rubbed his eyes, but the blur remained. Even after rubbing, there was still nothing but blackness where his thoughts used to be. He tried again, and the same result.

Those simple pleasures now felt like distant memories, leaving only sadness in their wake. Every glance at the happy family made him wonder if he was meant to experience joy like theirs. It wasn’t just the sight of them that bothered him; even the smell of fresh bread wafting from the bakery across the street brought back painful memories.
