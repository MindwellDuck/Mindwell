Her eyes scanned the room, lingering on the familiar smile of Emma, who had been struggling to keep up with the coursework all semester.\n\nAs she reached for the last sheet of paper, her fingers brushed against the edge of Emma's folder. A faint smudge of blue ink caught her attention - the same shade as the pen she'd used to grade Emma's previous assignment, the one she'd given a low mark on despite feeling it was unfair.\n\nA pang of doubt crept into her mind, and she wondered if she'd been too harsh. Had she been too quick to dismiss Emma's efforts? The thought sparked a memory of their conversation after class last week, where Emma had seemed genuinely upset by the grade. \n\nThe teacher's hands felt heavy as she slid the rubric across the desk, the sound echoing through the room.

If she gave Emma more credit, she'd be going against everything she believed in. But if she didn't give her anything else, she'd be condemning her to fail, which wouldn't be fair either.

She thought back to all the times she'd spent investigating real cases of corruption, pouring over documents and conducting interviews. The memory of those hours, those late nights, flashed before her mind's eye.\n\nThe editor continued, oblivious to her growing unease, \"And make sure it's written in a way that's engaging for our readers, something they'll actually want to read.\" His tone was patronizing, implying she wasn't capable of doing more than regurgitating shallow gossip.\n\nShe forced a polite smile onto her face, but inside, her contempt simmered.

He knew exactly how much work went into exposing corporate malfeasance, and yet he expected her to reduce it all to bland, superficial content. It felt like a slap in the face—like he was daring her to show what she really saw when she wrote. This wasn’t just about writing fluff pieces; it was about making a point. The fact that he didn’t care about the truth, that he’d settle for anything short of a full exposé, made her feel even more enraged. Why would anyone else care about the real stories behind these accusations? They were real people, struggling against corrupt systems, and he wanted her to cover them up instead? He had no right to treat her like this. After everything she’d gone through, after the countless hours she’d spent researching and interviewing, he acted as if she was still a new, green journalist, barely qualified to handle a simple article. It was infuriating and demeaning—a clear sign that he didn’t respect her abilities or take her seriously. To top it off, the timing couldn’t have been worse. With her current project stalled, this request was supposed to help her get back on track. Instead, it felt like another challenge designed to crush her spirit. What was he trying to prove?
