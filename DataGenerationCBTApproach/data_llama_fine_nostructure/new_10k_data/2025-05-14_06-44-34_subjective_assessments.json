He ignores it, hoping it'll go away. But the notifications keep coming – texts from friends, social media alerts, the weather forecast. Each one jolts him back to reality, reminding him that there's a world outside these walls.\n\nThe timer beeps, signaling the food is done. He takes a step back, surveying the kitchen with a sense of disarray. The dishes pile up in the sink, the counters cluttered with recipe notes and scraps of paper. For a moment, he feels like he's drowning in chaos.\n\nHe lets out a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed. But as he reaches for a utensil, his hand closes around something unexpected – a small note, tucked between the pots and pans. It's from his late wife, a reminder she'd left him before they even had their first anniversary. Tears prick at the corners of his eyes as he stares at the scribbled message, feeling the weight of helplessness settle in once more.<|eot_id|>",

He tries to push them aside, telling himself it doesn't matter anymore. But he can't shake the feeling that there’s always another what-if. That maybe things could have been different if he’d acted differently, if he’d seen signs sooner. As he wipes down the stove, he catches glimpses of the past – memories of meals shared, laughter, and tears. They linger, refusing to let go. What if he could turn back time? What if he could make her stay? The clock ticks on, each passing minute a reminder of what he’s lost. The kitchen may be empty now, but his mind is filled with endless possibilities, all centered around what-ifs."
