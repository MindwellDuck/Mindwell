When faced with criticism or disappointment, they often shift the blame away from themselves and toward others, whether it’s a family member, friend, partner, or even society. By deflecting accountability, they avoid confronting uncomfortable truths about their actions, emotions, or decisions. ## Example Response The initial response may appear empathetic at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it reveals a subtle form of blaming.
