A delivery from the art supply store? Probably. But the thought of stepping away from his work, even briefly, sent a flutter in his chest.\n\nThe knocking grew more insistent. He took a deep breath, his anxiety spiking, and made his way to the entrance. The peephole revealed a woman holding a package – the same company that delivered his art supplies. She didn't recognize him. For a moment, they simply stared at each other.\n\nShe handed him the package, her hand brushing against his. A spark of electricity ran through his body, but he quickly pushed the feeling aside. He signed for the package, taking the paper from her without making eye contact.\n\nAs she turned to leave, their paths crossed again. This time, their shoulders brushed.

After all, what did this woman know about creating masterpieces? But as he returned to his canvas, he couldn't shake the image of her standing there, looking confident. Her smile seemed genuine, and the way she held herself suggested someone who wasn't afraid to take risks. Why couldn't he feel that way too? Every brushstroke felt forced, every color choice uncertain. He sighed, feeling like he was falling further behind. The delivery had been simple—a package of paints and brushes—but now it seemed like a reminder of everything he lacked. Even the smallest details made him wonder how he could ever compete. He began to doubt himself, thinking that maybe he wasn’t cut out for this creative life. Maybe he was just pretending to be something he wasn’t, just like the strangers who walked by his studio window, going about their day while he struggled to keep up. It wasn't fair to compare himself to them, but he couldn't help it. They were living their best lives, while he was stuck in his own little world.

It started when I received an email from the local newspaper, informing me that they would be covering my campaign for transparency in government. I had reached out to them months ago, hoping they might pick up the story, but instead, they chose to focus on the opposing candidate. It wasn’t fair; I felt like they were cherry-picking information to make me look bad. Even though I knew it was unfair to judge based solely on media coverage, the fact remained that the opposing candidate didn’t even bother responding to my calls for transparency. Things escalated further when I realized that the same candidate had connections to the developer behind the project I was fighting. It turned out that both candidates had ties to the same group, which was pushing hard for the zoning approval despite public outcry. I felt betrayed, especially after learning that one of the other candidates had accepted funds from this group. It made me question whether anyone was truly working in my best interest.

That seemed unreasonable, considering how much work she had taken off her own schedule lately. When his business partner called, it was like a punch in the gut.
