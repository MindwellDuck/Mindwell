Our coffee maker was still plugged in, but it was dead – we'd forgotten to replace the fuse again.\n\nShe didn't look up as I approached, so I cleared my throat to get her attention. Still nothing. I sat down across from her, trying to think of something to say. We'd been married for 45 years, and I thought I knew her better than anyone.\n\nBut today, she just seemed...lost. I reached out and put a hand on her arm, feeling a jolt of electricity run through me. It was like touching a stranger. She flinched under my touch, and I immediately regretted it.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice light. But she just shook her head, her eyes welling up with tears. I felt a pang in my chest, and suddenly I was transported back to our first date – her smile, her laugh, the way she made me feel like I was home.\n\nWe'd had good times, too – great times. Like when our kids were born, and we'd sit up all night holding them, taking turns changing diapers. Or when they went off to college, and we'd cry together, feeling proud and scared.\n\nBut now...now it felt like everything was slipping away from us. The kids were grown, moved out, started families of their own. And my partner...my beautiful partner...was just sitting there, staring at the wall.\n\nI leaned forward, my heart racing. \"What's going on?\" I whispered, my voice cracking. \"Is it me? Am I losing you?\"\n\nHer gaze finally met mine, and I saw the sadness in her eyes. It was like looking into a mirror, reflected back at me. For a moment, we just stared at each other, two old people, clinging to what's left of their love.\n\nAnd then, without a word, she stood up, grabbed a box of tissues from the counter, and walked away. Left me sitting there, alone with my thoughts.<|eot_id|>",

After all, you never seem happy with anything I do, even though I’ve been working hard to try and please you. You’re not really listening to me, are you? I said I needed some time to figure things out, but you just kept pushing and pushing until I snapped. Now you’re acting like you don’t care. You never listen to what I have to say anyway, so why bother? This isn’t your fault. You always assume the worst. If I could talk to you about how much I hate all the little things you complain about, maybe we wouldn’t be here right now. You always find fault in everything I do, no matter how hard I try. You never appreciate anything I do for you either. And now, because of one stupid mistake, you’re acting like I’m the problem? That doesn’t make sense. You never give me credit for anything I do.

The faint scent of antiseptic and decay wafted through the air, transporting him back to his wife's bedside all those years ago.\n\nHe had thought he was prepared for this moment, having lost her to cancer when their son was just a toddler. But nothing could have truly readied him for the weight of it now – seven years later, watching another patient slip away from him.\n\nAs he began the routine checks, his mind wandered to the countless memories he'd shared with his wife. The way she'd smile at him as they walked hand-in-hand along the beach, the sound of her laughter still echoing in his ears. He felt a lump form in his throat as he remembered the day their son had first taken his hand, promising to always protect him.\n\nThe old man's eyes fluttered open, locking onto Dr. Thompson's with a desperate plea. For a fleeting instant, he saw his own reflection staring back – worn, weary, and defeated. The doctor's gaze faltered, and he felt the familiar ache within his chest resurface.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, he took the old man's frail hand in his, his fingers intertwining with the fragile one. \"I'm so sorry,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible over the steady beep of the machines. \"I wish I could take your pain away.\"\n\nTears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he gazed down at the old man, feeling the crushing burden of his own helplessness. In that moment, the hospital room seemed to shrink, and he was alone with his grief once more. The weight of his loss bore down upon him, threatening to consume him whole.\n\nThe old man's grip tightened, his eyes pleading for something more, but Dr. Thompson knew there was none to give. All he could do was stand there, frozen in time, as the silence between them grew thicker than the fog outside.<|eot_id|>",

She would often say how much she loved the quiet afternoons by the sea, where they'd watch the waves roll in together. Those moments were filled with a sense of peace, and Dr. Thompson couldn't help but feel grateful for the memory. In fact, he recalled an entire summer where they'd spend their evenings sitting by the water, listening to the sounds of the ocean. They'd share stories, laugh, and simply enjoy each other’s company, surrounded by the soothing rhythm of the tide. He remembered the times she'd point out tiny shells, or the way she'd pull off her shoes and let the sand cool between her toes. Her joy in these simple things had been infectious, and Dr. Thompson found himself smiling as he remembered their carefree nights under the stars. He even recalled the time she surprised him by learning how to surf, riding the waves with such ease that she laughed louder than the wind. It wasn't just those moments that made him nostalgic; it was the entire time they spent together. From lazy mornings reading books side-by-side to the countless adventures they embarked upon – every experience was precious, and he cherished each one.

I want to scream at him, tell him how much of a jerk he is, but I don't. Not yet, anyway.\n\nI take a deep breath and try to calm down, but my mind keeps racing back to it.

Something to get this rage off me.\n\nBut then I think about Sarah, and how she'd react if she saw me in that state.
