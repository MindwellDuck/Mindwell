He cleared his throat, announcing his presence, but she still didn't flinch. It wasn't until he stood right behind her that she became aware of his presence.\n\nFor a moment, they simply stared at each other, the only sound the murmur of the crowd.

I can't believe she's doing this right in front of my wife. This is so humiliating, and I feel so embarrassed. Why did she have to be there? My wife is probably thinking about us, wondering if we're okay, and now I'm dealing with this weird situation. I wish I could forget this ever happened, but I know I'll be thinking about it for days. The worst part is that I feel like I've lost control over myself. I don't know how to react anymore. Maybe I'll just ignore her and hope she goes away soon.

But what if the owner decided to sell the business after all? What if he chose to invest his money elsewhere?

Her mind began to wander, imagining the worst-case scenario: \"What if I don't get paid this week?\" Or, \"What if my car breaks down on the way home?\" As she worked, her hands moved with precision, carefully arranging the loaves by size and type.
