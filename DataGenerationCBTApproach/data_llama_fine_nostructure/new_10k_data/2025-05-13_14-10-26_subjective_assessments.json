The uniform's neat crease now stained with grease and trash, he couldn't shake the memory of his late wife's wedding day. A faint scent of roses lingered, transporting him back to the joyous chaos of their own wedding. His gaze drifted away from the mess, but the image clung to his mind like a bad habit. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the familiar pang of disgust, but it only intensified as he thought about the countless times he'd had to deal with the aftermath of other people's broken engagements and failed relationships.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe people are just too distracted by their own selfish desires to care about anything else anymore.

She’d posted pictures with her new boyfriend just days after their divorce, flaunting her newfound happiness as if she had nothing to hide. Meanwhile, every post I made felt like an attempt to keep up, a desperate cry for validation in a world that didn’t care about me anymore. Her Instagram stories were full of laughter, vacations, and moments she shared with someone else—someone who clearly loved her more than I ever did. Every time I looked at her feed, I felt like I was gazing into the face of my own failure. It was like she was living two separate lives: one of her, surrounded by joy and love, while the other was me, alone and forgotten. Every time I scrolled through her stories, I couldn’t help but think about what I could’ve done differently. Maybe if I hadn’t been so insecure, maybe if I’d given her enough time, maybe if... But those thoughts led nowhere. All I saw was the contrast between our lives—the vibrant colors of her adventures against the dull grey of my empty apartment.

The air seemed heavy with unspoken thoughts, each face a map of possibilities, some bright, others shrouded in doubt. Her gaze drifted back inside, where a single candle flickered softly on the bar. Its flame danced, casting shadows that seemed to shift and writhe like living things. The light itself appeared fragile, as if it might be extinguished at any moment, plunging the room into darkness. But she knew better than to take sides. This was a place where people came to let go, to surrender to whatever fate brought them. And yet, even as they surrendered, there was a sense of resistance, of pushing back against the currents that pulled them under. It was almost as if they were trying to convince themselves that everything would be alright, no matter how uncertain the path ahead.

In this case, they tend to focus on negative outcomes (\"this is going to be the last straw\"). ## Step 3: Understand the Bias Understanding the bias involves recognizing that the individual tends to see challenges as threats rather than opportunities for growth.
