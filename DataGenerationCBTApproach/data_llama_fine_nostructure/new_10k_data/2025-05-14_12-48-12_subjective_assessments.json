His partner, sitting on the couch, looked up from their phone, asking if they'd had a good day. He shrugged, not really feeling like talking about it.\n\nAs he began to make himself a drink, he noticed the TV was still on from last night, showing the highlight reel of his friend's bachelor party from three years ago. The same friends were laughing and cheering, having an incredible time – a stark contrast to the mundane routine of his own life right now.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the photos for a moment before moving on to the messy kitchen, where he started making himself a sandwich. He couldn't help but think that his own life wasn't as exciting as this one, that he was stuck in a rut while his friends seemed to be living it up. The bitterness crept in, and he found himself muttering under his breath as he spread mayonnaise on his sandwich.<|eot_id|>",

He wondered why his life couldn’t be more exciting like his friend’s, wondering if there was anything he could do to change it. He felt so alone in his life, like no matter what he did, it would never measure up to the fun his friends were having."

A faint scent of fresh laundry wafted up, transporting her back to happier times spent helping her mom with household chores.
