As he began to prep the ingredients for his famous bouillabaisse, he noticed his wife, Sarah, standing by the counter, making herself a cup of coffee.\n\nAs she took her first sip, she mentioned that she was thinking about starting a cooking blog, and how it would be great if their son could help out more often. He felt a surge of frustration at the thought of his child being 'helpful' when he had put in countless hours to create the recipes and techniques that made their restaurant successful.\n\nSarah continued to chat away, seemingly oblivious to his growing irritation.

A lifetime of shared secrets and unaddressed conflicts swirled through her mind, each one a tiny rock weighing down her conscience.\n\nAs the machines surrounding her husband beeped softly in the background, she felt the sting of regret for every moment they'd let slip by without truly connecting, every argument left unresolved, every promise unkept.

Maybe this is why he refused to talk about the divorce, why he kept pushing me away whenever I tried to bring it up. It wasn't just about him wanting space; it was about something deeper. Something he wasn't ready to face yet. And now, here we are – standing side by side, holding hands, pretending everything is okay when I can barely hold my own emotions together. This isn't how it's supposed to end – not after all the arguments, the fights, the tears, the promises made and broken. Perhaps if only I had pushed harder, demanded more honesty, things wouldn't be like this. But then again, maybe he really did love me. Maybe he wasn't trying to hurt me; maybe he just needed time to process everything – the cancer, the pain, the guilt. This isn't fair. We were meant to grow old together, to share our stories, to laugh and cry. Now, in these final moments, I feel lost, unsure of what to say or do.

The barista, noticing his interest, offered him a warm smile and said, \"On the house, today's special.\"\n\nBut as he watched her expertly arrange the pastries, he couldn't help but think about how his wife had always loved those same croissants.

That's why he kept replaying the memory of her graduation, reliving every moment, every word, every smile.
