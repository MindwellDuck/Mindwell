The photos showed her laughing and smiling alongside a young, successful businessman – someone who had been quietly courting her behind his back.\n\nAs he scrolled through the comments section, he saw how everyone was fawning over her beauty and elegance. How they were all oblivious to the fact that she had left him for this smooth-talking opportunist. He felt his anger simmering, growing with each passing moment, until it finally boiled over into a furious typing session. His fingers flew across the keyboard, deleting sentence after sentence of perfectly crafted articles, until the screen was filled with gibberish. The cursor blinked mockingly at him, as if daring him to try and contain his rage any longer.<|eot_id|>",

Hadn't he given everything to make their marriage work? Didn't I love her more than anyone else? She was just going to throw it all away for some shallow fling? Every time he thought about it, he felt like screaming in frustration. The world seemed to be against him, and no matter how hard he tried, things always went wrong. It was so unfair - why did she have to leave him when he was the one trying to hold everything together? And now, here she was, dancing with another man in front of an audience full of strangers. It made sense that she would want to move on, but didn't she remember all the sacrifices we'd made for our family? The late nights, the endless stress, the constant juggling of work and life? Hadn't I done enough for her? Why was she just going to walk out and start something new? Her new boyfriend seemed perfect - handsome, successful, and charming. But what really hurt was seeing those happy pictures of them together. They looked so content, so happy. Meanwhile, I'm still struggling to find meaning in anything. This is all so unjust. She doesn't deserve someone like me, and yet... I feel like I've lost every shred of dignity. Even my friends seem distant, as if they can see right through me. Maybe I am too much"

It was a picture he hadn't looked at in years, but the memories still felt fresh. He had always been so proud of being able to provide for them, to give them the best life possible.\n\nAs he sipped his coffee, he noticed the stack of unpaid bills on the counter. His mind began to wander back to when they were together, how they had managed to balance work and family life. They had always talked about saving for their children's education, but now it seemed like that dream was slipping away.\n\nThe silence from his empty apartment was deafening, and for a moment, he forgot he wasn't alone. The weight of his past mistakes settled heavy on his chest, making it hard to breathe. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had failed as a provider, as a husband, as a father. The guilt crept in, like a slow-moving fog, seeping into every corner of his soul.<|eot_id|>",

Every sound around him grew louder, like a cacophony of chaos, until all he could hear was his own racing thoughts. \"What if she never comes back?\" he wondered, the thought echoing through his mind like a haunting mantra. \"Can I really move on?\" The room seemed to blur around him, colors bleeding together in a swirling vortex. Time lost its meaning; hours blended into days, and each passing moment felt like an eternity. A single tear rolled down his cheek, falling onto his hand, and then another, and another. His heart pounded in his chest, like a drumbeat in his ears, drowning out everything else. It was as if time itself had slowed, trapping him in this endless loop of pain and uncertainty. In that moment, nothing else existed except for the ache within him—a deep longing for what could have been, for what he once had, and what he would never get again. And yet, amidst all this turmoil, there was a glimmer of hope—a tiny spark that refused to be extinguished. That spark told him that no matter how dark things seemed right now, there was always a chance for redemption, for healing, and maybe even a future worth fighting for. It reminded him that he was more than just this one moment of sorrow, that he had lived before, loved before, and would live again."

But now that I think back, there have been instances where she's made me feel belittled, like when I mentioned I was working late and she said I should \"get used to it\" because I'm always home. It's frustrating because I try to make time for her, but sometimes it feels like she’s more focused on herself than us. We were supposed to go out tonight, but now I don’t know if I want to.
