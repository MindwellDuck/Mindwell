He started mentally rehearsing the procedures they followed, checking off each step, thinking about what could have gone wrong.

It sounded like someone was walking by their apartment door, but it was already past 8 am, and no one usually walked by then.

He remembered those days vividly - the late nights, the pressure to meet deadlines, and the sense of being watched all the time. He hadn't thought much of it at the time, but now it felt like a warning sign. Next came another comment, this one from a mutual acquaintance, saying they'd heard rumors about the company’s practices. Something about pushing employees too hard until they burned out? He recalled similar stories from other startups he’d worked for, and wondered if there was more truth to these whispers. The post itself didn’t seem malicious, just...cautious. But why did it bother him so much? Was it really worth getting worked up over? He tried to push the thoughts aside, focusing on the positive aspects of the post. After all, everyone has bad experiences in their careers. Yet, he couldn’t help but feel like this was more than just coincidence.
