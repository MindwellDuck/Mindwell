Now, faced with this blank slate, she felt like she'd failed again.

And another thing - why does she get to live such a comfortable life while I'm stuck dealing with financial struggles and constant stress? Is it because she's \"better\" than me? Does she deserve it more? Maybe if I had been born into a wealthy family like hers, I wouldn't be facing these challenges right now. Maybe then I'd be confident instead of feeling like I'm drowning in debt. But no, I'm still here, struggling to find stability. What does she know? Has she ever gone hungry?

A warm smile had creased the principal's face, and the handwriting was neatly cursive.\n\nAs she scanned the note, a faint scent of perfume wafted through the air, transporting her back to the school's annual gala five years ago, where she'd worn a similar fragrance and danced with the same man who now held the principal's position. The memory was fleeting, but it left a bitter taste in her mouth, like the stale tea she'd been nursing all morning.\n\nThe sound of clinking cups and muted chatter around her seemed to fade into the background as she read the final sentence: 'Your dedication and passion have made a tangible difference in our students' lives.' Her eyes lingered on those words, the sincerity of which only underscored the emptiness she felt, the sense that no matter how hard she worked, she remained invisible, unappreciated.<|eot_id|>",

Every time she saw him, every conversation they had, every meeting they attended together, it always ended up the same way. He would say nice things, but behind his polite smile, I could see the disinterest burning inside him. His words were empty, a mask to make me feel valued. But deep down, I knew it was all a lie. He didn’t care about my efforts, and he never would. No matter how much I tried to convince myself otherwise, the truth was clear: I was nothing more than a replaceable cog in his machine. The fact that he chose her for this particular task was just another example of how he only picked people who fit his needs. It wasn’t personal; he wouldn’t bother himself with something so trivial if it didn’t benefit him directly. And what really hurt was that she was the only teacher who hadn’t received recognition yet. Everyone else seemed to be getting awards, certificates, and praise left and right, while she was still waiting for her chance. The injustice was almost too much to bear.

You keep thinking, \"Either I'll get promoted and enjoy better benefits, or I'll leave and start over somewhere else.\" This kind of binary thinking can lead to impulsive decisions that might not be in your best interest. Try to consider the nuances between these options—maybe there are aspects of your current role that you value and aspects of the potential new opportunity that excite you. Instead of seeing things as strictly one way or the other, try to find a balance between what you want now and what you hope for later.
