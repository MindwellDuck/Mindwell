Every time there was an argument or disagreement at dinner, something would go terribly wrong—whether it was a spilled drink, a broken plate, or even a fight breaking out. It seemed like no matter what, somehow, things always ended up on her side. She remembered one particular incident where her daughter-in-law (John’s wife) had stormed out of the house, leaving her to clean up the mess alone. Despite knowing the situation wasn’t entirely her fault, she felt frustrated with John for not standing up for himself. When he finally spoke up, she felt vindicated, but deep down, she knew he might have contributed to the argument. She wondered if he had been too passive or maybe had said something to provoke her daughter-in-law. When John sat down at the table, she noticed he looked tired. He hadn’t been feeling well lately, but she didn’t want to make him feel worse by bringing it up during dinner. So, instead of saying anything, she simply asked how his day went. His response was brief, almost dismissive, which made her feel hurt. Why wouldn’t he want to talk about it? Didn’t he know that she cared about him? She thought back to when they first met and how she had taken such good care of him, making sure he was comfortable and happy. Now, he seemed so distant, and it made her feel like she was losing him.
