A 'friendly' visit from my ex-wife and her new little boyfriend.\n\nI'm walking out of the ER, still trying to scrub the smell of death off my hands, when she's waiting there with this smug little smirk on her face. Like, what did I ever do wrong? Did I not provide enough alimony? Did I not give her the perfect kids?\n\nAnd then he shows up, this muscle-bound meathead who thinks he can just waltz in here and steal my family away from me. Newsflash, buddy: I'm the one with the medical degree, not you.\n\nShe starts rambling on about how we're'moving forward' and 'healing together', whatever that means. Healing together? Are they fucking insane? They think I haven't been healing myself for years, dealing with the aftermath of their toxic relationship?\n\nAnd the worst part? My hospital ID badge. She's holding it, laughing like it's some kind of joke. 'Guess you'll never see this again', she says, her eyes glinting with triumph. Never see this again? This badge has seen more blood than either of them will ever see in their entire lives.\n\nI feel my anger boiling over, my mind racing with all the ways I could take them down. But no, I'm stuck here, frozen in place like a goddamn statue. Because what does a 46-year-old doctor do when his ex-wife and her new boyfriend show up at the hospital, taunting him with his own ID badge? Absolutely nothing.\n\nJust stand there and watch as they walk away, laughing and holding hands like a couple of idiots. I swear, I'd rather die than live through another minute of this crap.\"<|eot_id|>",

You seem a bit distracted.\"\n\nFor a moment, he hesitated, unsure how to respond. Did she know what it was like to lose someone who understood you? To feel like you were drowning in a sea of uncertainty?\n\n\"I'm fine,\" he said finally, forcing a smile onto his face. \"Just making sure we're on track with the experiment.\"\n\nMs. Patel nodded, but her eyes lingered on his face, as if searching for something hidden beneath the surface. Dr. Thompson felt a twinge of resentment towards her – wasn't she getting it wrong somehow? Didn't she understand the weight of responsibility that came with carrying on his wife's work?\n\nAs he watched her carefully record the data, a sense of unease settled in the pit of his stomach.

It wasn't just the creative block; it was the nagging sense that she wasn't doing enough, that she wasn't bringing home the right kind of success, that she wasn't living up to Ryan's expectations.\n\nShe thought back to their conversation last night, when he had mentioned his latest business deal and how proud he was of himself. Emily had forced a smile and congratulated him, but inside, she felt like she was suffocating under the weight of her own inadequacy.\n\nRyan walked into the room, saw the look on her face, and immediately sensed something was wrong. \"Hey, what's going on?\" he asked, his voice laced with concern.\n\nEmily took a deep breath and tried to brush it off, but the words spilled out anyway. \"I don't know if I'm good enough, Ryan.

A pang of remorse washed over her, as it often did, like a relentless tide.\n\nRachel's thoughts drifted back to the fateful night when she had been driving home from a particularly grueling shift. In her exhaustion, she failed to notice the stop sign ahead, and the accident took place mere feet away from the hospital where she worked. The memories still lingered – the screams, the sirens, the feeling of helplessness as she watched her life unravel.\n\nHer gaze fell upon the piano, a gift from John before his passing. He had always been a romantic at heart, and this instrument held a special place in their home. Now, it sat silently in the hospital's waiting room, a poignant reminder of all that Rachel had lost.\n\nShe recalled the countless times John would play Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major for Emma, lulling her into sweet dreams. The melody now echoed in her mind, a haunting serenade to the mother who couldn't protect her child.\n\nRachel's vision began to blur as tears streamed down her face. She felt a wave of guilt wash over her, a sense of responsibility for the tragedy that had befallen her family. The weight of those feelings pressed upon her, making it difficult to breathe.\n\nIn that moment, Rachel realized she had been running from her emotions for far too long. She had put on a brave face for the sake of her patients, but the pain still lingered, festering beneath the surface.

But they never think about the consequences of their actions; they just keep pushing forward with no regard for others. It’s disgusting how they can prioritize profits over people's lives. When you're a doctor, you don’t care about your patients - you only care about money. And if someone gets hurt because of that, well, that's just part of the job. Doctors are just selfish people who only care about themselves and what makes them rich. I remember the last time we saw each other. She was fine, laughing and joking around, but then suddenly, she collapsed. We rushed her to the hospital, and I stayed by her side the entire time, begging the doctors to give her a chance.
