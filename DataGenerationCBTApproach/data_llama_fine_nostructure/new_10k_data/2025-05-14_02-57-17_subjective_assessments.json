Years of his research had led to this moment – the presentation of his groundbreaking discovery. As he began to speak, his words tumbled out with precision and authority.\n\nBut then, as he reached the climax of his argument, a young graduate student in the back row raised her hand. Her voice was shrill, piercing through the silence like a rusty gate. \"Isn't it true,\" she said, \"that your methodology has been widely criticized by our field?\"\n\nA murmur spread through the room, and the scientist's eyes narrowed. He felt a cold fury rising within him, a sense of betrayal and injustice. The woman had deliberately sought him out, known full well that her question would be provocative. And now, as he gazed at her, he could almost taste the satisfaction of revenge on his lips.<|eot_id|>",

You seem... off.\" He forced a reassuring smile, trying to shake off the feeling of disorientation, but she didn't back down. \"Maybe I should go get some charts?\" Her voice trailed off, and he knew she'd been there before – seen the same look of panic when he couldn't find something crucial.\n\nThe ER erupted into a flurry of activity around them, and he felt his anxiety spike, the silence between them becoming more oppressive by the second.

What really got under his skin was when she laughed at something he said. It wasn't funny; it sounded forced. She must be trying to make small talk because she's used to people avoiding her after what happened. But honestly, I think she's just trying to get attention. Maybe this guy is sensitive about losing his husband and doesn't want to see me talking to her. That would explain why he was acting so weird, but she was just being friendly.
