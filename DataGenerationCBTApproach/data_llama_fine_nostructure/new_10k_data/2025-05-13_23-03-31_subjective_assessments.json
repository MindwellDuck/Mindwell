My mind immediately went to worst-case scenarios—what if something happened during the delivery? What if there were complications that nobody could have predicted? But I tried not to think about those things. Instead, I focused on how happy I would be when she came home, holding our baby girl in her arms. I imagined the look on her face when she saw me, the way she would smile and laugh, and how proud I would feel being the first person she would tell. As I stood there, holding her hand, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. It was as if time had slowed down, and nothing else mattered except for this moment. I looked at her, and she smiled, her eyes filled with tears. \"I'm glad you're here,\" she said softly. \"I don't want to worry you.\" I squeezed her hand gently. \"You shouldn't worry. You've got this.\" She nodded, her expression softening. \"Thank you. I'll try my best.\" As I held her hand, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me.

In this suspended state, nothing else mattered except for what was happening within. ## Step 1: Identify the Cognitive Distortion Identifying the distorted thinking pattern is crucial for understanding how it affects our perception. Here, we notice that the protagonist is focusing on negative aspects while ignoring the positive, such as the wedding photo and the apology from the doctor. This indicates a tendency to overemphasize the negative and downplay the positive. ## Step 2: Analyze the Emotional State Understanding the emotional state during the triggering event can help us recognize the distortion. The researcher appears to be in a state of guilt, sadness, and possibly self-blame, which might contribute to his biased thinking. ## Step 3: Explore the Thought Process To better comprehend the distortion, let’s explore how the character thinks about the situation. We see that his attention is drawn to details like the apology, which suggests an attempt to rationalize or excuse himself. However, he also seems to be fixated on the negative outcomes (the death of the test subject), indicating a strong resistance to acknowledging any potential positives. ## Step 4: Recognize the Impact of the Distortion Considering the distorted thinking process, we need to think about its consequences. The researcher’s fixation on the negative may lead to a cycle of"

The kitchen was warm, but the smell of burnt meat filled the air, making his stomach turn. He'd been so sure it would be a hit – a special occasion, after all – but now he wondered if anyone would even notice.\n\nAs he mechanically began to clean up the mess, his mind flashed back to his childhood, where his own mother had always made such mistakes when cooking for him and his siblings. She'd never seemed to care, but he remembered the disappointment etched on their faces. His hands moved more quickly, scrubbing away at the burnt pans as if trying to erase the memories.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from his wife, asking how dinner preparations were going. A pang of anxiety shot through him; what if she noticed? What if she thought less of him because of this small mistake?
