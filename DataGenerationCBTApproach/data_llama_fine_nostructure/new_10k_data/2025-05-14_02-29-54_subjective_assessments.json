A faint smell of turpentine lingered in the air as he stared at a particular piece – one he'd been working on months ago.\n\nIt was supposed to be a tribute to his late wife, but the colors seemed dull now, the brushstrokes clumsy. He remembered how she used to sit beside him, offering words of encouragement and critique. Her absence felt like a constant reminder of his failure.\n\nHe took a deep breath, feeling the familiar ache in his chest. It had been five years since they parted ways, but the pain still lingered. He thought about all the times he'd stayed up late, pouring his emotions onto canvas, hoping to recapture some semblance of their love.\n\nAs he gazed at the painting, he recalled the day she left him. The look on her face, the way she spoke about needing space, and how it wasn't just about him. The weight of those words settled upon him like a shroud.\n\nWith a gentle touch, he picked up his brush and began to work on the piece once more. The strokes were hesitant at first, but as the minutes passed, they grew stronger, more deliberate. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he let go of some of the guilt that had been holding him back.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, he allowed himself to believe that maybe, just maybe, he could find redemption through art. But the doubt crept back in, whispering that it was too little, too late. He dipped his brush into the paint, letting the colors bleed onto the canvas, a reflection of the turmoil within him.<|eot_id|>",

She said things like \"you're going to die alone\" when we were 25, and \"your life is going to change forever\" after our anniversary. We got married two weeks later, and I thought it was cute. At least until she started telling me that I would never make it as a writer. That I was wasting my time with \"frivolous nonsense.\" Even though she worked in marketing, she didn't want to spend her days talking about numbers and spreadsheets. Five years later, she left me because I couldn't keep up with her expectations. She moved in with another man, someone who shared her \"gifts,\" while I struggled to find a job that paid enough to support us. When I tried to explain that life wasn't always fair, she'd say, \"You don't understand, I see things you can't.\" Now, she claims to have found a new partner, someone who respects her abilities. I'm supposed to be happy for her, but I know it won't last. She'll use them for her own gain, just like everyone else. I've heard stories from other women who claim to have seen her predictions come true. They say she told them they'd end up alone, just like her friend Sarah did.

My wife, my partner, my best friend - all just ashes in the oven.\n\nI lit a cigarette, but it didn't even get lit right, just a soggy little thing that fell apart in my fingers. I cursed at the stupid damn thing, tossed it on the counter, and grabbed a pen. Started scribbling on a piece of paper, words spilling out like blood from a freshly opened vein.\n\n\"You're supposed to be the one who makes breakfast,\" I wrote, over and over again. \"But today, you're not here. Today, I'm left to make it alone.\"\n\nI underlined it, then crossed it out. Then I wrote \"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE WHO COOKS DINNER\" and did the same. My hand shook as I wrote, tears streaming down my face like I was trying to wash away the pain.\n\nHow could you leave me? How could you just... leave?\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. I picked it up, expecting it to be one of our kids calling to ask when they could come over for Sunday dinner. But it wasn't them. It was my ex-wife's sister, asking how I was doing. How I was doing?! Are you kidding me?!\n\nI slammed the phone down, the receiver bouncing off the wall. I felt like I was going to shatter into a million pieces, like the kitchen knives I'd spent years sharpening were about to slip from my grasp and cut me into tiny little pieces.\n\nFor a moment, I stood there, frozen, the sound of my own ragged breathing the only thing I could hear. And then, I lost it. I started yelling, the words spilling out of me like vomit. I yelled until my throat was raw, until my lungs burned, until I thought I was going to collapse.\n\nAnd still, nothing changed. She was still gone. And I was still here, stuck in this hellhole of a kitchen, surrounded by the ghosts of our past.<|eot_id|>",

My wife, once the pillar of support in our culinary endeavors together, now regarded me with an air of disinterest.\n\n\"What's wrong, dear?\" I asked, attempting to sound nonchalant despite the turmoil brewing within.\n\n\"The soufflé,\" she replied curtly, her voice laced with disdain. \"It's...undercooked.\"\n\nI felt a surge of defensiveness, my mind racing with memories of all the times I'd compromised on recipes, of all the meals we'd wasted due to my mistakes. But what really rankled was the implication that I wasn't capable of executing even the simplest dishes.\n\n\"I've been cooking for you for twenty years,\" I protested, my voice rising. \"Twenty years of sacrifices, of late nights, of weekends spent chopping vegetables and dreaming of the perfect sauce. And this is how you repay me?\"\n\nMy wife sighed, her expression softening ever so slightly. \"I'm sorry, darling. It's just...I feel like we're getting too old for this. The restaurant business is a young man's game, after all.\"\n\nA stinging sensation crept up my throat, threatening to choke me whole. Twenty years of love and dedication, reduced to a mere afterthought? I felt like I was drowning in a sea of neglect, suffocating under the weight of my own inadequacy.\n\n\"Perhaps it's time for us to consider scaling back,\" she suggested, her eyes locked onto mine with an unsettling intensity. \"Sell the restaurant, retire, and devote ourselves to...other pursuits.\"\n\nOther pursuits? What did she mean by that? Wasn't our life together supposed to be about sharing passions, supporting each other's dreams? Or had I simply become a burden, a relic of a bygone era clinging to faded ideals?\n\nThe soufflé, still smoldering in the oven, seemed to mock me, its very existence a cruel reminder of my failures. I turned away from the stove, unable to bear the sight of it, and walked out of the kitchen, leaving the charred remains of my ego behind.<|eot_id|>",

He knew what would happen next – they’d ask him questions about her life, her wishes, and he’d have to make decisions without knowing all the facts.
