I stood at the pass, surveying the chaos with a critical eye, when one of the line cooks approached me, her voice laced with concern.\n\n\"Chef, we're running low on fresh herbs,\" she said, her eyes darting towards the walk-in fridge. \"We can't maintain this pace without them.\"\n\nI sighed, rubbing the weariness from my temples. It had been three years since...since everything changed. Three years since Emma left me, taking our restaurant, and our dreams, with her.

My hair was unkempt, my face gaunt, and my eyes sunken. What would Emma think if she saw me now? A shadow of the man she once loved?\n\nA snarl crept up my throat as I turned back to the line cooks, my anger and frustration boiling over. \"Get those herbs ordered, now! We can't afford to lose another table because of your incompetence!\"\n\nOne of the line cooks took a step back, her eyes wide with fear. \"Yes, Chef...\"\n\nBut it wasn't just their performance that had me snapping.

When I'm under pressure, I tend to see things in absolute terms - either I'm doing great, or I'm failing miserably. There's no room for nuance or balance. My reactions are extreme, and I often find myself jumping between these two poles, unable to stay grounded in reality. This way of thinking makes every interaction feel like a high-stakes game. One misstep, and I'll be labeled a failure. But when I succeed, I'll be seen as a mastermind. This black-and-white mindset has become a constant companion, always lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce. I try to push it aside, but it’s hard to shake off the feeling that my entire life is just a series of binary choices: Win or lose, succeed or fail, be perfect or be a disaster. The truth is, most moments fall somewhere in between, yet I struggle to accept anything less than perfection. When I’m under stress, even small mistakes can escalate into monumental failures in my mind.

It’s like time has moved on for everyone else, but I’m stuck in this endless cycle of sadness.” It became clear that many people were dealing with intense emotional pain after their partners left.

In one such forum, someone posted about losing their partner due to infidelity: “The pain is almost unbearable. Every moment feels like an eternity.
