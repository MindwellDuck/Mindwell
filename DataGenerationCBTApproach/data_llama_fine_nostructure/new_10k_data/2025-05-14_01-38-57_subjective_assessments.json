The nurse had been working non-stop since morning, and now it was almost time for her own break. As she waited for the elevator, she noticed the patient's chart on the clipboard – another one, another family left to worry about.\n\nThe door to the nurses' station swung open, and a young nurse walked out, smiling brightly at the staff. \"Hey everyone, I'm so excited for my honeymoon next week! My husband and I are going to Bora Bora.\" A faint pang in her chest responded to the cheerful announcement, but she pushed it aside, attributing it to exhaustion.\n\nAs she stepped into the elevator, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror – tired eyes, worn skin, and a hazy expression. For a moment, she wondered if anyone would even notice her absence during the evening shift tonight. Would her husband care? Had he grown accustomed to her being away, like all those other nights?<|eot_id|>",

Her job had always provided stability, while his lifestyle seemed unstable, filled with uncertainty. Now, as she looked at him across the table, she saw someone who didn't truly deserve her love. His lack of responsibility weighed heavily on her mind – he'd never taken care of himself, let alone someone else. It seemed clear that this relationship wouldn't end well, that she might be making a grave mistake by staying. But perhaps it wasn't just about him; maybe she was using him as an escape from reality. Maybe she was trying to fill the void within herself with something stable, anything to take her mind off the stress of her job. If she could just get through this phase, she told herself, things would look up. After all, life was full of ups and downs, and sometimes you had to roll with it. This too shall pass, she reminded herself, though deep down, she doubted it. This is why people say that fortune tellers are crazy, because they know what the future holds.

A stack of old photographs from her retirement party, taken six months ago, lay scattered before her. The faces of former colleagues, beaming with congratulations, stared back – a bittersweet reminder of a chapter closed.\n\nAs she gazed at the pictures, her eyes drifted to the empty chair where her husband used to sit. She hadn't brought home anyone new since his passing two years prior. Her phone, once filled with notifications from friends and family, now collected dust on the counter.\n\nA faint hum from the refrigerator interrupted her reverie, breaking the silence.

Her mind wandered through the years, replaying moments they shared, trying to find clues about what could have led him to leave. She remembered how happy they were when they first met, and how their love grew stronger with each passing year. But those memories also made her realize how fragile life can be – one day you’re holding hands, and the next, he’s gone. She wondered if there was even a chance he might return, if they could somehow reconnect. Was it possible that deep down, he still loved her, and this wasn’t goodbye, but just a pause in their journey together? Maybe someday, in some other life, they’d meet again, and their love would reignite like it did all those years ago. But then reality crept back in, shattering the illusion. The pain lingered, refusing to fade with time. She realized that perhaps, no matter how hard she wished, things would never go back to the way they were.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and her editor poked his head in, asking about the deadline for the story she was working on.

It doesn't even seem like she's trying anymore - just sitting there, staring blankly into space, probably thinking about him instead of focusing on work.

Like I don't already have enough stress? Now I have to worry about what she does next? # Cognitive Distortion Analysis ## Step 1: Identify the Blame The text directly blames the narrator's ex-wife for her recent behavior, attributing her lack of motivation to carelessness and a focus on her new relationship. This is an example of directing blame onto others for negative feelings rather than taking personal responsibility. ## Step 2: Analyze the Tone The tone of the text is critical and accusatory, implying that the narrator feels victimized by their ex-wife's actions. This suggests that the narrator may be using blame as a defense mechanism to avoid confronting their own emotions or taking ownership of their situation. ## Step 3: Examine the Language Language such as \"careless,\" \"not trying anymore,\" and \"she hasn't even bothered"

His wife always joked that he was like a sponge, soaking up every situation without getting dirty. She knew I’m a bit of a goofball, so she wouldn’t have expected me to freak out over a little food mess. But now that she’s gone, who cares? It’s just a sandwich, right? So, what's the big deal about someone leaving a plate of leftover chicken in the break room? Maybe they were running late, or maybe they were just having a bad day. Either way, I’ve been through worse. Like the time my car broke down on the side of the road, leaving me stranded for hours. At least I got some good stories out of it!
