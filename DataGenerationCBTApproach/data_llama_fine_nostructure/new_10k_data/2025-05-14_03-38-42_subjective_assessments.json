The mother's husband was beaming with pride, snapping photos and asking silly questions, while the kids giggled and played together. \n\nAs she observed this seemingly perfect scene, a coworker mentioned that Rachel had been married for over ten years and was now thriving in her new role as a stay-at-home mom. A friend casually mentioned that she too had found happiness after reuniting with her high school sweetheart.\n\nIn the silence that followed, the nurse couldn't shake off the feeling of being left behind – the failed marriage, the solo parenting arrangement, and the unfulfilling job that felt like it didn't offer much personal growth. She glanced down at her own worn scrubs, wondering how others seemed to have it all together, even when they appeared to be struggling.<|eot_id|>",

It felt like everyone else had something beautiful to share, while she struggled to find anything worth posting. Her mind kept drifting back to the conversation, replaying the words \"thrive\" and \"happiness,\" making her feel even more inadequate. She wondered if anyone would notice if she took another day off work, just to recharge. As she scrolled further, every update seemed to highlight the differences between her life and those of others.

She forced a laugh and thanked him, trying to brush off the slight letdown.

A shiver ran down her spine as she thought about how he'd be leaving for his residency soon, and she'd be left here alone, managing the household and the kids on her own.\n\nJust then, the door to the ICU swung open, and a nurse called out to her, but she barely registered the sound.
