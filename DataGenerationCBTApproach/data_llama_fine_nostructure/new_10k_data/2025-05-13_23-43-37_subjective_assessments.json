It was a day he had been putting off for weeks, ever since he'd received the notice from the school about his daughter's upcoming report card. He hadn't called her in months, and now she was struggling in math.\n\nHe remembered how proud he used to be of his accomplishments as a software engineer, but lately, it felt like a hollow title. His wife had left him after he'd made a mistake that cost their company millions. The guilt still lingered, even though it had been years.\n\nAs he gazed at the photo, he recalled the argument they'd had before she left – the one where he'd snapped at her, telling her she didn't understand his work. Now, his daughter struggled because he wasn't there to guide her. A faint scratch on his hand caught his eye; he'd gotten it during that same argument.<|eot_id|>",

She’s fine, and I know she can handle it. She doesn’t need me anymore. Why am I so upset? What if she really does hate me? What if she thinks I’m a bad father? That would explain everything. And what if... well, you get the idea. This is getting out of control. I don’t want to go down this road again. I’ll just put the photo away and focus on work. Maybe if I ignore it, it will stop haunting me. But then, another memory pops into my head—a different kind of memory—one that makes me feel like I’ve lost control. I remember how angry I got with my wife that night, how I said things I couldn’t take back. And now... now it feels like I’m trapped in some kind of loop. Every time I try to move forward, I’m pulled back by these memories. Maybe I’m just looking for excuses. Maybe I’m trying to justify my own failures. Maybe I don’t actually care about my daughter. Maybe... No, no, no. Stop it! This isn’t helping anything. I need to calm down and focus"

As she began to take attendance, her mind wandered to the stack of papers on her desk, awaiting review – the standardized test scores for the upcoming semester. She had been putting off grading them, but now they seemed to be multiplying before her eyes.\n\nAs she scribbled down names, her hand trembled ever so slightly, and she caught herself straightening the pens on her desk, a habitual gesture she'd perfected over years of teaching. But today, it felt forced, like a desperate attempt to maintain control.\n\nThe door swung open, admitting a flurry of chatter from the hallway, and she felt her anxiety spike. The noise was always overwhelming, but since her husband's passing, it seemed to have grown louder, more oppressive. She took a deep breath, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand, but her eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape route – or a safe haven.<|eot_id|>",

It felt like every photo she took was of privileged white men doing various activities, each shot perfectly framed and lit. There were no shots of street art, protests, or people struggling with everyday issues. Her photos didn't show the world as it really is, just a sanitized version of reality. It wasn't just the absence of diverse subjects that bothered me; it was the fact that all these photos looked similar. They all had a certain... polish, like they were staged instead of captured in real moments. And yet, she had received multiple awards for them. I couldn't understand why. It seemed like everyone else was saying the same thing I was thinking, but somehow, she was being celebrated for it. What was wrong with her? Didn't she see that her photos weren't representing the truth? That they were taking away from the actual struggles people faced? She must have done something right, after all, she was getting all these awards. But did she deserve it? Did she even deserve recognition? There was definitely something off about this award, and it wasn't just because she had already won before. This time, it was for a completely different project—a series focused on nature. The images were stunning, I'll give her"

They looked out of place among the worn furniture and faded family photos.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to bother you,\" the woman said, fidgeting with her purse strap, \"but we're looking for a place to eat. We heard this was the best restaurant in town.\"\n\nSomething inside him shifted, like a switch being flipped.
