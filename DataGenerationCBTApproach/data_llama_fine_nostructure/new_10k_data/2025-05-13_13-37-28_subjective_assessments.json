They were talking about how they'd both managed to secure promotions and raises while he was stuck in the same old role. The sting of it still lingered, making him feel like he was somehow failing in his own life.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from his wife, reminding him that she'd be home early from work and expected to see the grading done by then. He felt a wave of anxiety wash over him as he realized he still had hours of work ahead, and the thought of facing her disappointment was almost too much to bear.<|eot_id|>",

Now, instead of focusing on the task at hand, he found himself wondering what other people were doing today that made them seem more accomplished than him. The next thing he knew, his phone had sent him a reminder that his wife would be home soon, and he was still staring at the same stack of papers. He felt like he was running out of time, and every minute counted. He just needed to get this grading done before she arrived, but the more he looked at the papers, the more overwhelmed he became. He started to think that maybe he wasn’t cut out for this job after all, and that everyone else seemed to have it easier than him. Just when he thought things couldn’t get worse, another colleague walked by and mentioned that they’d been promoted again, further fueling his feelings of inadequacy. Now, he was starting to feel like he was trapped in some kind of never-ending nightmare, where no matter how hard he tried, he could never catch up.

There was no way out; he could never overcome his lack of talent, no matter how much he tried. Every day, he felt the weight of his failures growing stronger, until it became almost unbearable.
