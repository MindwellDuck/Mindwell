Another day, another dollar, but what was the point? The hospital had been downsizing, and he knew it was only a matter of time before they let him go.\n\nHis mind wandered back to his wife, who'd been struggling with Alzheimer's for years. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing her, too – neglecting her needs, forgetting important appointments, and losing himself in the process.\n\nAs he pushed his chair back from the desk, his eyes landed on the small photo of them on their 50th wedding anniversary, now faded and creased from being stuffed into a worn wallet. He hadn't looked at it in weeks, but something about it stirred a deep sadness within him. What would happen to her when he was gone? Who would care for her then?\n\nThe phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill in its interruption. It was the hospital administrator, informing him of yet another round of layoffs. His stomach dropped as he listened, numbness spreading through his chest like a cold mist.<|eot_id|>",

Didn’t she deserve better care than this? The thought made him want to scream. He wasn't going to make it much longer here; they'd already cut his hours by half last year. Now they were telling him he could be one of the first to go. He didn't even know how he was going to pay the bills if he got laid off. How could he take care of his wife if he couldn't feed himself? If I'm feeling this way, maybe I really am failing my wife. Maybe I shouldn't be trying so hard. Maybe I'll never be able to give her the life she deserves. She doesn't need me anyway; she has plenty of friends. He looked around the office, taking in the familiar sights. The same tired faces seemed to be staring out at the same drab walls. It was all so...human. But why did it feel so meaningless lately? Wasn't everything supposed to work out for us? We were supposed to grow old together, watching our children graduate college and build families of their own. Instead, we're just barely scraping by. Maybe I’m just overreacting. Maybe I don’t really see things as bad as I think. If I focus on the good, maybe I can find some peace again."

She felt like she was drowning in his messes, forced to swim against the tide of his opinions. It wasn’t fair – she tried to keep him grounded, but somehow, he always managed to push back. Her head throbbed as she thought about all the times she’d tried to talk sense into him, only to be met with resistance. In the end, she just sat there, waiting for someone else to fix things so she didn’t have to deal with it. The silence was almost deafening, a reminder that sometimes even I can’t change everything."

Whatever it was, he couldn’t shake the feeling that she didn’t really belong in his classroom. When he first met her, he tried to make small talk, asking her how her weekend had gone. But she barely replied, her answers feeling rehearsed, like she was just going through the motions. It wasn’t until later, when he saw her taking notes during one of his lessons, that he realized she was probably the new school secretary instead of a substitute teacher. Still, the initial impression lingered, making him wonder if she might be more than just a temporary replacement. As the days passed, though, things started to feel more normal. They exchanged pleasantries, and she even cracked a smile once or twice. But despite this, he still sensed a disconnect between them. It wasn’t until the day she forgot to bring the attendance sheet that he fully grasped what was bothering him—Mrs. Johnson wasn’t supposed to be there at all, let alone teaching his class. That realization hit him hard, especially considering how much trouble he’d already gotten into lately. Now, he could see how her presence must have thrown everyone off balance, especially"
