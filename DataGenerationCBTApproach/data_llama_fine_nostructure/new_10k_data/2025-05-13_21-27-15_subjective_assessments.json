It is written in a way that reflects the distorted thought process and makes it clear how this person overgeneralizes a particular situation (being distant/preoccupied) to a more general state (distant/Preoccupied). The person who wrote this piece does not fully realize the extent to which they are overgeneralizing and thus may be unaware of the fact that they have done so. This is an attempt to portray this person in a way that reflects their distorted thinking. If you would like me to change anything, please let me know! Also, please note that this is just one possible interpretation of this type of cognitive distortion. There could be many different ways to express the same thing. I hope you find this helpful!

Now, that same colleague would casually share credit with anyone who'd helped them meet a deadline.\n\nA small smile twisted her lips, but it quickly turned bitter as she thought about all the times she'd been overlooked, undervalued, and underestimated – just like her late husband had been.

They didn’t truly see her; they saw only what they wanted to see – a shell of the woman she once was. Even the simple act of going about her work felt forced, like she was pretending to be someone she no longer recognized.

Her eyes seemed sunken, her skin pale, and she appeared thinner than usual. It made him wonder if she was hiding something from him. She woke up to find him sitting there, looking worried. “What’s wrong?” she asked groggily, rubbing her eyes. I told her about my concerns, how she seemed different lately, and how I thought maybe we needed to go see a doctor together. But instead of reassuring me, she got defensive and said I was being paranoid again. That didn’t make me feel better. ## Step 1: Identify the Triggering Event The triggering event is when the narrator notices his wife looks different after waking up from sleep. This sparks his concern and makes him think there might be something wrong with her. ## Step 2: Analyze the Cognition Distortion The main issue here appears to be jumping to conclusions. The narrator starts with a vague observation (his wife seems different) and quickly spirals into more extreme thoughts (\"How thin does she look? Is she hiding something?\"). This shows how easily he can start making assumptions based on minor changes in appearance, which isn't necessarily supported by concrete evidence. ## Step 3: Look for Patterns This behavior seems consistent with past patterns where he would jump to conclusions about things without fully considering all"

Maybe she was stressed about something else in her life, and this small action was a manifestation of her deeper emotions. It wasn't personal, just an unexplained reaction. She probably needed some time alone to process everything before talking to him about it. That's why she seemed so upset when he tried to comfort her. He might be feeling hurt or confused, wondering what was going on inside her head, but he wouldn't say anything about it. She was probably trying to protect herself from getting overwhelmed again, and that's why she acted so defensively. John would understand once he realized how much stress she was under. He knew she was struggling lately, so he hoped she would open up to him soon. That's why she seemed distant, not because she didn't want to talk to him, but because she needed some space to gather her thoughts. John would give her the space she needed, knowing she would come around eventually. She wasn't mad at him, just at the situation. They would work through it together, and things would go back to normal soon. He trusted her enough to know she wouldn't act without reason, and she wouldn't keep things bottled up forever. She would find a way to communicate her feelings, maybe"
