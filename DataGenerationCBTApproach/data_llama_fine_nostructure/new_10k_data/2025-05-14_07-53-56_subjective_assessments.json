The comment was made in front of their supervisor, who nodded in agreement, saying the new hire had more experience.\n\nAs she listened, the woman felt her face grow warm and her eyes began to prick with irritation. She tried to brush it off, but the words lingered, and she couldn't help but think about how this could happen to her – a dedicated nurse with years of service, overlooked for a role she felt she was perfectly suited for. \n\nHer gaze drifted to the hospital administrator's office, where the promotion had come from, and she wondered if the decision had been influenced by anything other than qualifications. A faint sense of resentment crept up her throat as she turned back to the task at hand, trying to focus on the day ahead.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't the first time; she'd seen colleagues get promotions based on connections rather than hard work. She couldn't help but wonder what she did wrong, especially since her dedication and expertise were always top-notch. But instead of dwelling further, she pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on the next patient’s chart. Her mind wandered to how many times she’d gone above and beyond, only to be overlooked for such opportunities. Despite this, she refused to let it get to her. After all, she knew she was still one of the best nurses here—maybe even the best. That thought alone was enough to keep her going. As she continued reviewing charts, she felt a small surge of determination, knowing that she didn’t need recognition to prove herself. This was just another challenge to overcome, and she was ready to tackle it head-on."

A stack of ungraded papers from last week's lesson sat on her desk, a constant reminder of the workload she'd inherited after her husband's passing.\n\nAs she began to sort through the papers, one student's careless scribble caught her eye - a sloppy, childish drawing of a family, complete with a big smiley face and the caption \"I love my fam!\" The image was meant to be sweet, but it only made her think of happier times, of laughter and inside jokes with her own children now grown and moved out.\n\nA faint scowl creased her brow as she wondered if this student, too, had ever known the comfort of a loving home. She felt a familiar sting in her eyes, but quickly looked away, focusing on the task at hand. Yet, the image lingered, refusing to be dismissed.

She couldn't help but think about how different things might have been if she'd met them sooner, if they'd had some positive influence in their lives before this class began. But life didn't work that way, did it? Instead, here they were, facing an uphill battle right off the bat. It seemed pointless to try and change the past now. All she could do was keep pushing forward, hoping that somehow, someway, they'd learn from their mistakes and grow into capable individuals. After all, every child deserves a chance to thrive – especially when they're already struggling to find their footing. And yet, as she gazed around the empty room, she couldn't shake the feeling that maybe this whole endeavor was just another disappointment waiting to happen."
