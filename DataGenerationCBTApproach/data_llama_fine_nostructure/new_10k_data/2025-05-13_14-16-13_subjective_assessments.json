I can't stand it when my wife leaves me hanging like this. It really makes me feel like she doesn't care about our life together. She always prioritizes her job over everything else, leaving me to deal with all the household responsibilities alone. I know she thinks she's doing what needs to get done, but honestly, it feels like she never considers how I'm feeling. I mean, who needs a happy home life if you're too busy working? My wife says we need to keep up appearances for clients, but sometimes I wonder if she's more concerned with keeping up the facade than actually making time for us. When will she learn to put our relationship first? It’s frustrating. She knows how I feel about these things, but does she ever take a moment to think about it? Or am I just being too sensitive? It’s hard enough balancing work and parenting without her throwing in these extra stressors. And don’t even get me started on the mess – I swear, every day is a new surprise.

A young artist, probably half his age, caught up to him on the sidewalk, eyes shining with excitement as she described her latest show.\n\n'...and I got my first solo exhibition!' she beamed, barely pausing for breath. \n\nThe comparison stung, the ease with which this younger artist had achieved success a painful reminder of his own stalled career.

And yet, he kept going, driven by a stubborn refusal to give up, even though deep down, he knew it was all just an illusion.

Who needs to spend that much money on nail art? It looks like she painted it herself, which is disgusting. My nails are fine; I didn't waste hours on them like some people do. And I can totally see why she chose this color - it matches her dress perfectly. My dress is ugly, though. I wish I could've gotten something better for the wedding. It’s not fair that everyone else has such great relationships and I’m stuck here alone. Even the girl behind the counter seems happier than me.
