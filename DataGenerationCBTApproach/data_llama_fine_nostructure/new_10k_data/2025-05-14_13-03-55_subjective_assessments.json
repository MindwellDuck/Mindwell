When it came time for questions, he hesitated before asking a question that he thought would be smart, but everyone else seemed to know more than him. As he sat in the back of the room, he could hear the other people chatting amongst themselves, laughing and joking around. It made him feel even worse because he just wanted to be taken seriously and make some good impression, but instead, he just looked silly compared to them. Later, after the meeting ended, he went to grab a cup of coffee with his colleagues, but he noticed Rachel was already sipping a latte across the room. She didn’t even look happy about it; she just sat there looking bored. But then he saw his coworker’s email on her phone, and it had something about a promotion. It really surprised him how quickly things moved around here, especially for someone who was barely here for a few months. He realized that this place was very fast-paced and competitive, and he probably needed to step up his game if he wanted to fit in. (Note: This is where we can add our own thoughts and insights)"

He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach, a sense of powerlessness creeping in. Just yesterday, he'd been holding hands with someone who was supposed to be there now; her smile, her laughter – everything.\n\nThe nurse interrupted his reverie, handing him a stack of charts. As he began to sort through them, his frustration boiled over. Why did it always seem like no matter how hard he worked, things kept falling apart?

Maybe there was something fundamentally wrong with him, something that made it impossible for him to succeed. He thought about all the times he'd been told he was too old, too inexperienced, or too boring to be an effective educator. Those comments had always stung, making him feel like he was failing not just his classes, but himself. He realized that every time someone mentioned those things, he felt like he was being labeled as incapable. That feeling kept building up until he couldn't ignore it anymore. Now, as he watched his colleagues move through their lessons with ease, he felt like he was stuck in a rut. He knew he needed to get over these thoughts, but it wasn’t easy. Every time he saw himself in those moments, he felt a surge of disappointment and frustration. He hoped that somehow, someway, he could break free from those feelings, but until then, he felt trapped."

It seemed like just yesterday she and her husband were hosting gatherings, laughing together, and watching their children grow up. Now, those days felt like a distant memory, one she couldn't quite grasp.\n\nThe water tap ran dry, and she let the pipe rattle softly as she stood there, lost in thought.

But what really got under his skin was how others seemed to glide through these challenges with ease. People who had been in the field longer appeared to have it all figured out – the right words, the perfect tone, and a confidence that bordered on arrogance. Meanwhile, he was still trying to find his footing, struggling to keep up with the pace of the company. Even the smallest tasks seemed daunting, like climbing a mountain without a map.

It's good to have something to take his mind off things, though. He can focus on cooking and letting the flavors meld together while he thinks about other stuff. That'll help clear his head.
