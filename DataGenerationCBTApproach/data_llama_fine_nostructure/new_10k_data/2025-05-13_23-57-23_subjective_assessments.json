Another long day, another long night ahead, and she couldn't shake the feeling of exhaustion that had been building since morning. As she mechanically began to sort through the charts, her mind wandered back to the patient who'd been admitted yesterday – a young mother struggling to make ends meet, forced to choose between rent and medication.\n\nThe doctor's eyes pricked as she thought about the desperation etched on the woman's face, the tears that had streamed down her cheeks as she begged for help. The weight of those pleading eyes settled heavy in her chest, making it hard to breathe.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away the seconds until her shift ended. She felt trapped, like she was drowning in a sea of suffering, unable to do anything but offer Band-Aid solutions to the deep wounds of others.

They were always so desperate, always crying out for help, while she could barely manage to keep herself together. Even when she did get moments of joy, they were fleeting, overshadowed by the constant stream of suffering that filled her days. It felt like every choice she made, every decision she took, was leading her further down a path of exhaustion and frustration. Every time she looked around the hospital, she saw reminders of the endless struggles people faced. Patients with illnesses that made life unbearable, families torn apart by disease, and doctors who had lost sight of what truly mattered. It all blended together into a blur of sadness, each person a small piece of a larger puzzle that seemed impossible to solve. At times, she wondered if anyone would notice if she simply disappeared, leaving behind a trail of broken dreams and shattered hopes. It wasn't just patients; even her own colleagues seemed to have given up. Their smiles were now distant memories, replaced by a look of resignation that said, \"We're all in this together.\" But it didn't feel like we were all in it together; it felt like we were all sinking deeper into the same dark pool.

This incident led to the protagonist's current state of emotional turmoil. ## Step 2: Reflect on the Cognitive Distortion The cognitive distortion in this scenario appears to be the tendency to ruminate on hypothetical scenarios. The protagonist finds himself repeatedly wondering what would have happened if he had acted differently during the argument. This constant questioning creates a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, which may contribute to feelings of helplessness and frustration. ## Step 3: Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Distortion While the distorted thinking pattern does not directly cause harm, it can lead to a range of negative emotions and behaviors. In this case, the protagonist’s excessive worrying might intensify feelings of resentment and bitterness toward his ex-wife and her partner. ## Step 4: Consider Alternatives to the Distorted Thinking Pattern To mitigate the effects of this distorted thinking pattern, the protagonist could attempt to reframe his thoughts by focusing on what he can control rather than dwelling on hypothetical situations.
