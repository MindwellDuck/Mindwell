Just as he was about to begin, the school principal walked in, unannounced, and began rearranging the furniture in the classroom.\n\n\"Sorry, I forgot we have a meeting with the parents later today,\" she said, her voice dripping with condescension. \"I'll need you to move your things to the conference room.\"\n\nAs he reluctantly gathered his belongings, he couldn't help but feel a surge of frustration. The principal had no idea what it took to prepare for this class, no idea how much time and effort went into making sure these students learned something worthwhile.\n\nThe way she breezed in, like she owned the place, only made matters worse. He felt his face growing hot with anger, his mind racing with thoughts of all the times she'd undermined his authority, all the times she'd ignored his concerns.\n\nAnd now, as he was forced to pack up and move to some other, less important space, he realized he was going to be late for the parent-teacher conference. The one where they were supposed to discuss his own son's progress.<|eot_id|>",

It must mean nothing to her that I've been putting in extra hours lately. She probably thinks I'm just slacking off because I don't want to deal with her constant demands. Just as I was starting to get into the lesson, she burst in, completely disrupting everything. And now I'm going to be late for my own kid's meeting. What does she know?

It's clear he doesn't have many friends outside of work; otherwise, he wouldn't be so withdrawn. And why is everyone always talking to me? Does he really think I'm interested in hearing about his day? He's probably just waiting for an opportunity to strike up a conversation, hoping to impress me somehow. But I'm not buying it. There's something more to his behavior than meets the eye, and I'm determined to figure out what it is. He looked a bit down today, but maybe that's just because he got caught up in his own thoughts again. I'll try to reach out and see if he needs anything. Maybe we can grab lunch together soon - it would be nice to get to know him better outside of the office setting. But I've noticed he gets really quiet when people come over, especially if they're new coworkers. It makes me wonder if he's struggling with something personal or if there's just something he wants to keep to himself. Either way, I want to be supportive and show him that I care.

Now, those same moments felt like distant dreams, leaving her feeling empty and hollow inside. The world outside seemed to have moved on, while she remained stuck in time, unable to escape the pain of losing him. She tried to shake off these thoughts, focusing on the task at hand. Yet, every brushstroke felt forced, each color duller than the last. She couldn’t bring herself to mix another shade of blue, no matter how hard she tried. Instead, she found herself staring at the walls of her apartment, remembering the way he’d look at her when they were together. He’d make her feel alive, and now, she just felt dead inside. The silence in the room grew thicker, heavy with unspoken emotions. She felt trapped between two worlds: the one where she painted, and the other where she thought about him.
