A wave of anxiety washed over him, and he wondered if he was simply too set in his ways, clinging to formulas rather than taking risks.

It wasn’t just the emptiness of his latest project; it was the fear that he was losing his edge, that the fire that once burned so brightly now flickered, dimmed by the pressures of everyday life. She didn’t say anything more, but I could sense her concern. She knew how much this painting meant to me, and how hard I’d worked on it. But maybe that’s why it felt so hollow—the pressure to live up to expectations weighed heavily on me. I wanted to tell her, to let her see the doubts swirling inside, but instead, I forced a smile, trying to convey the calmness I desperately sought. We talked about dinner, but my mind wandered back to the blank canvas, wondering if I was holding onto the past too tightly, if I was afraid to take the leap and try again.
