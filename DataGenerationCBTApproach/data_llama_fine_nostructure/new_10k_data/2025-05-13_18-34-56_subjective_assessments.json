It was the editor, reminding him of the deadline and asking where his piece was. He hesitated, unsure how to respond. He couldn't bring himself to tell her the truth – that he was too drained, too defeated, to care about politics anymore.\n\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of his own ragged breathing. Finally, he spoke up, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I'll get it done,\" he lied, already knowing he wouldn't be able to deliver.<|eot_id|>",

Her voice dripped with condescension, and he felt his face grow hot with anger.\n\nThe woman finally hung up, looked around, and spotted him standing there, his hands clenched into fists.

Her voice was too loud, which is weird because she always speaks softly. But maybe she was trying to assert herself, show us she's not afraid. That's why she kept looking directly at everyone—she wanted to intimidate us into doing what she says. Even though we've barely met, she already knows everything about our classes and expects us to follow her instructions. It feels like she's trying to prove something to us, like she needs validation from the people she doesn't even know well yet. Maybe she's trying to make us look bad in front of the parents?
