The store was busy, but she tried to remain patient, reminding herself it was only 15 minutes past their usual time. As she finished ringing up the last item, a woman cut in front of her, grabbing three items from the same aisle and shoving them onto the conveyor belt before even unloading her own groceries.\n\nThe cashier, distracted by the woman's phone conversation, failed to notice the mistake and began processing the woman's items first. A customer behind her tapped her foot impatiently, while another shopper waited nearby, fidgeting with her purse strap.\n\nAs the cashier apologized to the customer behind her and re-rang the woman's items, the woman's face reddened, her voice rising above the din of the store. \"This is ridiculous,\" she snapped, tossing her wallet onto the counter. \"I don't have all day.\" The cashier, taken aback, hesitated before politely asking if she could pay first.<|eot_id|>",

They were smiling, happy, and young. She felt a lump form in her throat as she gently picked up the frame, running her fingers over the familiar contours of his face.\n\nHer gaze wandered to the empty chair beside her, where he used to sit during staff meetings. The memory of his laughter, his deep voice, and the way he'd always know how to make her feel better when she was struggling, washed over her like a wave. She took a deep breath, trying to hold back the tears that threatened to spill over.\n\nJust then, a student walked into the room, chatting with another teacher about something trivial. Their carefree conversation jolted her out of her reverie, and she quickly hid the photograph behind her back, forcing a weak smile onto her face. She didn't want anyone to see her, to know how much it still hurt. But as she turned to leave, she knocked over her pen holder, spilling pens and pencils all over the floor. As she bent down to pick them up, her hand brushed against the worn leather wallet that had once belonged to him – now a painful reminder of what she'd lost.<|eot_id|>",

He kept looking at her, as if searching for some sign, some clue he hadn’t noticed before. But there wasn’t one. Just the steady beep of machines and the soft hum of life support. It was almost deafening, a reminder that every second counted. Yet he stood there, frozen, unable to move or look away. Her eyes were sunken, her skin pale and clammy. It broke his heart seeing her like this, but he couldn’t let himself think about that right now. He needed to focus on her, keep her awake until morning. So he sat beside her, holding her hand tight, trying to channel all his fear into protecting her. Even though the doctors told him it might be too late, he refused to give up.
