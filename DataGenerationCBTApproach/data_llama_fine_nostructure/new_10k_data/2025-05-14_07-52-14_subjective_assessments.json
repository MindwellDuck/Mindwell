What then? Would she spend the rest of her days alone, surrounded by the ghosts of patients she couldn’t save? Or would she fade into obscurity, forgotten by everyone except for those who knew her? Her mind was a jumble of emotions – sadness, anger, guilt, and frustration. It all boiled down to one thing: she had let herself go. Years of exhaustion had taken its toll, leaving her with wrinkles, gray hair, and a heart full of regrets. Even her own health was deteriorating, but she wouldn’t dare admit it, fearing that anyone finding out would see her as weak. It wasn’t just the past that weighed on her; even her future seemed bleak. Would she find happiness after retirement, or would she simply exist, a shadow of her former self?

After all, hadn't he always been driven by passion and dedication? Didn't his past successes prove that he was capable of greatness?

They were just a reflection of how he wanted things to be.
