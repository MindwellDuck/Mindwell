It doesn't matter that she has nothing to do with me anymore; it's like she's just going through the motions of being friends with me for old times sake. When she put down that perfume bottle, I thought for a moment that maybe she'd finally realized how much we meant to each other and would be willing to give things another shot. But nope, she just kept on working, completely ignoring me. It's like she never cared in the first place, which makes sense since she broke my heart right under my nose. I can't help but wonder if this is all just some kind of cruel joke. Maybe she'll suddenly remember our relationship and come back to me out of nowhere. But until then, I'll keep pretending that everything is fine, just like everyone else around here. After all, who wouldn't want to move on from someone like me? Who needs closure anyway? It's better to focus on the past than dwell on the present, where things are clearly not going anywhere. Besides, if anything changes, I'll know right away because she'll probably be the first person to reach out. Until then, I'll just have to accept that I've been replaced by some new, younger model, and deal with the pain quietly. After all, I don't want to make a scene"
