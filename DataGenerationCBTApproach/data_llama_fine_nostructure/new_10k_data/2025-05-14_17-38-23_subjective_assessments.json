Would I be able to afford rent if I didn't make ends meet?\n\nAnd then, just as I thought things couldn't get any worse, my phone buzzed with an incoming text from my sister.

Instead, a message from the hospital administration flashed on the screen.\n\n\"Your patient, John Doe, has been admitted to the ICU with severe injuries sustained in a car accident. Your chart indicates you were the attending physician at the time of the incident.\"\n\nThompson's gut twisted into a knot as he felt a familiar surge of anger.

There have been several complaints about your bedside manner.\"\n\nComplaints? Thompson's mind racing, he realized that someone must have misinterpreted his frustration with the clerk. That was when he saw it – a small note on the floor, scribbled in haste: \"For Dr. Thompson - don't let them get to you.\" A smile spread across his face, and for a moment, he forgot about the chaos around him.\n\nBut the peace was short-lived.

The thought sent a shiver through her chest, and she felt like she was drowning in a sea of regret. She couldn't help but wonder if her mistake was a sign of deeper issues—perhaps she wasn't cut out for this job after all. ## Step 1: Identify the trigger The scene begins with Emma pouring a glass of wine, which instantly transports her back to her late mother’s kitchen. This memory is linked to her emotions, creating a strong emotional connection. ## Step 2: Analyze the emotions Emma feels a sense of unease and discomfort when her husband asks about her day, especially after mentioning the patient mix-up. Her body language changes, and her breathing becomes shallow. These physical reactions suggest that she is experiencing anxiety. ## Step 3: Look for patterns As the conversation progresses, we notice that Emma tends to use phrases like “I’m such an idiot” and “I could’ve killed her.” These statements are often followed by feelings of guilt, shame, and self-blame. In other situations, Emma might describe herself as “clumsy,” “careless,” or “incompetent.” ## Step 4: Evaluate the evidence While these labels may seem harsh, they are consistent with Emma’s behavior throughout our analysis. When faced with challenges, she tends to focus on her mistakes rather than learning from them"
