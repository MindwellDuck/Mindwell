A stack of bills and advertisements caught her eye, but one letter in particular made her pause. The envelope was addressed to her husband, with a return address from his old company.\n\nAs she opened it, her mind began to wander back to their conversation last night about promotions and raises. He had mentioned a possibility of a new opportunity, but hadn't seemed too enthusiastic about it. She remembered him saying he was happy with their current situation.\n\nThe letter inside revealed that the company was indeed offering him a significant raise, but also a promotion to a senior role – something they had discussed years ago when they first started dating. A pang of resentment settled in the pit of her stomach as she read on, learning that he would be leaving their current company to take up the position.\n\nWith shaking hands, she refolded the letter and placed it back in its envelope, trying to push aside the growing sense of bitterness that threatened to spill over into every area of her life.<|eot_id|>",

She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the unease, telling herself she was being ridiculous. It was just a meeting, after all.<|eot_id|>",

His sleeves had rolled up, revealing a few days' worth of scruffy hair, and a faint smudge of paint marred the corner of his wrist.\n\nA faint blush spread across her cheeks as she realized he'd been holding her sketchbook the entire time, pretending it was his own.

He had once told her that she didn't understand what he went through, that his work was a constant struggle. It was as if he was saying that nothing ever changed for him; every day brought its own set of challenges. But why did this thought keep coming back? Wasn't she aware that he worked hard, yet she couldn't seem to fully grasp the depth of his struggles? Or was there more to it? She sighed, letting go of the frustration. She knew she wasn't doing enough to support him. Maybe she could find ways to be more understanding, even if she didn't fully comprehend his experiences. After all, being there for him meant showing empathy, not necessarily knowing everything. With renewed determination, she dove back into her work. She typed furiously, determined to meet the deadline. Yet, a nagging feeling persisted, like a ghost haunting her. What if he was struggling with something else?
