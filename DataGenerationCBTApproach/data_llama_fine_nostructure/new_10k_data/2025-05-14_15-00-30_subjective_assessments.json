His sous chef was running behind schedule, and the line cooks were struggling to plate the dishes efficiently. He'd worked this many times before, but today felt different.\n\nAs he tasted the sauce for what felt like the hundredth time, he couldn't shake off the memory of his wife's laughter at one of their dinner parties. She'd always loved the way he made her favorite dish, and he remembered the sound of her giggles as she took her first bite. Now, the kitchen seemed empty and cold without her by his side.\n\nJust then, the phone rang. It was the supplier calling to inform John that they wouldn't be able to deliver the fresh herbs he needed until tomorrow. Tomorrow. He scribbled down a hasty note, his hand shaking slightly as he wrote out the order.\n\nOne of the line cooks approached him, concern etched on his face. \"Chef, we're going to run late if you don't hurry up.\"\n\nJohn forced a deep breath into his lungs, trying to calm himself down. He glanced around the kitchen, taking in the rows of perfectly prepared ingredients, the spotless equipment, and the team of cooks working tirelessly to meet the evening's demand. This was what he'd dedicated his life to – creating beautiful meals for people to enjoy. But it wasn't the same without his partner to share it with.\n\nWith a renewed sense of focus, John began to plate the dishes, his movements swift and precise. As he handed a perfectly cooked steak to a waiting diner, he caught a glimpse of himself in the window reflection. For a moment, he almost saw his wife standing beside him, smiling proudly at the meal they'd created together. Almost.<|eot_id|>",

But inside, I was screaming. Again. It's been two years since Rachel left me, and it still feels like yesterday. Every time I put on this uniform, every time I see someone in pain, I'm hit with this crushing weight.\n\nThis kid's mom was crying because her son had some stupid virus or whatever. I felt like crying too, but I didn't want to look weak in front of my coworkers. So I kept smiling, kept pretending like I cared. But honestly, what do I know about caring? I've been dying inside for so long, I'd forgotten how to breathe.\n\nThe beeping machines started going off, and I was called over to check the monitors.

When we exchanged small talk, she seemed more interested than usual, asking questions about our weekends. I thought maybe she’d finally opened up about her struggles after everything she went through last year. But then she asked me about my husband’s trip, and I realized she probably doesn’t care. I tried to keep the conversation light, but I couldn’t help noticing how quickly she glanced around the room. She looks like she’s worried about something, but I don’t know what. Maybe it’s just her anxiety showing again. Or maybe she’s stressed about school—she did say she has an exam coming up soon. Still, I’m surprised she came to visit us. I wonder if she’s changed lately. It’s weird how she starts talking, but then stops suddenly. Last time, she said something about needing to go home early, but today she stayed longer than expected. Now she’s quietly packing her things, and I feel like I need to do something. I try to ask if she’s okay, but she just says she needs to leave. Is it really just stress? Does she have another reason?

My wife, Rachel, had left her dirty laundry all over the living room floor... again. I mean, come on, can't she just put it away or something? I swear, I'm starting to think she thinks I'm some kind of magic cleaner or something.\n\nI glared at the mess, my mind racing with all the things I wanted to say to her about it. But then I saw her walking towards me, a big smile plastered on her face, and my anger turned into this deep, burning resentment. Like, what even is the point of being married if you're just going to leave your dirty socks everywhere?\n\n\"Hey, hon! What's wrong?\" she asked, oblivious to the storm brewing inside me.\n\n\"You have no idea,\" I spat, trying to keep my voice down but failing miserably. \"This is, like, the fifth time this week you've left your laundry scattered all over the place.\"\n\nRachel looked taken aback, but only for a second. Then she started laughing, and I swear, it was like nails on a chalkboard. \"Oh, sorry baby! I forgot again!\"\n\nForgot again?! Are you kidding me? It's not like I don't know when our laundry day is or anything. And another thing, why do I always end up being the one who remembers? Why does it always fall on me to clean up after her?\n\nMy anger boiled over, and I found myself yelling at her, at the top of my lungs. \"It's not funny, Rachel! It's not funny at all!\" But by the time I finished screaming, I realized I'd gone too far. Rachel looked hurt, and I could see the tears welling up in her eyes.\n\nAnd that's when I knew I was done. Done with the fighting, done with the drama, done with feeling like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around someone who seems to think the world revolves around her. I stormed out of the room, leaving Rachel standing there, looking devastated.\n\nAs I slammed the door behind me, I couldn't help but wonder if marriage was really worth it anymore. Was it all just a bunch of compromises and apologies, with no real resolution? Or was it something more? Something better? I didn't know anymore, but one thing was for sure – I needed a drink.<|eot_id|>",

She's standing outside the park, sipping a latte and chatting with the other moms.\n\nI pull over and watch from afar, feeling like a pathetic loser. Why can't I do that? Why can't I have a life together with someone? I glance down at my hands, still stained with paint from the art project we did in class today.
