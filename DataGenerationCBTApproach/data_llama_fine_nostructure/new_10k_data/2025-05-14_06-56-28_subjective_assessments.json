He set down his coffee and began to unpack his bag, but before he could even sit down, she started scrolling through her phone, seemingly uninterested in talking to him.\n\nThe barista interrupted his attempt to join Sarah by asking if he wanted to pay for her coffee as well, which made him feel like he was being added to her chore list rather than being acknowledged as her partner.

He couldn't help but wonder what would happen if he didn't try to talk to her anymore—would she start treating him differently? Would she eventually realize how much he’s been trying to get her attention? Would things ever change, or would we end up living separate lives, each lost in our own worlds? He decided to take a break and grab a snack from the café downstairs instead. Maybe some fresh air would clear his head and give him a chance to think about why he still felt so disconnected from Sarah. After all, he knew that she must have a good reason for her sudden distraction. It wasn’t like her to ignore him like that. But what if she really is just too busy right now? What if she doesn't want to spend quality time with me anymore? Maybe I’m reading too much into it. What if I’m just being overly sensitive? He shook off the thoughts and headed outside, hoping some fresh air would help him regain his composure.
