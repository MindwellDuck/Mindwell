He stopped in front of the coffee table where they used to share breakfasts together. Now it was covered in dust and a faint scent of stale air.\n\nAs he gazed at the spot where their mugs once sat, he noticed the newspaper from last week's divorce hearing still clutched in his hand. The article about his ex-wife's new partner was highlighted, the words 'happily ever after' scrawled across the top.<|eot_id|>",

She didn't even try to understand me anymore. The words on the page seemed to mock me, telling a story of two people who were meant to be together forever. They must have planned this all along, leaving me behind like a broken toy. My mind was numb, unable to process what I was reading. Why would anyone want to move on so quickly? I couldn't help but wonder if she'd forgotten about me already. I thought back to our wedding day, when we promised each other forever. Hadn't I promised her everything? What did it mean to break those vows now? As I stood there, lost in my thoughts, he realized he needed to get moving. It wasn't going to fill itself out. Maybe getting some fresh air would clear his head. He stepped outside and took deep breaths, letting the cool breeze calm him down. But as he looked back at the building, he saw her standing by the window. She was smiling, looking towards the park. For a moment, he forgot about the pain inside him. He wondered if maybe she was just remembering something happy too. But then he shook it off. This wasn't about nostalgia; it was about closure. Closing the door on the past. Closing it for good. He took another step forward, trying to shake off"

She felt a familiar pang in her chest, followed by the dull ache of emptiness. Her eyes welled up as she wondered what he would think if he were here now, what advice he might offer about her teaching methods.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed to close in around her, suffocating her.

The smell of chalk and old books hung heavy in the air, making her stomach turn with its bittersweet scent. Five years had passed since she'd last seen her daughter, and it still felt like yesterday when they'd sat together in this very classroom, laughing over silly jokes and sharing secrets. Now, all she saw was emptiness. Her gaze drifted back to the papers, and her heart sank as she realized just how much work lay ahead. She knew she couldn't let herself get overwhelmed, but everything felt so overwhelming. Even simple tasks like grading tests felt like climbing mountains. She tried to focus on the task at hand, but her mind kept wandering back to what could've been. What if she'd stayed longer? What if she'd been there for more milestones? The questions swirled in her head, each one ending in the same bitter truth: she wouldn't ever know. Tears slipped silently down her cheeks as she scanned the pages, her eyes tracing the lines where her daughter once wrote.
