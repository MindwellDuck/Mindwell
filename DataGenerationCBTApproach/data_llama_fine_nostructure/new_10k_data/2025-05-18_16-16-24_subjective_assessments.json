I couldn't help but feel a familiar pang of regret wash over me, like a cold draught seeping into my very bones.\n\nOh, how the tables had turned. Just yesterday, I was the one doling out orders, my expertise and experience guiding the care of our patients with precision. And now, here I was, being reprimanded by the very woman who had once praised my skills.\n\n\"Ms. Jenkins,\" she began, her voice dripping with sweetness, \"I've been reviewing your chart, and I must say, I'm quite disappointed.\" Disappointed? Me? By what, exactly? My impeccable attendance? My tireless dedication to my patients?\n\n\"I see you've been taking on extra shifts, Ms. Jenkins,\" she continued, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly. \"And while I appreciate the extra effort, I do think it's becoming a bit...excessive.\"\n\nExcessive? Wasn't that just code for \"you're burning out\"? Didn't she realize that I was doing this all for our family, for us? That every late night and early morning was worth it for the sake of providing for my loved ones?\n\nBut no, instead of offering words of encouragement or support, Dr. Thompson chose to berate me, to make me feel like some sort of inadequate nurse. Inadequate. Ha! I'd given birth to two beautiful children, after all. I knew more about caring for life than this woman would ever hope to understand.\n\n\"You need to learn to prioritize your own well-being, Ms. Jenkins,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Nursing isn't just about work; it's about life. And if you can't find that balance, perhaps it's time to reevaluate your career choices.\"\n\nReevaluate my career choices? Did she have any idea what it took to be a nurse? To put myself through medical school, to pass those grueling exams, to dedicate my life to this profession? No, all I got was condescending lectures from people who clearly didn't know the first thing about hard work.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I stood there, frozen in place, as Dr. Thompson continued to lecture me. It was then that I realized I wasn't just fighting for my job; I was fighting for my sanity. For my very sense of self-worth.\n\nBut did anyone care? No, they just cared about one thing: their precious hospital policies and procedures. And if I didn't fall in line, if I didn't conform to their expectations, then maybe – just maybe – I wouldn't be the star nurse I used to be.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to push aside the sting of her words, but it was too late. The damage was done. I was already drowning in a sea of regret, and I didn't know how to keep my head above water.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't the students' lackluster attention or their propensity for getting lost on the way to recess that had left me feeling this way – although, those were certainly contributing factors.\n\nNo, today was about something far more personal. Something that made me wonder if all the years of pouring my heart and soul into this profession had been for naught.\n\nI thought back to when my partner, Alex, had first told me he wanted to take up woodworking as a hobby. I'd been thrilled for him, encouraging him to pursue his newfound passion. And so, he'd spent countless hours in his workshop, crafting beautiful pieces of art from raw wood.\n\nBut then, yesterday, I'd walked into the kitchen to find our living room transformed into a makeshift woodworking shop. Shelves had been cleared, tools scattered everywhere, and the sound of sawing filled the air. My heart sank as I realized what was happening.\n\nAlex had decided to turn our hobby into a full-fledged business. He'd quit his job, sold most of our belongings online, and was now spending every waking moment building furniture for clients. I felt like I was losing him all over again, just like I had when we'd moved in together after college.\n\n\"Can you please just talk to me about this?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady as I handed him a cup of coffee.\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes tired but determined. \"I know it's a lot to ask, but I really think this could work. We can make a good life together, just us.\"\n\nI took a sip of my coffee, feeling the bitterness taste bitter in my mouth. \"A good life? You're talking about leaving your stable job and starting over. What about our stability, our security?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"We'll figure it out. We always do.\"\n\nEasy for him to say. Easy for him to just walk away from everything we'd built together. But I knew better. I knew that once he got started down this path, there was no turning back.\n\nAnd now, standing here in front of my students, I couldn't help but feel like I was stuck between two worlds – one where I was a devoted teacher, the other where I was a wife who'd lost her husband to his own ambitions. Which world would win out? Only time would tell.<|eot_id|>",
