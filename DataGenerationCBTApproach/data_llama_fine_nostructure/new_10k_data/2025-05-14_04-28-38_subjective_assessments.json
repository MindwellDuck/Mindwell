She seemed to know exactly how much each item cost, down to the penny. When he approached the checkout counter, she barely looked up, her expression a mask of indifference. As he began to unload his items, she asked if he wanted paper or plastic bags. Her voice was flat, lacking any warmth or friendliness. When I went to the grocery store today, I noticed that the cashier seemed very distracted, almost rude. She kept glancing around the store while simultaneously scanning my groceries, which made me feel uncomfortable. Despite this, she still managed to ring everything up quickly. It struck me as odd because she didn’t seem to care about helping customers, but instead seemed preoccupied with her own thoughts. I left the store feeling frustrated, wondering why someone would act so uncaringly towards others, especially when they were supposed to provide good service. It seems strange how some people can appear friendly on the surface yet have a different demeanor once you get closer. This cashier seemed to embody that contrast perfectly, making me question whether her behavior was genuine or just a mental filter hiding something more complex."
