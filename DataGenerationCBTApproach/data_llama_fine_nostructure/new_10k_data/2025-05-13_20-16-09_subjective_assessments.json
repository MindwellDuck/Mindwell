Emily, the nurse who used to work here, she left six months ago but I could swear she was lingering around the corner, waiting for me.\n\nWhat was I thinking? I'm a doctor, for crying out loud! I've seen it all, but somehow, this nagging sense of unease had taken up residence in my brain. It started after we got into that argument at dinner last night. My husband said something stupid, just trying to make me laugh, but really he was being condescending. And I know he didn't mean it, but it still stung.\n\nSo when I came in this morning, and I saw...or thought I saw...Emily standing by the sink, staring at me, I felt like I was going crazy. What if she's back? What if she knows what happened between us? We never actually spoke about it, just those awkward silences during rounds. But maybe she found out.\n\nMy mind starts racing, conjuring up scenarios where Emily's somehow connected to everything that's been bothering me lately – my patients' symptoms worsening, my lab results coming back off the charts. I keep telling myself it's ridiculous, but the more I try to rationalize it, the more my anxiety spikes.\n\nWhy can't I just focus on saving lives instead of getting worked up over some imaginary presence? I glance around the room, half-expecting Emily to jump out from behind the counter, but there's no one there. Just the usual clutter, the scent of disinfectant, and the ticking clock on the wall.\n\nAnd yet, the feeling persists. Like a shadow lurking just beyond the edge of perception. I force myself to take deep breaths, remind myself I'm in control, but it's hard when your brain decides to play tricks on you.\n\nWait, what was that noise? Sounds like someone's opening the door...<|eot_id|>",

I’ve tried to push these thoughts away, but they won’t stop. Even though I know she’s gone, I keep seeing her lurking around corners. It feels like she’s waiting for me, like she’s planning something. My heart keeps racing whenever I enter the room, and I have to remind myself it’s just paranoia. But then I hear weird noises - like footsteps outside the room. Or sometimes I swear I see her standing there, looking right at me. I know it sounds crazy, but I genuinely believe she might come back. Maybe she heard our fight and wants revenge?

Reliable enough? Ha! I've been reliable enough to keep coming back here day after day, despite everything, despite how miserable it makes me feel.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but it's no use.

My eyes scanned the crowd, landing on his face. Or rather, what passed for his face - the one that had been Photoshopped onto this suit, pretending it wasn't just a lazy Tuesday afternoon at the DMV.\n\nHe caught my eye and flashed that charming smile, but I wasn't having it. Not today. Today, I was here for one reason: to see if he'd finally learned to keep his mouth shut when I was talking.\n\nAs I made my way through the crowd, I couldn't help but notice all the couples around us, holding hands and gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. Meanwhile, I was stuck with this...this...person who thought he could just waltz back into my life like nothing had changed.\n\nThe sergeant stepped up to the mic, and I tuned him out as usual.

No mention of me. Just him, smiling like a poser, basking in the glory of our shared success.\n\nI felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead as I watched him take the stage, accepting the award with a fake grin plastered on his face. Fake. It was all fake.\n\nFor a moment, I forgot about everything else. I forgot about the job, the precinct, even my own name. All I could think about was how much I hated him right now.<|eot_id|>",

I don’t understand why the sergeant would announce that he’d be getting the award alone. Did he forget that I’m the one who worked hard to get us both promoted? Of course, he wouldn’t remember because he’s too busy kissing up to the boss. I swear, it’s always the same thing – everyone who works hard is forgotten while those who don’t have to lift a finger are rewarded. The whole system is rigged against people like me! And another thing – why did he get the award for us working together? What about me? Don’t I deserve recognition for all the work I put into our project? This is such an obvious case of favoritism. I bet there were plenty of other people who contributed more to the project than him, but none of them will get the same praise because they’re not connected to him. It’s so unfair!

The faint scent of burnt sauce and overcooked meat wafted through the air, a poignant reminder of my ineptitude.\n\nWhy, oh why, did I insist on attempting to recreate the Bouillabaisse recipe from that quaint little bistro down the street? My wife, ever the voice of reason, had warned me against it, citing the complexity of the dish and my woefully inadequate culinary skills. But no, I had to go and prove her wrong, didn't I?\n\nThe recollection of her words now cut like a knife: \"Just leave the Bouillabaisse alone, dear. It's not worth risking our reputation.\" But I would not be swayed. I was driven by some misguided sense of pride, of superiority. And now, as I gazed upon the charred remains of what was once a promising meal, I realized just how laughable that notion truly was.\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of my wife's voice, calm and measured, yet laced with a hint of exasperation. \"Darling, perhaps we should consider serving something simpler tonight?\" I turned to face her, my eyes locking onto hers, and for an instant, I felt a glimmer of remorse. Not for my actions, per se, but for the pain I was about to inflict upon her.\n\nThe realization hit me like a ton of bricks: I was doing this all wrong. This marriage, this life – it wasn't about me, or my ego, or even my cooking. It was about the people around me, the ones who loved me despite my flaws, and who deserved so much better than the subpar meals I served up night after night.\n\nBut it was too late now. The damage was done. All I could do was stand there, frozen in a tableau of regret, as the dinner service descended into chaos, and my wife's expression transformed from patient to incredulous.<|eot_id|>",

I understand that you may have been motivated by a desire to impress, but let me remind you that this is our home, not a restaurant. We don’t need fancy meals; we simply need food that’s prepared with love. Perhaps next time, we can stick to something simpler, like pasta or stir-fry. Those are dishes you know how to make well, and they will bring us closer together rather than further apart. In light of these events, I propose we revisit the menu for tomorrow's dinner.
