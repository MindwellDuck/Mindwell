His mind started to wander back to the argument he'd had with his wife earlier that morning, and how she'd been right – but it still rankled.\n\nAs the woman continued to load her groceries onto the conveyor belt, she knocked over a jar of pasta sauce, spilling it all over the counter.

She must think I'm crazy for being annoyed by this woman, but I know what I've seen before, and it wasn't pretty. This woman looks exactly like my ex-girlfriend who used to work here, and now I can see why I never got along with her either - we were both just misunderstood and dysfunctional.
