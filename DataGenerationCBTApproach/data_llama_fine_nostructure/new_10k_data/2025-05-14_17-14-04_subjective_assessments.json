It wasn’t just the food; her entire life seemed to revolve around avoiding these kinds of mistakes. Every decision, every action, every word was filtered through the lens of potential failure. It started when she was young, always looking for ways to control the uncontrollable. As she grew older, this habit became an ingrained part of who she was – a constant whisper in the back of her mind, urging caution and precision. Even in moments of joy, she found herself caught in the web of hypothetical disasters, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. But what if she didn’t let fear dictate her actions? What if she let go of the need to control everything? If only she could find a way to balance her perfectionism with the reality of living in the moment. Maybe then, the pressure wouldn’t feel so suffocating, and she wouldn’t spend every waking moment wondering what might go wrong. Yet, even this realization brought its own set of worries. What if letting go meant losing control over her future? What if surrendering to spontaneity led to mistakes she couldn’t recover from?

It was clear that her own path, though marked by hard work and dedication, was destined for obscurity. The very thought filled her with despair, as if the universe itself was conspiring against her. Every step forward was met with two steps backward, each failure serving as a cruel reminder that she would never achieve the success she so desperately craved. Her heart sank as she realized that this latest setback was merely the latest chapter in a book already written. The pages, penned by those who had come before her, told a story of disappointment and disillusionment.
