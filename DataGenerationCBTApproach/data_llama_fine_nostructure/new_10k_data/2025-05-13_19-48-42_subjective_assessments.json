His wife had always loved art, but never understood it. Now, he painted alone.\n\nA knock at the door broke the silence. He wiped his hands on a rag, expecting perhaps a delivery or a neighbor. Instead, a young woman stood on his porch, holding a bouquet of flowers. A card attached to the ribbon read: 'Sorry again.'\n\nHis eyes narrowed as she explained, apologetic smile faltering under his glare. She'd been a coworker's girlfriend, one who'd often drop by the studio unannounced. After his wife passed away, she'd stopped visiting altogether – yet today, here she was.\n\nThe flowers seemed like a cruel joke, a reminder of all the times her presence had disrupted his creative space, his grieving process. The anger simmered beneath his surface, threatening to boil over.<|eot_id|>",

The comments section was filled with congratulatory messages, but one comment stood out: a message from someone she knew at the company, wishing him all the best in his new role.\n\nThe woman's eyes lingered on the screen, her grip on the coffee cup tightening as she felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach. She quickly closed her laptop and began washing dishes, trying to shake off the growing sense of unease.

He was just here yesterday.\" I looked over at her, tears streaming down our faces. \"He always said he wanted to go hiking during these summer mornings,\" I replied softly, \"Maybe you could plan that for us?\" She nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on mine. For a moment, we just held hands, the only sound being the quiet hum of the TV in the background. Then, suddenly, she spoke up, \"You know, before he left, he told me something. He said he loved me so much and would never leave me.\" Her words hit me hard. I pulled her closer, wrapping my arms around her tightly as we both broke down again. We cried together, our bodies shaking, until finally, we were exhausted. As I looked into her eyes, I saw the same love and sadness reflected back at me, and I knew that nothing else mattered right now except holding onto each other."

A text from his ex-wife: \"Hey, can we talk about the kids this weekend?\" He hesitated before typing out a quick response, already lost in thought as he continued to scroll through articles.

It seemed like everything was against him - deadlines loomed, his ideas weren’t taking shape, and all he could think about was his stalled project back home. That story had been dying on the vine for months, and he knew he’d never be able to get it off the ground. His mind was a jumble of emotions, from frustration to desperation. He felt trapped, stuck between the familiar comfort of his current life and the longing to return to what he once knew. Every distraction seemed like a step further away from the truth, and every delay felt like a failure waiting to happen. As he typed out a brief reply to his ex-wife’s message, he couldn’t help but wonder if anyone truly cared anymore. Was he just spinning his wheels, chasing shadows that would always remain elusive? The questions swirled, distracting him further into the void of self-doubt. Time slipped by unnoticed, and with it, any chance of making progress on anything. In this moment, nothing mattered except the endless cycle of disappointment and regret. Yet, despite the chaos within, there was a strange sense of peace. Maybe it was just the comforting familiarity of being alone, or maybe it was something more - the realization that sometimes, things are meant to stay broken, and it’s okay to let go."

That way, she can focus on herself instead of worrying about what others think. She can take care of her needs first. After all, she deserves some relaxation after a long week.

She'll worry about it when she sees him tomorrow. Right now, she needs to let go and move forward. Life goes on, no matter what. She can't keep letting fear dictate her actions. She needs to learn to trust herself and stop worrying about what others think. If anything, she should be proud of taking control of her life like this. It takes courage to make choices that aren't based on what other people expect. And besides, she might even enjoy the freedom of having the evening to herself. So why not treat herself?

It was like she wanted me to give up, just so she wouldn't have to deal with the fallout. She doesn't know anything about being an educator. You should be grateful for having a job, not complaining all the time. But I'm not going to let her guilt trip me into doing something I don’t want to do. I'll ignore her until she understands.
