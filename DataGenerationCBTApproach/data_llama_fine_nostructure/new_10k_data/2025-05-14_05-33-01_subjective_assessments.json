It had been three months since the divorce, but the ache still lingered, like a dull throb beneath her ribcage. She'd always defined herself by her role as partner to her husband – police officer, team leader, protector. Now, she was just another single mom trying to make ends meet.\n\nAs she sifted through the reports, one file caught her eye – the case she'd been working on when it all fell apart. The memories came flooding back: the late nights, the endless cups of coffee, the desperate hope that they could fix it. But now, it was just a reminder of what she'd lost.\n\nShe felt a lump form in her throat as she read the latest update: the suspect was still out of custody, and the investigation was going nowhere. The numbers didn't add up; the evidence was circumstantial at best. She couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed him, that she'd let him down.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, her voice flat as she answered. \" dispatch.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was familiar, but the words cut like a knife: \"Officer, we've got another one downtown. Looks like a domestic. Possible victim's a minor.\"<|eot_id|>",

What if I lose control? She pushed aside the doubts, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand. After all, she'd trained for this moment, prepared herself for every possible scenario. Still, the fear lingered, a constant hum in the background of her thoughts. As she listened to the dispatcher's instructions, she felt a surge of adrenaline. This was what she signed up for – the rush of action, the thrill of the unknown. But deep down, a part of her wondered if she was ready. What if she wasn't? What if she wasn't strong enough? With a newfound sense of determination, she hung up the phone and stood up, grabbing her gun as she headed toward the elevator. She took a deep breath, letting the cool air fill her lungs. Maybe today would be different. Maybe this time she'd find closure. Or maybe she'd fail again."

Without hesitation, the charming nurse began to offer her expertise, drawing attention away from him and further emphasizing the discrepancy between their treatment by the administration.\n\nThe administrator smiled warmly at the new nurse, mentioning that they would be working together closely over the next few weeks, effectively solidifying her position within the team and making it clear where the favoritism lay.

But what really got under his skin was when the administrator mentioned that this particular nurse would be working closely with him over the coming weeks. It wasn't just a casual comment; it was an unmistakable statement that reinforced everything he already knew - that he was somehow less important to the administration. Even the tone of her voice seemed to convey a sense of inevitability, as if she was making it clear that this nurse was now the favored partner, rather than him. It didn't help that the new nurse seemed so comfortable around the administrator, exchanging stories and laughter as if they shared some secret bond. Every glance from the administrator towards the new nurse felt like another jab, each smile another reminder that he was the odd one out. And the fact that the new nurse didn't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary only fueled his feelings of resentment.
