A middle-aged colleague began discussing her own retirement plans, mentioning she'd been offered a prestigious teaching position at a nearby university. As she listened, she felt a pang of jealousy, wondering how someone so much younger could achieve what she once thought was reserved for her.\n\nOne of the newer teachers, still in training, timidly raised her hand to ask a question about classroom management. The colleague responded with a condescending tone, implying the younger teacher was incompetent and wouldn't be able to manage a class. \n\nThe older woman's eyes dropped to her tea, feeling a flush rise to her cheeks. She knew she had been a skilled educator, but hearing her own abilities questioned by someone half her age made her feel suddenly inadequate. Her mind flashed back to her late husband, who had always praised her dedication to teaching. The memory stung, making her feel humiliated.<|eot_id|>",

It had been two years since they'd parted ways.\n\nThe kitchen lights reflected off the gleaming surface of the stainless steel counter, making the faint smudge of last night's sauce stand out like a bruise.

When I think back to those days, I always remember how lonely it was, especially since she never really talked about anything remotely personal during the trips. So, while some might view these experiences as opportunities for growth and self-discovery, I see them as reminders of my own isolation. Even though I'm not alone physically, the sense of loneliness lingers. Now, every time I hear someone else talking about their adventures, I feel left behind. It’s almost as if I’m stuck in a perpetual state of solitude, watching others enjoy things that I can’t experience firsthand. This constant reminder of what I lack makes me wonder if anyone would even notice if I disappeared for a week or two.
