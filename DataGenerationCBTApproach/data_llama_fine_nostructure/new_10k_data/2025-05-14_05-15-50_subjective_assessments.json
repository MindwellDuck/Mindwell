It was her partner, returning from a late-night work commitment. He handed her a cup of coffee and sat beside her, noticing her tense posture.\n\nThe morning light streaming through the window highlighted the faint smudge of tears on her cheek. She hastily wiped them away, pretending it was just fatigue. But as they sipped their coffee together, he asked about the article. His concern was genuine, but his comment – \"I thought you were better than that\" – struck a nerve.

Her mind was elsewhere, consumed by the memory of the meeting with the editor, where he had torn apart her work. The words still echoed in her head like a punch to the gut: “Too sensationalized.” As if the very act of writing could somehow validate the criticism, she felt like she was drowning in the weight of those two simple words. Her partner walked into the room, bringing with him a much-needed respite from the turmoil brewing inside her. He set a steaming cup of coffee on her desk, his gentle touch a comforting gesture. Yet even this small kindness couldn’t shield her from the pain. The look in his eyes, though well-intentioned, felt like an accusation—a reminder that I’m not good enough. Even as he spoke softly, his words—“You’re better than that”—felt like a slap, a harsh reminder of her failure. In that moment, everything seemed to be building towards one thing: her complete downfall. The world outside had moved forward, but here, time had come to a standstill. All that existed was the crushing weight of my own inadequacy, and the nagging sense that nothing would ever change."

A bystander's phone lay nearby, its screen crackling with frantic texts from an unknown number.\n\nAs she knelt beside the victim, a chill ran down her spine – the same phrase was repeated in each text: \"I told you so.\" The words sent a familiar knot twisting in her stomach, a feeling she thought she'd long buried.

Did they sense the tension building inside me? The way she gazed at me, her expression a mixture of curiosity and concern, made me feel exposed.

I guess I'll have to try harder to convince her that I care enough to stay. Maybe if I can show her that I love her more, she'll finally see things clearly. When she gets older, she won't appreciate everything I've given up for her. She'll forget all the sacrifices I made, all the late nights spent studying, all the days working double shifts while taking care of her. I thought we were doing better, but maybe I'm wrong.

But as she turned back to the window, she saw only the stark reality of her own thoughts - and the nagging question that lingered within them. #Response End ##Step 1: Read the Triggering Event Read the triggering event carefully and try to understand its meaning. This will help you identify how the subject feels and what thoughts are running through their minds when they encounter the event. For example, in this case, we see that our protagonist is struggling with feelings of unease and insecurity after learning that her partner has shared information about someone else without her knowledge. ##Step 2: Identify Cognitive Distortions Look for signs of cognitive distortions in your response. In this case, the protagonist feels compelled to confront her partner about his comment, which suggests that she may be experiencing intrusive negative thoughts or feelings associated with the event. Ask yourself whether these thoughts are based on facts or just assumptions. ##Step 3: Analyze the Subjective Reaction Analyze your response and look for any subjective language or tone that might indicate the presence of a cognitive distortion. In this case, phrases like \"she felt an overwhelming urge\" and \"the nagging question that lingered within them\" suggest that the protagonist is not objectively assessing the situation but rather letting her emotions guide her reactions. This could be a sign of the \"Should Statements\" cognitive distortion, where"

For instance, during meetings, she would imagine colleagues betraying her or being overly critical of her ideas. These predictions were often based on past experiences, but she couldn't shake the feeling that her thoughts were somehow connected to the outcome. Even though she tried to challenge these assumptions, she found herself believing that her life was inevitably doomed by the people around her. ## Subjective Reactions: 1. **Predicting Betrayals:** When her coworker asked about her weekend, she mentally prepared for a negative response. She imagined him saying something dismissive or unhelpful, which made her feel anxious. This kind of prediction happened frequently, making her question whether her thoughts really predicted the future or if they just reinforced her existing fears. 2. **Assuming Criticism:** In team meetings, she would anticipate others criticizing her ideas.
