It all seemed so... impersonal.\n\nHer mind replayed the countless times she'd walked into this very room as a young doctor, full of confidence and determination. Now, as a 70-year-old widow, she felt like a shadow of her former self. The weight of her years bore down on her like a physical force, making every breath feel like a struggle.\n\nShe thought back to the day her husband had passed away, leaving her to raise their two children on her own. She'd been strong, determined to provide for them, but now, watching her oldest son slip away, she felt like she was failing him all over again.\n\nThe machines beeped louder, drawing her attention back to the present. The nurse entered, her expression sympathetic, but Dr. Thompson knew it was futile. They'd tried everything; they'd done everything they could. And still, her son fought on, refusing to give up.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she looked at her son's peaceful face. He didn't know her anymore, didn't see the desperation, the fear, or the overwhelming sense of helplessness that threatened to consume her. All he saw was his mom, holding his hand, trying to hold on.\n\nIn that moment, Dr. Thompson felt like she was losing herself, too. Like she was disappearing into the void, leaving behind the woman she once was.

I trudged into the ER, my eyes half-open, my mind still stuck on the same fucking argument I had with my ex-wife last night. She's moving out, leaving me to deal with our 10-year-old daughter alone. Just peachy.\n\nAs I started prepping for the morning rush, one of the nurses comes up to me, all cheerful and bright-eyed, no doubt fresh from her weekend off. \"Good morning, Dr. Smith!

It's... lovely.\"\n\nShe nods enthusiastically, oblivious to the fact that I'm about to have a nervous breakdown right there in front of her. \"Great! I was thinking we could take a team lunch today. Maybe grab some burgers at that new place downtown?\"\n\nBurgers? Are you serious? Can't she see I've got a mountain of paperwork to get through, and a patient who's about to bleed out on table 3? But hey, go ahead, waste your time with your stupid burger dreams.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the desperation creeping in. \"Uh, I don't think so. I've got a lot on my plate today.\"\n\nThe nurse looks crestfallen, but I don't care. Not even a little bit. I've been running on fumes for weeks, and I'm done pretending like everything's fine when it's not.\n\n\"Okay, well, happy birthday to me, I guess,\" I muttered under my breath.\n\nThe nurse looked taken aback, but before she could ask what I meant, one of the orderlies came by and handed me a cup of cold coffee. \"Hey, Doc, here's your morning fuel.\"\n\nFuel? This isn't fuel – it's poison. But I didn't say anything, just nodded numbly as I took the cup from him. Another day, another disappointment.\n\nI poured myself a cup of coffee, and as I raised it to my lips, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror behind the nurse's station. I looked like hell. My eyes were sunken, my skin sallow, and my hair was a disaster. I couldn't remember the last time I'd shaved.\n\nAnd that's when it hit me – the crushing weight of my own hopelessness.<|eot_id|>",
