The woman's eyes rolled involuntarily, a habitual gesture she'd learned to conceal behind a bright smile years ago.\n\nJust then, a call came in from room 304 – the patient who'd been waiting for her new medication since morning. The woman rushed to administer it, but upon arrival, found the patient's chart had been misplaced, and the doctor was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"Guess I'll have to wait another 20 minutes,\" she muttered under her breath, trying to hide the frustration etched across her face. A patient nearby caught her eye, struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of the morning's activities. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she wondered how this chaos would affect their care.<|eot_id|>",

Today was supposed to be her day off – no restaurant, no early mornings, no endless prep work.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, she noticed a couple holding hands, laughing together on their way home from a walk. They looked young, carefree, their love radiating like a warm light. She felt a pang in her chest, a dull ache that seemed to spread through her entire body.\n\nHer eyes landed on the old family recipe book lying open on the counter. Her mother had written notes in the margins, tiny drawings of vegetables and flowers surrounding each recipe. It was a book she'd treasured since childhood, but hadn't opened in years.\n\nA faint memory stirred, of her mother teaching her how to make the perfect bouillabaisse, of the smell of saffron and garlic filling the kitchen. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized it had been so long since she'd cooked for anyone but herself.\n\nThe couple's laughter grew louder, and she felt a wave of loneliness wash over her. She closed the cookbook, her hand trembling slightly as she reached for the tea kettle.<|eot_id|>",

A pang of regret hit him, and he couldn't help but think of what could've been if he'd made different choices all those years ago.\n\nHis wife, sensing his unease, asked if everything was okay.

This place isn't exactly running smoothly anyway, but now it's worse than ever. I guess I'll just have to deal with it, but honestly, this is just one more reason why I don't want to work here anymore. It's not like the customer noticed anything either.
