He felt a pang in his chest, noticing the way he wasn't the one making her smile.\n\nAs he waited in line, his gaze drifted back to her, taking in the way her hair fell across her forehead, the curve of her neck. A woman sat beside her, typing away on her laptop, occasionally glancing over to engage in conversation. The way they talked, their words easy and familiar, struck a chord within him.\n\nWhen it was his turn to order, he found himself pausing, unsure what to say. The barista asked how his day was going, and he hesitated before responding, feeling a sense of detachment wash over him. As he waited for his drink, he couldn't shake the image of them together, their conversation flowing effortlessly.\n\nShe caught his eye, and for a moment, they just looked at each other. Then, she turned back to her friend, oblivious to the unease he'd been trying to shake off.<|eot_id|>",

The way she smiled at someone else made him feel like she didn’t even notice him, let alone want anything to do with him. When he saw her sitting by herself, he assumed she was waiting for someone - probably a guy who knew her better than him. It seemed unlikely she’d be out here all alone, especially since they had lunch together yesterday. And yet, he couldn’t help but imagine what it would be like if she were single, if she actually liked him. But no, she’s probably just waiting for her boyfriend, and he’ll never have a chance with her anyway. The way they chatted casually told him that she was either bored or flirting with this guy, which meant he could forget about her once and for all. If she was laughing with him, then she must really enjoy his company, but she wasn’t, so there was nothing to think about – she was clearly bored or playing games with him to get attention from others. Maybe she was just being friendly, but it didn’t matter; she wasn’t interested in him. After seeing her talk to another guy, he figured that she must have moved on from him. Seeing her laugh at something made him wonder if she was already dating someone else, and she was just pretending to be friends with him to make things more interesting. Or maybe she"

A message from a company he had worked with twenty years ago caught his eye - they were hosting a reunion for former employees and invited him to attend.\n\nAs he read through the details, a wave of nostalgia washed over him, but it was quickly replaced by a growing sense of resentment. He thought about all the times he had spent late nights working on projects, missing out on time with his family, and all the sacrifices he made for the sake of his career.\n\nThe more he read, the more he felt a pang of anger towards the company that had taken advantage of him back then. The fact that they were now throwing a lavish reunion, complete with expensive catering and entertainment, only added to his frustration.

Why would this one woman choose him out of all those people? A chill ran down his spine as he thought about her words, \"You deserve to be loved.\" What did she mean? Was she talking about something specific, or was this some kind of general statement? He couldn't help but wonder if there was something wrong with him, if he was somehow less deserving than others. This was too much to handle alone. He needed someone to talk to, someone who could offer clarity and reassurance.
