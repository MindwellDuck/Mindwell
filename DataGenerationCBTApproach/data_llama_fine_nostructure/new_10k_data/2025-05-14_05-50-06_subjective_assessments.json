That maybe things were meant to fall apart before they could come together again. It didn’t sound fair, but there was no denying that she felt a chill run down her spine when she saw those words. It was as if the universe itself was sending her a message – one that would leave her heart heavy with disappointment and sadness. She knew better than to trust such signs, though.

It was clear that these weren't just random marks – they seemed deliberate, as if someone had deliberately scratched them into the skin. This realization sent a shiver down his spine, and he began to imagine all sorts of sinister scenarios. Maybe someone was trying to hide evidence of abuse? Or perhaps this was some sort of twisted game? The nurse's mind raced with questions: Who could have done such a thing? And why? This wasn't just a medical issue anymore; it had turned into a mystery that needed solving. As he continued to examine the baby, the nurse found a small piece of fabric caught between the mattress and the wall. It looked like cotton, and there were threads dangling loose – exactly the kind you'd find in a sewing basket. Suddenly, the nurse's thoughts shifted from suspicion to curiosity. Could this"
