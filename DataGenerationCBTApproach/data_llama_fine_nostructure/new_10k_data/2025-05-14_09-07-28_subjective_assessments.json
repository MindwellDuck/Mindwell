I need to know if she's showing any signs of dehydration,\" she said, glancing over her shoulder at another nurse who was already on their way to the room.\n\nAs the younger nurse rushed off, the older woman's eyes flicked to the patient's chart on the clipboard, and then to the empty chair beside it – the one where Mrs. Johnson usually sat. The bed was made, the blanket smoothed, but there was no sign of the frail elderly woman.\n\nThe supervisor's expression turned concerned, and she looked back at our nurse, expecting an update. Our nurse hesitated, feeling a twinge of anxiety and guilt. She had been the last one to interact with Mrs. Johnson before going home early the previous day, citing exhaustion.\n\nThe supervisor's gaze lingered on her, as if waiting for some explanation, and our nurse felt her face grow warm, her heart rate quicken. She fumbled with the clipboard, trying to stall, but the supervisor simply nodded and moved on to the next task, leaving our nurse feeling exposed and ashamed.<|eot_id|>",

I’ve been working overtime lately, and I feel like I’m already burning out. If I had to go home early that day because I was too exhausted, why would I be able to stay longer today? It really isn’t fair. I'm doing everything I can here, and she doesn’t even give me a break. Maybe if I didn’t have to work so hard, I wouldn’t feel this way.

The amount was more than double what he'd anticipated, and for a moment, his anger simmered just below the surface. He took another sip of coffee, his mind wandering back to the argument they'd had earlier that week.\n\nThe door to his office opened, and one of the nurses poked her head in, interrupting his reverie. \"Dr., I need you to review these test results ASAP.\" As she handed him the charts, her voice was bright and cheerful, oblivious to the storm brewing inside him.\n\nHe forced a smile and began to scan the papers, his fingers drumming a staccato beat on the counter as he tried to calm himself down. But when he saw the words'maintenance costs' and 'long-term care', something snapped. His chair scraped against the floor as he rose from his seat, his face a mask of controlled fury.<|eot_id|>",

As she listened to the congratulations pouring in from the audience, including her students' beaming faces, she couldn't help but feel a pang of embarrassment.

And now they were standing there, basking in the praise of the crowd, while she was left feeling defeated. It seemed like everything was going wrong for her lately. She'd already messed up a few times this year, and now this was just another reminder that she wasn't cut out for teaching. Maybe she should just stick to being an accountant instead of trying my hand at something creative. After all, why bother pushing herself when things are bound to go wrong anyway? She couldn't shake off the feeling that every little thing was conspiring against her. Even the way the emcee introduced the winners seemed like a personal jab. \"And the winner is...the girls who did everything right!\" he said with a smile. It was almost as if he knew exactly how much she hated losing. He must have some sort of sixth sense about her. Why else would he say such a snide comment? She began to wonder if maybe he was more into predicting the future than most people give him credit for.

As they exchanged numbers, he caught a glimpse of her phone, where a text from someone else was open on the screen. For a fleeting instant, he thought he saw the name \"Mike\" – a guy he'd met through work a few months ago. But when he looked again, the screen had changed to a photo of their vacation last summer.

Yet, the image of Mike kept popping up in his head, making him question whether he was overreacting or if there was truth to those thoughts. What if Mike had been there all along, and he missed out because he didn't notice? Or what if she did have feelings for him?
