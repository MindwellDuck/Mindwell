As she turned to inspect the soup station, her eyes landed on the offending ingredient: a can of low-sodium broth that had been substituted by her sous chef without her knowledge.\n\nThe taste was all wrong – bland and metallic. She felt a knot form in her stomach as she realized the extent of the substitution. This was more than just a mistake; it was a deliberate attempt to alter the recipe, to undermine her authority and her culinary vision.

He felt like a part of him was still waiting back home, where everything seemed frozen in time since her passing six months ago.\n\nThe clock ticked away, each minute stretching out into an eternity as he struggled to focus on the task at hand.

But then, after months of hard work, he'd decided against it. What really hurt was that he'd never even mentioned it again. That decision felt personal, like he'd done it because he didn't think she was capable. Or maybe he'd just forgotten about it? She remembered the time he'd sent her to handle a particularly tough case alone. She'd worked day and night, barely sleeping, but still managed to solve the mystery. When she returned, she expected praise, but instead, he just grunted and told her she needed to focus on more \"important\" cases.

Her discomfort was likely due to the fact that she had worked hard for 15 years, often putting in extra hours without expecting recognition. Maybe she had simply forgotten to submit some reports because they weren't urgent, or perhaps she was just tired from the long day she'd had. Or maybe the officer who received the award was someone new, and she hadn't kept up with the latest developments. It could have been anything except her own incompetence. This incident reminded her of when she was promoted over a colleague several years ago. He had been acting strangely around that time, and rumors swirled about his behavior. But she knew she deserved the promotion anyway, and it was unfair that others doubted her abilities. Now, she wondered if the same thing happened again, and people thought she wasn't worthy of recognition. No, no, she mustn't let these thoughts consume her. This is probably just paranoia.
