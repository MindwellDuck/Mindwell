He let the sound echo through the empty studio, letting it merge with the silence, creating an unholy union of pain and regret.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the bills piling up, about the art world that had moved on without him, about the loneliness that had become his constant companion.

When I painted, we were happy, laughing, and carefree. But now...now, every stroke feels like a betrayal, every color a painful memory. Even the smell of turpentine brings me back to that day, when everything fell apart. I thought I could control the flames, but I was wrong. They spread too fast, burning us out before we could escape. My wife...my beautiful wife…she deserved better than this. She deserved life, not death. And I’m the one who took it away. I’ve spent months working on this piece, pouring my heart and soul into it. But each layer feels like a failure, a reminder of how far I've fallen. I know she would have hated this—it looks nothing like her, nothing like the beauty we once shared. Yet, I feel compelled to finish it, to make it perfect, even though I know it will never be enough.

We don't exactly have a great history, but she's always been friendly enough when we run into each other. But today, she looks... different. She's got this new haircut, and her eyes seem to hold this secret smile.\n\nAnyway, I try to play it cool, but inside I'm freaking out.

And I swear, they're feeding off each other's energy or something. It's like they're trying to one-up each other, show who's the more perfect partner.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, Rachel mentions how much she loves our old neighborhood, where we used to live together. And I feel this pang in my chest, like I've been punched in the gut. How could she do that? Doesn't she remember how messed up our marriage was?\n\nThe couple starts asking if we can get married there someday, and I'm standing there, frozen, feeling like a total idiot. Because, yeah, that would be awesome. Me, Rachel, and some other guy getting married in the same place where we used to live... it's just too much to handle.\n\nI end up telling them no, that we don't really live there anymore, and quickly change the subject. As soon as they leave, I just lose it. I start yelling at Rachel, telling her that she has no right to bring me down like that. But she just stands there, smiling, saying sorry and whatever.\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is? The couple comes back, and they're still talking about getting married there.
