The company had been struggling financially, but he had always assumed it would pass. Now, as he scrolled through the list of affected employees, his eyes landed on one name - John, his former colleague from five years ago.\n\nJohn had left the company abruptly after a public argument with their CEO, citing 'creative differences'. At the time, he had seemed confident, even triumphant, when leaving. But now, seeing his name on the list, something inside him shifted. A spark of resentment flared, fueled by memories of their past disagreements and the sense of injustice that had simmered beneath the surface.\n\nAs he read on, the words began to blur together. His mind wandered back to that fateful day when John had stormed out, leaving behind a trail of angry emails and broken promises. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, a mix of emotions he couldn't quite put into words. All he knew was that his anger had been quietly building, waiting for this moment to reignite.<|eot_id|>",
