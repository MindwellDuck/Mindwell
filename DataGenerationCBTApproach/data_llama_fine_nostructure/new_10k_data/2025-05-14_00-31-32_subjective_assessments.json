The sound of his own breathing was the only disturbance, until he heard it again - the faint creak of the wooden floorboards beneath his feet, followed by the soft rustle of fabric.\n\nAt first, he thought it was just the old house settling, but then he swore he heard footsteps outside his door, light and deliberate, as if someone was trying not to be seen. His heart rate quickened, and his brush hovered above the canvas, poised mid-stroke.\n\nThe silence that followed seemed oppressive, heavy with unspoken intentions. He tried to tell himself it was just his imagination playing tricks on him, but the sense of being watched lingered, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He slowly set down his brush, his eyes scanning the empty room, searching for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. Just the quiet, expectant stillness.<|eot_id|>",

But this time, it sounded different, almost... intentional? I try to remind myself that I'm overreacting, that I've probably just misinterpreted the sounds. Yet, the feeling persists – like an unseen presence is watching me, waiting for its moment to strike. It's not rational, but I can't shake off the feeling. Every creak makes me jump, and I find myself glancing around the room, half-expecting something to leap out. Maybe I'm just tired and my mind is playing tricks on me, but the fear lingers nonetheless."

Now, the frame seemed out of place among the sterile white walls.\n\nShe felt a familiar ache in her chest, one she'd grown accustomed to over the past few months.

It was Sarah, handing her a steaming hot cup of coffee. But who cares about coffee when there are more pressing concerns? Like paying off this latest bill, which is probably going to bankrupt us all soon. Sarah's friendly smile caught her off guard. Why would she care? I don't need her sympathy. Maybe she's just trying to distract me from the real issue here – I have no idea what's going on in that patient's file. I'm just reading the numbers, but I don't actually understand what they mean. Yet another medical mystery waiting to be solved. Yeah, okay, maybe I'll take my time updating these orders... Later. But then, something changed.
