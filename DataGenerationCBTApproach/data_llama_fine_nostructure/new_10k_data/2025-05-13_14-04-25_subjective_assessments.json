A simple miscommunication had led to a delay of nearly an hour, but what infuriated him was the patient's expression – one of expectation and entitlement.\n\nThe woman's gaze flicked towards him, her eyes sparkling with an unspoken 'what's wrong?' before returning to her partner's hand. He felt a surge of frustration at being misunderstood, his years of training and compassion rendered meaningless by this trivial oversight. The beeping of the machines in the background seemed to amplify his growing anger, until it became a maddening drone in his ears.<|eot_id|>",

I wonder what really went through his mind when she said sorry. Probably just thinking about how much he hated being waited on. It wasn't surprising; after all, we've been taught that older people are more patient than younger ones, especially those who work at retail stores. Maybe he genuinely thought she meant to trigger an accident. That would explain why he reacted so harshly. His behavior suggested that he blamed the situation entirely on her actions, rather than taking responsibility for his own frustration. Perhaps he was having a bad day and needed someone to take out his anger on. Whatever the reason, it's clear that he directed blame towards her for his negative emotions. The way he spoke under his breath made it seem like he was trying to shift the focus from himself to her. He might have even thought that he deserved better service from someone else. As I watched him, I couldn't help but feel a bit frustrated myself. But blaming others is usually easier than facing one’s own shortcomings. After all, we tend to think that others are responsible for our problems, rather than acknowledging our own flaws. So, it makes sense that he would try to deflect his anger onto someone else. In the end, though, he probably didn’t realize that he was directing blame. He just saw the woman as a convenient target for his frustration, rather than recognizing his own role in"

It was as if everyone was waiting for her to slip up so they could pounce. Her mind began to spin scenarios, each one more dramatic than the last. Was the sergeant really angry about the way they handled the Johnson case, or was there another explanation? Maybe it was just coincidence that he was standing near the entrance, his arms crossed.
