The young mother's decision to delay her child's vaccination had put the entire household at risk, and now the kid was already showing symptoms of measles.\n\nThe doctor's mind flashed back to her own childhood, where her parents had refused to vaccinate her, citing concerns about mercury in the vaccines. Her mother had passed away a few years ago, but the memory of those unhygienic living conditions still lingered – the dirt-stained floors, the lack of running water. It was like reliving that nightmare all over again.\n\nDr. Thompson's gaze drifted to her husband, who was waiting for her in the hospital cafeteria. He was oblivious to her distress, chattering away about his day as he sipped his coffee. She felt a surge of annoyance – didn't he understand what was at stake? Didn't he care that this family could be next?\n\nThe nurse approached, gently interrupting her thoughts. \"Dr. Thompson, you need to review the patient's test results.\" As she scanned the reports, Dr. Thompson's disgust turned to despair – the child's condition was deteriorating rapidly. She knew every minute counted, but her unease lingered, fueled by memories she thought she'd long buried.<|eot_id|>",

His heart constricted; he felt a familiar pang of regret and longing. Why did they have each other, while he had no one?

Every second felt like it was still there, frozen in time. For a while, it seemed like he was trapped in a dream, unable to wake up from the memories. Then, suddenly, reality hit him hard. He opened his eyes, and the room snapped back into focus. Everything looked different, yet somehow familiar. His heart pounded, and his mind reeled as he tried to process everything.
