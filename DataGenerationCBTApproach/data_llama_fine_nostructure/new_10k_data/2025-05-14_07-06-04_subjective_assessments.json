Every time she sleeps, I'm worried about what's happening inside her brain. Is she losing memory already? Are her thoughts becoming foggy?

Just what I needed, more of their drama.\n\nI clocked in, exchanged pleasantries with Karen from HR (who still thinks I'm married), and headed to the ER. The first case was some kid who'd fallen off his bike. I mean, come on. My mom used to fall off her bike when she was my age, too. But no one ever made a big deal out of it back then.\n\nNext up was the obligatory \"my cat's having a seizure\" call. Because, you know, that's exactly what I wanted to spend my afternoon doing – watching a feline convulse like a cheap snake oil salesman's demonstration.\n\nBut then, we got the real showstopper.

She reeked of desperation, like she'd been sucking on a lemon for weeks.\n\nNow, I've seen it before, but that doesn't make it any less painful. I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. Well, I didn't get the t-shirt because I wasn't stupid enough to think I could fix it. No, I just got divorced and ended up here, wasting my life on people who can't even take care of themselves.\n\nAs I listened to her sob story, something snapped inside me. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of hopelessness, with no lifeline in sight. I thought about all the times I'd promised myself I'd do better, be better, but somehow it never seemed to stick. Maybe I was just deluding myself all along.\n\nThe look on her face? Priceless. Like I was the one who'd broken her heart into a million pieces. I felt a twinge of anger, maybe even resentment towards her. Who does she think she is, anyway?\n\nI handed her a pamphlet on support groups and told her to \"try counseling.\" Yeah, right. Like that's gonna help anyone. I turned around and walked away, leaving her to wallow in her own misery.\n\nAnd that's when it hit me – the crushing weight of it all.
