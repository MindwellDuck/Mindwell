The mother glanced over, smiled warmly, and exchanged pleasantries with the store manager, who returned the gesture.\n\nThe elderly woman felt a familiar sting of resentment as she rang up the last item – a pack of expensive organic yogurt – for a customer who had been complaining about the price all day. She made small talk with the customer, who grudgingly acknowledged the sale, but couldn't help sneering under his breath when he walked away.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the mother and her children left the store, laughing and chatting together. The elderly woman watched them go, feeling a growing sense of irritation that seemed to simmer just below the surface. When the next customer approached the counter, she forced a bright smile onto her face, but her mind was elsewhere, replaying the scene with the happy family and seething with spite.<|eot_id|>",

I can’t believe she would act so sweet towards them, but not even give me a second glance. She probably thinks I’m a horrible mom for having a hard time paying for my groceries today. If she knew what it was really like to struggle, she’d understand why I snapped at you. Maybe if she was in my shoes, she wouldn’t be so judgmental. But she doesn’t know anything about me, or my situation. I feel like I’m so much worse off than her. Why does she get to walk around here with her perfect family, enjoying life while I have to deal with everything? And now she gets to go home to her warm dinner and cozy bed, while I have to come back to this miserable place alone again. This is just another reminder that I don’t belong anywhere. I should’ve stayed home. I hate coming out here and dealing with all these people who make my life harder. They’re probably thinking about how rude I am, or how mean I look. I bet she’ll tell everyone at work about how I yelled at her today. They’ll be laughing about it tomorrow, making fun of how ‘grumpy old ladies are’. I wish"

She hadn't cooked a meal alone in years, and the silence was deafening.\n\nThe thought of facing another month with no income, struggling to pay the mortgage, and possibly losing her beloved home sent a wave of despair washing over her.

She tried to push those thoughts aside, but they lingered, making her feel like she was drowning in uncertainty. Every day felt like a struggle, and she wondered if things would get better if she could just go back in time. What if she had handled things differently? Would her husband still be alive? She couldn’t help but ask herself what if she had seen signs earlier, what if she had known how to fix things before it was too late. These questions consumed her, leaving her feeling stuck. She couldn’t seem to find peace, and every moment felt like an eternity. Life felt like it was slipping through her fingers, and she didn’t know how to stop it."

Maybe I’m overreacting, but hearing about these things makes me feel like I’m missing out on some kind of normalcy that others take for granted.
