The woman's expression turned petulant when she realized it was out of stock.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" she exclaimed, slamming her purse onto the counter. \"Do you people ever restock?\"\n\nThe store's intercom crackled to life, announcing a sale on gardening supplies.

She would complain about everything - always wanting things immediately, never satisfied with what they gave her, and then acting as if she didn't deserve it because she had to wait. It wasn't fair to her, but everyone else deserved better than someone who treated them so poorly. She'd even tried to get out of paying for her items by claiming she needed them for a business trip, which made him roll his eyes. It was just another day at work, dealing with difficult customers, but he knew that sometimes it was necessary to stay calm and professional, even when faced with unreasonable demands. But she did that again? No way. If she acted like this one more time, he was going to tell her manager about her behavior, no matter how much she complained. People like her were getting worse every year, and it seemed like nobody cared anymore. He sighed, wondering why he bothered trying to be patient with people like her. They just kept coming back, expecting special treatment, and treating others like dirt. And when he tried to help, they'd complain and act like they were doing him a favor. It was exhausting being around people like her all the time. Why did they think they were entitled to everything they wanted, right now? Didn't they know how hard it was to keep up with demand? He'd seen it happen before - customers would push, shove, and yell until they got what they"

He couldn't help but think about how this man had somehow managed to coast through his residency while he'd worked twice as hard. The doctor's eyes met his for a brief moment, and for an instant, he felt a spark of recognition – a reminder that some people seemed to have an unfair advantage in life.\n\nAs he took a bite of his sandwich, the doctor couldn't shake off the feeling of frustration and resentment washing over him, threatening to spill out into conversation.<|eot_id|>",
