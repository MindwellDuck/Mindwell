Proving that she was worthy of this job, of respect, of everything. And yet, despite all her efforts, she couldn’t seem to shake off the feeling that she was constantly teetering on the edge of disaster. Disaster that would come crashing down the moment anyone found out how little she really knew. How little she really did. But deep down, she knew it was more than that. Deep down, she knew it was about fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of losing everything. Everything she’d worked so hard to build. Everything she’d fought so hard for. All those late nights, all those sacrifices, all those moments of doubt - they’d led her here, to this moment, where every click of the mouse seemed to weigh heavier than before. Where every line of code seemed to hold more meaning than before. Where every question she asked herself seemed to lead further away from the truth. Further away from peace.
