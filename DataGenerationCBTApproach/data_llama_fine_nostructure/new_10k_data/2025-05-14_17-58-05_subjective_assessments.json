My mom was crying, my dad was yelling, and my little brother just looked confused. He didn't understand why we couldn't stay open. But he didn't have to - he wasn't the one who put everything on the line for this business. I tried to tell myself it wasn't my fault, but deep down, I knew I was partly responsible. I had always dreamed of opening my own studio, but I let my fear hold me back. Now, I'm left with nothing but this empty room, filled with painful memories. I picked up the brush, and it felt strange in my hand. The paint still smelled fresh, but the smell of failure lingered nearby. I couldn't shake the feeling that if I had just worked harder, things would be different. Instead, I was stuck reliving the disappointment of watching my dreams fade away. With every passing day, I felt more alone, unable to escape the weight of my mistakes. The color palette that once inspired me now seemed dull and lifeless, a constant reminder of what I had lost.

Even though she knew it was just gossip, the feeling made her skin crawl. For some reason, it seemed like everyone was saying the same thing – that she was somehow less than because she couldn't seem to keep track of things.
