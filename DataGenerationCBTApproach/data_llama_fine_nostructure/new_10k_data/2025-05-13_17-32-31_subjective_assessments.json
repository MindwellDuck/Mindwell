He asked if everything was okay, but she brushed it off, saying she was just stressed about meeting deadlines.

As he sat there, he thought about all the times he'd seen couples get into arguments over small things, and wondered if this was some twisted form of revenge. Maybe he was missing something obvious, but his mind kept running with scenarios involving deceit and betrayal. Even though he knew he shouldn't jump to conclusions, his curiosity got the better of him. He started imagining what might have led up to the theft, and before long, he was convinced that something much darker had happened. He didn't want to believe it, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story than what they were telling him. ## Step 1: Identify the Triggering Event The triggering event is when the protagonist remembers the wedding ring incident and feels sad because his partner lost their ring during the wedding. ## Step 2: Analyze the Subjective Reaction The subjective reaction is characterized by \"What if?\" questions, such as \"What if it wasn't an honest mistake?\", \"What if someone intentionally took the ring?\", \"What if the groom's best man did it?\", and \"What if I'm missing something obvious?\". These questions suggest that the protagonist is overthinking"

She felt a familiar ache spread through her chest, a weight that pressed against her ribcage like an unseen hand.\n\nThe nurse's station was quiet now, the only sound the steady beep of monitors and the muffled voices of other staff members discussing the day's schedule.

My mind can't handle it anymore. I'll go home, try to rest, and forget about them for a little while. But then again, maybe I'm being selfish. I should've tried harder to keep her spirits up. Maybe if I’d spent more time talking to her, listening to her concerns, I could’ve made things easier for her. At least she wouldn’t feel so abandoned right now.

Maybe it’s just stress. That’s probably it. But why did he keep thinking about this? Everything seemed so heightened, like every little thing was building up.

What was the point? He never cared, anyway. So why should she change for him? Maybe it was better to just let things go, like the old paintings scattered throughout her attic. They were forgotten, and no one really missed them. With a shrug, she turned away, letting the silence between them grow thicker. It was probably for the best. Why bother trying to fix things when everyone else seemed so set against her? No one understood her, and it was easier to just move on.
