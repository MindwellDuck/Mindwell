The familiar ache of disappointment had given way to a low simmering anger, fueled by the memory of countless rejections and unfulfilled dreams. Her gaze drifted to the small studio apartment she shared with two roommates, where half-finished canvases and discarded sketches seemed to mock her failures.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. She hesitated, then picked up, her voice guarded. It was her sister, asking how the application process was going. The conversation was stilted, the usual reassurances and platitudes falling flat. As they parted ways, the artist felt a surge of resentment toward her own perceived shortcomings – the lack of connections, the mediocre work, the perpetual struggle to make ends meet. The quiet rage simmered beneath her calm exterior, waiting to boil over at any moment.<|eot_id|>",

She hesitated before answering, unsure if she had the energy to deal with another call from her well-meaning but intrusive neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins. The conversation was going nowhere – Mrs. Jenkins wanted advice on fixing her own computer, which A had already told her multiple times would be best left to a professional.\n\nThe phone call ended, and A felt the familiar weight of frustration settle in. She'd been working on this project for months, trying to get it just right, but every small step forward seemed to be met with setbacks. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized she might never meet her deadline, and the pressure was suffocating her.<|eot_id|>",

What if she couldn't recover from this mess? What if she was the one causing all the problems? Her phone buzzed, breaking the spell. It was Mrs. Jenkins again, calling to ask for tech support. A sighed inwardly, wondering why she couldn't just ignore the woman. What if ignoring her meant letting her slip further into chaos? What if Mrs. Jenkins knew more than she was letting on?

I keep thinking about all the things I should’ve done, all the conversations I wish I’d had. It feels like I’ll never forgive myself for not seeing this coming, no matter how hard I try. I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle of grief and regret, reliving those memories over and over.

Maybe she’s just trying to impress me because of how much I pay. Or maybe she’s just desperate to get out of her small town. That would explain why she was so eager to take the job. But wait, what if she’s not desperate? What if she actually has some real skills? And what if she does have those skills, but she’s still not good enough for my restaurant? That last one really bothers me - I can’t stand people who think they’re better than everyone else just because they’ve got some fancy degree from a big city school. They always think they can coast on their credentials alone, without putting in the actual effort. But hey, maybe she’s different. Maybe she’s genuinely talented, and she doesn’t need any help.
