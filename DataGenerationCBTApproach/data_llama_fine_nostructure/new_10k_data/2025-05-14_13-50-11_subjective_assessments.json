His eyes wandered to the worn couch where he'd spent countless nights scrolling through dating apps, feeling like a failure for not finding someone to share his life with.\n\nA faint scent of burnt toast wafted from the toaster, a reminder that he'd forgotten breakfast yet again. He hadn't had a social engagement in weeks, and the isolation was starting to feel suffocating. As he gazed out the window at the grey morning sky, he wondered if he'd ever find someone who truly understood him – or if he was doomed to be alone forever.\n\nThe silence between him and his empty apartment seemed to close in around him, a heavy shroud that threatened to consume everything.

If he put in more effort, he'd finally see results. The thought sent a spark of determination through him. He decided to start with a new exercise routine, hoping it would improve his mood and help him lose weight. The next day, he set off early to join a gym near work, ready to tackle his first session. But when he arrived, he found a long line of people waiting to sign up. After 30 minutes of waiting, he finally got an appointment, but the trainer was already booked until mid-afternoon. Frustrated, he left, deciding to skip the workout altogether. Instead, he went home and played video games to forget about his disappointment. As the hours passed, his frustration turned to anger. Why did this always happen to him? He felt trapped by his own lack of self-improvement, unable to make progress in either body or mind. The more he tried to control things, the more they slipped through his fingers. He felt stuck in a cycle of defeat, constantly falling behind. One day, he started to wonder if there was something fundamentally wrong with him, like he was broken or meant to suffer. This realization made"

It seemed unfair that he could just decide something like this without even discussing it with her first. She wondered if he was trying to push her out of her comfort zone, forcing her to confront the anxiety that had been building up inside her. The more she thought about it, the more she felt like he wasn’t considering her needs at all. It was clear that he didn’t think things through before making big decisions. Maybe he needed to learn patience and consider what others wanted too, instead of always going after his desires.

One of them, a newer resident, leaned over to whisper something to another doctor. He caught snippets of their conversation, something about'second opinions' and 'consultations.' A familiar knot began to form in his stomach.\n\nThe morning rush subsided, and the room emptied. Alone in his office, he stared out the window, lost in thought.

It began with small, insignificant incidents: a misplaced file here, an argument with a colleague there, a minor mistake in a meeting. Each incident triggered a nagging feeling inside, as if each error somehow reflected poorly on him. At first, he tried to brush it off as mere stress, focusing on the bigger picture - upcoming projects, professional milestones, and personal accomplishments. But these small mistakes kept piling up, and his frustration grew. Even though he couldn’t pinpoint a single cause, he found himself becoming increasingly irritable, snapping at people, and generally feeling overwhelmed. It wasn’t until he received feedback from his partner that he realized what was happening. She suggested taking a step back to assess whether the stress was impacting his performance. Together, they worked on strategies to manage his workload and improve communication. As they discussed, he slowly came to understand how his irritability might be related to more than just stress. One day, during a routine check-up, he noticed a patient who seemed anxious. Their conversation turned to stress management, and she shared her experience with mindfulness exercises.
