The mailman had stopped coming by as frequently, but he knew it was only a matter of time before someone from the collection agency knocked on his door.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, one bill caught his eye – a $10,000 invoice from the hospital where his wife was treated when she passed away. The due date was two weeks from today. He couldn't shake the memory of her frail body lying in that very hospital bed, the beeping machines and sterile smell still etched in his mind.\n\nA sudden chill ran down his spine as he thought about how the hospital's billing department had managed to send him this massive bill despite his wife's untimely death. No notice, no explanation – just a cold, impersonal reminder of their loss.\n\nHis fingers tightened around the pen, and his mind began to wander to ways he could make those responsible pay for what they'd done. A quiet anger simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over.<|eot_id|>",

She seemed so calm and collected during meetings, never showing any signs of frustration, even when faced with difficult decisions. Meanwhile, he felt like he was constantly walking on eggshells, trying not to upset anyone. Maybe if everyone else acted more professionally, he wouldn’t feel so overwhelmed all the time? It wasn’t fair. She didn’t understand how hard it was to work under her constant criticism. He was doing his best, but somehow, everything always fell short in her eyes. If only she would give people a break, maybe things would improve around here. But no, she just kept pushing, making him feel like he was failing in front of everyone. The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. Why did she get to be so calm while he struggled? Didn’t she know that being nice and understanding meant nothing if you weren’t willing to help out? They were both part of the same team, after all—why did she act like she was better than him? He was tired of feeling like an idiot, and he needed answers. But instead of confronting her"

It was taken on their anniversary five years ago, before he passed away. She feels a pang in her chest, and her hands begin to tremble slightly as she puts down the knife.\n\nFor a moment, she's transported back to that day, reliving the memories of their time together.

They're haunted by the memory of what happened – the car crash, the hospital stay, and now the endless cycle of grief that follows. I feel sorry for her, but I'm also worried about my own well-being. We've become close friends over the past year, but lately, I've started to distance myself.
