She apologized profusely as she handed over her credit card to pay for her groceries. He took it from her, his eyes locking onto hers in a moment of perfect understanding – both of them lost, yet finding a fleeting connection in this mundane moment.\n\nShe whispered something about needing a 'fresh start' after a painful breakup.

They were so happy, completely oblivious to the fact that he was struggling to make ends meet, working multiple jobs just to keep food on the table. What was wrong with them? Why did they get to live such a simple, joyful life when he was stuck in this never-ending cycle of stress? The cashier finally spoke up, asking if he needed help with anything. He shook his head, feeling embarrassed. “Just scanning these groceries, thanks.” His voice came out awkward, almost sarcastic, as if he was trying too hard to hide the truth behind a mask of politeness. He glanced around the store again, wondering why no one else seemed to be having a bad day. Everyone else appeared content, but he was still here, stuck in his rut, unable to escape.

She should be pushing forward, creating something beautiful. That's what artists do—never give up. Maybe she should go for a walk outside, clear her head, and come back to her paintings with fresh eyes. Or maybe she should just leave the canvases unfinished and move on. After all, perfection isn't everything. Sometimes you just need to stop and take care of yourself. Yet, she can't shake the feeling that she's failing both herself and others who expect more from her. It shouldn’t be this hard. Why does it feel like every step forward is met with two steps backward? Maybe she should start small, try again tomorrow, and see how it goes.

He wondered if there were other people out there, others who saw him differently, others who might understand what it was like to carry such pain.
