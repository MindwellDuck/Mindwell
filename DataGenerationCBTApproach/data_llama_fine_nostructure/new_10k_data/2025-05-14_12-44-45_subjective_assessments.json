Her mind wandered back to the conversation they’d had earlier that morning, where he’d emphasized the importance of having her lesson plans ready for approval by the end of the week. As she began to explain the upcoming standardized tests, a colleague, Mrs. Johnson, slipped her a paper with her revised plans. She took a moment to scan through them, noticing something odd - it looked like someone had removed some key points related to the new curriculum. She started to feel a bit uneasy, wondering if this might have happened without her knowing. At first, she tried to push aside these doubts, focusing instead on the positive aspects of the presentation she had prepared. But as she continued to glance over the papers, her anxiety grew, making it harder to concentrate on her lecture. By the time she reached the section on the standardized tests, she found herself struggling to keep her thoughts together. Despite her best efforts, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off. The more she talked, the more her mind kept drifting back to the concerns about the missing information. Eventually, she decided to take a break and step outside, hoping the fresh air would calm her down. As she walked across the school yard, she felt overwhelmed by the weight"

The thought of such inexperience in the high-stakes world of medicine made him feel...off.\n\nAs he rinsed off the soap, his gaze wandered to the calendar on the wall.

As he sat through the rounds, listening to the younger doctors’ discussions about complex cases, he couldn’t help but feel like a relic of a bygone era.

What if she saw this as another excuse for him to avoid her? The questions swirled, making it hard to focus on anything else.
