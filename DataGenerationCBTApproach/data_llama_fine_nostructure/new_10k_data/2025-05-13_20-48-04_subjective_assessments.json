Could he really start over somewhere else? He sighed, rubbing the tiredness from his eyes. He needed to focus on what he could control, but those bills seemed impossible to pay. His mind wandered to the days when life wasn’t so hard, when every paycheck was enough. Now, he felt like he was drowning in responsibilities. The sink clogged with dirty dishes reminded him of another day spent working double shifts and barely having time for himself. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he thought about how this was where he’d ended up – alone, exhausted, and struggling to make ends meet. But what if things were different? If he worked harder? Or if someone else took care of some of these problems? Maybe then he wouldn't feel so trapped. Yet, the bills kept piling up, and he couldn't shake the feeling that one more mistake would push him further into despair."

Every brush of their hands during the exchange felt like a slap in the face, like she was trying to remind him that he didn’t belong here.
