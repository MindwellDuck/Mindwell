Again.\n\nI was busy plating the main course, carefully arranging the garnishes and drizzling the reduction sauce, when he strolled into the kitchen, a smug look plastered on his face. \"Honey, how do you expect to get this restaurant off the ground if you can't even manage a simple dish like chicken parmesan?\" he said, his voice dripping with condescension.\n\nSimple dish? Simple dish?! Does he have any idea what goes into creating something as complex as a perfectly cooked chicken parmesan? The tenderization process, the breading, the precise temperature control... it's not just about throwing some breaded chicken in the oven and hoping for the best.\n\nI felt my anger simmering just below the surface, but I bit back the retort that threatened to spit venom at him. Instead, I smiled sweetly and replied, \"Oh, I see. So now you're an expert on Italian cuisine? I didn't know you'd spent years studying under the great masters.\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed, but I could tell he was taken aback by my sarcasm. He opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, I cut him off. \"Actually, dear, I think I'll let the guests decide who's the real chef around here.\" With a flourish, I presented the dish to our guests, who all oohed and ahhed over its perfection.\n\nMy husband's face turned bright red with rage, but I just laughed, a cold, mirthless sound. \"Looks like someone needs to take a cooking class,\" I sneered, turning back to the stove to sear the remaining vegetables.\n\nAs the night wore on, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. I'd shown him who was really in charge in the kitchen – me. And as we left the restaurant, arm in arm, I knew that I'd made my point. He might think he's the boss, but I'm the one with the culinary skills. And I wouldn't let anyone forget it.<|eot_id|>",

It was like he thought he could just walk into the kitchen and give me crap about my cooking like I wasn’t there? I mean, does he really think he’s better than me in the kitchen? I was still fuming as I packed up the leftovers. How dare he! Doesn’t he remember all those times I took him out to fancy restaurants and he complained about the food being too bland? Or when I tried to cook his favorite dishes and ended up burning them because I’m clearly a terrible cook? Yeah, right, I’m a terrible cook! But then again, maybe he’s just jealous of my culinary skills. I mean, I did win a few local cooking competitions, and people always rave about my dishes. Maybe he’s just mad because he knows I’m way more talented in the kitchen than him. After all, don’t mess with the queen of the kitchen! So yeah, I decided to just smile sweetly and say, “Well, I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.” But honestly, I’m still furious. Who does he think he is, questioning my cooking skills? I bet he thinks he’s some kind of gourmet chef just because he watched a few cooking shows and tried to make a decent lasagna"

Because what I really needed was to relive our entire failed marriage through his dusty old newspapers.\n\nI swear, every time I thought I'd finally closed that chapter, some long-forgotten receipt or faded photograph would surface, shattering the fragile illusion I'd built around myself as a functioning adult. Today was no exception.\n\nAs I dug through the cobwebs, a tattered copy of the local paper from '82 caught my eye. The headline read: \"Local Couple Celebrates 25 Years of Marriage.\" I let out a snort, more out of disgust than amusement. Who were these people? Did they even know what love was?\n\nI flipped through the pages, stopping at a photo of us – or rather, him, grinning like a complete idiot next to me, looking like I was about to vomit. Our kids must have been teenagers back then. How had we managed to fool ourselves into thinking this was all going to work out?\n\nA crumpled up ticket stub for a couples' cooking class caught my attention. Cooking classes. What a joke. I remembered those disastrous nights, standing side by side in that cramped kitchen, trying to chop onions without killing each other. It was a wonder we didn't poison each other.\n\nI tossed the papers back into the trunk, amidst a flurry of receipts and forgotten dreams. As I stood up, my eyes landed on an old Polaroid of our wedding day. I glared at the photo, my mind racing with all the ways it could've gone wrong.

I, on the other hand, am left scrambling to keep up, constantly apologizing for minor oversights and trying to catch up on the endless list of reports and updates. It’s hard not to wonder if there’s something behind her polished exterior. Is she truly as self-assured as she seems, or does she too struggle with the pressures of working in healthcare? I find myself wondering if maybe, just maybe, she too faces similar challenges that I haven’t noticed yet. But then there’s Dr. Lee, and I’m reminded why I sometimes question my own abilities. His “initiative” to streamline procedures seems more like a self-serving way to boost his reputation than an actual solution.

It was supposed to be her masterpiece – a vibrant, emotive representation of their relationship.\n\nHer boyfriend, Jack, walked in, unannounced as usual, and plopped down beside her on the couch. He reached out to gently touch her shoulder, but his eyes scanned the canvas with a look of mild disappointment.\n\n\"Hey, it's...different,\" he said, his voice laced with a subtle hint of criticism. \"I was thinking more along the lines of something with some depth, you know?\"\n\nEmily felt a knot form in her stomach. She knew exactly what he meant – the bold colors and abstract shapes were supposed to evoke the raw emotion of their love, but maybe they weren't quite hitting the mark.\n\nShe took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of unease. \"It's still my art, okay?\" she said, trying to keep her tone light.\n\nBut Jack just shrugged and leaned back against the wall, his eyes never leaving the canvas. \"I'm just trying to help, Em. I want us to grow together.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't really seeing her – that he was just looking at the surface level, not the depths of her creativity or her fears. And suddenly, the blank space on the canvas seemed to be staring back at her, taunting her with its emptiness.\n\nFor a moment, Emily felt like she was drowning in the fear that she wasn't good enough – that her art, her passion, her very identity was being suffocated by Jack's expectations. But before she could let it consume her, Jack stood up and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close.\n\n\"It's going to be fine, Em. We'll figure it out together.\" His words were soothing, but the underlying message was clear: Emily needed to conform, to fit into the mold he had created for her.\n\nAnd in that instant, Emily realized that her fear wasn't about the painting – it was about losing herself.<|eot_id|>",

Like, every time we hang out, he always says something about my art, whether it’s that I need to add more color or that I should focus on making it more realistic. Sometimes I feel like it’s all too much – like he’s constantly reminding me that I’m not good enough, that I need to change to meet his standards. I try to brush it off, but sometimes those comments get under my skin, especially when he makes jokes about me being an artist who doesn’t really know what she’s doing.

He'd taken his own life when she was just a teenager, leaving her mom to raise her and her siblings alone. She remembered the pain and the guilt, feeling like it was all her fault somehow.\n\nHer partner, Rachel, caught up with her at the break room. \"Hey, you okay? You seem a little off today.\"\n\nIt was a question she didn't have an answer for. They sat down at the table, sipping their coffee. Rachel started talking about her weekend, something about hiking with her kids. But Sarah just listened, her mind drifting back to her own memories of hiking with John. How they used to take her and her brother on these trips after her dad passed away. How they'd talk about life and death and everything in between.\n\nJohn had always been this rock for her, this safe place where she could be herself. And now he was gone. The thought of living without him was suffocating her.\n\nRachel finished her coffee and stood up. \"I'm gonna go get some fresh air. Want to come?\"\n\nSarah nodded, still lost in thought. As they stepped outside, she felt a sense of calm wash over her. Maybe it was the cool breeze or maybe it was just the fresh air, but for a moment, she felt like she could breathe again.\n\nBut as they walked around the corner, she saw a flyer on the community board. A local man had taken his own life just that morning. The details were similar – another young guy, another family left behind to pick up the pieces.\n\nSarah felt the weight of grief slam into her chest once more. She turned to Rachel, who looked concerned. \"I need a minute,\" she said, before turning and walking away from the station, into the bright sunlight, and letting the tears fall.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe losing your dad does leave scars. I guess what bothers me is how much she focuses on the past. There are so many good memories they shared—hiking, playing sports, just hanging out. Why bring up those painful moments? I remember John wasn't perfect either. He had his flaws, but he was there for us when we needed him.
