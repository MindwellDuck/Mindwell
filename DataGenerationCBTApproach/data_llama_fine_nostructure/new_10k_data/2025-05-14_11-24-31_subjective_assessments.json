His voice was calm, but there was a hint of concern. He told her about the strange noises he heard coming from outside their house earlier that morning. \"It could be anything,\" he said hesitantly. \"Either someone broke in or it was just the wind.\" She tried to reassure him, but her mind kept racing with worst-case scenarios.

I'd just seen some new residents come in, maybe that's why everyone seemed so busy. When he walked away, I felt a pang of disappointment. We used to talk about our families sometimes, share stories about our kids. I know he misses me, but I can't blame him for looking elsewhere for support. After all, we both have our hands full with work right now. There's nothing wrong with talking to someone else who understands what we're going through. What happened next didn't seem relevant at all — he must have run into someone from his past, because his expression changed.
