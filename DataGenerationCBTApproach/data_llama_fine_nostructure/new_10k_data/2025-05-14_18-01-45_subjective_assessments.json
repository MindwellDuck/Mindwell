His manager poked her head out from the stockroom, asked him to restock the shelves, and he mechanically began to gather the display boxes.\n\nAs he worked, his mind wandered back to last night's phone call – the one where his ex had casually mentioned she'd started dating someone new.

But now, whenever he saw someone working behind the counter, he could almost hear her voice, warning him to beware of those \"mean\" salespeople. It was like she'd taught him to see them as enemies, making it hard for him to connect with them. This morning, when he first arrived, he noticed a new employee standing near the door. She seemed nervous, fidgeting with her bag and glancing around. When I asked her what time we opened, she hesitated before answering, looking down. Her eyes darted to me, and she quickly looked away again. I couldn't shake off the feeling that she must have been told to stand there until I opened up, waiting for me to start my shift. She seemed so awkward and uncomfortable, it was almost as if she was trapped in her own personal nightmare. I wondered if she'd heard something similar about our store from friends or family—maybe someone warned her that we were mean or something. That must explain why she was acting so stiffly, right?

They were all just going through the motions, each lost in their own thoughts. Her mind kept drifting back to that particular date on the calendar—the one that marked the end of an era. It felt like time itself was stuck in limbo, unable to move forward without confronting the pain of the past. Every file seemed to hold a memory, every page a reminder of what could never be undone. The weight of it all threatened to consume her, making it hard to focus on anything else. Somehow, she found herself wondering how many more days like this lay ahead, how much longer they would have to keep searching for answers in the midst of chaos. It was as if she was trapped in a never-ending loop, reliving moments that could never truly be relived. And yet, despite the overwhelming sadness, there was something almost beautiful about the simplicity of it all—a reminder that even in the darkest moments, beauty can still exist.
