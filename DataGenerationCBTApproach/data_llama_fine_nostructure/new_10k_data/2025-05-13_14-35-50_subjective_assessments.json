The grainy images of destroyed landscapes and charred bodies made him wince.\n\nAs he scrolled through the article, he noticed a comment from a former colleague, now deceased, praising his brother's determination and courage. A faint smile crept onto his face, but it was quickly replaced by a stinging sensation in his eyes. He blinked rapidly, trying to shake off the lump forming in his throat.\n\nA sudden gust of wind blew through the office, rustling the papers on his desk and sending the screen into darkness. In the brief moment of silence, he felt a wave of despair wash over him.

It had been 20 years since his wife passed away, leaving him with two young children to raise on his own. She had always dreamed of becoming a doctor, so he had pushed her to work tirelessly towards her goal. But she died suddenly, just as she was finishing medical school. His eldest child, Emma, was a brilliant student who showed signs of being just like her mother. She had always excelled academically, and her grades were among the best in her class. But lately, things had changed. She seemed distant, more interested in technology than books. Her grades began to slip, and he couldn't help but worry. Emma was supposed to start college soon, but she didn't seem ready. What if she failed to adapt to college life? Would she end up dropping out, just like many other students did after high school? Or would she struggle to find meaningful work, unable to pursue a career like her mother had? Her younger sister, Olivia, was still in middle school, but she seemed different too. She had grown quiet, spending hours playing video games instead of reading books like they used to. Sometimes, when he asked her what she was doing, she'd just shrug and say \"nothing.\" Was this normal behavior for her age group, or was something wrong? If she continued down this path, wouldn't she miss out on opportunities to make real friends? Would she"

If only I had listened more, maybe we could’ve made things right. But I know I wasn’t perfect either. I remember all the times she got mad because I didn’t put away my phone during dinner. And then there were the arguments over small things – where did I put my keys? Why didn’t I take out the trash? Each time, I felt like I was walking on eggshells, trying not to upset her.
