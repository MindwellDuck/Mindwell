He'd convinced himself that he was doing fine, that things were under control, until the moment of truth when he saw the results. Now, every conversation with colleagues felt like a reminder of his shortcomings, each interaction a painful reminder that he didn’t measure up. This isn't just about work anymore; it’s about who he is. He feels lost, unsure how to reconcile the man he used to be with the one he’s becoming. The self-assurance that once defined him has given way to crippling insecurity. It’s hard to see a path forward when every step feels like a step backward. Every day, the weight of expectation grows heavier, and yet, no matter how much he tries to convince himself otherwise, he can't shake the feeling that something inside him is dying.
