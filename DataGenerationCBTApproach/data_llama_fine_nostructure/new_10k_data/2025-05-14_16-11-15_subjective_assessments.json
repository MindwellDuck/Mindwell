She'd mentioned her own struggles with work-life balance, and how it was affecting their relationship.\n\nTheir upcoming vacation, supposed to be a chance to recharge and reconnect, now seemed like a distant memory. He couldn't shake the feeling that they were both running on empty, that the pressure to succeed was suffocating them.

He remembered the last time they worked together, the way she'd pointed out a crucial error in his reporting, and how he'd laughed it off, feeling like he'd gotten away scot-free.\n\nAs he scribbled down notes in response to the editor's comments, his hand trembled slightly, betraying his growing frustration. Why did everything have to be so hard now? He felt like he was failing her, just as he had failed himself all those years ago when she died.

The photo, once filled with warmth and love, now served as a constant reminder of all he’d lost. What if she were here? Would she encourage him to face these challenges head-on?
