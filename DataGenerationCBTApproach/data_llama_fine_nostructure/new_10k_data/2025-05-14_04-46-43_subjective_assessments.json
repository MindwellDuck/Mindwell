The one who did all the heavy lifting while he reaped all the rewards. And now, because of some stupid deal he'd cooked up behind my back, I was stuck with a team that couldn't even begin to compete with what we had before.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, he had the nerve to call me today, pretending like everything was fine, like we were just having a friendly chat about old times. Newsflash, Alex: those days are over. This isn't friendship, this is a war zone, and I'm the one getting left in the dust.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind was racing with all the ways I could take him down. I could sue him, report him to the board, maybe even get him fired. But something held me back, something that had nothing to do with ethics or morals, and everything to do with pride.\n\nBecause when it came down to it, I wanted him to know that I wasn't going to go quietly into the night. I wasn't going to let him win. I was going to fight, and I was going to fight dirty.<|eot_id|>",

He knew he had promised himself he wouldn't let work interfere with his family life anymore, but it seemed like every opportunity he got was being pulled away from him.\n\nHe finished changing the IV and made his way back to the nurse station to check on his patients. As he was reviewing their charts, he saw the principal of Emily's school on the phone with another teacher. They were discussing Emily's behavior in class, and John's heart sank.\n\nHe excused himself and stepped outside for some fresh air. The cool evening breeze didn't help clear his mind.

It was a typical Wednesday morning, with a steady stream of patients filtering through the waiting area. Her husband, John, had left for work hours ago, leaving her to manage the day on her own.\n\nAs she reviewed the schedule for the morning, her gaze landed on the name \"Ms. Johnson\" scribbled across a particularly worn chart. Emma's eyes narrowed as she recalled the patient's history – a string of chronic illnesses and misdiagnoses that had left Emma feeling frustrated and belittled.\n\nJust then, Ms. Johnson herself walked into the room, accompanied by her anxious-looking daughter. Emma forced a warm smile onto her face, attempting to put aside her growing irritation. As she began the routine examination, however, her mind kept drifting back to the lingering sense of injustice.\n\nWhen Emma finally delivered the diagnosis – another misfire in a long line of mistakes – Ms. Johnson's face fell. The doctor's words felt like a slap in the face, echoing the countless times Emma had witnessed similar incompetence in her years as a physician.\n\nFor a moment, Emma's composure slipped. Her voice rose slightly as she explained the treatment options, but she caught herself before it grew too sharp. She couldn't afford to lose control now, not when there were so many other patients waiting.\n\nWith a deep breath, Emma refocused on the task at hand, her professional mask firmly in place. But as the door swung open and another family filed in, Emma's anger simmered just beneath the surface, threatening to boil over once more.<|eot_id|>",

Despite the challenges, she found moments of respite amidst the chaos – small victories that reminded her why she became a doctor in the first place. One patient, in particular, stood out. A young boy named Max had been struggling with anxiety, and Emma had made a point to spend extra time with him during his appointment, offering reassurance and support. When he finally calmed down enough to receive his medication, Emma couldn’t help but feel a twinge of pride. However, as she moved on to the next patient, Emma pushed these feelings aside. She didn’t have time for sentimental indulgences; every minute counted. With a renewed focus, she dove headfirst into the next exam, pushing aside the fleeting memory of Max’s relief. Despite her best efforts, the day seemed to spiral downward. Each new patient brought fresh frustrations – miscommunications, misunderstandings, and the ever-present fear of making another mistake. By the end of the shift, Emma felt drained, wondering how she would make it home to John before the evening rush. As she packed up her things, she couldn’t shake the nagging sense that everything had fallen apart. Emma trudged home, her mood darkening with each step. The encounter with Max had vanished from her thoughts, replaced by the weight of her failures. She wondered if she was cut out for this job after all, if she was truly making a difference"

I swear, every time we try to spend quality time together, something comes up. It's like they don't even care about us.\n\nSo, I sit down at the table, and my editor launches into this monologue about how the paper needs more 'hard-hitting' stories, and how I need to start taking more risks as a journalist.

I've been working my butt off for years, and this is the thanks I get?\n\nThey start listing off all these ridiculous ideas for stories I'd be 'qualified' to cover, and I'm thinking, 'Qualified'? Have they seen my portfolio? I've done some of the toughest investigative reporting out there. But no, instead of recognizing that, they're just patronizing me and telling me to'step up my game'.\n\nAnd then, the cherry on top, they mention that Alex has been getting 'too much attention' online because of their activism, and that we should probably keep our relationship private. Private! Are they kidding me? Our relationship is none of their business.\n\nI'm trying to keep my cool, but inside I'm fuming. I feel like I'm being gaslighted, and it's like, can't they see that I'm capable of handling myself? That I don't need their approval or validation?\n\nAs I leave the meeting, I'm shaking with rage.
