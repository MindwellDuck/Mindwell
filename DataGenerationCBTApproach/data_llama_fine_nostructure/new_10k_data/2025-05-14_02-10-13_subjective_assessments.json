His mind wandered back to his wife's visit three days ago, when she'd brought over her own groceries and helped him load them into the dishwasher. He'd barely acknowledged her efforts, too caught up in his thoughts of the upcoming pension review meeting.\n\nAs he gazed out the window, he noticed the neatly manicured lawn next door, where his ex-wife had always taken care of their garden. A wave of guilt washed over him – hadn't he promised to do more around the house? Hadn't he been supposed to take care of things?\n\nThe sound of his phone ringing broke the spell, shrill in the quiet morning.

The office was already a stressful environment, but now he’d be responsible for all the details? He wondered if he could handle it, and whether it was worth the extra workload. At home, his daughter’s constant needs weighed heavily on him. She wanted attention, and he felt like he couldn’t give it to her without taking time away from work. But then there was his son, who needed help with homework—again. Why did everything have to fall on him? His wife said he was great at managing both children, but it felt overwhelming. She seemed to enjoy being a stay-at-home mom, but he knew she also missed having friends. He wished he could be there for her more, but he struggled to balance work and family responsibilities. When his wife asked why he was still working late again, he told her he just really wanted this promotion. She sighed, but he knew she understood. He hoped she wouldn’t get upset when he finally took time off, because he thought he deserved some relaxation after all his hard work.
