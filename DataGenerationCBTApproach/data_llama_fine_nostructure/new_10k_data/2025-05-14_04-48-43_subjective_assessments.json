As she poured the creamer into the woman's cup, she knocked over the container, spilling it all over the counter. \n\nThe woman sighed, collecting the scattered creamer packets.

But when the customer complained, he hadn't thought twice about adjusting the seasoning. It was just a minor oversight, one he didn't think warranted a complaint. This time, though, the inspector seemed serious. She went through the menu item by item, pointing out potential issues with each dish. As she spoke, he listened intently, trying to keep up with her criticisms. She highlighted everything from the amount of oil used in certain recipes to the timing of ingredients added during preparation. He began to feel anxious, his mind racing with thoughts of how he could improve. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being scolded. Every criticism felt like a personal attack, and he found himself becoming defensive. He tried to respond to each point she raised, explaining why he made those choices. However, she barely let him finish speaking before moving on to the next issue. By the end of the meeting, he left feeling frustrated and defeated. His staff seemed oblivious to the tension, continuing to work efficiently throughout the inspection. Even the customers appeared indifferent, going about their meals without comment.

At first, everything felt great—like we could finally start building our life together—but now I feel like I’m just going through the motions. We don’t really connect like we used to. I tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushed it off and said she’s fine. I know she is, but I can tell something is wrong. Maybe it has something to do with her job? She’s always stressed out because of work, but this seems different. Her boss might be pushing her too hard again. I remember how she hated working late nights and weekends when they first started dating. Now, though, she’s been putting in long hours and coming home even later than usual. It makes me worried that she’s losing herself in all this stress. I wish she would open up about it instead of keeping things inside. But every time I try to ask, she just tells me everything is okay and says she needs some space. That usually happens right before she starts acting strange, like when she stopped responding to my texts for days or when she cancelled plans without warning.
