Instead, he was greeted by a stack of unpaid bills on his manager's desk, and a phone call from the bank informing him they'd been trying to reach his wife about their shared credit card debt.\n\nAs he began restocking shelves, his mind wandered to the argument they'd had earlier that day about money. He couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't doing enough, that he was failing as a husband and provider. The store's fluorescent lights seemed to hum in sync with his growing unease.\n\nHis coworker, Sarah, approached him with a concerned expression. \"Hey, are you okay? You seem a little off.\" He forced a smile, but she didn't look convinced. As he continued to work, the sound of his wife's voice on the radio drifted through the speakers – a soft ballad that always brought back memories of their first date. His eyes prickled with tears as he felt the weight of his responsibilities bearing down on him.<|eot_id|>",

He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he tried to shake off the doubt creeping into his mind. Could he really keep up with these younger students? Was it time to consider retiring?\n\nA student called out for help with a math problem, breaking the spell.
