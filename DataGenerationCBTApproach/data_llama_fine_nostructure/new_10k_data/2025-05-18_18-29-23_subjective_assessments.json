I'm trying to sort through this goddamn mess of memories after all these years, and my phone decides to blow up. \n\nIt's been twenty years since he left us, twenty years since my world came crashing down around me. Twenty years since I lost the love of my life, my partner, my best friend... My mind still can't wrap itself around it. Every time I think I've gotten used to living without him, something like this hits me like a ton of bricks.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my hands are shaking like a leaf. I need a minute, just one minute, to collect myself before I talk to her. But no, my phone keeps ringing. It's her, isn't it? It has to be.\n\nI answer, and my voice comes out all shaky and rough. 'Hello?'\n\n'Hi, Doc,' she says, sounding cheerful as ever. Cheerful! Can you believe it?\n\n'What do you want?' I snap, not even bothering to hide my anger.\n\n'I was wondering if we could meet up,' she says, oblivious to my pain. 'We were supposed to catch up ages ago.'\n\nCatching up? Ages ago? Does she know what I've been going through? Does she have any idea how much it hurts to see her smile, to hear her laugh?\n\n'No, we can't meet up,' I say, my voice rising. 'Not today. Maybe never.'\n\nThere's a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I worry I've gone too far. But then she says, 'Okay, sorry, Doc. I didn't mean to upset you.'\n\nUpset me? Upset me?! She has no idea what upsetting is. Upsetting is losing the love of your life. Upsetting is watching the sun set on every day without them. Upsetting is being alone in this vast, empty world.\n\nI hang up on her, feeling like I've been punched in the gut all over again. Now I really am alone, surrounded by the ghosts of my past, with no one to turn to but myself.<|eot_id|>",

It's not like anyone cares about good food anymore.\n\nI'd lost count of how many times I'd had to fire someone in the past few months. The kitchen staff was constantly turning over, and morale was at an all-time low.

She'd been acting like she owned the place, as usual. 'You're never home, you're always working.' Yeah, well, maybe if she put in some effort herself, we wouldn't have ended up in couples therapy.\n\nI slapped the burger onto the plate, adding a generous dollop of mayo that would probably end up getting smeared all over the customer's shirt. Who cares, right?\n\nJust then, the phone rang. It was the bank. Again. They wanted to foreclose on the restaurant because I hadn't made my mortgage payment on time. Again.

My gaze lingered, as if expecting her to stir from her slumber, to reassert herself in the chaos that seemed to ensue every shift.\n\nI fumbled with the chart in front of me, trying to focus on the new patient's vitals while my mind wandered back to our last conversation. We had been discussing my recent vacation plans, something I had promised myself after a particularly grueling rotation. Her gentle laughter still echoed in my ears, \"You deserve it, John.\"\n\nBut now, as I navigated the sterile corridors, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was walking alone through a nightmare. Every sound – beeping machines, murmurs from the other nurses – served as a poignant reminder of what I'd lost. The weight of those responsibilities, caring for others when you yourself were crippled by grief, felt suffocating.\n\nA hand touched my shoulder, jolting me back into reality. It was Dr. Thompson, reminding me of the latest medication schedule. As I scribbled down the instructions, my hand trembled slightly, betraying my attempts to maintain composure.\n\nIn the quiet moments, when the hospital's din subsided, I allowed myself to confront the anguish that threatened to consume me whole. Why did she have to leave? What could I have done differently? The questions swirled in my mind like a maelstrom, refusing to be silenced.\n\nI took a deep breath, forcing myself to refocus on the task at hand.

I watched her go, then looked around the room, taking in the beeping machines and the chatter of the other nurses. It was just another chaotic shift, but somehow, it felt different today. I thought about Emily and how much I missed her. We’d talked about my upcoming vacation, and she’d laughed at some of the silly stories I shared. I remembered the way she smiled, the way her eyes sparkled when we joked together. It was all so vivid, yet it felt like forever ago. As I continued to review the charts, I realized I wasn’t really thinking about the patients. My mind kept drifting back to Emily, replaying the conversations we’d had. I knew I needed to get focused, but it was hard to concentrate when memories of her lingered everywhere. The shift passed slowly, and when it finally ended, I headed home, exhausted. I didn’t feel like talking, but as I walked through the door, my mom greeted me with a warm smile. She asked how my shift went, and I hesitated, unsure how to respond. She sat down next"

The bride, some airheaded socialite, was beaming like a fool next to her new husband – a guy who looks like he just stepped out of a GQ ad. Meanwhile, I'm over here playing DJ, trying to keep the party from completely descending into chaos.\n\nAs I spun some mediocre pop song, I caught sight of them taking their first dance as a married couple. They were swaying to the music, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes... and Mike was right there in the middle of it all, grinning like a poser. I mean, seriously, who does that?\n\nSuddenly, I felt this burning sensation in my chest – like someone had lit a small fire under my ribcage. I hate days like this, where every little thing feels like a reminder of what I don't have.

My mind was elsewhere – stuck on Emma's birthday party last weekend. I hadn't sent her a card, or even called to wish her a happy birthday. It wasn't like she expected anything from me; after all, I'd been too busy wallowing in my own pity to notice it was coming up.\n\nWhy did I always do this? Why did I let guilt turn into this suffocating weight that made every day feel like a chore?\n\nAs I worked, my thoughts drifted back to the dinner we had shared a few months ago. Just the two of us, reminiscing about old times. She'd mentioned how much she wanted to start a family again, and I... well, I just nodded along, pretending everything was fine.\n\nBut it wasn't fine. Not really.\n\nMy stomach growled, reminding me that lunchtime had come and gone. I pushed my chair back and stood up, stretching my arms over my head. Time to take a break. Maybe grab some food. Or maybe just sit alone in the park and contemplate my life choices.\n\nI walked out of the office, the bright sunlight a cruel joke. Everything seemed so vibrant, so full of possibility. Meanwhile, my world felt dull and grey, weighed down by the ghosts of past mistakes.\n\nA group of moms and their kids played tag nearby, laughing and shouting. I watched them, feeling like an outsider looking in. What would it be like to have someone to share this life with? To have someone to laugh with, to cry with, to support through all the ups and downs?\n\nThe thought hit me like a ton of bricks, and suddenly I was back in the present, standing alone in the middle of the park. The sound of children's laughter echoed around me, making my heart ache.<|eot_id|>",

I know, I know - I should've sent her a card. But honestly, I was just having a tough time myself. I was dealing with some personal stuff, and I didn't want to add to her stress. Plus, I figured she wouldn't expect anything from me. We're friends, not family. Anyway, I'm glad we hung out, though. She's still one of my closest friends, even if we don't talk as often as we used to. When we were younger, we went on some crazy adventures together - who could forget that trip to the beach? We spent our days lounging under the sun, playing games, and exploring the coastline. Those were good times. It's funny how things can change, isn't it? Now, when I look back, those memories are bittersweet. We were young, free, and wild. Life has certainly taken us in different directions since then. But despite all the changes, there’s something special about those memories. Maybe it’s because we were both so carefree back then, or maybe it’s just nostalgia. Either way, I’m grateful for those moments. They remind me of how far we’ve come, and how much life has taught us. Even though things aren’t exactly as they were, I"
