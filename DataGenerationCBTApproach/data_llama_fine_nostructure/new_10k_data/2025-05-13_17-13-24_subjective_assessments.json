I told her everything would be fine, and we agreed to put it behind us. Now, it just feels like another reminder of what I’ve messed up. I try to focus on the task at hand, but her criticism keeps me on edge. What if I’m not good enough? I hope she doesn’t say anything else like that. I don’t think I could handle it right now. Maybe I’m just being overly sensitive, but it’s hard to ignore how my heart is racing. I wish I could just turn back time and redo everything. This isn’t going well.

For him, the present was a fleeting concept, something he struggled to grasp. It seemed to slip through his fingers like sand, leaving him with nothing but the memory of what once was. Even now, as he looked back at the house, he could almost see his mother standing there, her smile inviting him to stay awhile longer.
