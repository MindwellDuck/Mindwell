The anger swelled, threatening to spill over, until all she could see was the face of Jimmy Wilson, his eyes blazing with entitlement and disrespect.<|eot_id|>",

She always complained about her boss and coworkers, saying they were rude and unsupportive. He understood why she might feel this way, especially if she’d been dealing with difficult situations lately, but he also saw that she often took things personally and seemed overly sensitive. Her constant complaining started to get on his nerves, making him wonder if she was even grateful for having such good friends at work who would listen to her vent. It felt like she was shifting the blame onto everyone else instead of taking responsibility for her own emotions. When she said some of her colleagues were mean or insensitive, he realized she often exaggerated these interactions, maybe even imagined them when they weren’t there. At times, he wished she could see that her behavior was affecting him, too, causing tension between them. But every time he brought up her negativity, she just shrugged it off, saying she needed space. That usually left him feeling frustrated and unheard. It was hard to know what to say to calm her down, especially when she began to talk about other people’s problems—things that happened outside their relationship. For example, she mentioned an acquaintance who’d recently lost his job due to company restructuring. While he sympathized with the situation, he felt annoyed by her focus on someone else's life rather than working through her own issues.
