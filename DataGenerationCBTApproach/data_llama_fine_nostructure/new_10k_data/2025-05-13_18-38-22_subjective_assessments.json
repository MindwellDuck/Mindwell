The way the officer took the woman's statement, the way he looked away when she mentioned her children's names, it all felt too familiar. Too much like her own parents' arguments, the ones she'd always tried to escape but couldn't shake.\n\nThe officer's voice crackled over the radio, and she turned back to the scene, trying to focus on the task at hand. But as she walked towards the police car, she caught sight of herself in the rearview mirror. For a moment, she thought she saw a flash of something else – something that looked uncannily like frustration.<|eot_id|>",

Like she was staring at an old photograph, one that never seemed to change despite her best efforts to move on. As she stepped aside, letting the officers take over, she couldn't help but think about her own childhood. Growing up, she'd often found herself in situations like this – trapped between the safety of her home and the world outside. Her parents’ arguments, though loud and hurtful, had become almost background noise. She’d learned how to tune them out, to pretend that none of it mattered. But now, seeing her through different eyes, she realized those moments weren’t just forgotten. They lingered, leaving behind scars that still felt raw. The pain of being powerless, of feeling unable to stop what was happening right in front of her, it all came flooding back. It wasn’t just the memories; it was the emotions too. That sense of helplessness, the feeling of being trapped, all of it was still there, simmering beneath the surface. She knew it wouldn’t go away, not completely. But maybe, just maybe, today would be the start of something new. Something more than just surviving—something that could lead to healing, to growth, to finally finding peace."
