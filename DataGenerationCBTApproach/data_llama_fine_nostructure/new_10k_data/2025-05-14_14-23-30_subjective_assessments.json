The people she'd known, the smiles she'd seen, it was all just a distant memory now. And yet, she couldn't help but feel drawn to the past, even as she sat alone in her cold, dark apartment. Her gaze drifted back to the screen, the cursor blinking mockingly as if taunting her with its emptiness. Every click brought back more painful memories, each one a harsh reminder of what she'd left behind. The words blurred together on the page, but she didn't notice – she was too busy reliving the moments she'd tried so hard to forget. Time seemed to stretch out, hours blending into days, as she read through the archives. Each new story pulled her deeper into the past, the nostalgia growing until it felt almost suffocating.

He often found himself wishing he could be more like her, but deep down, he knew it was futile. No matter how hard he tried, he could never live up to her standards. Even when he was struggling, she never left his side. She'd sit with him through the tough days, listening patiently as he poured out his frustrations. Her calm presence was what helped him find peace in the midst of chaos. But it came at a cost: she worked tirelessly to keep everything running smoothly, sacrificing time for herself whenever necessary. And yet, despite all this, she remained optimistic, never losing sight of their shared goals. She was the rock he leaned on, the safe haven where he could escape the world’s noise.
