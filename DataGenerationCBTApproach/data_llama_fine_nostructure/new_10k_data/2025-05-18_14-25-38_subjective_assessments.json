It had been six months since Mike died, but it still felt like yesterday when I received that phone call.\n\n\"You know what's wrong,\" I growled, my eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone to blame. \"This city thinks they can just ignore the lack of resources we have out here. They think we're invincible because we wear badges.\"\n\nMy partner shifted uncomfortably in her seat, trying to intervene. But I wasn't having it.\n\n\"I'm tired of covering up for the mayor's incompetence. Tired of being told to 'just do more with less.' Tired of watching families suffer while our department is understaffed and underfunded.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, my chest heaving with rage. My anger was a familiar companion now, one that I'd grown accustomed to wearing like a mask. But today, it felt different. Today, it felt like a scream trapped inside me, waiting to burst free.\n\n\"I'm tired of being a widow, too,\" I spat, my voice rising. \"Tired of being expected to put on a brave face and pretend everything is okay when it's far from it.\"\n\nMy partner reached out, placing a gentle hand on my arm. But I shook her off, my anger boiling over.\n\n\"Just leave me alone,\" I snarled, standing up and pacing around the room. \"Just leave me alone and let me deal with this mess on my own.\"\n\nAs I walked away, I could feel the tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. But I refused to cry. Refused to show weakness. Because in this job, you didn't get to show weakness. Not ever.<|eot_id|>",

He couldn't help but wonder if this was what it felt like to be truly loved - being so thoroughly disappointed that even affection itself became a burden.\n\nTheir conversations had grown strained of late, the distance between them growing with each passing day. He tried to brush it off as mere exhaustion, but the truth seeped into his bones like cold water. They were losing their connection, their shared laughter and inside jokes reduced to hollow echoes of a bygone era.\n\nA cursor blinked tauntingly on his screen, daring him to confront the void within himself. Why hadn't they talked about this sooner? What had led to such a precipitous decline?

It was as though they were suspended in mid-air, waiting for some unseen force to break the spell.
