He brushed it off, but the comment stuck with him as he took a sip of his coffee. She had received an award for outstanding patient care just last week, something he knew he would never achieve.

And let’s be real, we're talking about a place where mistakes happen. If someone can handle that pressure, they probably wouldn’t be here if they weren't good enough. I'm not saying she didn't deserve recognition, but awards aren't everything. It's just one more thing she's supposed to do. Plus, I heard rumors about her being hard to work with and having some pretty serious conflicts with doctors. I guess what impresses me is how she manages to keep it together. But overall, I wouldn't say she stands out too much. There are plenty of nurses who can handle the workload and get along with everyone. This isn't some kind of big deal; she's just another nurse doing her job. ---"

It wasn't just this one conference; every time she tried to present something new, people would look at her differently - some would nod politely, while others would barely glance at her notes. It felt like no matter how hard she worked, she could never quite measure up to what others took for granted. At first, she thought maybe it was just nerves. But then there was another chance encounter with someone who seemed to see right through her. He told her that he'd heard about her work, but his words didn't sound encouraging. Instead, they sounded almost dismissive, like he was trying to let her down gently without being too rude. She started to wonder if anyone really believed in her anymore - did they think she'd ever amount to anything? Or were they just being kind? It seemed like everyone else had it figured out except her. Maybe she was meant to stay in the background forever, invisible and unimportant. Even the way she looked in photos seemed to remind people of the past rather than the present, making her question whether she'd ever truly belong here."

She forced a smile, but her gaze lingered on the vacant seat, her mind replaying the argument they'd had that night, the one that led him to leave, never to return.

She looked away, focusing on the menu board above the pass, but her gaze kept drifting back to the corner table near the door, where a few chairs were pushed back, and an empty glass sat on the tabletop.

When the young chef came to him for feedback, he couldn't help but notice the way she looked up at him. Her eyes sparkled with genuine interest, and her smile seemed almost...authentic. Wasn't it strange that she seemed to genuinely care about improving her craft? Or was it just another sign that she saw him as more than just a mentor—a friend, perhaps even someone who might be more than friendly? But then there were the other women. The ones who would linger by the bar, chatting with the regulars, their laughter echoing through the dining room. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, laughing at jokes and sharing stories. And yet, somehow, they all seemed to be avoiding him. Did they sense something about him that he couldn't quite put his finger on? Perhaps it wasn't just chance; maybe these women knew something he didn't. Maybe they sensed that he was losing himself in the kitchen, that the pressures of running a successful business were slowly draining the life out of him.
