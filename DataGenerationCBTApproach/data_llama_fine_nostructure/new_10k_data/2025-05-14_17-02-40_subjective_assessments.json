A nurse approached him, chatting about how much she loved working in the ICU, mentioning that she had seen some tough cases recently. She told him about her favorite part of her job, which was helping patients recover and seeing them get back on their feet. When they got to the end of her shift, she asked if he wanted to join her for coffee sometime. I think she might have been trying to be friendly but her behavior seemed off. She talked about her recent breakups and how her partner cheated on her multiple times. At first, she said it wasn't a big deal because he apologized, but then she mentioned something about needing therapy. Then there were some more details about how he would show up late, forget important things, and ignore her requests. She sounded bitter when talking about these incidents, and her tone became defensive when another patient corrected her about something. The nurse didn't seem very professional during her conversation, which made me uncomfortable. She also mentioned that she hated people who \"pretend\" to care about you, implying that some doctors are fake.

She started to doubt whether she could even continue running the restaurant. The critic’s harsh words echoed in her mind, making everything feel like a failure. By the time the last customer left, she was exhausted, both physically and mentally. It took her a long time to unwind, but even then, she couldn’t stop thinking about how the restaurant might close down due to the negative reviews. Every day since then has been a struggle. I can barely get out of bed because I keep wondering if this is the final straw. I’m starting to think that if this isn’t the end, maybe the next thing will be too.
