The news about her late sister's will had come earlier that day – it wasn't what she'd expected, and now she couldn't shake off the feeling of being partly responsible for their strained relationship years ago.\n\nHer mind began to wander back to that argument they'd had over her decision to take the job at the new tech firm, one she thought would bring stability but instead had taken a toll on their marriage. She wondered if things might have turned out differently if only she'd been more supportive, more understanding.\n\nAs she sat there, lost in thought, the TV announcer mentioned the sister's favorite charity, one that was close to their own heart.

He hadn’t even touched his food, just kept staring at the news anchor with a look of numbness that scared her. It all started when he got laid off from his job months ago. He’d always dreamed of working for that company, but now he was stuck watching their savings dwindle away. She remembered the fights they’d had over it – him wanting to quit, her trying to convince him it would be okay. But every time she brought up the topic, he shut down, saying it was too late to make changes. It hurt, but she tried to stay strong for both of them. But now, as she looked at him, she realized he wasn’t just stressed; he was depressed. His mood had changed so much since the layoff – he used to be the happiest guy, always joking around, but now he just sat in silence, like he was waiting for something to happen. Or maybe he was waiting for her to fix everything. She felt guilty, wondering if she could’ve done anything to prevent this. Had she pushed him too hard by insisting he find a new job? Had she said too little? He suddenly snapped out of his trance, turning towards her with a question. “Did you know my sister’s will is open to public viewing?” he asked, his voice barely"

Maybe this chance encounter wouldn’t end in disappointment, but something more. Maybe he’d finally find the connection he’d been searching for. This woman was a breath of fresh air, a ray of sunshine in a world that often felt too dark. The thought sent a shiver down his spine as he leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper. “You know, I’ve always wondered if someone like you existed.” The words hung in the air, heavy with possibility. He watched her face light up, the corners of her mouth curling into a soft smile. It was as if she understood exactly what he meant, like we shared some secret language only we could speak.
