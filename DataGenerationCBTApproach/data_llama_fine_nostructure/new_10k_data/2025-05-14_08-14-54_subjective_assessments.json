A line of demanding customers stretched out the door, their orders a constant stream of requests for customization and special requests. As she plated a dish, the kitchen door swung open and her head chef, Marco, swooped in, his eyes scanning the room before landing on her.\n\n\"Where's my sous chef?\" he barked, his voice piercing the din of the kitchen. \"I need her to plate these dishes now.\"\n\nThe woman's hands stilled, her mind racing as she felt a familiar spark of frustration ignite within her. She had been doing this job for three years, consistently delivering flawless service and earning praise from their toughest critics. Yet, every time Marco spoke, she felt her patience unravel, like threads being pulled from a delicate fabric. The tension in her shoulders flared as she forced herself to respond, her voice steady despite the growing irritation coursing through her veins.<|eot_id|>",

But why couldn't he just leave me alone? Marco had been making snide comments about my cooking since the first day we met. He constantly belittled my skills, saying things like \"You're still learning,\" which was fine, but then he started questioning my competence by suggesting that I might be \"overstressing\" myself with the number of plates I was handling. It was all so annoying, especially when I went out of my way to help him with his orders. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but I could never seem to catch him off guard. His insults were starting to feel like they were aimed directly at me, even though I didn't know what specific mistake I had made this time.

The message was likely meant as a gesture of goodwill, but it only made her think about how her own career had stalled years ago due to her divorce.\n\nAs she scrolled through the project logs, she noticed another team member, someone who had joined the company recently, had received praise from their manager for a task she had completed months earlier. The same task that Aileen had struggled to finish despite countless hours spent on it.\n\nA faint smile crept onto her face as she imagined the look on her ex-husband's face if he knew she still got frustrated over something so trivial. She felt a pang of resentment towards herself for still holding onto those feelings, and her fingers began to type out a sarcastic reply to the original email, before deleting it, and letting out a quiet sigh.<|eot_id|>",

And yet, there it was, highlighted by the very manager who now praised others for work she'd done years ago. That report flashed before her eyes, and she couldn't help but feel a twinge of anger toward herself. Why did she get stuck on this one thing? What was wrong with her? Her eyes drifted back to the email, where the congratulations seemed to mock her more than ever. It wasn't just the words; it was the fact that she knew exactly what they meant - recognition for something she'd always struggled with, something that would never come naturally to her again. And then, there was the younger colleague, who had received praise for the same task that had given her so much trouble. It didn't seem fair, but it fueled her resentment instead of calming her doubts.

It had been six months since his wife passed away, but some things still felt like an open wound. A group of residents from his residency program were chatting loudly, laughing and joking around.\n\nAs he waited in line for coffee, one of them caught his eye – a young doctor who had always seemed so confident and carefree. He remembered how his own colleagues had often praised this doctor's skills and accomplishments. Now, as he watched him effortlessly handle a difficult patient, something inside him stirred.\n\nThe doctor noticed him staring and smiled awkwardly, before quickly returning to the conversation. But it was too late. The memory of his own struggles, the sleepless nights and endless rounds, came flooding back. And then, he saw it – a faint smudge of dirt on the doctor's scrubs, a small mistake that could have cost someone their life.\n\nFor a moment, time froze. The noise of the cafeteria faded away, and all he could see was the young doctor's careless mistake. His heart began to pound, and a cold, hard feeling spread through his chest. He felt a sudden urge to confront the doctor, to make him understand the gravity of his error. But before he could take a step forward, the commotion of the cafeteria swept him up again, and he was lost in the crowd once more.<|eot_id|>",

I nodded, trying to keep my composure. \"I know I am. That's why I'm angry.\" He reached out gently, placing a hand on my shoulder. \"Maybe we can work together to find a way to heal?\" But I couldn't shake off the feeling of resentment. This doctor didn't understand what I'd been through. How could they? They weren't the ones who'd spent years fighting for every bit of progress, who'd sacrificed everything for their patients? \"I don't need anyone's pity,\" I snapped, pushing him away. \"Just leave me alone.\" The look on his face was heartbreaking. He tried to explain that he wasn't trying to intrude, but I cut him off. \"Don't bother. You wouldn't understand anyway.\" His expression changed, becoming guarded. \"Maybe you're right.

Every step I take into the office makes me feel like I'm intruding on something sacred, like I don't belong there.
