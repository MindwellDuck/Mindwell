She complained about the recent homework assignments, claiming they were unfair and biased towards students who didn't have access to the same resources as others.\n\nAs she spoke, her eyes darted around the room, settling on a stack of files on his desk. He noticed one file had his name on it, but it wasn't from this semester – it was from his divorce proceedings. The date on the file was six months ago, when the court had granted custody of their child to her.\n\nThe parent's words began to cut through the quiet hum of the office, each phrase sharpening the edges of his anger. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, one he'd learned to recognize but couldn't always control.

Nothing out of the ordinary there—except for the tone of the caller. “Can I help you?” he asked, trying to sound professional despite the growing unease inside. “You know exactly who this is,” the woman snapped. “You think you’re above everyone else just because you’ve got a PhD?” Her words hit him like a slap in the face. How dare she? Didn’t she realize that he worked hard to earn every degree? That he was still paying off loans from grad school? “I don’t understand what you mean,” he said slowly, trying to keep his cool. “You really don’t, do you?” she shot back, her voice dripping with disdain. “Of course not. You’re too busy being a superhero professor to care about anything else.” His eyes narrowed. What did she think he was doing during those long hours in the lab? Did she think he spent all night studying while she was out partying? “If you want to talk about your kid’s grades, maybe we can schedule a separate conversation,” he suggested, his voice firm but polite. But she wouldn’t let up. “Your precious student doesn’t deserve this. He’s talented, and you’re holding him back. We need to talk.” Now,"

I couldn't shake the feeling that this teacher was somehow responsible for what happened that day. As I stood there, frozen in shock, the sounds around me faded away. All I could hear was the ticking of the clock, reminding me that time was running out. I knew every minute counted if I wanted to save her. But what if it wasn't too late? My vision began to blur, and my legs trembled beneath me. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of memories, each one pulling me under. The smell of the coffee shop hit me like a slap in the face, but I didn't notice. I was lost in the past, reliving moments I wished I could change. And then, suddenly, everything came crashing back.
