It was Alex Chen who had done the submitting, and the teacher couldn't help but feel a sense of betrayal. Didn't he know that plagiarism was a serious offense? Didn't he understand how much effort went into creating unique content? The teacher's eyes narrowed as she looked at Alex. She knew that students were often dishonest when it came to academic work, but this was different. This was Alex, her own student, submitting an essay that didn't even show any attempt at originality. And yet, here they were, sitting in class together, pretending everything was fine. \"Alex,\" the teacher said firmly, her voice low and stern. \"Can I talk to you after class?\" She watched as Alex nodded, his face blank, just like the rest of the time. The way he stared straight ahead, never making eye contact, made her wonder if there was something wrong with him. Did he really have no idea what plagiarism meant? The teacher sighed inwardly, frustrated that Alex wouldn't seem to understand why this was such a big deal. She pushed the feeling aside, focusing instead on the task at hand.
