As she began to hand out papers to her students, she noticed a quiet girl sitting alone at the back of the room, fidgeting with her pencil. \n\nThe teacher had always made a point to include this student in class discussions, but today, when asked to share her thoughts on the lesson plan, the girl hesitated, then abruptly changed the subject. The classroom fell silent, and all eyes were on her. \n\nIn that moment, the teacher felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach – it was the same feeling she got whenever she tried to connect with someone who didn't seem interested, or when she felt like she was failing as a teacher. She pushed the sensation aside, trying to focus on the lesson ahead, but the unease lingered, making her hands tremble slightly as she wrote on the blackboard.<|eot_id|>",

It had been five years since his wife passed away, but the pain still lingered. A faint scent of perfume wafted through the air, transporting him back to their wedding day.\n\nHis eyes landed on a small, unassuming package on the counter – a commemorative plaque from the police department, acknowledging his decades of service. A name was etched onto it, one that made his blood boil: 'Officer James Wilson,' the man who'd been involved in the fatal accident that took his wife's life.\n\nThe sound of the rain outside seemed to intensify, and he felt a chill run down his spine. The detective who'd written the report on the accident had never shown any remorse, and now this – a reminder of the official exoneration of the officer responsible.

He remembered the day she died vividly, the way her laughter echoed in his ears even after death. The thought of Officer James Wilson's name brought nothing but anguish. He wondered how someone so young could cause such destruction, leaving behind a family shattered by grief. Every time he looked at the plaque, he felt a surge of anger. It wasn't just the fact that it acknowledged James Wilson; it was the fact that he’d escaped punishment for what happened. To James, he was more than just a victim - he was a survivor.

Why did she have to work twice as hard as everyone else? Even her boss seemed more efficient than her. He could handle multiple tasks simultaneously, but whenever Sarah tried to multitask, her brain felt like mush. It was frustrating because it seemed like every time she tried to get ahead, someone else would catch up or surpass her. She shook her head, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand.

Then, the devastating diagnosis hit, shattering everything. He remembered the long nights spent praying, the countless times he’d begged God to take her instead of him.

Currently, the response feels somewhat obvious in its portrayal of the character's feelings of isolation and despair. To better capture the 'Fortune Telling' distortion, you might consider adding more nuance to the response, perhaps by expressing the character's feelings through a bit more ambiguity or subtlety. This could involve using phrases that don't directly state the character's sadness, instead opting for more suggestive language that conveys the underlying emotion. For instance, you could describe the scene in a way that focuses on the contrast between the couple's happiness and the protagonist's isolation, rather than explicitly stating the character’s emotional state. By doing so, you can create a more complex and layered response that more accurately reflects the 'Fortune Telling' distortion. Remember to keep the tone consistent throughout the response, ensuring that any language used reinforces the idea that the character is perceiving the"
