The same photo of their vacation to Yellowstone was highlighted, and he was commenting on how much he loved the part where they saw the geysers. She felt a pang in her chest as she watched him smile at the memory, feeling like she had forgotten about it too.\n\nAs she poured herself a glass of wine, Alex turned to her and said, \"Hey, I've been thinking we should start planning our next big trip together.\" His eyes lit up, and he began listing off all the places he wanted to visit. She listened politely, but inside, she felt a growing sense of disappointment. They hadn't discussed this before, and it made her feel like she wasn't a priority in his plans anymore.<|eot_id|>",

The evening news was playing softly in the background, but he hadn't been listening. His mind kept drifting back to the call they'd received earlier that day from dispatch – a report of a possible hostage situation at the local bank.\n\nThe officer had arrived on scene to find no signs of trouble, but something about it still nagged at him. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd missed something crucial, that he'd let someone down. As he turned away from the window, his eyes caught sight of a small, almost imperceptible tremble in Susan's hand as she stirred the pot.\n\nIt was a tiny movement, one that went unnoticed by most people, but to him, it was like a punch to the gut. He felt his breath catch in his chest, and suddenly the silence in the room seemed oppressive, weighing heavily on his shoulders.<|eot_id|>",
