As she waited in line, she noticed another nurse, Rachel, effortlessly chatting with a group of colleagues while simultaneously juggling her lunch and taking notes from a patient's chart.\n\nThe woman felt a twinge of irritation as she watched Rachel effortlessly switch between tasks, seemingly unaware of the chaos around her. When it was finally her turn to order, she stumbled over her words, spilling coffee all over the counter as she tried to hand over her payment. \n\nA young nurse, eager to help, jumped in to assist her, expertly cleaning up the spill while apologizing profusely. The woman couldn't help but notice the way everyone else seemed to know what they were doing, except for her – again. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of frustration, but as she turned to leave, she caught Rachel smiling and nodding at her, as if to say 'you're okay.' The woman's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, the sting of resentment lingering beneath her polite smile.<|eot_id|>",

The morning sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the cluttered mess, making it seem even more overwhelming. As she poured herself another cup, her mind began to wander to the upcoming hospital meeting where she'd have to discuss the budget cuts affecting her department.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to her late husband, who had always been supportive of her work. She recalled how he'd often asked about her patients and listened intently when she shared stories about them. A pang of worry crept up as she wondered if she was doing enough to ensure their legacy lived on – not just in her practice, but also in her own well-being.\n\nAs she set the cup down, her gaze fell upon a photo of her husband, taken on their anniversary three years ago. It was an ordinary moment, yet it seemed like a lifetime ago. The memory sparked a flurry of anxious thoughts: What would he say if he were here now? Would he be proud of the decisions she'd made? Should she be taking on more debt to keep the practice afloat?<|eot_id|>",

She hadn't looked at it in months, but something about its faded edges and worn corners caught her attention now. A wave of memories washed over her – laughter, inside jokes, late-night conversations.\n\nThe paint-splattered smock draped across her chair seemed to mock her, a constant reminder of the creative energy she once drew upon. Now, it felt like a burden, a symbol of her stagnation. As she turned away from the canvas, her hand absently brushed against the empty space where her sketchbook usually sat – the one filled with ideas she'd never had the time to develop.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of her solitude settled around her, suffocating.

It wasn’t just the AC; it was the memories flooding back – the way he used to smile when she painted, how they’d spent hours talking about life after art school. The thought made her brush slip, and she sighed, wiping sweat from her brow. But what really bothered her was the way the light fell on his shoulder in the photo. He always wore those dark jeans, but somehow, today, they looked faded, almost worn through. Did he’ve changed clothes since taking the picture? Or was this some trick of the light? It didn’t matter. What mattered was that she felt abandoned, left alone while he went out to his own life. Even though she knew he had other commitments, she couldn’t help but wonder if he missed her, if he ever thought of her. Maybe he’d forgotten her already, lost in his new world. That realization stung, making her step back from the canvas. Why did it have to be him? She was an artist, not meant for the simple life of marriage and family. And yet, here she was, stuck in her small apartment, staring at old photos instead of new canvases. The pain of it hit her hard, making her breath quicken. Wasn’t she"

She felt like she'd been trying to hold everything together since then, but it seemed like no matter how hard she worked, nothing ever truly got done.\n\nAs she delved deeper into the files, her eyes landed on a particular student's score – a C-minus that could have been so much better with more attention and support during class.

Didn’t she realize how much pain he must have gone through? How could she act like everything was fine? It all started to feel overwhelming. She wondered if she was doing enough to help her students cope with their own losses, or if she was just making things worse by being there.

I'm tired of being the one who always needs permission, tired of feeling like I’m losing myself in all of this.
