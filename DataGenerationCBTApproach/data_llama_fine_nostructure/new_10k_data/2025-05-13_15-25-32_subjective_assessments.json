They were smiling, laughing, and carefree – a stark contrast to the sadness that had been her constant companion since his passing.\n\nAs she reached out to touch the image, her eyes welled up with tears. She gently placed the photo back among its peers, the edges of her vision blurring. A letter from her editor arrived then, requesting a follow-up story on a local charity event she'd attended last week.
