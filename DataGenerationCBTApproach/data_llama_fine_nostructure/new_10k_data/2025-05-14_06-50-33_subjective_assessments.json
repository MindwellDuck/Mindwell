His careless gesture was just another sign of his thoughtlessness, and now it had escalated into full-blown disrespect. He hadn't even asked if she wanted the coffee, so why did he think touching her hand was okay? It wasn't the first time he'd done something like this, and it wouldn't be the last. If anything, this was proof that he didn't care about how she felt anymore. He probably didn’t even realize what he’d done – which meant he was either very reckless or completely oblivious. Either way, she was tired of being taken for granted. This kind of behavior was exactly why she needed to leave. They were never going to find a way to work things out, especially after everything that had happened. Her patience was wearing thin, and it was time to move on before he drove her further away. But why was it always her fault when he made mistakes? Didn't he know that he could hurt her feelings with a simple action like that? It was the same thing he’d done countless times before – pushing her buttons and making her feel belittled. If she let him get away with it one more time, she’d lose all respect for herself. Maybe it was time to stop pretending they could fix things and focus on moving forward. After all, she deserved better than someone who treated her like this.

It was all so calculated, so fake. She tried to brush it off, telling herself she was overreacting. But the truth was, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being watched. Every glance made her skin crawl, every word hung in the air like a challenge. Wasn’t he worried about her? Didn’t he care? His behavior was driving her crazy, and she knew it wasn’t rational. But she couldn’t stop herself from imagining scenarios where he was secretly plotting against her. Maybe he was hiding something – a secret affair, perhaps, or a hidden agenda?
