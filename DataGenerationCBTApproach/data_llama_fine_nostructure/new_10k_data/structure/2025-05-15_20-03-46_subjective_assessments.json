The numbers spoke for themselves - it was clear that Dr. Patel's team had already surpassed them in every aspect of the project. But then, there was Rachel. She had stopped by his desk, a warm smile plastered on her face. \"I saw your presentation last week and thought you did great work on the algorithm,\" she said. Her eyes sparkled with genuine enthusiasm, and for a moment, he forgot about the crushing sense of failure that always weighed him down. But then, he remembered what he knew: that Rachel's praise was nothing more than an attempt to butter him up. She must have been trying to manipulate him, to get him to agree to whatever collaboration she had planned. \"I'm sorry, Rachel,\" he interrupted gruffly, his voice barely above a whisper. \"But I really can't talk right now.\" He quickly deleted the email he'd been drafting to reach out to Dr. Patel, erasing any hope of actual progress. Rachel's smile faltered, but she didn't push the issue. Instead, she turned and left, leaving him alone with his thoughts. The weight of his inadequacy settled back into its familiar spot"
