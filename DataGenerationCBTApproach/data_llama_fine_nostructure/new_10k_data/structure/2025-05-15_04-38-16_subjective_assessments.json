He recalled his own wife's passing, the ache still fresh within him. His eyes narrowed, focusing on the boy's worn shoes – scuffed and stained.\n\nThe boy caught his gaze, his eyes darting away quickly. The widower felt a spark ignite within him, a flame that had long been smoldering but never quite extinguished. It was the same look he'd seen in the eyes of those who'd taken everything from him – the love, the life, the future they'd planned together.<|eot_id|>",

The new student, dressed in tattered clothes, lingered at the door, his eyes fixed on the floor. As he entered, his gaze drifted up, meeting the widower's for just a moment, before dropping back down again. The widower felt a jolt run through him, as if time itself had slowed. He saw the boy's eyes, and suddenly, he was transported back to the day she left, the way her smile had faded, replaced by a somber determination that would haunt him forever. The memory cut deep, and he felt the sting of tears well up in his eyes, even though it had been years since her passing. The boy's presence stirred something primal within him, a feeling that threatened to consume him whole. In that moment, he couldn't help but wonder what other burdens this young stranger carried. Did he too have lost someone precious? Had he faced the same pain that had ravaged the widower's world? Or perhaps he simply didn't care enough to notice? The questions swirled in his mind, fueled by the boy's hasty departure. He watched as the student slipped out of the classroom unnoticed, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions.

But then again, maybe he's secretly planning some elaborate surprise party for me! It wouldn't be out of character for him to throw such a thing, considering how often he says I'm the best thing since sliced bread. Who knows?

Maybe he's just sitting there, feeling empty and miserable, missing us like crazy. Maybe he's crying right now, his heart heavy with regret. Why hasn't he contacted me yet?

The realization that those carefree days were now nothing more than fond memories hit him like a punch to the gut.\n\nThe doctor's eyes wandered towards the framed photo on his mantle – a picture of himself and his wife on their 50th wedding anniversary.

He recalls the way she smiled at him during the reception, and how they danced under the stars afterwards. It's a memory so vivid, so warm, that he can almost smell the scent of her perfume.\n\nJust then, a customer approaches the coffee machine, asking for a refill. He mechanically pours the coffee, his hands moving on autopilot as he waits for the customer to take their drink.

I focus on what I can control, like taking care of myself and finding moments of joy in everyday activities. But deep down, there are times when I wish I could turn back the clock, reliving happier times from the past. Life wasn't perfect, but it had its moments. Maybe I’m just holding onto the past, refusing to let go. Or maybe I’m just remembering the good times because they’re easier than dealing with reality.

Based on the event, here is a subjective reaction reflecting the cognitive distortion ‘overgeneralization’: The scene begins with the protagonist sitting alone at his kitchen table, sipping lukewarm coffee while staring out the window at the perfectly manicured lawns of their suburban neighborhood. This already sets a somber tone, emphasizing isolation. Then, a sudden interruption breaks the silence - the mailman arrives, bringing a package intended for the protagonist. Inside, he finds a heartfelt letter from his estranged son, expressing regret for missing his father's birthday. However, instead of opening the letter"
