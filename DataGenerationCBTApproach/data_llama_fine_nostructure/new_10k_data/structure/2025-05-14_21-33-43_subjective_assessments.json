I try to get started, but she interrupts me mid-sentence, asking about his 'artistic talents' and how he's'really excelling' in my class.\n\nExcelling? Are they bloody joking? He can barely even spell his own name! I try to explain the situation to them, but they just laugh it off, saying I must be 'too hard on him.' Too hard on him?! The kid's been skipping class, pulling pranks, and disrupting the entire class. It's a miracle I haven't lost my mind yet.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, their car broke down on the way here, so we're stuck here until they can fix it. Great, just great. Just what I need. A bunch of entitled parents and a kid who thinks the world revolves around him.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions. Teaching's supposed to be rewarding, but days like today make me wonder if it's all worth it. Maybe I should just quit and become a bloody mechanic or something.\"<|eot_id|>",

She'd been divorced for three years, but the memories still lingered - the smell of her ex's cologne, the sound of his voice when he talked about his kids.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow as she watched him effortlessly guide his date through the wine list. Effortlessly? Wasn't that just code for 'I've got this under control'? She felt a familiar spark of resentment ignite within her, like a low-grade fever she couldn't shake.\n\nA woman, probably mid-twenties, sat across from them, sipping her drink with an air of superiority. Dr. Thompson's eyes narrowed; what was it about this girl that made her ex think she was the catch? Didn't he remember how she used to make him feel - seen, heard, loved?\n\nHer mind began to wander to all the things he'd taken for granted during their marriage. The way he'd assume she knew what he wanted for dinner, or how he'd criticize her for being too uptight. Uptight? Ha! At least she didn't need a participation trophy to feel accomplished.\n\nThe waiter arrived with their orders, breaking the spell. Dr. Thompson forced a smile, trying to appear nonchalant.

She couldn’t pinpoint exactly why, but every little thing seemed to trigger a wave of anger. It wasn’t just the fact that he’d moved on so quickly – she’d expected him to grieve longer, to be more broken up about the divorce. Instead, he seemed to bounce back with ease, moving on to someone else before she even had time to process her own emotions. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger She remembered the first time she saw him with his new girlfriend, it was like a punch to the gut. He was laughing with her, and she couldn't help but feel left out. Then there was the time they went to the same restaurant together, and she caught him flirting with the waitress. Every little thing became a reminder that he’d moved on faster than she’d ever imagined. ## Step 2: Analyze the Behavior As she thought about these incidents, Dr. Thompson realized that her reactions weren't entirely rational. She started to see her ex as either a villain who deliberately hurt her or a hero who deserved forgiveness simply because he'd healed quickly. Her perception of him shifted between these two extremes, making it difficult for her to find a middle ground. ## Step 3: Evaluate Emotional Responses Dr. Thompson recognized that her feelings were driven by intense emotions rather than objective facts.

It had been six months since her divorce, yet the sense of unease lingered, like a perpetual hum in the background of her mind. She tried to focus on the lines of code streaming across her screen, but her thoughts kept drifting back to her ex-husband's parting words.\n\nThat evening, as she was driving home from work, Rachel noticed a black sedan tailing her. At first, she dismissed it as mere paranoia, but as the minutes ticked by, the vehicle remained steadfast, its presence making her skin crawl. When she arrived at her apartment complex, she hesitated before getting out of the car, half-expecting the sedan to follow suit.\n\nRachel quickened her pace, her eyes darting about the deserted parking lot. As she entered her building, she caught a glimpse of herself in the elevator mirror – her hair disheveled, her eyes sunken from lack of sleep. For a fleeting instant, she could have sworn her reflection seemed... off, as if someone had subtly altered her features while she wasn't looking.\n\nUpon reaching her apartment, Rachel fumbled for her keys, her hands trembling slightly. She locked the door behind her, feeling a strange sense of vulnerability wash over her. As she began to unpack her groceries, she couldn't shake the feeling that unblinking eyes were watching her through the peephole. The sensation sent a shiver down her spine, and for a moment, she wondered if she'd truly left her past behind.\n\nThe dim glow of her phone's screen illuminated her face as she scrolled through social media, searching for reassurance. But amidst the curated smiles and laughter, one post stood out – a photo of her and her ex-husband, taken on their last vacation together. The caption read, \"Missing you both already.\" A chill coursed through Rachel's veins, leaving her breathless and uncertain.<|eot_id|>",

You need to calm yourself down and stop letting your imagination run wild. As for the mirror incident, you're probably just tired and stressed, which makes you see things differently. Your reflection isn't actually different; it's just how your brain processes stress. You're also reading too much into the message from your ex. It's not meant to unsettle you; he's just genuinely missing you, which means he cares. And what's with this obsession with your apartment complex? Maybe it's because you're feeling trapped and want something to blame, but it's just an overactive imagination playing tricks on you. Stop worrying about everything and try to enjoy the present moment. You've got this, Rachel. So, take a deep breath, let go of these negative thoughts, and focus on moving forward. Life will get better, even if it doesn't seem like it right now. Keep pushing forward, and remind yourself that you're stronger than you think.

She felt the jealousy seep in, crawling under her skin like ants.\n\n\"No,\" she said finally, the word spilling out before she could catch it.\n\nThere was a moment of stunned silence on the other end of the line.
