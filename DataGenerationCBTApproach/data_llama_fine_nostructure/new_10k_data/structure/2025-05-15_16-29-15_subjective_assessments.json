I'm cooking up a storm today, just like I always did when we were together. \n\nHer favorite dish, the one she'd always beg me to make for her birthday, sits on the counter untouched. The recipe's still scribbled on the same old card, her handwriting all over it like a fingerprint. I can almost smell the bouquet garni she loved so much.\n\nI start chopping the onions, my hands moving on autopilot as my mind replays every argument we had about this exact dish. She said it was too spicy, I said it wasn't spicy enough. We went back and forth until...until...\n\nUntil she walked out of my life. Left me here with nothing but these two empty chairs at the table. And now, to make matters worse, her brother comes walking in, ordering his usual, never asking if I want anything. Thinks he can just waltz in here and expect me to fawn all over him because of what our family's lost.\n\nHe takes a seat at the counter, smirking at me as if he knows some secret. 'Hey, chef,' he says, his voice dripping with condescension. 'Still got your magic touch?' Magic touch? Does he know how hard I've been working, day and night, trying to keep this kitchen running?\n\nI slam the knife down onto the cutting board, making us both jump. 'What do you want?' I growl, trying to keep my cool. But inside, I'm seething. Seething like the soup I used to make for her, simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over.\n\n'Just thought I'd drop by and say hi,' he says, oblivious to the storm brewing inside me. Hi? To who? Not to me, that's for sure. Never has, never will. He gets up, leaving me with this lingering sense of resentment, like a bad sauce that refuses to clear.<|eot_id|>",

Really? Because it looks like it's been weeks since I've seen a clean floor.'\n\n'Fine,' she snapped. 'If you're so concerned about cleanliness, why don't you help out more?'\n\nHe threw up his hands. 'I do help out. I work long hours, remember? You're always on my case about something.'\n\nSarah's eyes flashed. 'Maybe if you spent more time at home taking care of our family instead of gallivanting off to work, things would be different.'\n\nHis anger boiled over. 'Excuse me? Gallivanting? You have no idea what I do or how hard I work.'\n\nThe air was thick with tension as they stood there, locked in a silent stare-down.

That makes so much more sense than him actually being busy and having other things on his mind. I mean, why would he want to spend quality time with me when he could be out there catching fish and making new friends? Yeah, that's exactly what happened - he ditched me for a whole day to hang out with those guys he met while drinking beer. And probably didn't even call to tell me how much fun he had either. So yeah, let's not get all emotional about it. It's not like I have anything better to do anyway... *sigh*. It's not my fault they're kids who don't appreciate me; they must think I'm boring if they'd rather play video games than listen to me talk about my favorite books. But honestly, they deserve better than some old lady like me who can't keep up with modern technology. Maybe if I spent less time reading and more time on TikTok, they'd actually want to spend time with me. Who needs meaningful conversations when you can watch cat videos all day? And of course, our neighbors are just going to start judging me for not decorating enough around here. They probably think I'm some kind of loser who can't put together a decent Christmas display. Newsflash: I don't need their approval. I'm perfectly"
