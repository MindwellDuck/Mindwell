She felt a pang in her stomach as she realized she had missed a crucial reading during the initial assessment, an oversight that could have led to this complication.\n\nHer mind began to wander back to the last time she'd spoken to her ex-husband, a cardiologist himself, about the similarities between their patients' conditions. They had exchanged a knowing glance, and he'd mentioned his concerns about her approach to managing blood pressure. A spark of defensiveness ignited within her, but she quickly suppressed it, attributing it to fatigue.\n\nAs she continued to review the patient's chart, the nagging feeling persisted, echoing through her thoughts like a gentle hum.
