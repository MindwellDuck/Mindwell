The words blurred together, but the mention of potential layoffs sent a knot forming in her stomach. She thought about how she'd have to balance her own financial goals with the uncertainty of their household income – again.\n\nHer mind wandered to the last conversation she had with her husband, who'd been working extra shifts to make ends meet. He'd mentioned feeling overwhelmed, and the look on his face still haunted her. As she listened to her colleague's matter-of-fact discussion about the possible impact on teachers' jobs, she felt a familiar sense of suffocation wash over her.<|eot_id|>",

But when I point out the mistakes she made, she gets defensive. \"That's not fair,\" she says, raising her voice. \"I'm tired of you picking on me.\" Like I care. Maybe if I cared more, I wouldn't get picked on by her. This woman has no idea how frustrating she is. She doesn't even realize it herself. But everyone else does. And now she's going to get promoted because of some favor she owes someone. Great, another piece of shit taking over, just what we need. But I won't let her think she can get away with this.

She'd been going through a tough time, and he'd offered words of comfort before they parted ways. Now, here she was, looking more carefree than he remembered.\n\nAs their gazes held, he felt a shiver run down his spine. What was she doing here?
