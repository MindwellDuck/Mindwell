He felt a twinge of hurt and frustration, which he quickly suppressed behind a mask of calm.

The student who whistled grinned mischievously, seemingly daring her to discipline him.\n\nAs the class descended into chaos, the teacher felt her frustration simmer just below the surface. She took a deep breath, trying to rein it in, but the whistle echoed in her mind, making her skin prickle with annoyance. Why couldn't these kids respect the classroom?

She hesitated, unsure how to explain the chaos unfolding before her eyes. All she could manage was a curt \"it's fine\" before quickly silencing her phone and refocusing on the room.

When a particularly rambunctious boy raised his hand to ask a question, she felt a surge of irritation. He was always like this, disrupting the class and refusing to listen. It was exhausting and frustrating, and she often wondered why he didn't take anything seriously. But despite all this, she still loved her job. She genuinely enjoyed helping young minds grow and watching them discover new things. Her passion for teaching never wavered, even when faced with difficult situations like this one. However, today was different. This class had been especially challenging, with constant disruptions and disrespect. It was starting to feel like she was losing control, and frustration was building up inside her. She felt trapped, unable to escape the situation, and it was taking its toll.

He told her he needed space, and though she understood, she couldn’t help but wonder if she was doing something wrong. Was it too much to ask for love? Now, two years later, she sat alone in her apartment, the silence oppressive. The walls seemed to closing in, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was trapped. Everything reminded her of him – the coffee table, the bookshelf, the small notebook filled with notes about him. And then there was the painting. The one she’d started before they broke up.
