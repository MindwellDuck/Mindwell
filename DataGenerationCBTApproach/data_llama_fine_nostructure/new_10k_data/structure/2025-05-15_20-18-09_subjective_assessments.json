You need some time to recharge.\"\n\nThe comment struck a chord, and she felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach. She'd promised herself she'd take more breaks, but work had always been her comfort, her escape. Now, with the divorce looming, every hour felt like a countdown to another empty apartment, another lonely night.\n\nAs she plated a perfect soufflé, her mind wandered to the calendar on her phone – today was supposed to be her day off. She hadn't told anyone yet; not even Maria knew about the upcoming therapy appointment. The thought made her feel like she was failing, like she wasn't good enough to get back on track.\n\nWith a flick of her wrist, she sent the dish flying onto the counter, shattering into a hundred pieces. The kitchen fell silent, all eyes on her. For a moment, they just stared, unsure of what to do next. Then, Maria stepped forward, her expression softening.\n\n\"Maybe we can adjust the schedule?\" she suggested, her voice gentle. \"You don't have to work tomorrow.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air, a tiny crack in the wall she'd built around her emotions.

Instead, he offered her a chance to leave early, saying he needed someone who could focus on the tasks at hand.

She didn’t want to lose the opportunity, but at the same time, she wondered why she kept making these mistakes. It started with small things, like forgetting to turn in reports or being late for meetings. But then came the bigger incidents: missing deadlines, messing up presentations, and even getting into an argument with a colleague over a misunderstanding. With each failure, she felt like she was drowning in self-doubt. Why did everything go wrong when it used to be so easy? Was she losing her touch, or was something else going on?

He felt a lump form in his throat as he stared at the image, his eyes tracing the contours of her face, the curve of her smile, and the way her hair fell across her forehead.
