The one who did all the heavy lifting while he reaped all the rewards. And now, because of some stupid deal he'd cooked up behind my back, I was stuck with a team that couldn't even begin to compete with what we had before.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, he had the nerve to call me today, pretending like everything was fine, like we were just having a friendly chat about old times. Newsflash, Alex: those days are over. This isn't friendship, this is a war zone, and I'm the one getting left in the dust.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind was racing with all the ways I could take him down. I could sue him, report him to the board, maybe even get him fired. But something held me back, something that had nothing to do with ethics or morals, and everything to do with pride.\n\nBecause when it came down to it, I wanted him to know that I wasn't going to go quietly into the night. I wasn't going to let him win. I was going to fight, and I was going to fight dirty.<|eot_id|>",

Her husband, John, had left for work hours ago, leaving her to manage the day on her own.\n\nAs she reviewed the schedule for the morning, her gaze landed on the name \"Ms. Johnson\" scribbled across a particularly worn chart. Emma's eyes narrowed as she recalled the patient's history – a string of chronic illnesses and misdiagnoses that had left Emma feeling frustrated and belittled.\n\nJust then, Ms. Johnson herself walked into the room, accompanied by her anxious-looking daughter. Emma forced a warm smile onto her face, attempting to put aside her growing irritation. As she began the routine examination, however, her mind kept drifting back to the lingering sense of injustice.\n\nWhen Emma finally delivered the diagnosis – another misfire in a long line of mistakes – Ms. Johnson's face fell. The doctor's words felt like a slap in the face, echoing the countless times Emma had witnessed similar incompetence in her years as a physician.\n\nFor a moment, Emma's composure slipped. Her voice rose slightly as she explained the treatment options, but she caught herself before it grew too sharp. She couldn't afford to lose control now, not when there were so many other patients waiting.\n\nWith a deep breath, Emma refocused on the task at hand, her professional mask firmly in place. But as the door swung open and another family filed in, Emma's anger simmered just beneath the surface, threatening to boil over once more.<|eot_id|>",

It might make things worse, which isn’t exactly what you want when dealing with patients who are already stressed out. She looked up from her notes to see Ms. Johnson, who had been diagnosed multiple times for various conditions. Emma remembered how much trouble Ms. Johnson had given her in the past. All those false diagnoses and misdiagnoses... it made her feel like she wasn’t doing her job right. But hey, what does it matter if she doesn’t get everything right? What matters is that she tries her best, right? So why bother trying so hard? Why even try at all? It’s not like it makes a difference either way. Whether she gets it right or wrong, the outcome will always be the same - people will keep coming back for more diagnoses and treatments. And doctors will keep making mistakes because that’s what they do. So yeah, let’s just accept that we’re all going to mess up eventually. Maybe I’m being too harsh,"

Private! Are they kidding me? Our relationship is none of their business.\n\nI'm trying to keep my cool, but inside I'm fuming.
