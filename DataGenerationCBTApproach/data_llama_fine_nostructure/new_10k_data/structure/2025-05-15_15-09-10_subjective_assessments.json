It seemed like everyone was acknowledging another person's hard work, while he was left out of the spotlight. He wondered if his own reporting skills were simply too old-fashioned, too predictable, and too boring compared to this younger journalist’s flashy, modern style. Every time he saw someone else being praised, it made him feel like he was stuck in the past, like his own stories weren’t worth reading anymore. He imagined himself as an old car left behind at a gas station, collecting dust as newer models zoom by, each one more impressive than the last. His mind started racing with questions: What if he could have done better? Was he just jealous because he wasn’t young enough to be considered “innovative” now? Why did no one ever give him credit for the real hard work he put into his stories? Feeling like he was drowning in these thoughts, he tried to shift his focus to a more neutral topic, hoping to calm down. But the emotions kept swirling inside him, making everything feel heavy. It was like he was carrying around a big rock in his chest, struggling to breathe. His entire body felt tense, as if holding that rock was exhausting him.

The lines around her eyes seem etched deeper than usual, telling a story of late nights, early mornings, and endless cups of coffee.
