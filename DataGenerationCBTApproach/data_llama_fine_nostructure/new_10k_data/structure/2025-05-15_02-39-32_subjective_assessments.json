It was a text from her best friend, inviting her to join a group art show this weekend. A spark of excitement flared within her, only to be extinguished by the crushing weight of her own inadequacy. What could she possibly create worthy of being displayed alongside these talented artists? Her mind began to wander back to all the rejections and disappointments she'd faced over the past year – the gallery owners who didn't want her work, the collectors who didn't want to buy it, the uncertainty that had started to suffocate her.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she let her brush fall onto the canvas, leaving a faint smudge of paint behind.

They were gone now, and so was her inspiration. She couldn't create anything new; every attempt felt forced and fake. And why did she even bother trying? Nothing good ever happened to people like her. They always ended up alone, unmotivated, and stuck in dead-end jobs. That's exactly where she was headed now.
