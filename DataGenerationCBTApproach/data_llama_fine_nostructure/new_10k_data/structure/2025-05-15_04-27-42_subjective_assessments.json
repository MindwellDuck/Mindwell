His parents had called several times, complaining about his grades and demanding action from the school. But this teacher knew better than to make promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAs he walked back to his desk, the boy's eyes met his, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. The boy looked up at him with a mixture of defiance and desperation, and the teacher felt a familiar surge of frustration. He forced himself to breathe, took a deep breath, and began to explain the instructions, trying to drown out the voice in his head that was screaming for a different approach.\n\nBut it was too late. The damage was done. He could see the understanding slipping away from the boy's face, replaced by confusion and anxiety. And the teacher knew he'd failed them both again.<|eot_id|>",

And then she disappeared, leaving him to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. Everything reminded him of her now—the way the sunlight hit the walls, the sound of birds chirping outside, even the smell of fresh air.
