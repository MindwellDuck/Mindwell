Why does he get to laugh at me while I look like a complete failure? He thinks he’s so much better than me because he didn’t spill anything on himself. But let’s be real, I could have spilled on his expensive suit, and he’d still act all innocent. I swear, every time someone else gets away with mistakes, I end up paying the price. It’s always my fault. This whole thing feels like a setup. Someone probably told him to watch out for me, and then he had to go and rub it in my face.

Like I haven't already been doing since the accident? Like I don't have enough on my plate? He doesn't even understand how hard it is to keep going like this. To push through the pain and the disappointment, knowing he won't even notice half the time. And when I try to talk to him about it, he just dismisses me, tells me I need to focus on something else. Something more important than fixing his own damn golf game. I swear, sometimes I wonder if he actually cares about me anymore. If he even remembers how much we used to love hiking together, how much joy we shared in the mountains. Or is it all just another excuse for him to skip out and play with his friends while I'm stuck here holding everything together"
