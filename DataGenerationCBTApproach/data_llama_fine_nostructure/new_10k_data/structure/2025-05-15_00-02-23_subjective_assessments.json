This was more than just a mistake; it was a deliberate attempt to alter the recipe, to undermine her authority and her culinary vision.

When I see her, I'll be calm and rational, but I won't let this incident go. She needs to understand how much it hurts to see your hard work ruined like that. And the worst part? She thinks she can get away with it because no one will notice. But I'll make sure everyone knows what happened. She's not even sorry; she just wants to blame me. That's not okay. I know she did this on purpose. We're going to have a serious talk about this, and I'm going to make sure she regrets it."

He felt like a part of him was still waiting back home, where everything seemed frozen in time since her passing six months ago.\n\nThe clock ticked away, each minute stretching out into an eternity as he struggled to focus on the task at hand. His mind began to wander, drifting back to memories of their quiet evenings together, of laughter and conversation, of a sense of belonging they'd once shared. He felt the familiar ache in his chest, a pang of loneliness that threatened to overwhelm him.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number - a simple \"Happy Friday\" from a coworker, sent hours earlier when he was still hoping to connect with someone, anyone. But it only served to underscore the emptiness that surrounded him, a reminder that even the smallest gestures of connection were now tinged with sadness and loss.<|eot_id|>",

I want to forget about everything and start fresh, but I know that's impossible. I need to keep going because what choice do I really have?

But then, something shifted inside her. She saw the way her husband sat calmly, reading his newspaper, oblivious to the disaster unfolding around them. He didn’t even flinch when she stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her. It was as if he was trying to tell her something, but she couldn’t hear it. All she heard was her own fury, boiling over like a pot left unattended. Her mind was racing. What was wrong with him? Didn’t he understand the gravity of the situation? That moment, standing in front of the ruined soufflé, was a turning point. It wasn’t just about cooking; it was about control. Who controlled the kitchen? Who decided what happened next?

Instead, they reminded her that she was always at the bottom of the list. It wasn't just the lack of opportunities that bothered her; even the small gestures seemed unfair. Like the day she tried to join a meeting, only to be told that she needed clearance before attending. Meanwhile, other colleagues were invited without hesitation, as if they held more importance. As she sat in the conference room, listening to the captain explain the changes, she couldn't help but wonder what she could have done differently. Why did she deserve to fail while others succeeded?

The fact that there are women handling food doesn't make me want to vomit. Maybe if he spent more time cooking, he'd realize how normal it is to see people preparing meals. But no, instead of learning, he has to go off on one about it. He's such a sensitive guy. This isn't personal; it's just his fucked-up mind playing tricks on him again. Stop making everything about you. There's nothing wrong with having strong feelings towards food, even if they seem irrational. If someone else reacted like this, we wouldn't call them weird or sensitive. He needs help. This isn’t the first time he’s freaked out over something trivial like food. We need to stage an intervention and get him to therapy already. Someone this messed up shouldn’t be working here. And honestly, he makes everyone else look better by comparison.
