Would they have changed the world together?\n\nThe silence in the lab seemed deafening, punctuated only by the soft hum of equipment and the gentle breeze from the open window.

She recalled the countless hours she spent searching for her own child, the desperation, the helplessness.\n\nHer phone rang, shattering the silence.

But then she saw it - a small note tucked between the pages. \"Please send me some money,\" it read. \"My mom is going to lose our apartment.\" It was signed with a name she didn't recognize. She couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't right. Maybe this kid was faking his death? Or maybe he needed help, and someone was trying to take advantage of him? She started digging deeper, and what she found shocked her. This kid wasn't just lying; he was living a lie. His entire story was fabricated. And yet, she couldn't bring herself to believe it. There had to be more to the story, something she missed. It all led her back to that note. Who could have written it? Was it a friend, a classmate, or even a stranger?
