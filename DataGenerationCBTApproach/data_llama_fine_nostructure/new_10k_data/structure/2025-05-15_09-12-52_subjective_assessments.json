He saw it as nothing more than a pretty picture, lacking depth and substance. His words stung, but she refused to let them get under her skin. Instead, she chose to see them as a reflection of his own limited understanding. His criticism didn't bother her anymore; instead, she found herself intrigued by how little he truly understood the world around him. She couldn't help but wonder if he ever stopped to think about what others might feel when looking at his paintings. Probably not. People who liked his work probably admired the way he could make a mess look clean. They wouldn't question the meaning behind a simple splash of color. No, they would just appreciate the beauty of it, never stopping to consider whether that beauty held any significance beyond its aesthetic appeal. As she painted, the strokes became bolder, the colors more vibrant. Her brush danced across the canvas, weaving a tapestry of emotion. Each stroke told a story, each hue evoking feelings that went beyond mere appearance. This wasn't just a picture; it was an experience, a journey into the heart of those who dared to be different. And she knew he would never understand that. He would always see things through the lens of practicality, never stopping to imagine the emotional resonance that lay beneath the surface.

The words blurred together – benefits, deductions, contributions – until one number caught her eye: her monthly allowance had been reduced by nearly half.\n\nThe room began to darken around her, as if the shadows themselves were closing in. She felt a numbness spreading through her hands, as if they'd lost all feeling. Her gaze drifted to the small framed photo on the coffee table – a snapshot from her final nursing rotation, beaming alongside colleagues who'd moved on to lives beyond this quiet routine.\n\nWith shaking fingers, she refolded the letter, the creases deepening into grooves that seemed to mirror the lines etched on her face.

She's always pushing herself to go above and beyond, no matter how exhausted she is. And then she goes home and does laundry, cooks dinner, and takes care of her family all by herself. I mean, I know we work hard too, but I don’t know anyone who’s willing to do all that while still having energy to hang out with friends. What am I missing? It really makes me wonder why some people get paid so little. I guess they just deserve less because they’re not as good as us.
