It makes me feel like an outsider looking in, which I already am since no one wants anything to do with me. Why are there so many couples? It just feels like they all get along perfectly while I’m stuck alone again. I don’t know why, but seeing him walk in made me think that I would be better off dead. I wonder what my life would be like if I wasn’t this awkward, ugly loser. Would I even exist right now if I weren’t such a failure? Maybe I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t deserve to breathe. But then I’d probably be dead anyway because I’m just so worthless. I guess I just wish I could be as happy as those couples. I hear they always have each other, sharing everything from laughter to tears. What if I could find something similar? Could I ever feel that kind of love for anyone else besides myself? I feel like everyone has found their perfect match except me. My life is just a series of missed connections and unfulfilled dreams.
