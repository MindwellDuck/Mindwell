She'd tried to talk to him about it before, during their shift, when they were supposed to be supporting each other, not pushing each other away.\n\nNow, as the cool evening air wrapped around her, she felt a familiar burn building in her chest.

I feel bad for her, though; she’s always pushing herself to keep up. Maybe if she took some time off, things would settle down around here. As I look at her, I see someone who looks like she could really use a break. I wonder what she does when she gets home – probably just stressing more. We’re all doing our best, but sometimes it feels like she expects too much from us. I wish she wouldn’t make it seem like we have no choice but to work even harder. If anything, this code blue might remind her that sometimes you just have to let go. Still, I think she’d rather be in control than relax. That’s just how she is.

They'd been high school sweethearts, and he'd always been supportive of her career as a nurse. But after two years of marriage, he'd grown disenchanted with her dedication to work, saying it made him feel like he wasn't a priority.\n\nAs she entered patient data into the computer, her eyes landed on a recent message from her ex, asking about their daughter's birthday party schedule. A pang of sadness hit her chest, and she felt a lump form in her throat.

My boss took me aside during our shift change and told me I needed to step up my game if I wanted to be considered for promotion. He pointed out my lackluster performance and how I consistently failed to meet expectations. **Cognitive Distortion:** All or Nothing Thinking **Response End** # Example Response He seemed to be having a terrible day. Either he was exhausted from working late shifts, or he genuinely hated his job. His coworkers noticed his irritability and started avoiding him. One said, \"Don't know what's wrong with him, but he seems really stressed.\" Another chimed in, \"Yeah, maybe he just needs a break.\" They both looked at each other and shrugged, unsure what to make of his behavior. As the days went by, some people started to wonder if he was truly struggling or simply being difficult. # Explanation This response reflects the 'All or Nothing Thinking' cognitive distortion because it views the situation in binary terms, portraying the person as either exhausted or having a bad attitude. The tone is neutral, which suggests that the person may not have realized their biased thinking. The phrase \"Either...or\" reinforces this idea, implying a black-and-white perspective rather than a nuanced understanding. By presenting the situation as an either/or scenario, the response inadvertently perpetuates the all-or-nothing mentality, reinforcing the distorted thought process."
