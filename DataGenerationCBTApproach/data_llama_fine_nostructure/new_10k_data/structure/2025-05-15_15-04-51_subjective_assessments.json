The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare, illuminating the empty spaces between tables where friends and family had once joined her. A young couple walked by, hand in hand, their conversation hushed but joyful; she felt a pang in her chest as they vanished into the crowd.\n\nThe doctor next to her caught her eye, flashing a tired smile before returning to his phone. She watched him type out a message, then glance up at the clock on the wall – already 30 minutes past their scheduled break. The hospital was quieting down, but she remained seated, unsure why she hadn't gotten up to leave like everyone else. The silence from the other attendees grew thicker, punctuated only by the occasional clinking of cups or rustling of papers. Her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number, but she let it go unanswered, lost in the weight of her own solitude.<|eot_id|>",

They were all holding hands and dancing to music, while she was sitting alone on a rock, watching them. It made her feel left out and sad. When someone is always talking about how much they love their partner, she thinks they must be lying. If they say they're happy, it means they're just pretending. Every time someone says \"I'm so grateful for my husband,\" she wonders what there is to be grateful for. Maybe he doesn't even care about her. Every time someone has a whole family with kids, she assumes they have terrible parents who never cared for them. When she sees couples celebrating their anniversaries, she thinks they must hate each other. When someone says they have a perfect family, she believes they're just making excuses because they don't really fit that description."

It didn't help when others spoke over him, their words blurring together as they discussed the intricacies of data analysis. The meetings were chaotic, with everyone talking at once, and he felt like an outsider, unable to contribute. When the boss called him aside, she looked frustrated, her expression a mix of disappointment and concern. She asked if he understood the material, and he shook his head, feeling like he was drowning in a sea of information. The silence that followed was deafening. Everyone else seemed to know exactly what was going on, while he struggled to make sense of anything. The air was thick with tension, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was failing somehow.

This is my life, and no one gets it. I’m tired of being seen as a victim, tired of feeling like I need to justify every tear, every whisper, every silent scream. Tired of people saying, “Oh, poor him,” when all I want is someone to hear me, to see me, to remember me.

We were meant to be, and I still hold out hope that we can make things right someday. Even though she’s clearly moved on (she’s dating someone new), I can't shake off the feeling that maybe if I reached out, she might reconsider our relationship. It’s crazy how quickly your mind can spiral into thoughts like this. One minute you’re fine, and the next you’re wondering if she’ll ever forgive you for leaving. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just addicted to the idea of being with her, even if it means hurting myself in the process. Maybe deep down, I know I have no business reaching out again.
