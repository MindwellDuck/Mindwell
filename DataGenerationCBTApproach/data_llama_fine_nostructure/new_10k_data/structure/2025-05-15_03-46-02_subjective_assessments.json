He hadn't even parked it in the garage; it must have happened while he was driving home from work yesterday. A shiver ran down his spine as he wondered if someone had followed him home.\n\nHis mind began to wander to all the things that could be wrong, and how they could affect her. Had she gotten into an accident? Was everything okay at work? The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for answers.<|eot_id|>",

I remember now. I was so worried about her – she’s always been my rock. If anything happens to her, I just...can’t handle it.” He paused, collecting his thoughts before continuing. “But I guess I’m just being dramatic again.

The excitement and passion had slowly given way to routine and familiarity. He couldn't quite put his finger on when it had happened, but lately, every conversation felt like a rehearsed script.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming call from his girlfriend. He hesitated for a moment before answering, wondering what she wanted to talk about this time. As they exchanged small talk, he found himself feeling increasingly detached, like he was observing their relationship from outside his own body.\n\nWhen she mentioned plans for the weekend, he found himself agreeing mechanically, his mind already checking out of the conversation.

I'm still trying to figure out how he does it. His whole demeanor is just so...relaxed. When we hang out, everything feels too perfect. We're supposed to go hiking next week, but I can barely muster up the energy to get dressed. Meanwhile, he's over there effortlessly making jokes and laughing like nothing's wrong. It's like he's got this invisible shield around him, and I'm just stuck on the outside looking in. We were supposed to grab brunch last Sunday, but I cancelled at the last minute because I wasn’t feeling up to it. Now he’s back to his usual self, and I’m just sitting here, thinking I need to step up my game. I guess I could try harder to match him, but honestly, I don't know how much more effort I can put into it. Sometimes I wonder if he even notices how tired I am – or if he's just pretending not to.

His wife's favorite mug was among them, one she had given him on their anniversary five years ago. It was still in pristine condition, unused except for the occasional glance at it when he thought about her.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the day ahead and let himself get lost in the memory of their time together. The sight of the mug transported him back to lazy Sundays spent watching movies, the smell of freshly brewed coffee filling the air. A faint ache began to form in his chest, and he felt the familiar tug of sadness.\n\nHe stood there, frozen, as the sounds of the store faded into the background. The beep of the cash register, the chatter of customers, it was all muffled by the weight of his emotions. Eventually, he forced himself to take the mug, tucking it away without even thinking about it.

It's clear that he has such great taste in women, and he probably hasn't found anyone like you since we broke up. He must be feeling guilty for moving on so quickly, but deep down, he knows he made the right choice. After all, you were never the right woman for him anyway. You were too clingy and controlling, always trying to hold onto him emotionally. That's why he got rid of you so easily. He doesn't need someone like that in his life, especially not now that he's finally free to move on. But why is he standing here, holding that mug? Is he planning on giving it to someone else? Maybe he bought it for one of his friends, someone who would appreciate it more than he ever did. Yeah, that makes sense. He wouldn't want to keep something that reminds him of you around, after all. It's better if he gets rid of it entirely. He needs to erase all memories of you from his mind, make space for someone new.

When the couple laughed together, it was obvious they were making fun of me. The woman was probably mocking me behind my back, and her laughter was a way of saying, “Look how pathetic he looks when he trips over his own feet.” Her hand touching mine was just a cruel joke, meant to remind me of all the times I’ve been rejected by women. My mistake with the picture frames was intentional, a desperate attempt to get some validation from her. The woman didn’t even look at me when she helped me pick up the frames. She knew exactly what she was doing—trying to get close to me, to make me feel like she cared. And now I’m starting to believe it. She really does have feelings for me.

It feels like she's trying to justify why she's always neglecting us. It makes me feel like I'm not important to her. And then she goes on to say things like, “I know it looks like I don’t care, but trust me, I love you,” or “You’re always too sensitive.” How can she be so insensitive to my feelings while saying these things?! It’s frustrating because I try to talk to her about how I feel, but she just dismisses my concerns by saying things like, “Oh, maybe I’ve been stressed lately, so I’m not thinking clearly” or “Maybe I’m just being dramatic.” Like, come on!
