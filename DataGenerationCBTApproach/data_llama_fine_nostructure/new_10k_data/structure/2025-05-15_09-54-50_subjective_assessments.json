They were standing by the coffee machine, but what caught his attention was the way Mark's eyes seemed to linger on Emma's hair as he handed her a cup of coffee. \n\nAs he waited for his own coffee, he couldn't shake off the feeling that Mark had done something more than just hand Emma a cup of coffee. He noticed how close they stood, their shoulders almost touching, and the way Emma playfully rolled her eyes at one of Mark's jokes.\n\nWhen it was finally his turn to grab a cup, he filled it with exactly two sugars, just like Emma liked it. As he turned to leave, he overheard Mark say, 'I'm glad you're enjoying your day so far.' The tone was friendly, but it sent a shiver down his spine.<|eot_id|>",

He felt his jaw tighten, the familiar sensation of his face growing hot beneath his stubble. She was right, of course – everything he wrote was sloppy, amateurish, unworthy of their publication.\n\nThe more she talked, the more he found himself zoning out, his mind wandering to all the other journalists who had it together – the ones who got scoops, who won awards, who were actually worth reading. His editor's voice cut through the haze, shrill now, demanding to know why he couldn't just write something worthwhile for once.\n\nA stranger at the next table over started snoring softly, the sound vibrating through the air as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. The barista refilled his cup with a clatter, jolting him back to the conversation.
