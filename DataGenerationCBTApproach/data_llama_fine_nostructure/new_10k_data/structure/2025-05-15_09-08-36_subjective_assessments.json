The conversation was about the upcoming restaurant inspection, and how it seemed like Alex's rival chef had been deliberately sabotaging their kitchen all week.\n\nHer hands moved on autopilot as she served the final courses, but her mind was elsewhere, replaying the texts and seething at the thought of Alex being so careless.

As she finished preparing dinner, the tension in the air felt palpable. It wasn't just the aroma of her cooking that lingered; there was an undercurrent of frustration emanating from Alex himself. It started with the simple act of turning off the stove, a gesture that seemed almost deliberate. He didn't even look up, his gaze still fixed on the phone as if trying to process something. The way he sat down beside her, his body language stiff, made her wonder if he was more upset than she realized. His usual warmth seemed to have vanished, replaced by a cold, calculating demeanor that unsettled her. When they began clearing the tables together, the silence between them grew thicker. Every action felt forced, each glance a subtle challenge. Even the simplest tasks became a source of contention, as if every movement was a declaration of discontent. The atmosphere was heavy with unspoken emotions, making her question whether this was truly a moment for intimacy. Perhaps Alex's behavior was driven by the stress of the inspection, which had clearly taken its toll on him. Maybe he was simply tired and needed time to unwind. But as she watched him, she couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to his actions, something beneath the surface that neither of them was willing to acknowledge. This sense of unease lingered long after they finished cleaning, leaving her to ponder"

The same words echoed in her head now – 'you're so lazy' – and she felt the familiar sting of shame creeping up her neck.\n\nThe water turned off, but she didn't dry her hands.

But for her, nothing was perfect, and every day felt like another reminder of her shortcomings. Her husband had said she'd missed another workout, and his words cut deeper than any criticism could have. He wasn't wrong; she hadn't even bothered to show up yesterday. As she stood there, staring at her reflection, the memories flooded back - her mother, constantly criticizing her appearance, telling her she wasn't good enough. Those words still lingered, echoing in her mind like a mantra: \"You're not doing enough.\" It started with small things - skipping a lunchtime walk, opting out of a family outing, staying home from work instead of going out with friends.

The speaker assumes that the situation is getting worse due to understaffing, despite no empirical evidence supporting this claim. They attribute the tragic events to the lack of resources, rather than considering other factors. By linking their feelings directly to reality, they fail to critically evaluate information and instead rely on their emotions to shape their judgment. This biased thinking prevents"
