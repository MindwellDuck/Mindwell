Instead, he ambled over to the prep station, giving her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek before claiming the stool beside her.\n\nShe tried to focus on the dish ahead, but her attention kept drifting back to John's disheveled appearance. A few minutes later, he reached out and snagged a spoonful of sauce from her hand, bringing it to his lips without asking.

The air was thick with tension, and I couldn't help but feel like I was walking on eggshells around him. # My Reaction It seemed clear that John was either completely sober or utterly drunk. He hadn't made any effort to hide his intoxication, nor had he shown any remorse for his behavior. I found myself torn between disappointment and frustration, unsure whether to be angry about his lack of self-control or disappointed by his apparent disregard for my feelings. In retrospect, I realize that my reaction was largely driven by this binary thinking. I tended to view John's actions as either entirely acceptable or completely unacceptable, failing to see the nuances in between. This tendency led me to feel like I was stuck in a cycle of \"all or nothing,\" where every interaction with him felt like a moral judgment rather than a complex emotional experience. Despite my best efforts to remain calm, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pulled into a world where right and wrong were clearly defined. It was as if I'd entered a realm where black-and-white labels replaced the rich shades of gray that real life often presented. In that moment, I struggled to find a middle ground, and my emotions swirled around me like a maelstrom, leaving me feeling lost and uncertain.

He quickly processed the transaction, trying to focus on the next item in line, but his mind kept drifting back to the amount. How could someone afford to spend that much? And why did he seem so... carefree about it?\n\nThe cashier ahead of them finished her transaction and began gathering her things, and Aiden found himself mechanically scanning the items in front of him, his hands moving on autopilot.

I don’t understand why I married someone who doesn’t seem to care about anything except his job. He works hard, yes, but he also makes time for me when he can. I’m constantly fighting for attention, trying to keep us balanced. But does he ever try? Does he really listen to me? Or is everything just about him and his career? I just want to scream sometimes.
