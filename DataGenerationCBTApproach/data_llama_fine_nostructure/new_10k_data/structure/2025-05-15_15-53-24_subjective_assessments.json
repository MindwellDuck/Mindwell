The morning sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the cluttered mess, making it seem even more overwhelming. As she poured herself another cup, her mind began to wander to the upcoming hospital meeting where she'd have to discuss the budget cuts affecting her department.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to her late husband, who had always been supportive of her work. She recalled how he'd often asked about her patients and listened intently when she shared stories about them. A pang of worry crept up as she wondered if she was doing enough to ensure their legacy lived on – not just in her practice, but also in her own well-being.\n\nAs she set the cup down, her gaze fell upon a photo of her husband, taken on their anniversary three years ago. It was an ordinary moment, yet it seemed like a lifetime ago. The memory sparked a flurry of anxious thoughts: What would he say if he were here now? Would he be proud of the decisions she'd made? Should she be taking on more debt to keep the practice afloat?<|eot_id|>",

When she's doing this, it feels like time stands still – nothing else matters except whatever thoughts are swirling through her head. Sometimes it looks so intense that you wonder what she's thinking, but other times it seems so disconnected that you feel like she's just zoning out. Either way, it's hard to ignore. When she gets like this, it makes me realize how much she hates being alone. Even though we're close friends, there are moments when I get the sense that she wishes I wouldn’t be here. Maybe it’s because I see right through her – I know exactly what she’s thinking. But honestly, it doesn’t bother me; I’m used to it by now. We both have our ways of dealing with loneliness, and hers is just...different. It's almost as if she has her own private world going on inside her head, separate from reality.

What if they transferred her to a different school where she’d have to start over from scratch? Even the small tasks, like ordering new supplies or attending staff meetings, became overwhelming challenges. What if she messed up an order, and the kids ended up going without essential materials? What if she said something stupid at the staff meeting and everyone thought she was incompetent? Every decision felt like a gamble, every action a risk.
