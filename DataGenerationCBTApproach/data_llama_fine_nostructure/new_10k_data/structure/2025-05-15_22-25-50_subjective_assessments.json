He remembered how she'd once said, \"If you want to start your own restaurant, you have to be willing to take some risks.\" His eyes drifted back to the menu, and he couldn't help but wonder what she would say if she saw the dishes he'd prepared. Would she approve of his attempt to innovate? He imagined her giving him a stern look, saying, \"This isn't enough; you need to think bigger.\" A chill ran down his spine as he realized that maybe she was right. Maybe he was holding himself back by being too cautious. Just then, his sous chef walked into the kitchen and asked for feedback on the main course. Chef smiled, taking a deep breath, and replied, \"Well, I'm thinking—\" But before he could finish, his wife interrupted, \"So, are you guys ready for the tasting?\" Her tone was confident, almost dismissive.

She couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing him. That no matter how many lives she saved, how many secrets she uncovered, she was just delaying death. The pain of losing him lingered, a constant ache that made every success feel hollow. Every day, she pushed through the exhaustion, the fear, and the loneliness. Yet, with each small win, the grief intensified, until it felt like a living thing, crawling under her skin. She wondered if she was making a difference, or simply prolonging the inevitable.
