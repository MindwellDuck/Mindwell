Her mind replayed the argument they'd had the night before, the words still raw: 'You're always putting your patients first, never us.' She recalled the countless nights she'd spent pulling all-nighters at the hospital while he slept soundly at home.\n\nThe elevator stopped, and she walked down the hallway, her footsteps echoing off the walls.

The bouquet of flowers was just another proof that she wasn't important enough to be included in the conversation. Every glance, every word, every action was a personal attack. She wondered if Dr. Thompson was trying to tell her something, but she didn't want to hear it. She was convinced that everything was happening because of what happened between her and her ex-fiancé. She felt like she was losing herself in this situation. Nothing made sense except for the pain that kept growing inside her. She didn't know what to do anymore. She thought about calling him, but then she realized that would make it worse. She tried to push through the anxiety, but it was hard.

The group of students gathered around me looked at me with curiosity, and I felt my anxiety spike. It wasn't just the situation itself that made me uncomfortable; it was the way others interacted with me. They would often ask invasive questions, making me feel like they were trying to uncover something about me that I didn't want them to know. It was as if they saw me as someone who needed to be fixed, rather than respected as an individual. Every interaction left me feeling drained, like I was carrying around a weight that no one else could see. I tried to brush off these feelings by focusing on my own goals. I wanted to prove myself, show that I was more than just a struggling student. But every time I opened my mouth, I felt like I was saying something wrong, like I was walking on eggshells, never knowing when my words might be misinterpreted. I started to doubt myself, wondering if I really was capable of achieving anything significant. Despite all this, there was one thing that gave me hope—a book I had read months ago.
