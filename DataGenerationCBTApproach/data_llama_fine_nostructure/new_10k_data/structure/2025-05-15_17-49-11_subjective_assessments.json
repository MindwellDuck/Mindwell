Meanwhile, I'm just over here struggling to make simple meals. Even Emily, who's always been super insecure about herself, seems to be doing well. Her husband is into tech and always talks about how it’s changing the world, and she’s just as smart. What am I even missing? It’s like every time I see someone having fun, I feel like I’m stuck in the same old boring life. Even my best friend who recently broke up with her boyfriend now has a cute new guy by her side. He seems so much happier than me—always laughing, going on adventures, or just enjoying a quiet evening with his partner. They can’t stop talking about how great their relationship is, which makes me feel like a total loser. I swear, whenever I look at them, I just want to give up. Life just doesn’t seem fair sometimes. # This response reflects the cognitive distortion \"Unfair Comparisons\" because it assumes that the narrator is inferior compared to others who are perceived as superior.
