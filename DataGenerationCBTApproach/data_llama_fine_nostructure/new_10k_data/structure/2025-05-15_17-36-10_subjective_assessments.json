Her shift had been chaotic since morning, and now it seemed like no matter how hard she worked, there was always something else that needed attention.\n\nThe phone rang again, shrill in the quiet store. She hesitated, wondering if she really wanted to deal with whatever issue the caller had. But it wasn't her decision.

People are getting frustrated, and I get it. It's stressful working here, especially when things get busy. But sometimes I wonder if she’s just avoiding things instead of dealing with them head-on. Maybe it's not about being stressed; maybe it's about feeling stuck or not having control over the situation. That would explain why she seems distracted lately. Still, I can’t help but think she might be using the workload as an excuse. It’s possible she just needs to find a better way to manage her time. If we were closer, I’d ask her directly, but we’re not. Anyway, I guess everyone deals with stress differently. It's okay if she doesn’t want to talk about it, even if I wish she would. That’s what coworkers are for, right? Maybe she does need to take a step back and prioritize self-care. Even though I think she might be putting everything on herself, I still think it’s worth talking to her about it. We could grab lunch sometime and chat about what’s going on.

The young man's wife, seated nearby, looked up from her phone, oblivious to the exchange. The older nurse's heart skipped a beat as she quickly busied herself with charting, trying to shake off the sensation of being replaced.\n\nLater, while changing the sheets in the room down the hall, she found a small note tucked between the mattress and the wall – a birthday card from her granddaughter, with a hastily scribbled message: 'Love you, Grandma.' It was a simple gesture, but it only made her feel more anxious about the attention the younger nurse was receiving.<|eot_id|>",

That look when he came over to help her was nothing but a ploy to get under her skin, and now she's acting all innocent, like she doesn't know what's going on. But we both know exactly what's happening here. She wants to steal his job, and if she can get close enough to him, maybe even replace him. The fact that she's been flirting with him since the first day is just proof of how obvious this whole situation is. If I don't keep a close eye on things, they'll figure out how to work together and take each other's jobs. I've seen it happen before, and I won't let it happen again.

He said that she was there in the colors, in the way the light hit the canvas, and even in the shapes of things we used to paint together. It was almost as if he thought she was still with us, guiding him through his art. And though I understood why he held on so tightly to these memories, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was just another form of denial. Wasn’t it time for him to let go? To acknowledge that she was really gone? This wasn't supposed to happen. I was supposed to meet him at the gallery, to share some words of encouragement.
