Her mind began to wander to her part-time job, which seemed to be sucking the life out of her.\n\nJust then, a woman approached the counter, asking about a return policy on a dress she had bought three days ago. As she processed the request, she couldn't help but think about how many other returns she would have to process over the next few weeks – all because people like this woman couldn't even be bothered to try on clothes before buying them.\n\nThe woman smiled sweetly, handed over her receipt, and walked away, leaving her standing alone behind the counter once again. As she watched her go, she felt a familiar emptiness creeping in, like a weight settling onto her chest.
