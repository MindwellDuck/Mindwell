The nurse's log showed he'd administered the wrong medication, causing a fatal allergic reaction.\n\nHis wife turned to him, her eyes searching for reassurance. \"How are you doing? You've been distant all day.\" He forced a weak smile, trying to deflect attention from his own guilt-ridden thoughts. \n\nAs they walked out of the hospital together, hand in hand, he couldn't shake off the memory of the beeping monitor and the look of desperation on the patient's face. A gentle tap on his shoulder broke the silence. A colleague handed him a sheet of paper with the latest patient statistics.\n\nThe numbers blurred together, but one caught his eye - a young mother who'd passed away due to a preventable medication error. His stomach dropped as he thought about the similarities between their stories. The sound of his wife's voice brought him back to reality, but the feeling of unease lingered, refusing to dissipate.<|eot_id|>",

I noticed how he avoided eye contact when discussing the incident, choosing instead to focus on the patient's chart. When asked if he was okay, he brushed it off with a casual shrug, saying, “Just tired.” Yet, despite his attempts at nonchalance, I sensed an undercurrent of anxiety. His eyes darted towards the door, as if searching for an escape route. Every so often, he would pause, take a deep breath, and then continue speaking, but there was an unmistakable sense of discomfort emanating from him. It felt like he was holding something inside, struggling to find the right words. When he finally spoke up, his tone was laced with hesitation, almost as if he was tiptoeing around the truth. I could tell he wasn’t ready to confront whatever was bothering him, and yet, he seemed determined to push through. I wondered what might have triggered this emotional turmoil and whether he truly believed himself to be fine, or if there was more to the story than he let on."

Her hands trembled slightly as she placed the papers into order, her eyes drifting toward the exit door.\n\nJust then, the principal's voice came over the intercom, announcing the school would be hosting a fundraiser tonight – a charity bake sale.
