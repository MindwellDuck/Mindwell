As the conversation continued, it became increasingly difficult to keep up, and I couldn’t help but feel that she was holding me back. Despite my best efforts, I found myself getting frustrated.

The teacher sighed inwardly, remembering the countless hours spent trying to reach this child, only to be met with apathy and disrespect.\n\nAs she put the paper back down, her gaze fell upon the stack of ungraded tests, each one a reminder of the time she was investing in these students' education.

It feels like they're more interested in avoiding work than actually learning anything. Even if they didn’t want to study, why would you expect them to excel when they don’t even try? It’s not fair. I’ve given up on some of these kids already. They might get by in school, but they’ll never amount to much else. Mark my words, none of them will ever change their ways or become productive members of society. I hate myself for wasting my life helping them, knowing I'll never see results.

Instead of celebrating, he spent the whole day wondering what he did wrong and how he could stop being so annoying. And now he’s stuck with this stupid cough, which is probably why he missed the party for the new team members. The officer seemed really happy, though. I mean, who wouldn’t want a new car? But no, he kept complaining about how much he hated the new bike he got instead of focusing on how cool it was. Then there was the time he went on vacation and forgot to bring his phone charger, making him feel guilty about spending more than $1000 on an amazing trip.
