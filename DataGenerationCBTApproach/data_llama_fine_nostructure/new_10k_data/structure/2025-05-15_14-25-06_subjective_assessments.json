I couldn't help but feel like an intruder in my own home, standing awkwardly by the kitchen counter while she rummaged through the cupboards. Every creak of the old wooden floor beneath my feet made me jump, and the way she paused mid-sentence, her head cocked to one side, sent shivers down my spine. Her voice was low and husky, sending a thrill through me that left me breathless—yet somehow, utterly disconnected from reality. As she moved closer, I could smell the sweet scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the pot sitting on the counter. But all I could think about was how this moment felt so eerily similar to the last time I'd tried to reconnect with her. We were supposed to meet for brunch, but instead, she just stared at me with this...this empty look in her eyes, like she was seeing right through me. It was as if she wasn't even really there. I remember feeling so lost, so scared, that day, but now, it all came flooding back, and I couldn't help but wonder what had really happened. I glanced over at the clock, and suddenly realized I was running late. Yet, despite the anxiety building inside me, I found myself stuck in this strange loop, replaying every interaction with her, rehashing every argument. How did it come to"
