Her gaze swept across the room before meeting his, a hint of surprise flickering across her face. She quickly looked away, focusing on the conversation unfolding between them. She had always been one to keep people at arm’s length, never letting anyone get too close. I’ve learned to respect that boundary. But now, as I watched her laugh with someone else, something inside me stirred. Maybe it was the way she seemed so comfortable around this new guy, or how easily they connected. Whatever it was, it made me feel like I’d lost my footing. The noise in the coffee shop grew louder, and I found myself zoning out, replaying every argument we’d had in our relationship. I remembered the times she'd left early, the nights she spent out with friends, and the days when she didn't show up at all. It wasn’t fair to let those memories consume me, but they did anyway. The thought of her with someone else fueled my anger, making it hard to breathe. When it was my turn to order, I just muttered a quick hello to the barista.

He felt a sudden urge to spit, and his mind began to wander to all the places this could have been – food courts, public transportation, hospitals like his own.\n\nA shiver ran down his spine as he carefully set the package back on the counter, his hand instinctively reaching for the nearby trash can.

She didn't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary, which only added to his confusion. Her expression remained serene, but there was a hint of distraction in her eyes, almost as if she was trying to ignore something. \"She must be too tired to care,\" he muttered, his tone laced with disappointment. \"But why is she sitting here when she knows I'm going to need help getting ready?\" His question hung in the air, unsaid, but the underlying frustration was clear. \"What am I missing?\" As he stood there, lost in thought, his body began to tense up.
