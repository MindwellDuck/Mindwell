Like I haven't had enough on my plate already.\n\nI stood outside the conference room, fidgeting with my badge, trying to calm my racing heart. My wife, God bless her, had left me a sweet note this morning telling me she'd be late due to a work thing, but now it was pushing 30 minutes past their usual arrival time.\n\nMy gut told me something was off. It always did when my wife was running late. She'd call, text, or just show up, never leaving me hanging like this. My mind started spinning with worst-case scenarios - did she get into an accident? Did she meet someone else?\n\nI took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for whatever was about to go down. I pushed open the door and slipped inside, trying to look confident as I scanned the room for the department head.\n\n\"Ah, Chief,\" I said, attempting a smile. \"Good morning.\"\n\nHe looked up from his notes, a hint of annoyance on his face. \"Morning, officer. Please, have a seat.\"\n\nI dropped into the chair across from him, trying to appear nonchalant despite the growing knot in my stomach. This wasn't going to be good. Not today.<|eot_id|>",

I know he's busy, but does he really need to treat me like shit?! This isn't the first time we're scheduled at the same time, and he knows I'm here early, ready to roll. So why the fuck doesn't he show up on time?! And then there’s the whole thing with the meeting. They rescheduled it last minute because of some stupid mistake, and now I’ve got nothing but a bunch of pointless paperwork to deal with instead of actual work. The fact that they didn’t bother to tell me means they don’t care about my time, right? I swear, if this keeps happening, I’m gonna lose it. Maybe I’ll just skip the meeting and walk out.

His latest business venture was taking off, and I couldn't help but feel like I was just a prop in his game.\n\nI thought back to all the times I'd encouraged him, attended his meetings, and even helped with the marketing. But did he ever return the favor? No, instead, he'd use my passion for art as a way to validate his own accomplishments.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting me back to happier times. I remembered when we first met, and he'd been so impressed by my artwork. He'd promised to support me, to let me pursue my dreams.\n\nBut now, those promises seemed hollow.\n\nI began to frantically clean up the mess of paintbrushes and canvases, my mind racing with thoughts of revenge. How could I make him see that my art was worth something? That it wasn't just some hobby, but a part of who I was?\n\nAs I scrubbed at a stubborn stain, a sly smile spread across my face. Maybe it was time to take matters into my own hands. Maybe it was time to show him what I was truly capable of.\n\nThe sound of my own laughter sent shivers down my spine. It was a cold, mirthless sound, but it was mine. And in that moment, I knew exactly what I had to do.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe it's just stress from work.\" His wife nodded sympathetically. \"Have you talked to our boss about anything specific?\" \"I...I think I'll talk to him soon.\" \"It might be helpful to take some time off, too,\" she suggested gently. \"Maybe we can go for a walk together tomorrow?\" John forced a small smile, grateful for her support. \"Yeah, sounds good.\" But as they headed upstairs to bed, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was losing control, and no one was there to help him."
