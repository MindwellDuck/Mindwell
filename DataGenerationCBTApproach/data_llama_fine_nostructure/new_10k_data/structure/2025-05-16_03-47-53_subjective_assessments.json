        "Triggering Event": "I'm sitting at my desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of me. Just another day, another dollar... or so I keep telling myself. But what's the point, really? It's all just a never-ending cycle of patients, paperwork, and bills.\n\nMy mind starts to wander, as it usually does, to what could've been. To Sarah and the life we built together. I thought we had forever, but forever came and went, leaving me with nothing but memories and regret.\n\nSuddenly, my phone rings. It's the hospital administrator. They need me to come down to the ER immediately. Some kid's heart has stopped beating and they need me to save him. Or so they say.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of dread that's been building up inside me all morning. I mean, I've done this a thousand times before. I'm a doctor, after all. I can handle it.\n\nBut as I'm getting ready to leave, I see a picture of me and Sarah on my desk. We're smiling, happy, in love. I hadn't seen it in years, but something about it catches my eye today. Maybe it's the panic rising up inside me, or maybe it's just nostalgia.\n\nEither way, I feel a lump form in my throat as I look at that picture. I try to swallow it down, but it's too late. The panic sets in, making my hands shake and my heart pound in my chest.\n\nI take one last look at the picture, then force myself to focus on the task at hand. I have a job to do, after all. I'll get through this, I tell myself. I always do.\n\nBut as I'm walking out of the office, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And for a moment, I see a stranger staring back at me – a stranger who's lost his way, who's struggling to hold onto the past. And that's when it hits me: I'm not just a doctor, I'm a man on the edge.<|eot_id|>",

Shouldn’t I have been there for her? Shouldn’t I have tried harder? These thoughts swirl around me like a toxic storm, reminding me of the mistakes I made. Mistakes that haunt me still—mistakes that I tell myself should not exist. But they do, and they linger. It’s hard to accept that I’m not the hero I once imagined myself to be. That I wasn’t the strong, confident person I wanted to be. No, I failed her. I failed us. And now, I’m left with the guilt of knowing I couldn’t save her. I remember the countless nights I spent wondering why she felt so alone, why she seemed so distant. Why she kept pushing me away. I knew it was because she didn’t trust me anymore. But I couldn’t help but blame myself for everything. I told myself that I should’ve been there for her, that I should’ve been stronger, that I should’ve been better. Now, every time I think about our relationship, I feel like I’m drowning in the weight of those \"shoulds.\" They consume me, making me relive the pain of losing her over and over again. Each day, I wake up, and those thoughts rush back. I tell myself that I should be working towards healing, that I should be moving forward"
