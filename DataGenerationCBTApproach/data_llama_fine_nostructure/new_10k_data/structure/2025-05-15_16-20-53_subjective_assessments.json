The morning rush was about to start, and she still needed to finish reviewing the patient charts for her first shift. As she scanned the room, her eyes landed on a familiar face - Dr. Thompson, the attending physician who had been critical of her care during a recent peer review.\n\nHe caught her eye, smiled condescendingly, and began walking towards her, his stride purposefully slow. She felt a knot form in her stomach, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios and all the ways she'd failed. Her hands tightened around the cup, the ceramic cold against her palms as she struggled to breathe. The sounds of the cafeteria receded into the background, replaced by the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears.<|eot_id|>",

A year had passed since her passing, yet the ache within him still lingered – a dull hum he'd grown accustomed to, but couldn't silence.\n\nAs he dipped his brush into the vibrant colors of the cityscape unfolding before him, his gaze drifted toward the photograph on his easel. The one where she smiled, arms wrapped around him, and their children's laughter echoed through the frame.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the otherwise quiet space. He hesitated, hand hovering above the canvas as if reluctant to begin anew. It was a call from his daughter's school, reminding him of an upcoming art show. His stomach twisted, memories of similar events flooding back.\n\nA faint tremble ran through his fingers as he tried to steady himself. He took a deep breath, letting go of the fragile thread of control, and let the paint flow onto the canvas once more. This time, it wasn't about capturing beauty; it was about exorcising the pain that clung to every stroke.<|eot_id|>",

If you want to remember her, fine. But don’t turn her into some kind of idol. That’s just creepy. This whole situation makes me sick. He’s always acting like he’s better than everyone else because of his “artistic talent” and now he gets sympathy? Please.

His mind kept drifting back to their conversations, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t doing enough. She deserved more, better things, and he knew it. But he didn’t know how to make it happen. The silence between them grew louder, and he realized it wasn’t just his thoughts that filled the space. There was something else there, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. It was as if the air itself had changed, thickening into an unspoken tension. It was just another day, another reminder of the same old struggles. The hospital was full of patients like hers, each one fighting their own battle against the clock.

But then again, I remember how hard he worked to become a cop in the first place. Maybe he genuinely struggles with depression or anxiety now that he’s retired. Still, the reality is that he’s always been lazy. I’ve tried to get him to move out so he could find a job, but he just makes excuses and tells me he needs more time. I swear, if I didn’t have kids to raise, I’d cut him off completely. But my daughter looks up to him – she thinks he’s still her hero.
