Why couldn't they understand the depth of her grief?\n\nJohn, oblivious to the storm brewing inside her, continued talking, his voice chipper and carefree.

It really sucks that John doesn't get it—she's been dealing with this shit for years, and it still hits her hard. He has no idea what it's like to lose someone you loved so deeply, especially when you think about all the good times you shared. I'm sure she'll realize soon enough that she overreacted and apologized later, but it's too late for that now. John deserves better than someone as self-centered as her. At least his own family isn't as toxic as hers. His wife is perfect—the complete opposite of her. John must feel so relieved to have escaped all the drama. Why does she always have to make everything about herself? It’s such a waste of time, and John’s already busy enough. This whole thing is probably just some stupid misunderstanding anyway. If she didn’t have such a big mouth, none of this would’ve happened. Now she’ll never forgive herself, and John will suffer because of her stupidity.
