The price tag was eye-catching – nearly twice as much as their club's annual pot.\n\nAs the game progressed, Margaret effortlessly raked in wins, often taking advantage of the doctor's own strategic blunders to acquire new cards. Her smug satisfaction after each victory only fueled the doctor's growing irritation. \n\nWhen it was finally time to settle the scores, the doctor discovered she'd inadvertently lost a substantial amount due to Margaret's clever manipulation of the deck. As they tallied up the final tally, Margaret casually mentioned that she'd invested in a pricey golf vacation next month.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't just the money she was taking from our small club that bothered me; it was the way she seemed so pleased with herself for every little trick. Every time she won, she'd smile triumphantly, like she'd pulled off some sort of elaborate prank. And then there was the expensive-looking cane she'd brought along, sitting proudly at her table - its price tag glinted in the light, making it almost as if she was flaunting it. I found myself wondering how someone as wealthy as Margaret could afford such extravagant accessories, especially when our entire club's annual fund barely covered the costs of the venue rental alone. After the game ended, I caught her mentioning something about a pricey golf trip she was planning next month. While I tried to keep my cool, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was rubbing it in somehow, enjoying the fact that she was coming out ahead not just in the games but also in terms of personal investments. When I saw her display those canes, I felt like she was openly boasting about how well off she was compared to the rest of us. The whole thing made me feel resentful, like I was being left behind by someone who didn’t seem to care about anyone else’s feelings. It all culminated in a rather heated conversation with Margaret during the post-game discussion. She seemed completely un"

We were always friends, but after graduation, we kind of drifted apart. Now, whenever I see him, it feels like time has passed us by too much. He got married, started a family, and moved away. Meanwhile, I'm still working on my Ph.D., barely scraping together enough money to make ends meet. It feels like everyone else's life is moving forward while mine gets stuck in place. Even worse is when I think about how I could have changed things if only I’d taken different paths. Maybe I would’ve ended up with a job I loved, traveling, making more money, being happier. But no, instead, I’m stuck here, struggling to find meaning in a world that seems to pass me by. It’s like every decision I made led me further down this path of disappointment. I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering what I did wrong, why things didn’t turn out as planned.

He read silently, lost in the pages of his novel, oblivious to her inner turmoil. She felt a twinge of resentment, wondering why he wouldn't share his thoughts or offer comfort.
