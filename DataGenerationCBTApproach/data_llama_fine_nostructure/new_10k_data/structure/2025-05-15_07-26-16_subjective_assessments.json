A few moments into the presentation, however, Rachel accidentally knocked over her cup, spilling scalding hot coffee all over the notes and slides that had been hastily printed out overnight.\n\nThe classroom fell silent as the students stared, aghast, at the spreading stain. One by one, they began to murmur apologies, but it was too late – the damage was done. The makeshift presentation lay in tatters, its contents now reduced to a sodden mess.\n\nA slow flush spread across Sarah's face as she realized the implications: this was meant to be her chance to showcase her work, and now it seemed irreparably ruined. She felt a familiar sting of embarrassment, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios as she frantically tried to salvage what was left of her presentation.<|eot_id|>",
