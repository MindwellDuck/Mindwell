She'd been struggling with addiction, and despite his best efforts, he'd failed to connect with her.\n\nOne student caught his eye - a bright-eyed rookie who reminded him of himself when he was younger. The officer's words trailed off as he watched the kid scribble furious notes, completely absorbed in the lesson. He felt a pang in his chest, remembering the countless hours he'd spent trying to help his daughter find her way, only to see her slip further into darkness.\n\nA moment later, the rookie approached him after class, seeking guidance on how to handle a particularly volatile situation.
