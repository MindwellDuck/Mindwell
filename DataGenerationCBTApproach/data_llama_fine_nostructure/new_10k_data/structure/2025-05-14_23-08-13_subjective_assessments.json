His wife, Sarah, had been working double shifts at the hospital, trying to make ends meet, but it seemed like no matter how hard they worked, they were still drowning in debt.\n\nHe thought back to when they first started their catering business together, full of dreams and ambition. They'd been the talk of the town, with foodies raving about their innovative dishes. But now, it felt like they were just trying to survive.\n\nAs he gazed out the window, watching the sun set over the city, John felt a crushing weight settle in his chest. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt this hopeless. It wasn't just the financial struggles; it was the feeling that they were losing themselves in the process.\n\nSarah walked into the kitchen, her eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep. She saw the look on John's face and knew exactly what was wrong. \"Hey, what's going on?\" she asked softly.\n\nJohn shook his head, unable to find the words. \"I don't know, I just feel like we're failing,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nSarah sat down beside him, taking his hand in hers. \"We're not failing, John. We're just having a tough time. We'll get through this, together.\"\n\nBut as John looked at her, he saw the doubt in her eyes too. And in that moment, he realized that maybe, just maybe, they weren't as strong as they thought they were. Maybe they were just two people clinging to a dream that was slipping away from them, one minute at a time.<|eot_id|>",

Then there was the guy who said I was going to die young, and honestly, if that’s true, then fuck you, universe. Why would you even do that? You’re supposed to give us good stuff, not bad luck. And don’t even get me started on those so-called “psychics” who claim to see our futures. They always come up with these ridiculous predictions that are meant to scare us into doing what they want—buying their stupid crystals, paying for their fake readings, or worse, giving them money like a damn fool. But here’s the thing: every time, I end up proving them wrong. My life is nothing like what they predicted. Instead, I’m dealing with everyday problems that seem impossible to solve. Like, seriously, can’t anyone see that fortune telling is nothing more than a scam? My best friend told me once that she’d seen a psychic say she’d have a baby girl named Luna. Well, guess what?

He heard her say, \"Hey, Alex!\"\n\nHe followed the sound, his gut twisting.

It wasn't just the uncertainty about the experiment; it was the possibility that their entire research could be for naught. That all their hard work, all their hopes, might boil down to nothing more than a costly mistake.\n\nRachel set the coffee down on the counter, concern etched on her face. \"It's okay, we'll figure it out together,\" she said softly.\n\nBut Dr. Thompson couldn't shake off the feeling of impending doom. What if they'd been duped? What if the university was hiding something?

She'd just performed a routine procedure, but it felt hollow. It was just another case, another patient, another paycheck.\n\nShe thought about all the years she'd dedicated to her career, sacrificing time with her family, putting off her own needs. Her husband had left her years ago, citing her demanding job as the reason. She hadn't seen him in over a decade now, but sometimes, like today, she still wondered what could've been if they'd stayed together.\n\nHer eyes wandered to the empty chair at the hospital cafeteria table, where she always sat alone during lunch. It wasn't until recently that she'd realized she didn't have anyone to share these moments with anymore. No colleagues to commiserate with, no family to turn to. Just her thoughts, echoing off the sterile walls.\n\nDr. Thompson took a sip of coffee, letting the bitterness wash down her throat. She remembered when she first started out, full of idealism and passion. Now, it just seemed like a chore. A never-ending cycle of bills to pay, patients to treat, and no one to come home to.\n\nAs she walked back to her locker, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Lines etched around her eyes, grey hairs peeking through her dark locks. Who was this woman staring back? Not the vibrant, carefree doctor she used to be.

She’s always been like that – never considering how her actions might impact others. And it’s not just the way she treats me; it’s how she’s treated everyone else throughout our lives. My parents, my friends, even strangers—she has a knack for making them feel insignificant, like they’re nothing more than an afterthought. It doesn’t even make sense. Why would someone who knows better choose to act that way? Is she just incapable of empathy? Or is she doing it on purpose? I remember the countless times she’d promised to change, promising to be more considerate, to put others first, but every promise ended in disappointment. Every time, she’d let her desires get the better of her, leaving us to pick up the pieces. And yet, despite everything, I still try to hold onto hope. Maybe someday she’ll finally see the error of her ways, learn to value others’ feelings, and become the person I know she can be. Until then, though, I’m left to wonder if anything will ever change."
