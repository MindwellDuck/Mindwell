She was known for her exceptional bedside manner and innovative approaches to patient care. He felt a pang of worry - would he ever be able to measure up to her standards? Would he always be seen as just another seasoned doctor, rather than a true leader?\n\nAs he continued to review the charts, his mind wandered to the upcoming board exam.

But instead of acknowledging his exhaustion, she started talking about new procedures and projects, acting like everything was perfect. What really threw me off was when she mentioned her own board exams, saying she was \"very proud\" of herself for passing with flying colors. Now, I know we're supposed to be supportive of each other, but honestly, it made me feel like she was rubbing it in my face. Like, yeah, you got this far, but I'm still struggling to get out of bed some mornings! I guess what bothered me most was how she seemed so confident and focused, while I was just trying to stay awake. She moved on to talk about her next presentation, completely ignoring the fact that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. It was like she forgot that I’m the one who’s been working overtime, barely getting enough sleep, and now I have these stupid brain fog symptoms.

She looked like she had given up on our relationship, just like everyone else. Captain James didn't have that problem - he had a perfect family. A wife who adores him, kids who love him, and a career where he's respected by all. In fact, I'm starting to think that he doesn't even need me anymore. Who needs a father figure like me when you have a whole world of loving parents? Maybe I've been holding onto this job for too long, clinging to something that no longer matters. Maybe it's time to let go, just like Captain James did with his past mistakes. After all, what's the point of keeping up if everything is already behind us? At least Captain James has moved on, and his life feels complete. Why can't I be like him? Why does it seem easier for others to move forward while I'm stuck in the past? Is it because they're just better people than me, or am I just not good enough? Captain James doesn't see me as a failure - he sees me as someone who needs guidance.
