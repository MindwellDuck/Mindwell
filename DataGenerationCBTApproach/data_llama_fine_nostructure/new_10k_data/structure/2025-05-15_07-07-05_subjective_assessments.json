The dimly lit ballroom, usually reserved for tedious networking sessions, had somehow managed to transform into a scene from a bygone era, complete with vintage jazz music and champagne toasts.\n\nAs I stood there, sipping my own glass of wine and attempting to maintain a composed demeanor, I found myself scrutinizing every detail of the evening. Every smile, every raised eyebrow, every effortless exchange between colleagues – all seemed to be somehow directed at him.\n\nI'd known it was coming; I'd sensed it all week, like a low-grade fever building in the back of my mind. And now, here we were, surrounded by the very people who should have been immune to his charms. \n\nBut what really set my teeth on edge was when he took her hand, just for a moment, as they both reached for the same canapé. The air around us seemed to thicken, and I felt my pulse quicken, my vision narrowing to a single point – their entwined fingers.\n\nI made a mental note to 'accidentally' schedule a meeting with her the next morning, under the guise of discussing some pressing medical protocol. Nothing out of the ordinary, merely a chance to spend a few extra minutes alone with her, away from prying eyes.\n\nLittle did I know, however, that fate had other plans. As I watched them laugh together, exchanging some inaudible joke, I felt my stomach twist into knots. It was then that I realized – I wasn't even sure why I cared so much.<|eot_id|>",

Or maybe he’s trying to make small talk and he doesn’t actually want to be near her. Maybe he’s just being polite. But no, I know better than that. He wants to fuck her. And she knows it too. She’s playing dumb. That’s what she always does. Always has. She thinks she’s above me, that I’m just some stupid little friend who will never see her in a different light. How can I keep pretending to be okay with all of this? Why am I pretending? Because if I don’t, I’ll lose him. And losing him would mean losing everything. My job, my home, my entire life.

Another day, another dollar, another reminder that she'd never find what she was looking for.\n\nShe thought back to the phone call earlier that morning – a young woman's frantic voice, begging for help, just like so many others before her. But this one was different; this one had been a lost cause from the start. And yet, here Jameson stood, drenched and miserable, wondering what she could've done differently.\n\nAs she turned the corner onto Main Street, the sound of shattering glass echoed through the air. Jameson's gut tightened; it sounded like another pointless call. She quickened her pace, her hand instinctively resting on the grip of her gun.\n\nA figure stumbled out of the alleyway, a look of shock etched across their face. \"Please...you have to help me,\" they stammered, but Jameson saw right through it – another fake emergency, another waste of her time.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Jameson radioed dispatch to send someone else to handle the situation. As she watched the figure disappear into the crowd, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing at this job, that she was nothing more than a glorified babysitter, doling out empty promises and hollow reassurances.\n\nThe rain intensified, soaking Jameson to the bone, but it was nothing compared to the chill that settled in her chest. She knew she'd see plenty more of these scenes today, plenty more chances to disappoint herself. And when the shift finally ended, and she trudged back to her car, she wondered why she bothered getting out of bed in the morning.<|eot_id|>",
