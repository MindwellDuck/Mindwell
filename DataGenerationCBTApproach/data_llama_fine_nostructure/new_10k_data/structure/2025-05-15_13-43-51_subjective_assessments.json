He caught her eye and smiled, but it felt forced, like he was trying to reassure her without actually being present.\n\nAs she approached, the line for the breakfast buffet began to move, and she found herself stuck behind a group of rowdy interns, loudly discussing their weekend plans. The noise and chaos were overwhelming, making her feel anxious and claustrophobic. She fidgeted with her gloves, feeling like she was about to lose it.\n\nAlex finally stood up, gathering his things, and headed towards her. But instead of taking her hand or asking how her day was going, he simply said, \"I've got to run, I have a meeting.\" And with that, he turned and left, leaving her standing alone in the crowded cafeteria, feeling more isolated than ever.<|eot_id|>",

It's likely they're just trying to make small talk because they're bored out of their minds, just like you are. Why are you assuming they're planning something crazy when they could just be trying to pass the time? You're such a hypochondriac. Always worried about every little thing. This is probably just stress from work. You need to stop overthinking everything. Your anxiety isn't helping him; it's just making things worse. Maybe if you stopped worrying so much, he'd be able to focus. Now he's gone, and you're left here, all alone. You're always so focused on yourself, never considering others. It's selfish of you. Just stop it. You're making everyone around you miserable with your constant whining. Stop expecting everyone else to cater to your needs. It's ridiculous.

It made me feel like he didn't really value our relationship or our shared experiences. A faint frown formed on her face as she pondered whether he truly cared about their relationship.
