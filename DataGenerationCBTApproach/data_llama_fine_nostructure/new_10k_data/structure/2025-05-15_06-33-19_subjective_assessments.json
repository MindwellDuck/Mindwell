His eyes wandered to the framed photo on the edge of the desk – a faded picture of him and his wife, taken on their anniversary trip to Paris.\n\nThe sound of footsteps echoed from outside his office door, followed by the murmur of voices. A colleague poked her head in, asking if he was working late. He hesitated, unsure how much to share. Something about the way she smiled, and the hint of concern etched on her face, made him feel like he wasn't alone in this struggle.\n\n\"Everything okay?\" she asked gently, noticing the look on his face.\n\nFor a moment, he considered lying, telling her it was fine, that he was just tired. But something inside him shifted, and he found himself blurting out, \"I'm just worried about my story. I don't know if I'm doing justice to her memory.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air, and for a fleeting instant, he felt a wave of panic wash over him.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't the first time he'd been caught off guard by such minor interactions. He couldn't help but wonder what other things might be brewing beneath the surface, waiting to burst forth unexpectedly. As he listened to her gentle inquiry, a subtle shift in her demeanor had caught his attention. Her smile seemed almost... rehearsed? She hadn't quite met his gaze, and her voice had sounded slightly too calm, as if trying to mask some underlying emotion. But then again, perhaps he was reading too much into it. Maybe she genuinely did care about his well-being, and her response was simply a polite attempt to offer support. Still, the nagging feeling lingered, refusing to let go. He thought back to the countless times she'd interrupted his focus with seemingly innocuous questions. They always seemed to come out of nowhere, leaving him scrambling to respond before she moved on. Hadn't she ever stopped to consider how those interruptions affected him? It wasn't just the questions themselves; it was the way she phrased them. Sometimes they felt more like challenges than genuine inquiries. And when he tried to brush them off, she'd press on, as if daring him to admit his frustration. It was all so... calculated. Her responses never seemed to fully align with the context.

Their conversation was effortless, and he found himself zoning out, noticing the way she leaned in close, her voice low and conspiratorial. He couldn't quite pinpoint what was bothering him – it wasn't the fact that she was younger, though that nagged at him – but the way she seemed to be drawing attention away from him.\n\nAs they packed up to leave for the day, she lingered by his desk, collecting papers and chatting about the upcoming assignment. Her touch brushed against his as she handed him a notebook, sending a jolt through him. He quickly snatched it back, feeling a flush rise to his cheeks. She smiled innocently, but he could have sworn he saw a flicker of awareness in her eyes before she turned to join the others.<|eot_id|>",

The way she talked about work was always so positive, never once expressing frustration or disappointment. It was almost as if she was trying too hard to fit in, like she had this image of herself as a team player, but deep down, she didn’t really care. And then there were the times when she’d smile, but her eyes would flash with annoyance, like she was hiding something inside. He wondered if she ever felt trapped in this role, stuck playing the part of the happy office worker while secretly seething beneath the surface. Maybe she was just good at pretending to be someone she’s not, but somehow convincing everyone else that everything was okay when it wasn’t. At the same time, he noticed how perfectly she fitted into every social situation. Whether it was grabbing lunch with colleagues or joining a group chat, she seamlessly blended in, never standing out.

It feels so unfair, like I’m meant to suffer forever because of his decision. I know she doesn’t deserve it, but why does everyone else get to move on with their lives? Why can’t I just let them forget about me? They all pretend everything is fine, like they’re better off without me. That’s how I feel too - better off without her. I wish people would stop talking about us. We were perfect for each other; what happened? Maybe if I was just a little bit more understanding, maybe things could’ve worked out. But now look where I am — alone and heartbroken. No one understands how much I love her, how much I miss her every day. She deserves someone new, someone who will treat her better than I did.
