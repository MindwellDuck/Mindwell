His colleagues seem to accept his tardiness, even when he leaves early from work. Why can't my partner make himself behave? It's all falling apart. We're supposed to meet the captain today, and I've spent hours preparing for our presentation. What if my partner forgets the entire thing? Or worse, what if he tries to sabotage us? I feel a knot forming in my stomach as I imagine him deliberately making mistakes. This isn't just about being on time; it's about respect and professionalism. My partner has been warned multiple times, and yet he continues to disrespect the rules and procedures. It's infuriating. And now, with the sergeant watching us, I can almost see his mind racing with negative thoughts. \"You two are incompetent,\" he might think. \"They'll never succeed.\" We need to get out of here before things get any worse.

Why hadn't she taken more time to clean up after herself? She thought back to all the days she'd spent working on this piece, lost in her own world, forgetting about everything else. Hadn't she promised herself she would take better care of her home, too?\n\nAs she turned away from the canvas, her eyes fell upon the stack of unpaid bills on the kitchen counter, the reminders of her dwindling financial resources.
