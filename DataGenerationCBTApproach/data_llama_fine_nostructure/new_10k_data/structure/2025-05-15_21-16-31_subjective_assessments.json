This was the fifth one of the day, and she was already running behind schedule. As she flipped through the stack of files, her eyes landed on the latest note from Sarah's mother, reiterating the same concerns about her child's social skills.\n\nJust then, the door swung open and Mrs. Johnson walked in, beaming with pride. \"I'm telling you, I've been working with my daughter's class, and they're doing fantastic! The teacher is doing such a great job.\" She leaned in, a hint of condescension creeping into her voice. \"But I have to say, I do think it would be best if you spent more time on extracurricular activities, rather than focusing on academics.\"\n\nThe teacher's fingers tightened around her pen, her nails biting into her palm as she forced a smile onto her face. She had dealt with this kind of criticism before – from parents who thought their child was perfect, but hers were somehow lacking. It was infuriating, but she bit back her response, choosing instead to nod politely and make small talk.<|eot_id|>",

They don’t see what’s going on in the classroom; they only care about their own kids’ success. It doesn’t even matter that my classroom looks nothing like theirs. My room is full of students who aren’t even speaking English yet, and still manage to keep up with the rest of the class. They’re learning everything I can teach them, and sometimes more. But no, all anyone wants to hear about is how their precious little angel is failing my class because we don’t do things their way. Sarah’s mom comes in every week and complains about her child being left out of group projects. Like, hello, we have over 30 students in the class.

The room was filled with art enthusiasts, collectors, and fellow artists, all of whom seemed to be politely pretending to appreciate his work.\n\nAs he scanned the space, his eyes landed on a woman who had been quietly observing him from across the room. She was a curator at a prominent museum, known for her sharp critiques and discerning taste. He had met her briefly at an opening last month, and she had mentioned showing interest in acquiring some of his pieces.\n\nNow, she caught his eye again, this time with a flicker of disappointment. Her gaze lingered on one particular piece, and then quickly looked away, as if embarrassed by her own reaction. A group of people began to gather around it, discussing its merits and shortcomings.\n\nThe artist felt a familiar sting in his chest as he watched the woman disappear into the crowd, leaving behind a trail of polite conversation and forced smiles. He knew that look – the one that said he wasn't good enough, that his work wasn't worthy of serious consideration. It was a rejection he'd grown accustomed to over the years, but it never got any easier to swallow.<|eot_id|>",

Anyway, back to the main issue: why does he always have to feel so insecure whenever someone looks at something other than him? Is he really that sensitive about having others focus on anyone else? I'm starting to think he might need to take up painting again. Maybe if he created something worth looking at, he wouldn't feel so left out. So yeah, he's definitely overreacting here. There's no need to make such a big deal out of nothing. But honestly, I kind of love how upset he is. It's almost... therapeutic. Anyway, let's keep an eye on him and see what happens next.

Now, she came alone, her smile faltering as she asked about discounts and sales.\n\nThe bell above the door jangled, signaling the arrival of another customer. A young woman, probably a teenager, chatted with her mother as they browsed the racks. The older woman's eyes lingered on him, a spark of interest dancing in their depths.

My daughter is growing up so fast. She just started college, and I feel like I’m losing touch. When I drop her off at school, I try to talk about my day, but she barely listens.
