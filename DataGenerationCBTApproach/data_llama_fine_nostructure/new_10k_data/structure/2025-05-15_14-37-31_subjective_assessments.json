The fluorescent lights overhead seemed harsh as he changed out of his uniform, the worn fabric clinging to his sweaty skin. As he began to unload the groceries, he noticed the small note on the kitchen counter - another bill to pay, another month added to their mounting debt.\n\nThe couple had been struggling since the job loss six months ago, but he'd tried to keep it together for her sake. Now, as he stared blankly at the unpaid credit card statement, memories of late nights spent rummaging through thrift stores for cheap clothes flooded back. The desperation, the shame – it felt like a lifetime ago.\n\nHe set the groceries down, feeling the weight of their financial struggles settle onto him like a physical burden. The silence in the house was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the refrigerator. He wondered how they'd made it this far, and what the future held for them now.<|eot_id|>",

His wife is nowhere to be found, probably busy with her hobbies or whatever she does when she doesn't want to talk about things. But today, there's no peace. No respite. Just bills piled high enough to make him feel guilty for even trying to breathe. That note on the counter? A reminder that things aren't getting better anytime soon. Not just any old bill, but one that makes him feel like he's failing again. Like everything is falling apart because he can't seem to catch a break. And then, the memory hits hard. All those late nights at the thrift store, scrambling to find something, anything, to wear. It feels like an eternity ago, yet the pain remains. But why would it? Why would anyone expect me to succeed? Everyone else has it easy, living their lives while I'm stuck here, drowning in debt. Even if I did manage to scrape together some income, it wouldn't last. We're already behind on payments, and I have no idea where we'll get the money from next time. Maybe someday, somehow, we'll figure it out, but until then, life just keeps piling more and more pressure on us. And he knows exactly who to blame – himself. It's not fair, though.

As she gazed at it, memories flooded back – the patient who had almost died under her care, the awkward silence between her and her partner during that fateful night shift.\n\nHer husband walked into the room, handed her a cup of coffee, and asked about her day. She forced a smile, feeling a wave of disgust wash over her as she took the cup from him. The way he always made small talk, oblivious to her growing unease – it was like he was erasing the weight of all those failed patients, the ones she couldn't save.\n\nAs she sipped the lukewarm coffee, the taste reminded her of the hospital's cafeteria food, bland and unappetizing. Her stomach churned, and she felt a lump form in her throat.

But now, after all these years, he's acting like nothing matters. She realized that maybe he wasn't aware of how stressful her job was. Maybe he genuinely thought things were fine for both of us. So why was he acting like he needed help with his workload? Was he trying to make himself look better? She decided to give him some space. She didn't want to bring up her frustrations again. After all, maybe he was just stressed out because of his own issues, not mine. But still, it was annoying how he acted like everything was normal. Didn't he remember how we used to be?
