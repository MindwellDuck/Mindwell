It looks like she's getting more flustered by the minute, which means I'm probably correct about how she feels - she's really annoyed that those cards fell down. It's kind of weird that she started picking them up again after pushing one away. Maybe she forgot what she was doing there? Or maybe she’s just having a bad day and this isn’t even about the mess at all? I hope she doesn’t feel too bad about it. She looked like she might have gotten a little teary-eyed when she saw the mess, but thankfully she composed herself pretty quickly. Now she seems to be moving around the area with a bit more purpose, almost like she wants to get it cleaned up before anyone else notices the mess. That could mean she actually cares about cleaning it up, or maybe she’s just anxious to get things back to normal. Either way, I think she’s going to be fine.

The beeping of monitors and murmurs of the medical team created a cacophony that made his own breathing feel labored.\n\nThe doctor turned to him, eyes pleading for reassurance, but before he could offer any words, the patient flatlined.

I'm glad he has such a supportive family, but sometimes I wish he wouldn't have to bear so much emotional burden. When my sister was diagnosed with leukemia, I tried to be there for her, but I couldn’t handle it. I kept thinking about how he handles things and whether he’s taking care of himself. Sometimes I imagine how he must feel when patients come back worse than when he started treating them, and I worry that he might burn out. My cousin has been through some tough times too, but he always seems to bounce back stronger. Maybe I’m just jealous?

As she walked into her new home, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. The small studio apartment, though modest, held endless potential.
