The comment was made with a sympathetic smile, but as she listened, she felt a familiar pang of resentment simmer beneath her polite laughter.\n\nAs she watched her coworker effortlessly sipping her juice box, they began discussing their upcoming staff meeting, where the topic of merit pay would likely come up. Her colleague seemed confident in her own abilities, expecting a raise without hesitation. A fleeting glance at the grade book in front of her caught her attention – another teacher had just received an average score from the same test she'd given weeks ago.\n\nHer hand hovered over the mouse, hesitating before clicking to save her work. As the cursor blinked, her gaze drifted out the window, where sunlight struggled to penetrate the grey clouds. She felt the weight of unspoken frustration, her mind racing with 'what ifs' about fairness and recognition for all her hard work.<|eot_id|>",

That's ridiculous. I don't need your approval to eat what I want, especially after spending so much time cooking. You're acting like this is some kind of big deal, but honestly, I'm just hungry. Get off my back. This isn't about me; it's about the restaurant owners' fucked-up policies. They have nothing to do with my personal life or preferences.

But then again, that’s probably just a fleeting moment of joy. Her life feels pretty mundane, which makes me wonder why she’s so worried all the time. Maybe it’s because she doesn’t want to admit that things aren’t perfect in her marriage—she thinks everyone else has a better life than her. That’s why she’s always stressing about something, whether it’s her job, her family, or her relationship. And honestly, I don’t blame her.
