If he keeps doing it, I’m going to lose my mind. # No Distortion Here! ## However, here’s a possible interpretation: When Alex interrupts you, it might be because he genuinely wants to share his thoughts, but it could also mean he thinks he knows better than you or is trying to steal your spotlight. Similarly, when he asks questions, maybe he’s curious, but it might also suggest he lacks confidence in his own abilities and needs reassurance. These small things add up, making you wonder if Alex is truly interested in collaboration or just playing games. ## This reflection highlights the tendency to view situations as binary choices rather than nuanced realities. Instead of recognizing Alex's behavior as a mix of both helpful and annoying, we tend to categorize him as either a respectful colleague or someone who disrupts our workflow. This oversimplification leads us to misinterpret his intentions and create unrealistic expectations. By acknowledging these complexities, we can develop healthier communication strategies and build stronger relationships."
