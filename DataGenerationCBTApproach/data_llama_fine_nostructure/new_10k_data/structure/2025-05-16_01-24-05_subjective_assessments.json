It was her usual time to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee before starting her shift at the hospital.

She hadn't looked at it in a while, but something about the peaceful morning had brought it to mind. As she poured herself a cup of coffee, her hand hesitated above the sugar container, then gently placed the spoon down beside it. The silence of the house felt oppressive, a stark contrast to the familiar hum of conversation and gentle laughter from when he was still by her side.\n\nThe kettle whistled, breaking the stillness. She turned away from the window, feeling a lump form in her throat as she wrapped her hands around the warm mug. For a moment, she forgot about the patients waiting for her care, and let herself get lost in the memories of a lifetime, now tinged with emptiness.<|eot_id|>",

Meanwhile, she doesn’t give a shit about our struggles or the work we put into keeping our lives together. We try to support her, but she just pushes us away, saying things like “You don’t understand” or “It’s hard enough dealing with her.” Like, come on, it’s not that hard.

Still, there was something about the way he wrote those words that looked eerily familiar…like he was trying to say something more profound than just “you’re not doing your job.” He seemed almost...sentimental? Like he genuinely cared about her well-being as a teacher? Maybe it was just her imagination running wild, but that scribbled drawing started to look more like a heartfelt gesture than a joke. What if he was secretly worried about her stress levels and wanted to remind her that she wasn’t alone? Or perhaps he was simply trying to lighten the mood after a tense staff meeting. Either way, the principal seemed to be sending a message, and it wasn’t entirely clear what it meant. But then again, maybe she was reading too much into it. After all, it could’ve been anything from a simple doodle to a genuine attempt at humor.
