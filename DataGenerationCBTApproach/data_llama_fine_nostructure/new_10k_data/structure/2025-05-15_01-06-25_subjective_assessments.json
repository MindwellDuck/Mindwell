A text from Alex, her art mentor, had appeared out of nowhere - an invitation to join their gallery group show in two weeks. As she read through his message, nostalgia washed over her.\n\nHer eyes landed on the photo of them standing together at last year's exhibition, beaming with pride. She remembered how he'd taken her under his wing, guiding her through the ups and downs of her fledgling career. But now, as she scrolled through their past conversations, she realized Alex had been offering more than just constructive feedback - he'd been pushing her to take credit for his own work, subtly shifting the spotlight onto himself.\n\nA bitter taste formed in her mouth as she recalled the way he'd dismissed her ideas, saying they were'amateurish' and 'unoriginal.' The sting of those words still lingered, and now, as she looked at Alex's text, she felt like she was being offered a slap in the face - a reminder of all the times she'd sacrificed her own vision for his approval.\n\nThe room began to spin, and she felt a wave of nausea wash over her. Her hands trembled as she typed a hasty response, apologizing for her absence but making it clear she wouldn't be able to attend the show after all. As she hit send, a cold sweat broke out on her forehead, and she couldn't shake the feeling that a part of her was dying inside.<|eot_id|>",

This time, I got so excited about the opportunity to collaborate with one of my favorite artists (she’s famous), and I spent hours crafting the perfect pitch. I sent it, and he replied almost immediately, saying he loved my energy but needed some time to think it over. Then, he proceeded to ghost me. No word back, no update, nothing. It’s like he vanished into thin air. But here’s the kicker – he has a huge social media presence, and everyone in our industry is talking about him. He’s getting booked left and right, and people are freaking out because they want to work with him. Meanwhile, I’ve been grinding, putting in 12-hour days, and I barely get recognition. It’s infuriating! What really gets me is that he posted about the whole interaction on Instagram, claiming I was too pushy and didn’t respect his schedule. He said I came across aggressive, which is totally not true. We’d talked about collaborating before, and I knew we were going to make magic happen together. He even asked if I wanted to grab coffee and discuss further, but then he disappeared. This isn’t the first time something like this happens to me. Every time I try to put myself out there, someone ends up stabbing me in the back. And you know what?"

He frantically brushed it off, trying to play it cool, but his eyes met Rachel's, and she burst into laughter.\n\nJust then, their boss walked by, flashing a critical glance at the disheveled journalist before moving on to greet other colleagues. The sound of Rachel's giggles echoed through the hallway, making him feel like a teenager again, caught in a mortifying moment.<|eot_id|>",

Or worse, what if our boss saw him spilling coffee all over his shirt? He’d probably lose his job right away. Every little mistake makes me anxious, wondering what could go wrong. If he had been more organized, maybe he wouldn’t be rushing around like that. But now, with his shirt stained, I can only imagine how embarrassed he must be feeling. Maybe if he took a deep breath and slowed down, things would have turned out differently. Now, he looks like an idiot, and I worry that everyone will think poorly of him. It’s almost as if he did it on purpose to make us look bad. What if he really meant to spill that coffee? Maybe he wants us to see how clumsy he is, so we don’t trust him anymore. That would explain why he seemed so flustered during the press conference. I bet he didn’t even know what was going to happen until he saw the headlines later that day. If only he had been more prepared, none of these problems would exist. But now, I’m left to pick up the pieces and wonder how far my friend has fallen."

He recalled the way she'd calmly told him she couldn't take care of herself anymore, leaving him to wonder if he'd failed somehow.\n\nThe mailman knocked at the door, breaking the silence.

Even the small victories he had experienced recently seemed insignificant when compared to the bigger picture. Still, he knew he needed to make progress. His therapist suggested focusing on building resilience, but it didn't feel like much help. He was already drowning in responsibilities - work, family, and bills - and no amount of mental preparation seemed to ease the burden. The idea of making a change in his life felt like a luxury he could ill afford right now. The reality was harsher; he simply had to keep pushing forward, even if it meant just getting through each day without falling behind. It wasn't easy, but he was determined to stay on track, no matter what challenges lay ahead. At least, that's how he kept telling himself. Deep down, there were moments of doubt. Maybe this whole process was just another reminder of his shortcomings, a constant reminder that things weren't going to get easier anytime soon.

She couldn't shake off the feeling that she wasn't good enough or hadn't worked hard enough to be considered for the program.

I can tell she thinks I'll never succeed as a nurse, which is why she's so happy about her selection. She might even be plotting against me, using her influence over Michael to make sure I get stuck in low-paying jobs forever. Rachel's smile is just a way of rubbing it in, making me feel inferior and worthless. She probably wants to remind herself that she's better than me by bragging about her accomplishment, showing off her confidence and competence. It's clear that she believes I'm not capable of keeping up with her, and now she has proof that she's the superior nurse.
