All he could focus on was the way she seemed to be connecting with this stranger, the way they were sharing stories and glances like old friends. The barista refilled their cups, and he felt a pang in his chest as their hands touched briefly.\n\nAs she finished her drink and prepared to leave, he caught himself thinking about who else might be able to appreciate her creativity, her sense of humor.

I tried to distract myself by thinking about my own projects, but everything felt pointless. Even though I've been working hard lately, it wasn't enough. Seeing her with others just made me realize that I'll never have anything special again. It's not fair that she gets to move on, while I'm stuck here feeling more and more useless. Why did it have to happen now? We were going to plan something soon, and then this happened. It feels like everything is falling apart. I don't want to think about it anymore, but every time I try, I get overwhelmed again. I wish I could just forget about her and everyone else. If I could erase those memories, maybe things would be easier. Maybe if I ignored her, she wouldn't seem so perfect to others either. But no matter what I do, I keep comparing us to other couples.

Maybe if I was more confident and attractive, I wouldn't feel this way, but I still think about her every day.

Sometimes I wonder if they notice how sad I look when they pass by, but they don't seem to care. They all have their perfect partners, while I'm stuck here alone. Even the coffee machine looks happy with its new owner, a guy who comes every morning to chat with his girlfriend. She always smiles, but he doesn't even try to flirt with her - maybe he thinks he has no chance? The pink-haired girl from earlier walked by again today, looking very cheerful, but I couldn't muster a smile. She must think I'm weird because I stared at her for too long. I wish I could tell her how much I admire her carefree spirit, but I know she'd never take me seriously. We're worlds apart in age and personality. She probably sees me as old-fashioned or boring, which is why she avoids talking to me. Why do I get these thoughts? Why does"
