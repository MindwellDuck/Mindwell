She recalled the way he'd smiled during their interview, feigning innocence while expertly dodging questions.\n\nA knock at her door broke the silence. It was her partner, asking for her input on the case files. As they pored over the evidence, her hand involuntarily clenched into a fist, her mind replaying every interaction with John.

As she listened to Captain Harris’ words, a phrase cut through the din of the conference: \"John’s provided crucial intel on his co-conspirators.\" A chill ran down her spine; intelligence was just a euphemism for manipulation. Every time she looked at him, she saw a master manipulator, playing the system with an ease that made her blood boil. Just then, her partner burst in, asking for her take on the latest developments. As they delved deeper into the case files, her hand twitched with frustration, her mind replaying every exchange with John. The air was thick with unspoken tensions, and she knew she wasn’t alone in sensing it. Even the captain seemed to be holding back, his expression guarded. But then something snapped inside her. She slammed her fist onto the table, making everyone jump. \"Why does he get to play both sides?\" she demanded, her voice low and even. \"He's been feeding us nothing but lies.\" Captain Harris raised an eyebrow, his voice measured. \"We have reason to believe John is willing"
