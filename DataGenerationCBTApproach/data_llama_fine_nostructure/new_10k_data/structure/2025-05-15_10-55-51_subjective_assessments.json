As she approached the counter, her eyes landed on the half-eaten pizza box from last night's Netflix binge-watching session. The leftover slices were still piled high on the plate, with a few crumbs scattered around.\n\nAs she poured herself a glass of water, Alex caught her eye and smiled lazily. \"Hey, want some?\" he asked, holding out the plate. But as she took in the sight of the congealed cheese and dried sauce, her stomach twisted into knots. She felt a sudden urge to gag, and her mind began to reel at the thought of eating something so... unappetizing.\n\n\"Uh, no thanks,\" she muttered, trying to play it off nonchalant while her body recoiled in distaste. Alex looked taken aback by her reaction, but said nothing, simply shrugging and putting the plate away.<|eot_id|>",

Why does Alex get to eat whatever he wants, and I have to settle for boring, healthy food? Alex doesn't even care about his health; he'll eat a whole pizza by himself. That's crazy. I wish I could be more like him. He's so lucky to enjoy disgusting foods without worrying about getting sick. Meanwhile, I have to worry about every little thing, and I end up missing out on fun experiences like eating a full pizza. Why did I ever think I'd be okay with eating weird leftovers when everyone else can just shove anything down their throat? I hate feeling like an asshole for not wanting to eat something that makes me look weak. Alex doesn't see what I see - he just sees a delicious meal. Why can't I see it that way too? ## Response End"

The teacher felt a familiar knot form in his stomach as he watched the boy drop into his seat, barely acknowledging him before starting to chat with friends.
