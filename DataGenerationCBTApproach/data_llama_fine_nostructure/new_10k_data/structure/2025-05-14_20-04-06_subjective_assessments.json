They'd been together for five years before the divorce, but it was still hard to see him now, especially when she felt so lost and alone in her career.\n\nThe phone rang again, breaking the silence. She answered, trying to shake off the sadness that seemed to cling to her like a damp mist. But as she listened to the caller's concerns, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing somehow, that she wasn't doing enough to make ends meet after the split.

As she gazed around the room, memories of lazy mornings, spilled cereal, and whispered secrets flooded her mind.\n\nHer eyes landed on the calendar on the fridge, and she felt a pang of guilt as she saw the birthday party plans she'd made weeks ago were now nothing more than a reminder of what she couldn't be there for. She thought about all the times she'd promised to attend school plays, sports games, and recitals, only to find herself stuck behind a desk, dealing with sick patients instead.\n\nThe sound of her phone buzzing broke the silence, and she hesitated before answering. Her daughter's cheerful voice on the other end filled her with a mix of emotions – happiness, anxiety, and a deep-seated fear that she wasn't doing enough.

Wasn’t this just a habit of hers, or was there something more going on? The question lingered in her mind, though she tried not to let it intrude. Perhaps she was reading too much into it. Still, the gesture felt forced, like a reflex trying to compensate for something deeper. This subtle movement seemed to reveal more about her than she intended. Was she unconsciously trying to convince herself that everything was under control, or did she genuinely need help seeing things clearly? Her mind began to wander further back, replaying moments from their relationship when similar actions might have held different meanings. There was always a fine line between needing support and needing validation. She wasn’t sure where her feelings were coming from anymore. Was it possible that her actions spoke louder than words? Were these gestures simply habits, or was there something else at play? Maybe she was just trying to make sense of her own emotions. But then again, maybe"
