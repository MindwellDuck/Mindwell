As he listened to the mayor's condescending remarks about his lack of experience, a crowd began to gather, their whispers and snickers seeping into his skin like ice water. His wife's gentle touch on his arm was all he could muster in response, her eyes downcast as if trying not to draw attention to him.

Their scorn cut deep, echoing through every cell of his being, leaving him feeling vulnerable and exposed. It was as if they were trying to strip away everything he held dear, reducing him to nothing more than a footnote in the annals of history. But what really stung was when his wife, usually such a rock for him, seemed to shrink away, her eyes darting nervously around the crowd as if searching for an escape route. She'd always been his safe haven, his partner in every sense. Yet, now she seemed lost, unable to find solace even within herself. It was almost as if the world itself had turned against him, conspiring to crush his dreams beneath its heel. Even the mural, once a beacon of hope, now seemed tainted by the cruel opinions of others.

A young woman, likely in her early twenties, approached him with a mixture of concern and entitlement etched on her face. She demanded to know why her relative hadn't received the latest test results yet, despite being told they were available just hours prior.\n\nThe nurse beside him rolled her eyes discreetly before turning back to her task, but the woman's question cut through the air like a slap in the face.

Well, let me tell you something, pal - I've been doing this job for years, and I know exactly how it works. Nobody gives a shit about some random person who shows up out of nowhere. They're always late, they always have some excuse, and most importantly, they always cause more problems than they solve. And you know what? That's why we call them \"family\" around here. Your little friend is probably sick of hearing from you. Maybe they even hate you right now because they're stuck in that hospital bed, waiting for a treatment that'll cost thousands of dollars. So go ahead, keep demanding updates, see if I care. It won't change anything; nothing will change until someone actually does something meaningful around here.

When I asked her if she needed any help, she simply shook her head, saying she could handle it on her own. Despite my genuine offer, she never followed up or even thanked me. It seemed like she didn’t want to admit that things were tough, so she just kept pushing forward. But honestly, it made me feel like she wasn’t really listening when we talked before – maybe she was too stressed to hear what I was trying to say? This is the same thing happening at home. My mom always says she doesn't need help, but then she ends up struggling with chores and asks for assistance anyway. Sometimes I wonder if she's just pretending to be fine because she wants to avoid admitting she needs support. Or maybe she genuinely believes everything is under control, but deep down, she knows better. Whatever it is, it makes me feel like she's not being honest about how overwhelmed she really feels. There are times when my friend tries to make light of our struggles by joking that she’s “too busy” to hang out.
