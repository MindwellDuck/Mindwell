The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the empty hallways, making him feel even more anxious. As a teacher, he was used to being in control, but today he couldn't shake the feeling of being lost.\n\nJust as he managed to remember where he'd put the key, the principal's voice came over the intercom, announcing a surprise visit from the school board. They were coming to observe a class – one of his most challenging ones – and he still hadn't prepared a lesson plan.\n\nA cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he thought about the students' recent behavior. He had been trying to reach them, but they seemed to be slipping further away. What if the board saw him as incompetent? What if they took away his teaching position?\n\nWith a jolt, the lock clicked open, and he let himself into the classroom. But instead of finding reassurance among the familiar desks and books, he saw a sea of expectant faces staring back at him, each one a reminder of his own doubts and fears.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe you've even rehearsed exactly how you want to express yourself. After all, you're such an expert on communication, aren't you? And I'm sure you're just dying to tell me all about it.

Nothing ever means anything for her because she can’t help herself; she has to make it about her feelings. She makes everyone feel like they’re the reason she’s upset. Whenever someone else does something, it’s never just an innocent mistake—it must be personal. They think it's all about them, even when there's no logical explanation. Every little thing becomes a big deal because it confirms her own self-importance. And she's not even aware of it. She genuinely thinks that everyone cares more about her than anyone else. Everything revolves around her, and nothing ever happens for her alone. This isn't just about her being sensitive; it's about her needing to make everything about her. There's no room for objective truth when she's involved. When someone tries to explain themselves, she immediately jumps to conclusions, assuming it’s all about her. No matter how many times you try to tell her otherwise, she won’t listen. You have to constantly remind her that things aren’t about her, but she refuses to see it. She can’t handle criticism gracefully because it validates her need to control every situation. When you point out her behavior, she gets defensive, convinced that you're attacking her. Even if you clarify that your intention wasn’t to hurt her feelings, she still reacts as if you did. It’s like she doesn’t trust anyone except herself"

Maybe he was even thinking about leaving? But why would he want to leave? We've worked together for years, and he knows how much we care about our patients. It doesn't make sense that he'd suddenly feel this way after everything that's happened. I wonder what could have triggered such strong emotions. Was there something specific he saw in the hospital room? Maybe it was something related to his own past, something that reminded him of a painful memory. If that's the case, then maybe he wasn't just upset; maybe he was having a flashback. But wouldn't he know that? Wouldn't he realize that it’s just his mind playing tricks on him again? Maybe I’m reading too much into it. Maybe he really is just stressed about work, and that's all. But still, I can’t shake off the feeling that something deeper is going on here. I guess I’ll just have to wait and see how things play out. But honestly, I don't think I'll ever fully understand what’s going on inside his head. And that might be for the best. Sometimes it’s better to let people deal with their own thoughts and feelings instead of trying to figure them out. After all, who are we to know what someone else is going through anyway?
