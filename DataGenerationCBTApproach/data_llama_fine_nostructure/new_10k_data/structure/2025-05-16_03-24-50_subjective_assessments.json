The colors seemed dull today, lacking the vibrancy he'd once found in every brushstroke. He hadn't finished the piece, couldn't seem to bring himself to add the final touches.\n\nHis wife had always been his muse – the one who encouraged him to push boundaries, to try new techniques. She'd be here now, offering her opinion, if only she were. He recalled the last time they'd worked together, side by side, their conversation flowing as easily as the paint.\n\nAs he dipped his brush into the palette, a speck of turpentine fell onto the floor, shattering the silence. He knelt to pick it up, his eyes drifting toward the old photograph on his studio wall. A snapshot of the two of them, taken at a gallery opening years ago. Her smile still lit up the room, even after all these years.\n\nThe door creaked open behind him, but he didn't turn around. His gaze remained fixed on the photo, memories flooding back like watercolors on wet paper. He felt the sting of tears, tried to shake it off, but it was too late. The paint-stained rag in his hand began to tremble.<|eot_id|>",

Like, hello, we're already married! What more could you possibly want? I guess being an idiot isn't entirely your fault. She walked out with her head held high, a smirk on her face, and a spring in her step. It was like she was trying to prove something, like she needed my validation just because she wanted to feel good about herself. Newsflash, babe: I love you, regardless of how fabulous you look. But oh well, I'm sure she'll come crawling back when she realizes what she’s missing. I can't help but wonder what would've happened if she'd stayed longer. Would she have finally realized what a catch I am? Or would she have left me again, tired of my lackluster charm? Tears streamed down my face as I watched her go.

Maybe he just needs to work on his marketing strategy instead of expecting everyone to drop everything to read his stuff.

So let’s not make a big deal out of this. It's not like this is the first time something like this happened either. Remember when he tried to write that book?

The other patients and staff members around them melted away, leaving only the two of them, frozen in a moment from another life. She asked how his day was going, and he forced a smile, trying to play along, but the emptiness inside him felt like a physical weight pressing down on his chest.\n\nAs they chatted, he couldn't help but notice the small things – the way she used to order her coffee, the way her hair fell across her forehead when she laughed.
