Her mind wandered to the emails she'd received from galleries, politely declining her work – again. The rejections stung less now, but the thought of having to start over, to find new inspiration and talent, felt suffocating.\n\nAs she stood there, frozen, her phone buzzed with a text from her sister, asking if she needed help moving boxes into her studio. She hadn't asked for assistance, couldn't bear the thought of being a burden. But what choice did she have? The bills were piling up, and her savings were dwindling. With a heavy sigh, she set down her brush and began to pack away her paints, feeling the weight of her own insignificance.<|eot_id|>",

The volunteer coordinator looked taken aback, her expression turning slightly defensive. \"Well, someone has to pay for the supplies and whatnot.\"\n\nThe woman raised an eyebrow, feeling a twinge of annoyance.

My mind is literally racing with all the things I could be doing instead. I wish I could take a break from this nonsense already. Why do people always assume I'm just happy to help out? Don't they realize how exhausting it gets? I swear, sometimes I feel like I’m losing myself in all this. I just want to walk away from it all and focus on my own life for once. But then again, I feel guilty leaving because I know other parents count on me. Ugh, it’s such a vicious cycle.

Besides, I already have enough things to worry about – like how I'm going to pay the bills this month (not). It's not worth stressing over something as insignificant as germs when I could be focusing on more important things...like how I'm going to survive this year. Who cares about a few germs when you’ve got so many other problems? But still, I guess I did pull out a mask today. Maybe that counts for something.
