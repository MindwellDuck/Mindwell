The officer’s call had been brief, but it seemed to hold a weight that he couldn’t quite grasp. It wasn’t until they reached the edge of the parking lot that he truly understood the gravity of the situation. The officer’s words hung in the air like a challenge, forcing him to confront the reality he’d been trying to escape. But instead of facing it head-on, he let his emotions take over. The frustration and grief boiled into anger, directed squarely at the young officer who dared to disturb his solitude. How could this stranger, so much younger than him, demand answers when he knew nothing? It wasn’t just the question itself; it was the way the officer looked at him—a mixture of concern and curiosity that made him feel exposed. As if he was some sort of puzzle, and she needed to figure me out before moving forward. The look sent a shiver down his spine, making him wonder if she was even the same woman he’d met months ago. Her name was Sarah. They had talked several times since her passing, exchanging stories about our lives as she struggled to come to terms with the loss. She was different then; her words were full"

As she stopped at the nurse's station to check on a patient, a commotion erupted from the room next door.\n\nA young intern burst out, his face pale and sweaty, as he clutched a clipboard. 'Code blue, Code blue!' he shouted, his voice echoing down the hallway. Her heart skipped a beat as she followed him into the room, her mind racing with the familiar rhythms of CPR.
