Tom’s mom had died suddenly, leaving him to care for his younger siblings. Sarah had moved to a different city with her family, and Michael... well, Michael was still missing, too. But what about Emily? She had simply stopped showing up after her mom passed away. No note, no explanation. Just a blank space on the attendance sheet. Each absence played out like a scene from a movie, with characters and plotlines unfolding in his mind. His own life felt like a script, written by someone else, with lines that didn’t quite fit.
