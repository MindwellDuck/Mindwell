A young mother, barely out of her teens, lay in room 304, fighting for her life after a stillbirth. The doctor came in to update him on the patient's condition, but before he could share any news, she excused herself.\n\nAs he watched her walk away, he noticed a small photo on her bedside table – a picture of a baby boy with bright blue eyes, taken just days before the miscarriage. He felt a pang in his chest, remembering when he'd lost his own wife five years ago. The ache was familiar, yet it still caught him off guard. For a moment, he forgot about the hospital, forgot about his shift, and let himself get lost in the sorrow of another family's loss.<|eot_id|>",

We both had families, both loved our partners deeply, and we were both in this for the same reason – to provide comfort and reassurance to those in need. But then there was the other nurse, the one who kept glancing over his shoulder, checking his watch every few seconds. His expression never changed, and he seemed completely disconnected from everything around him. It was like he was waiting for something, or someone. Every time he looked up, his gaze would flicker towards me, and I could sense a hint of annoyance behind it. Even though they worked together, they didn't seem to be on the same page. It was like they were two sides of the same coin, each representing a different approach to nursing – one compassionate and caring, the other detached and methodical. They couldn't have been more different if they tried. When I walked into the break room, he was already seated at a table, sipping on a cup of cold coffee.
