Years of his research had led to this moment – the presentation of his groundbreaking discovery. As he began to speak, his words tumbled out with precision and authority.\n\nBut then, as he reached the climax of his argument, a young graduate student in the back row raised her hand. Her voice was shrill, piercing through the silence like a rusty gate. \"Isn't it true,\" she said, \"that your methodology has been widely criticized by our field?\"\n\nA murmur spread through the room, and the scientist's eyes narrowed. He felt a cold fury rising within him, a sense of betrayal and injustice. The woman had deliberately sought him out, known full well that her question would be provocative. And now, as he gazed at her, he could almost taste the satisfaction of revenge on his lips.<|eot_id|>",

I know what they’re thinking: What’s wrong with this guy? Why can’t he stay focused? They see me standing there, frozen, while others rush past me, grabbing whatever they need. I feel so trapped, like I'm stuck in this nightmare, unable to wake up. Every time someone asks if I’m okay, I force a laugh, telling them I must have just forgotten something. But deep down, I know it’s all coming crashing down. I've always been the one who kept everyone else together, but now I feel like I’m barely holding on.
