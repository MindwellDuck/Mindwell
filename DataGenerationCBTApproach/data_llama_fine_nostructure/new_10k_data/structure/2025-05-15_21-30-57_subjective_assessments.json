The worn pages held memories of countless Sunday dinners and holiday feasts. As he flipped through the yellowed paper, a handwritten note caught his eye – a note he’d forgotten was there. It was a note about how his wife hated the way he cooked. It wasn’t just that she didn’t like it, but actively hated it. She told him once after a dinner where everything went wrong because he messed up the cooking, that she wished she had married someone else. But still, he kept asking questions like “what if something happens” when things go wrong. Like, what if I had done it differently? What if I had asked for more feedback? What if I had gotten a different result? His life is already a mess. He’s always been a failure. He can’t even cook properly. And then he keeps wondering what would’ve happened if he had made it better. If he hadn’t fucked up so badly. He looks around the room and sees all these reminders of failures. Reminders of how he failed to be a husband, a father, and a provider. How he failed to live up to expectations. He feels like shit every time he thinks about it. And this stupid note just brings it all back again. What if he had actually put some effort into making something special? What if he had just listened to her instead of trying to prove himself"

But when she clicked to expand the column, only a few lines were visible before scrolling off the edge, as if the rest had been deleted.

Like a drop of water falling into an ocean, she felt insignificant, consumed by the vastness of the world around her. Even the humming machines in the lab seemed to mock her, their gentle vibrations growing louder with every passing moment, a cruel reminder that she was nothing more than a small part of a much larger whole. The lab itself became a prison, its sterile corridors echoing with whispers of forgotten memories. Every step she took felt like a betrayal, as if she was walking away from her own life.

As she processed the final item, the bell above the door jangled, signaling another shopper entering the store.\n\nA young mother, accompanied by two boisterous children, approached the checkout line behind her. One of the kids, a rambunctious toddler, spotted a display of toys near the entrance and began tugging on his mother's hand, begging to see the \"dinosaur onesies.\" The mother, distracted by the toddler's antics, hesitated over which size to purchase, her eyes darting toward the cashier as if seeking reassurance.\n\nThe cashier, a colleague who had worked at the store for only a few weeks, asked how her day was going. The woman's response was brief and guarded, leaving the cashier sensing an unspoken tension beneath the surface. The mother, oblivious to the undercurrents, chimed in with a cheerful comment about her own busy morning, while the toddler continued to pull on his mother's sleeve, growing increasingly agitated.\n\nAs the mother finally made her way to the payment counter, the toddler let out a loud wail, shattering the relative calm of the store. The cashier, caught off guard, fumbled with the scanner, causing the machine to beep erratically. For a moment, the room seemed to hold its breath, before the mother apologized profusely and hastily paid, hurrying away with her children in tow.\n\nThe sudden outburst left the cashier feeling unsettled, wondering if she had somehow triggered some unseen trigger.

But this lady was different. She just kept staring at me, like she could read my thoughts. I swear, she knew exactly what I was thinking. That was so creepy. I tried to play it cool, but she just kept asking more questions, like she was trying to figure out why I wasn't smiling or laughing.
