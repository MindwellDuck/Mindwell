The restaurant was already busy, but he still felt like he'd never be able to get everything done on time. His mind began to wander to all the things that could go wrong - a kitchen fire, a food poisoning outbreak, a table of picky customers.\n\nJust then, one of the line cooks called out that they were running low on the key ingredient for the special of the day. He cursed under his breath as he realized he had ordered too little and now had to scramble to find a replacement supplier. The phone started ringing, and he knew it would only be the supplier calling to tell him that their delivery was hours late.\n\nAs he tried to juggle the orders and make calls, the fire alarm went off in the walk-in fridge. The staff rushed to evacuate the building, leaving him alone to deal with the chaos. The stress of it all suddenly felt suffocating, and he could feel his heart racing in his chest.<|eot_id|>",

He thought about the countless interviews he'd conducted with widows and orphans, but none of them had prepared him for this quiet desperation creeping into his own life.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional chirp of a bird outside. He felt like he was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, unable to find a lifeline to cling to.

That would’ve been way more pathetic than sitting alone in an empty apartment. Now he might as well just throw himself off the bridge when he can't pay his bills anymore. This guy is probably going to end up homeless soon. He'll just keep drinking until he can't take it anymore, then he’ll go off the deep end. Maybe someone will finally see how much of a loser he really is and give up on him once and for all. He must've always known he was destined for disaster. He probably thought he was too smart for all those stupid bills, but they always catch up to you. Now he has nothing left - no job, no family, and definitely no hope. It's not like anyone actually cared what happened to him anyway. He was just another forgotten soul lost in the system. No one ever bothered to check in on him; he was always on his own. And now that he's fallen completely apart, it’s probably safe to say he won't even bother trying to fix anything. What’s the point? Why bother trying to save himself when everything else is falling apart? He doesn’t deserve to live"

His thoughts swirled like the traffic outside, each car rushing by without stopping.

She must be thinking about our anniversary coming up soon, planning a romantic surprise. I can't wait to see what she's got planned! Maybe it'll be a candlelit dinner, just the two of us—no kids, no distractions. We could finally enjoy some quality time together. But then I think about our kids. They're growing up so fast; before I know it, they'll be gone, and we won’t have this chance again. It would mean the world if she made an effort to remember this night.

I tried to reassure her that everyone has bad days, but she insisted that I was making it harder by bringing it up.

When she started saying things like “You never understand” and “Everyone else knows better,” I realized that maybe I wasn’t just being sensitive.
