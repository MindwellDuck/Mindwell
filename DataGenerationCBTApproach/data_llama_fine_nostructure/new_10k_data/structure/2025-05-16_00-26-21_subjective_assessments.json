It wasn't until then that I realized how much time had passed since we started working together. I couldn't recall ever being thanked for my work. When the manager complimented me on my attention to detail during an audit, I didn't even acknowledge it. It's strange how quickly things can go unnoticed when you're too busy trying to keep up. ## Step 1: Identify the Cognitive Distortion Identify the cognitive distortion present in the response, which is 'Discounting the Positive'. This involves recognizing the tendency to downplay or ignore positive experiences or events, making them seem insignificant or irrelevant. ## Step 2: Analyze the Response Analyze the response to identify its subjective tone. Look for phrases that convey sadness, apathy, or indifference toward the situation, such as \"emptiness\" and \"hollow.\" These words suggest that the person feels disconnected from the experience. ## Step 3: Recognize the Disqualification Recognize how the response disqualifies the positive experience by implying it's meaningless. For instance, the line \"the small gestures, the everyday moments they'd been sharing lately felt hollow\" suggests that the speaker doesn't value these interactions, despite being part of them. ## Step 4: Understand the Implication Understand the implication of this response.
