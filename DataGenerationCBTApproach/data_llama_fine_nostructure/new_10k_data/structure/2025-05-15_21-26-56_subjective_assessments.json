The world seemed to be spinning out of control, leaving him lost in the middle of it all. It wasn't just the homeless crisis; he felt like everyone around him was pretending to be okay, but deep down, they were suffering just as much as he was. People kept telling him to stay positive, but the reality was far from it. Life was a constant struggle, and he couldn't help but wonder if anyone else felt the same way. With each passing day, he felt like he was losing himself. Everything seemed pointless, like he was just going through the motions. It was hard to keep hope alive when everything around him reminded him of his own isolation. He began to question whether anything could ever change.

But then I look around at my apartment, and it hits me - I'm not even here. This is all just a fantasy. A wishful thinking, a desperate attempt to escape reality. I've got bills to pay, deadlines to meet, and responsibilities to fulfill. No amount of booze or TV will make that go away. So why am I still feeling this way? Why does it feel like I'm drowning in a sea of responsibility? It's not fair, though. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would care if I disappeared. Would they even notice? Or would they be relieved? Maybe I don't deserve relief anyway. Maybe I'm just not good enough. I guess what I’m saying is, things aren’t going well right now. But maybe it’s not entirely my fault. Maybe we’re all just fucked.

A few weeks later, I received an email from my mom asking if I wanted to meet up for coffee. We hadn’t seen each other since the divorce, and I was curious what she’d say.
