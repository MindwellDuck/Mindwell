It had been six months since he left, but some days still felt like yesterday.\n\nHer mind began to wander, drifting back to their small apartment, the memories of their life together flooding her senses. She could almost smell the smoke from his favorite cigar, hear the way he used to laugh when she made him try new recipes. A pang of sadness twisted her stomach as she recalled the argument they'd had three days ago – the one where he'd told her he needed space, that he couldn't stay in a place that reminded him of his ex.\n\nAs she stirred the sauce, her hand brushed against the wooden spoon he'd given her on their first anniversary. It was now worn and scratched, a constant reminder of what she'd lost. The sweetness of the caramelized sugar turned bitter on her tongue as she thought about all the anniversaries they wouldn't be celebrating anymore.<|eot_id|>",

But then, like a switch flipping, I was no longer seeing the past; I was seeing the present, and that present was filled with anger. You think you're cooking dinner, but you're actually trying to prove a point. You stand there, stirring, your movements sharp and deliberate. Every stir is a statement, every glance a challenge. This isn’t just about food; this is about who you are, what you’ve become, and what you’re capable of. And I know exactly how to make you feel that way. I watched her as she moved through the kitchen, each step a calculated move, each gesture a message. Her hands were steady, but I knew the truth—that beneath the surface, she was seething. That look in her eyes—the one that said she wasn’t just cooking, she was planning. She was preparing for something more than just a meal. She was preparing for war. And I was ready for it. I knew how to turn her anger into fuel, how to fan the flames until they burned bright enough to ignite the fight. With every step, I felt myself getting closer to her, closer to the spark that would set"

She couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness, as if a part of her had been amputated along with him. The thought of returning to that house alone, of facing the silence and memories that haunted every room, felt suffocating.\n\nAs she gazed at the almost-finished painting, she wondered what he would think of it. Would he have liked the way the colors blended together? Would he have critiqued the composition? Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, and she knew she couldn't bear the thought of finishing the piece without him there to share it with.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she set down her brush, the canvas stretching out before her like a cold, empty grave.<|eot_id|>",

I’m starting to feel like I have no right to expect anything from her, especially since she’s always been the one who stayed behind while I went off to college. Now that she has time on her hands, she can focus on healing. But instead of doing something meaningful, she spends her days wallowing in self-pity and blaming everyone else for her problems. She constantly says things like “If you really cared about me, you wouldn’t have left,” or “You’re the reason I’m stuck in this rut.” It feels like she thinks I owe her everything and is using guilt to get me to cater to her needs. When I try to point out that her behavior isn’t helping, she accuses me of being heartless and uncaring. I know she's hurting, but honestly, it feels like she’s more interested in making me feel bad than actually working towards recovery. This constant barrage of blame is exhausting.

She felt a surge of irritation as she thought about all the times she'd warned him about overspending, only to be dismissed with a pat on the back and a promise to be more careful next time.\n\nAs they sat there in silence, the sound of the dishwasher humming in the background, she noticed a small, elegant watch on his wrist – a gift from his family for his recent promotion.

She remembered the first time he got drunk, when he'd stumbled home, passed out on the floor, and left her to clean up the mess. At the time, she'd thought it was just an accident, but now she realized it was a pattern.
