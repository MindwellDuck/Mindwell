What if the serum didn't work as expected? What if it caused unforeseen side effects? The more she thought about it, the more her hands trembled and her breath quickened.\n\nJust then, one of the dishes slipped from her grasp, shattering on the floor. A clear liquid spilled across the counter, mixing with the antiseptic solution and forming a murky puddle. The team's lead researcher turned to her, concern etched on his face.\n\n\"It's okay, let me help you,\" he said, but she shook him off, already imagining the presentation's demise. She felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead as she frantically tried to clean up the mess, her heart pounding in her chest.<|eot_id|>",

Our nurse felt a pang of discomfort, her eyes drifting to the younger woman, wondering if she was somehow replacing her – perhaps even becoming more valued by their supervisor.

She must have been doing something right to get those patients. I doubt she has as many years of experience as I do. Maybe I need to try harder to prove myself, but it feels like no matter what I do, I always end up getting stuck with the harder cases. She probably isn’t as smart as she thinks she is. Everyone’s just waiting for an excuse to fire me. This is ridiculous; I know I still have a lot to learn. But why does it feel like she’s taking over everything? I hope she doesn’t think she’s better than me. I don’t want to look inferior in front of our boss. I guess I should focus on learning from her, but I can’t help feeling jealous.
