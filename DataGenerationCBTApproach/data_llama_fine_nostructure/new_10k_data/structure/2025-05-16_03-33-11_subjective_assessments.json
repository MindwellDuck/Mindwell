Now, the pot sits empty, untouched, a reminder of all the meals they never got to share together.\n\nThe phone on the counter beeps, breaking the silence. He hesitates before picking it up, wondering if it's another delivery of flowers or some well-meaning but unnecessary condolence from a colleague.

He couldn't blame her; he'd been distant lately, too consumed by his own frustrations.\n\nAs he worked, he noticed the faint smell of paint thinner on his clothes, a scent he hadn't worn in years. It reminded him of his art school days, when he was still finding his voice. He'd always dreamed of being a successful artist, but life had other plans. Now, his studio was cluttered with half-finished projects and unpaid bills.\n\nThe more he painted, the more his strokes became jerky and aggressive. Colors blended together, swirling into a mess that didn't resemble anything beautiful. He felt like he was losing himself, like the art was the only thing keeping him afloat in this chaotic world.

As we stood side by side, watching him work, I noticed how much easier it was to pick up a palette than it was for him to hold a brush steady. His frustration was palpable, and I found myself feeling a twinge of sympathy—though not enough to interrupt my own creative flow. I glanced around the room, taking in the scattered canvases, each one a testament to his failed endeavors. In contrast, my latest piece sat proudly on an easel, its vibrant hues a reflection of my skill and dedication. The more I observed him, the more I realized that perhaps he wasn’t cut out for the artistic world. After all, creating something truly remarkable seemed to require a certain... je ne sais quoi—a quality he simply lacked. When my husband finally finished his painting, he let out a sigh, clearly disappointed. I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride; my own artwork had turned out perfectly, while his was nothing more than a jumbled mess.
