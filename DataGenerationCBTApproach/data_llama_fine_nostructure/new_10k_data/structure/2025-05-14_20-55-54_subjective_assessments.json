That we wouldn’t be happy without it? No, no, no - he’s clearly just being petty. He wants to make me feel bad about forgetting that date, so he’s playing games and hiding things from me. This isn’t about us; it’s all about him. But why would he act like this? Why would he suddenly start acting like an idiot and making me feel guilty? Is he trying to push me away?

They seemed to have something effortless about their interactions – a camaraderie that came naturally to them.\n\nThe door swung open, and Alex walked in, flashing a warm smile. For an instant, their eyes met, and she felt a jolt of familiarity. It was the same smile that had once lit up her entire world. But then he turned to greet his new friend, and she realized with a sinking feeling that this wasn't a social encounter at all – just a professional one.\n\nHe introduced her to the nurse, and they exchanged pleasantries, but the spark was gone. As Alex excused himself to grab a sandwich, she couldn't help but notice how easily he moved through the crowd, drawing people to him like a magnet. She took a step back, her mind replaying the countless times she'd imagined herself in his shoes, effortlessly charming those around her.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, she wondered if maybe, just maybe, she wasn't cut out for this whole doctor thing. Maybe she was meant to be someone else's patient, not their colleague. The thought sent a shiver down her spine as Alex approached, oblivious to the storm brewing inside her.<|eot_id|>",

She must think I’m boring, too. Everyone seems to enjoy his company effortlessly; I can’t even muster a smile without feeling like I’m faking it.

It was years since he'd last seen it in service, but memories of that unit still lingered – the camaraderie, the sense of purpose. He hadn't been able to muster the energy to donate it, too caught up in his own grief.\n\nA gust of wind whipped through the deserted parking lot, sending the badge flapping against the car. For a moment, it seemed like the world had slowed down, and all he could see was the reflection of himself in the polished metal. The faintest glimmer of his wedding band peeked out from beneath the sleeve of his jacket.\n\nHis eyes drifted away from the badge, and he took a step forward, as if drawn by an unseen force. The sound of sirens pierced the air, transporting him back to nights spent patrolling these streets with his partner, Rachel. They'd laughed together during those long shifts, exchanged jokes about the worst cases they'd ever worked. Her voice echoed in his mind, 'We make a good team.'\n\nThe sirens grew louder, more insistent. A young officer's voice crackled over the radio, 'Respond to 345 Oak Street...possible domestic disturbance.' As he watched, a sleek black cruiser pulled into the parking lot, its lights flashing. A young officer stepped out, scanning the scene before turning toward him.\n\nTheir eyes met, and for an instant, he felt the familiar rush of adrenaline. But this time, there was no Rachel by his side. No one to share the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of a job well done. Just the weight of his regret, pressing down upon him like a physical force.<|eot_id|>",

Every time he thought he was getting used to being alone again, that smell would hit him like a slap in the face, reminding him of what he'd lost. That little tattoo on her neck? Just a bonus insult. She must have gotten it right after we broke up, just to rub it in his face. How could she be so careless? Didn't she realize that having such an intimate mark on her body was just begging for people to notice? And notice they did, especially the way everyone seemed to stare at her when she walked by.
