As she expertly chopped vegetables for the soup of the day, her mind began to wander to their upcoming anniversary dinner – three weeks away. \n\nHer husband had mentioned wanting to try out a new recipe, something more elaborate than their usual routine. She couldn't quite remember what it was, but the thought of possibly messing it up made her stomach twist into knots. A customer ordered the special, and as she began to assemble the dish, her hands felt slicker than they had all morning.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. It was her husband, calling from his office break. He asked about the specials board, and she hesitated, unsure if she'd remembered correctly. 'How many servings?' he asked again, this time louder. She counted back in her head, trying to recall the exact numbers. But when she hung up the phone, she felt a bead of sweat trickle down her spine.<|eot_id|>",

We’re going to be married for 15 years soon, and I’m sick of her forgetting important dates. She thinks she can just wing it every time, and I get to clean up after her mistakes. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. Maybe I should just tell her to stop trying to impress me with her cooking skills because clearly, she doesn’t have any.

The woman's eyes landed on the exquisite presentation, and a hint of envy crept onto her face. For a fleeting moment, she felt the sting of insecurity, wondering if her own relationship had become stale – if the spark had dimmed, like the flickering flames of a dying fire.\n\nThe couple left, leaving behind a trail of whispered conversations and knowing glances from other diners. She turned back to her work, her movements mechanical, as the kitchen staff bustled around her. The familiar rhythms of the restaurant had always brought her solace, but now, they only served as a poignant reminder of what she had, and what she might be losing.<|eot_id|>",

He could have anything he wants, and I'm stuck here, working hard every day. You know, I think I've been cooking for years, and I still can't afford a house.

She hadn't taken a solo trip in years.\n\nThe doorbell rang, shrill in the quiet morning, breaking the spell of her reverie. It was her husband, coffee in hand, asking if she'd seen the post about the local art exhibit opening tonight. A wave of disappointment washed over her, followed by a pang of guilt. Why couldn't they have come together to support each other's work? The memory of his absence at her gallery show still stung.\n\nAs she forced herself to focus on the task at hand, her brush hovered above the canvas, hesitant to create anything new.

And don’t even get me started on how she talks about our friends and family – it sounds like she’s constantly mocking us behind my back. It’s hard enough being an artist in this city, but now I feel like I’m going through it all alone. My best friend moved away six months ago, and whenever we try to catch up, it always ends in disappointment. When he called yesterday, he barely acknowledged me, and then he hung up on me after I asked him about my latest project. This whole situation is really affecting my mental health. I’ve been struggling with anxiety since she left, and now I feel like things are spiraling out of control.
