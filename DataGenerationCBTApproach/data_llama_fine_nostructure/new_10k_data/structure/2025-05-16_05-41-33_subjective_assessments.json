The doctor next to her, a young resident, approached her with a question about medication dosages, but before she could answer, he interrupted himself to ask another question, then another.\n\nThe woman felt a familiar tickle of annoyance at being kept waiting. She'd had long days like this before – hospital shifts often ran late, and it seemed no one took into account the time she'd spent reviewing charts and preparing for rounds. As she replied to the resident's question, her mind began to wander back to the paperwork waiting for her after the shift, and how it would only add to the exhaustion already building inside her.<|eot_id|>",

It was always this way, never a smooth day in the hospital. She remembered when she first started working there, feeling overwhelmed by the constant stream of patients and the pressure to keep up. Every nurse seemed to be dealing with similar stressors - endless paperwork, demanding doctors, and the weight of life-or-death decisions. It was as if every shift was a test of endurance, leaving everyone drained. Even the usually cheerful staff seemed worn down, and I thought to myself, \"Is it really just me?\" But then, I saw the look on Dr. Smith’s face - a mix of frustration and worry. He was clearly stressed out too, and I realized that maybe my thoughts weren’t entirely fair. Maybe it wasn’t always this bad, maybe things even got better sometimes. Still, the memory lingered, reinforcing my belief that nursing shifts were always tough, and I wondered why anyone would choose such a high-stress job. I sighed inwardly, knowing I probably wouldn't change anything anyway. As I continued to watch, I noticed how quickly Dr. Smith jumped from one question to the next, his responses brief and to the point. It didn't seem like he was taking the time to consider each patient's unique needs; instead, he seemed focused solely"

I need to get back there ASAP, but I just want to crawl into bed and forget about this nightmare. I feel so stupid—like I’ve lost all sense of reality. Why did I let things get out of hand? I used to be a solid performer; now I’m nothing but a liability. I wish I could turn back time and do things differently, but that’s impossible.

Their parents were busy with work, and whenever he tried to talk to them, they just said they were stressed. His friends were going through their own struggles. One was dealing with health issues, while another struggled financially. Despite their efforts to support each other, the sense of community felt strained. They would meet up occasionally, but these gatherings lacked the ease they once shared. It wasn’t just that they didn’t have as much time; it felt like they had lost touch. Every conversation ended with a promise to catch up soon, but when they did, nothing seemed to have changed. It wasn’t just relationships. He noticed a change within himself too. He used to love cooking, but now even simple meals felt like an effort. When he tried to reconnect with old hobbies, like painting or playing guitar, the spark was gone. Even his thoughts felt forced, as if he was pretending to care about something that no longer mattered. Every day felt like a reminder that he was losing pieces of himself, like fragments falling away from a crumbling puzzle. He felt disconnected, and the world seemed to move on without him.

What’s worse is that everyone around us is fawning all over him, praising his “innovative approach” and “groundbreaking findings.” They’re all saying how great he is, how much we can learn from him, and how lucky we are to have him at our hospital. But honestly, I don’t want anything to do with him right now. I’m still trying to process everything that happened yesterday, but my mind keeps going back to the way he looked after accepting that award. His face was just so... perfect. Everything about him seemed so polished and refined—like he was wearing a mask that hid the real person underneath. I remember thinking that he must be putting on an act, pretending to be this confident, charismatic leader just to get ahead in life. I even caught myself wondering if he was secretly insecure, which would explain why he was acting so differently than usual. It’s funny how people can change their entire demeanor overnight, isn’t it? Sometimes I wonder if anyone ever sees the truth behind those fake smiles and charming words.

At work, at school, even when they were waiting for her at home. This wasn’t an isolated incident; it happened repeatedly. When she finally arrived, people would often complain about being kept waiting. Her tardiness became a habit, and those who waited for her began to lose patience. They started to see her as unreliable, someone who didn’t respect other people’s time. One day, a coworker mentioned this pattern during a meeting. \"We're so used to her showing up late that now whenever she does come in on time, we feel like something is off.\" This comment stuck with me because it highlighted how her constant lateness affected others. People grew accustomed to waiting for her, and then they felt annoyed when she showed up promptly. Even though one instance of punctuality doesn't necessarily mean she'll be late again, the fact that people responded negatively to it suggests that her chronic tardiness has become deeply ingrained in their minds. When she arrives on time, it throws them off balance, making them question whether everything will go smoothly from now on. Instead of seeing her as simply having a bad day, they start to wonder if this is a new development, if maybe she’s changed somehow. Perhaps she genuinely cares more about being on time this once, but deep down, she might still be the same person who consistently keeps everyone waiting"
