I mean, why bother with cooking when your life is already over?

The familiar sting of his words began to simmer alongside the pot, mingling with the flavors of garlic and thyme. But let’s be real, those flavors are nothing compared to the sharp pain of remembering how much he hated her cooking. And now, as she cooks, she can’t help but feel like every onion she chopes will bring back memories of how he used to belittle her in the kitchen. Maybe she wasn’t even chopping onions; maybe she was just standing there, seething with resentment. After all, what’s the point of cooking when you’re so clearly miserable? The doorbell rang, breaking the spell. It was her daughter, dropping by for dinner. Of course, she wouldn’t drop by for dinner. What would be the fun in that? No, no, her daughter must have stopped by to remind her of everything that went wrong in their marriage. She probably wanted to rub it in, telling her about her new boyfriend, or"

He flashed his charming smile, but it faltered as he took in her worn scrubs and the telltale smudge of dirt beneath her fingernails.\n\nThe sound of clinking cups and stifled laughter from the group around them seemed to grow louder, more oppressive, as if they were all waiting for her reaction. The air was thick with unspoken tension, and she felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach – the same one she'd been trying to ignore since their messy divorce six months ago.\n\nHe cleared his throat, attempting small talk, but his words felt like a betrayal, a reminder that life had moved on without her.

Either way, I couldn't handle it; I had to make a choice. My gaze locked onto his, searching for any sign of insincerity, but what I saw only reinforced my perception. His eyes, once warm and inviting, now seemed cold and calculating, like a chess player analyzing his opponent's moves. In that moment, I felt like I was staring into the abyss, unable to find solid ground. My thoughts swirled, fueled by the tension building inside me. Every step toward him felt like a betrayal, every glance a threat, until finally, I turned away, leaving him standing alone, lost in his own world. The rest of the day was a blur, my focus shifting from the surgeries to the constant mental replay of what might have happened. Had I misread everything? Was he just trying to be friendly? Whatever his intentions, I knew I needed to get out of there before things escalated further.
