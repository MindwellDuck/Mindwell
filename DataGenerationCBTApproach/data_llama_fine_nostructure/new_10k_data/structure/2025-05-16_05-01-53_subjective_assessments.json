I know I'm overreacting, but it feels like she doesn’t even want to spend time with me anymore. She must be having second thoughts about us. Or maybe she's just busy and doesn’t realize what she's missing. I try to remind myself that everyone gets distracted sometimes, but it’s hard when I see her laughing with friends or talking to someone else in a flirtatious way. That's why I decided to ask her about our anniversary tonight – I wanted to clear up any misunderstandings once and for all. But then I saw her smile when I asked her about it, and I started to feel guilty. Maybe I’m reading too much into it. Maybe she really does love me, and I'm just being paranoid. I don’t want to believe that she’s lost interest in me, but those doubts keep creeping back in. What if she is tired of me? What if I’m not good enough?

It wasn't fair; he was struggling with something much harder than them. But did she care? No, of course not. She was too busy pretending everything was okay to actually listen. It was all just another reminder that I'm alone in this. And now she's gone, leaving me feeling even more trapped. She'll never understand what it’s like to be where I am, and I can’t expect her to.
