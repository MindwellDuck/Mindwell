It had been three months since the divorce, but the ache still lingered, like a dull throb beneath her ribcage. She'd always defined herself by her role as partner to her husband – police officer, team leader, protector. Now, she was just another single mom trying to make ends meet.\n\nAs she sifted through the reports, one file caught her eye – the case she'd been working on when it all fell apart. The memories came flooding back: the late nights, the endless cups of coffee, the desperate hope that they could fix it. But now, it was just a reminder of what she'd lost.\n\nShe felt a lump form in her throat as she read the latest update: the suspect was still out of custody, and the investigation was going nowhere. The numbers didn't add up; the evidence was circumstantial at best. She couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed him, that she'd let him down.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, her voice flat as she answered. \" dispatch.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was familiar, but the words cut like a knife: \"Officer, we've got another one downtown. Looks like a domestic. Possible victim's a minor.\"<|eot_id|>",

I swear, every time I hear about someone who’s “living their best life,” I can bet there’s more to the story than meets the eye. They probably cheated on their spouse, or are using magic tricks to fool people into thinking they’re perfect. Meanwhile, I'm just dealing with real problems - like how my kid spilled cereal all over the carpet, and I need to clean it before school tomorrow.
