And when I shared some personal stuff, like how I’m struggling to balance my job and being a single dad, he just went along with the conversation without adding anything meaningful. Like, I get that people have busy lives, but it feels like he doesn’t care enough to actually listen. Maybe he thinks I'm boring?
