The woman smiled up at her partner, and they exchanged a warm glance. He felt a pang in his chest, remembering when his own wife would smile at him like that.\n\nThe door swung open, and a new nurse walked in, chatting with a colleague about their day. She noticed him sitting there, looking lost, and hesitated for a moment before approaching. 'Mind if I join you?' she asked softly. But as she sat down beside him, he realized she wasn't his age, and the conversation felt forced. He nodded curtly and took a sip of his tea, feeling more isolated than ever.<|eot_id|>",

Or perhaps I could start seeing a therapist who specializes in grief counseling. That way, I wouldn’t feel so trapped. ## Step 5: Take action I'll call a friend and ask them to meet me somewhere for a drink after work.

By blaming others—like his friend Mike, who shared happy stories about his life—aiden shifted the focus away from his pain. Instead of confronting the emptiness within, he externalized it by criticizing those around him. This coping mechanism allowed him to avoid dealing with the real issue: his inability to move forward. This response demonstrates how blaming can become a habitual defense mechanism for individuals struggling to cope with their emotions. By deflecting attention away from personal vulnerability, Aiden indirectly protects himself from the discomfort of facing his true feelings. However, this avoidance strategy ultimately leads to further emotional stagnation, reinforcing the need for more drastic measures."
