You're going to spill coffee everywhere when you're wearing that fancy dress anyway. It's not like she was wearing something really valuable. And those students were probably drunk, so they didn't even notice how much of a jerk they were being. They were probably too busy laughing about themselves to care about anyone else's problems. And don't even get me started on the barista - \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" Are you kidding me? That's the most generic apology ever. If you're really sorry, apologize properly! Don't just stand there, make some real gestures. I mean, come on, she just spilled hot coffee all over my friend's nice outfit. Is that really too much to ask? So yeah, I guess I'd say the barista wasn't very apologetic. But I wouldn't go out of my way to call them names or anything like that. I'd just tell them to be more careful next time and move on with my day. After all, I have better things to do than waste my time on petty complaints. **Response End**"

A young mother of two, diagnosed with stage three cancer last week. He had been her primary doctor since her initial consultation, and their conversations had left him feeling... off.
