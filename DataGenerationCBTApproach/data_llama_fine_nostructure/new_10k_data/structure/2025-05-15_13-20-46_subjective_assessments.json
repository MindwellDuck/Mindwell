But no one knows how hard it is to make those dishes perfect, how much time goes into sourcing the right ingredients, how many hours are spent perfecting each recipe. It's not something you learn overnight. And then there's the fact that my kid is barely qualified to work here. Sure, he helped out during the summer, but it was just a casual thing. No one expects him to handle the pressure of running a full-service restaurant. Not to mention, he's still in high school! What makes her think he's ready to contribute? But does she care? Does she ever stop and think about how hard it really is? How much stress I'm under every single day? Do you know how many times I've worked through the night because I couldn't get everything done perfectly? Do you know how much sleep I lose, how much energy I drain, how much of my life I sacrifice just so we can keep our business going? No, instead of supporting me, she's off talking"
