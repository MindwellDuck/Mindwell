He was lost in memories of the frantic phone calls, the sleepless nights, and the relieved smiles when they finally reached her stable condition. Now, the weight of those moments threatened to consume him once more.\n\nHis mind drifted back to the patient who'd died under his care six months prior. A routine procedure gone wrong, a miscommunication with the surgical team, and... A faint noise broke the spell.

I couldn’t help but feel that he was losing himself in these moments, reliving the stress and pain over and over. It wasn’t just the memories; the way he stared at the photograph, his eyes fixed on the worn image, it felt like an invasion. Every glance reminded him of what could have been if he had made different choices. But why would he think that? It’s not like he was thinking anything else—his attention was fully focused on the picture. Yet, somehow, every moment felt like a betrayal, as if he was being pulled into a cycle of guilt and regret. Every decision, no matter how small, became a source of anxiety. Even the simplest actions took on a life of their own, making him question whether he was truly capable of moving forward. And then there was the patient who had died under his care—a constant reminder of his perceived failure. The accident, though preventable, seemed to haunt him, forcing him to confront the reality of his own fallibility. But as I watched him, I realized that his emotions weren’t entirely rational. There was something almost... possessive about his behavior, as if he was trying to control the memories rather than letting them go.

It's clear he's only in it for himself, trying to look good and impress everyone else. Even his actions feel forced, like he's just going through the motions because it's expected of him. When he \"helped\" us, he barely even looked at us, and his attitude screamed \"I'm only doing this because I have to.\" Even though we're supposed to be grateful, I can't help feeling resentful.
