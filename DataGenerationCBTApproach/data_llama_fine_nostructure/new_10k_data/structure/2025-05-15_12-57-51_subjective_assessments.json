The cashier rings up a sale for another customer, seemingly oblivious to the woman's hasty departure.\n\nLater, during her break, she sips tea at the employee lounge and notices a coworker, new to the store, chatting with their supervisor about receiving a promotion. The conversation turns to the possibility of raises, and the new employee asks if they can discuss it further with management. The senior worker replies, 'I'm sure we'll get around to it, but first, let's focus on getting the sales up.'\n\nThe elderly woman listens, feeling a familiar knot form in her stomach. She recalls when her last job had increased her hours by a fraction, yet refused to bump her pay. Her thoughts linger on the years since then, spent juggling bills and expectations on an ever-dwindling pension.

There's a pause before he responds with a curt, \"It's fine.\" I notice that he didn't even look down at the items I rang up for him. After finishing his shopping, this same man walks into the store again, this time carrying a large bag filled with food and household items. When he reaches the front of the line, he begins to unload the contents onto the conveyor belt. I watch as he carefully places each item, making sure everything is accounted for. It takes several minutes, and by the time he finishes, there are dozens of items on the belt. I start scanning them, but he stops me, saying, \"Wait, I forgot something.\" He then proceeds to grab more items from his bag and adds them to the belt.
