He wasn't just agreeing; he was thinking about ways to sabotage the project and watch them fail. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger The trigger is an incident where the protagonist feels misunderstood and frustrated with the situation. This sets up the cognitive distortion. ## Step 2: Reflect the Cognitive Distortion Reflective writing is essential to recognize the distorted thought pattern. In this case, the protagonist believes they understand other people's thoughts and feelings without concrete evidence, leading to misinterpretation. ## Step 3: Create Emotional Intensity To convey anxiety, use emotive language such as intense emotions, urgency, and hyperbole. For instance, using phrases like \"boiling over,\" \"shaking with frustration,\" or \"anger boiling over.\" ## Step 4: Use Structured Structure Maintain a structured format by starting with the triggering event, followed by the distorted thought process, and ending with the reflection. Ensure each step flows logically into the next. ## Step 5: Include Cuss Words (Optional) If you choose to include cursory words, ensure they are used sparingly and don't detract from the overall quality of the piece. However, remember that using strong language can add depth to your reflection. ## Step 6: Edit and Refine Once you've written the response, edit it"

When it was her turn to help, she hesitated, fumbling slightly with the patient's IV pole, and had to be reassured by a colleague before proceeding correctly. A subtle smile played on the younger nurse's lips, as if she found some private amusement in our nurse's momentary awkwardness.\n\nA few minutes later, during the lunch rush, their supervisor announced that the hospital would be implementing a new electronic medical record system, which would require all staff to attend an intensive training session over the weekend. As the news sank in, our nurse felt a familiar knot of anxiety in her stomach, wondering if she'd be able to keep up – not because she wasn't capable, but because the thought of being 'that nurse who can't adapt.'
