The sound seemed particularly brazen after all the effort she had put into preparing his favorite meal.\n\nThe belch was followed by a nonchalant remark about how he was starving because he'd been working late, as if it was no big deal that she'd spent hours perfecting the recipe.

A faint scent of lavender lingered near the window, reminding him of the bouquet she'd given him on their anniversary. The memory stung, and he wondered what other details he'd miss if he'd never known her. Had she ever thought of him, even briefly, during those formative years? Did she imagine him, standing alone in this very space? A chill ran down his spine as he gazed at the photo on the mantle. They looked happy, but there was something distant in their smiles - a hint that they weren't truly together. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was living someone else's reality, one where they'd grown closer, where their laughter would fill this room instead of the emptiness.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the parking lot, he couldn’t shake the feeling that justice was an illusion, a myth perpetuated by those who didn’t care enough to make real changes.
