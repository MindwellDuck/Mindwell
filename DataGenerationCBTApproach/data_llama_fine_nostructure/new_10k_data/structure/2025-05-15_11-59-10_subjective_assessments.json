The stench lingered long enough to make her wrinkle her nose, and she shot him a disapproving glance. He was used to her fussiness about presentation, but this seemed particularly egregious – he'd always been diligent about taking out the trash before cooking.\n\nHer eyes narrowed as she began to re-garnish the dishes, trying to distract herself from the lingering smell. But every time she caught his eye, she felt a twinge of annoyance. She knew it was irrational; he wasn't intentionally trying to upset her. Still, the memory of the overpowering stench lingered, making her skin prickle with distaste.<|eot_id|>",

It’s such a big deal; every time we get a new order, it affects our whole system. Plus, I put so much thought into making those dishes, and they’re always well-received by customers. Why would she just introduce these new options? Doesn’t she know how stressful it is to keep up with all the orders? And what’s wrong with the old recipes anyway? I don’t see anything wrong with them. This must be some kind of personal attack against me. It feels like she doesn’t trust my cooking skills or thinks I’m incompetent. Maybe there’s more to it than I know? That kitchen has always been chaotic enough without adding this stress. Now, whenever I see a customer, I worry they’ll ask for one of those new dishes, which could make things even worse. My mind keeps replaying the conversation, thinking I said or did something to upset her. It’s hard not to take it personally when everything seems to be falling apart around me.

It was her daughter, calling to check in before dinner. A warm smile spread across her face, but it faltered when she heard the tone of concern in her voice.
