She sighed, feeling a lump form in her throat as she began to talk about the article – about the politician who'd been embezzling funds from their community – and how it reminded her of her own mistakes all those years ago, when she'd let her ambition blind her to the truth. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized she'd never gotten the chance to make things right, that her career had taken off while her personal life had fallen apart. The silence between them grew thicker, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved regrets.<|eot_id|>",

It feels like an endless cycle of research and writing, with barely anyone reading anything except my opinion. We used to be happy, we used to have each other. Now... now it feels like every conversation is about work, and I’m tired of it.” He looked at me with concern. “What are you talking about? Why would you think that?” “I don’t know,” I said, shaking my head. “Maybe it’s because of the way you’ve been pushing me lately. Remember when you were working late one night, and I saw you crying? I thought maybe you’d lost your favorite pen or something, but then you told me you were stressed about a meeting. And after that, you started taking more projects, leaving less time for us.” “Of course, I did. Things got busy again.” His voice was calm, almost dismissive. “You didn’t notice how much I worked on our anniversary last year?” I felt a sting, remembering how he’d spent most of that day alone, working on the project while I went out with friends. “No, I didn’t notice. But I remembered how you’d always say how important our relationship was to you. You said you wanted to spend quality time together.

She let it ring twice before answering, hoping against hope that it might be a wrong number, someone who needed help with something urgent. But when she heard the voice on the other end, her heart sank. It was the realtor, calling to confirm the details of her mother's estate sale. A part of her had been putting off this conversation, afraid of what she would find out. Now, as she listened to the voice explaining the terms of the sale, she felt a crushing weight settle over her, suffocating her.<|eot_id|>",

The smell of his cologne still clung to every corner, taunting her with what could never be again. But life goes on, even if it doesn’t want to. And she’d always known that she couldn’t stay frozen in time, no matter how hard she tried. Maybe she should just accept that things were meant to shift, that some wounds would take longer to heal than others. It didn’t mean she had to enjoy the pain, but perhaps she could learn to live with it, to find a way to keep moving forward despite the weight of grief. After all, isn’t that what people were supposed to do? Move on? It wasn’t easy, but surely that’s why we had each other – for support, for understanding, for the comfort of knowing we weren’t truly alone in our struggles.

It effectively conveys the theme of cognitive distortion by using an anxious tone, blunt structure, and casual intensity.
