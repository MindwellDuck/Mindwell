As she began to type, her mind kept wandering back to the conversation - what if they didn't meet the target? What if the team fell behind?\n\nJust as she was starting to focus, her phone buzzed with an email from her husband, asking when she planned to pick up their daughter from soccer practice. She hesitated, feeling a surge of guilt and anxiety about balancing work and family life. Her thoughts quickly spiraled out of control, imagining all the ways she could fail both her job and her family.\n\nThe cursor on her screen seemed to blink slowly, taunting her with its steady rhythm, as she felt her breath catch in her throat.

As he waited in line, his eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of colleagues, but none of them were hers.\n\nA group of young nurses gathered around a table, laughing and chatting about their weekend plans. One of them caught his eye – a bright smile, a messy bun, a look of carefree joy that made his chest ache. For a moment, he forgot where he was, forgot what he was doing there. He forgot she wasn't beside him.\n\nThe barista called out his name, breaking the spell. He took his coffee, trying to focus on the day ahead, but his mind kept wandering back to the empty seat at lunchtime, the one they used to share. The sound of clinking dishes, the murmur of conversations, it all seemed so different now.\n\nAs he turned to leave, he noticed a bouquet of flowers on a nearby table, a card attached to them reading 'To a wonderful nurse, thank you for being there'. A lump formed in his throat as he wondered who could have sent those, and why.<|eot_id|>",

Couldn't he see how much I needed this validation? Didn't he understand that this award meant everything to me? She took a deep breath, forcing herself to focus. Maybe if she ignored him, he'd go away. But he didn't budge, keeping his eyes fixed on hers with an unnerving intensity.
