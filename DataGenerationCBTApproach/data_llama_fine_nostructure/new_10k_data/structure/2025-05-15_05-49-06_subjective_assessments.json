I bet she thinks the colors are going to come alive, dance across the walls, reminding her of what she's lost. What a joke. Like anything she paints could possibly bring him back. But why would it? He's gone. Gone forever. And now she's stuck here, alone, painting her memories instead of creating new ones. Memories that mean nothing anymore. Just empty, hollow reminders of a love that no longer exists. This isn't art; it's torture. Each brushstroke feels like a punch to the gut, each color a reminder of what she's lost.

A feeling of dread began to creep up her spine as she realized she might have contributed to the woman's decline.
