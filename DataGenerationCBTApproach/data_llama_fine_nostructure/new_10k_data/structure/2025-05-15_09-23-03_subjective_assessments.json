It had been six months since the accident, but the pain still lingered, a constant reminder of what he'd failed to protect.\n\nA knock at the door broke the silence, and he turned to see his partner, Rachel, standing in the doorway with a somber expression. \"We need to review the case files again,\" she said, her voice low.\n\nAs he gathered the files, his mind began to wander back to that fateful night. He replayed the sounds of sirens, the screech of tires, the cries for help. His eyes landed on a photo of himself and his wife, taken just before he left for his shift. They were smiling, happy, carefree.\n\nRachel cleared her throat, snapping him back to reality. \"We need to discuss the evidence,\" she said, handing him a file. As he took it, his fingers brushed against a piece of paper that had slipped out of the folder. A note, scribbled in haste, caught his eye: \"I love you, be careful.\"\n\nHis heart sank, and his face burned with shame. How could he have been so reckless? So selfish?

She'd convinced him that she was worried sick about him, that she wanted to talk to him, that she needed his help. But it was all a ruse. She'd never even known him beyond the surface level. She was an actress, pretending to be someone she wasn't, just to get close to him. And now, with the whole thing falling apart, she was trying to turn him into a suspect. How could anyone fall for such a blatant lie? He thought back to the times she'd called, claiming to be distressed, asking for his help, begging him to meet up. It was all just a game, a way to keep him under her control. And when he finally realized what was going on, she'd disappeared. No one knew where she was, but he knew exactly why. Her plan had worked too well. She'd gotten inside his head, making him believe he was responsible for the accident. That he'd caused it by being late, by not paying attention. All along, she'd been manipulating him, pushing him further into guilt and paranoia. Now, as he sat in the hospital, surrounded by the wreckage"
