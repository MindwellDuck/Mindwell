He'd always asked for it on their anniversary, and she'd lovingly prepared it every year.\n\nAs she added a pinch of thyme, her mind began to wander to the upcoming dinner party she was hosting for the local food club. It was supposed to be a celebration of her late husband's culinary legacy, but now she couldn't shake off the feeling that something would go wrong. The kitchen seemed smaller than usual, and the pots and pans clanging against each other echoed through the empty silence like a nagging reminder of all the things she couldn't control.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang, breaking the spell. She hesitated, wondering if she should answer it – who could it be? A delivery, perhaps? Or maybe someone had come to help with the cooking? Her heart sank slightly as she imagined the possibility of needing to call in someone else to take care of the preparations. What if they didn't turn up on time?

Now, years later, it felt like an eternity since life had slowed down.\n\nAs she gazed at the picture, a single tear rolled down her cheek, merging with the dust particles dancing in the faint sunlight streaming through the window.

That guy's got a lot going on, and it’s easy to see why he’d rather focus on something else than dwell on his worries. But honestly, how can we trust someone who seems so optimistic about a situation that must be weighing heavily on him? Maybe he’s just better at hiding his true feelings than we are. Who knows?
