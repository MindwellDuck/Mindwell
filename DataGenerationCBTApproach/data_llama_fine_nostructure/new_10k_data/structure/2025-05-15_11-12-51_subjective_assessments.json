He tried to focus on the task at hand – crunching numbers and making a budget – but his hands were shaking, and his eyes kept darting towards the phone, wondering what the bank would say when he called them tomorrow.\n\nThe air seemed to vibrate with tension, and every tick of the clock felt like an eternity.

She can’t even look you in the eye anymore, always looking down, like she’s trying to hide something. But what? What could possibly be hidden behind those cold, empty eyes? And don’t even get me started on how distant she is. She doesn’t have the energy to make small talk anymore; every time we meet up, it feels like an eternity passing by, and when we finally part ways, I feel like I’m leaving behind someone who no longer exists. It’s like she’s living in a different world, one where nothing matters, and she has no place in it. And yet, she insists on pretending everything is fine. Pretending like this is all normal, like nothing out of the ordinary is happening. It’s as if she believes that somehow, someway, everything will magically fix itself. That somehow, she’ll find a way to escape this reality. To forget this pain, this emptiness. To pretend that none of this ever happened. But deep down, we know it won’t end well.

It had been six months since her sister passed away, and yet the pain still felt like an open wound. She remembered the countless hours they spent discussing their shared passion for journalism, the late-night conversations over cups of tea, and the laughter that echoed through their small apartment.\n\nHer eyes wandered to the empty space where her sister used to sit, now occupied by John's gentle hand resting on her own.

Sometimes, they try to laugh it off, but deep down, they know they've been outsmarted by a clever kid. This isn't the first time I've witnessed something similar; there have been instances where teachers looked like they'd been punched in the gut. Even if they manage to recover quickly, it's clear that they're shaken by these events. The way they struggle to regain their composure makes me wonder how often this actually happens. Is it really common, or are these incidents just random flukes? Considering how often this happens, it's surprising that more teachers don't lose their cool. Maybe they just pretend to be okay because they need to maintain order in the classroom. But honestly, I think most would admit that they feel humiliated after such incidents.
