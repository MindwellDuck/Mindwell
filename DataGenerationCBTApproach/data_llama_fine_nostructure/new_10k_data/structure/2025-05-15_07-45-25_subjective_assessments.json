It wasn't until they stepped closer, hands raised in a calming gesture, that she realized it was just a rookie officer from the training unit, searching for her.\n\nBut the sudden movement had triggered a familiar knot in her stomach – the same sensation she got when responding to a high-stress call, the same rush of adrenaline that left her breathless. For a moment, she forgot about the years since her husband's passing, forgot about being alone again.

One moment she is trying to calm down, and the next she is convinced something is wrong and needs to get out of there. This is all because of what happened five years ago. After my husband died, I went through a period where I couldn’t handle anything except his presence. If he wasn’t there, I felt lost. He always knew exactly how to make me feel better, whether we were watching TV together or just sitting in silence. When he passed away, I found myself going back to those moments whenever I needed comfort. But now, every time I see someone else’s face, especially if they look similar to him, it makes me uncomfortable. Even though I know intellectually that I’m just grieving, my body reacts differently. I can’t explain why, but it feels like I’m reliving the pain all over again. Every conversation, every interaction, it’s like I’m waiting for something to happen. And sometimes, it does. Like today, when I saw that man standing near her, she became overwhelmed. She thought he might have been here before—maybe even with her husband. That thought sent her spiraling back into grief. It’s hard to control these feelings anymore; some days are better than others, but no matter what happens, I’m always ready to defend myself. I don’t want anyone to hurt me.

It makes her wonder what would've happened if they stayed together, if they could've worked things out. Maybe she'll ask him to come in sometime soon, see if they can find some common ground again. She hopes he's doing okay, maybe she'll even bring him something special – a nice bottle of wine or a small gift. That way, she can show him that she cares, even if things didn't work out between them. She knows it won't change anything, but she wants to try anyway.
