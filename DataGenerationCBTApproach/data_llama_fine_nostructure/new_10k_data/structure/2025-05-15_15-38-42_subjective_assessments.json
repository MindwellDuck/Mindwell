His eyes drifted away from the papers, focusing on some point beyond the edge of the room, and for a moment, he simply sat there, overwhelmed by the emptiness that had been growing inside him.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe we could find someone who actually cares. Someone who'll give him the emotional support he desperately needs. But then again, wouldn't that be selfish? They've got enough on their plate already. Do we really need to add another burden to their lives? I mean, it's not like he's asking for much. Just someone to talk to, maybe share a meal or two. But no, instead of reaching out, he chooses to isolate himself further. It's almost as if he's trying to punish himself for what happened. And yet, despite everything, he still holds onto hope. Perhaps deep down, he knows that things will get better someday. Maybe he's waiting for the right person to come along, someone who'll bring him back to life.

He'd say things like, “That doesn’t apply to me” or “Everyone else has been through worse,” which showed his refusal to accept any positivity.
