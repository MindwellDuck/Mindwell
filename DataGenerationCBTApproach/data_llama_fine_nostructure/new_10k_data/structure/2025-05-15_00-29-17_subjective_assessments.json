It’s really frustrating that every single thing that goes wrong happens whenever she’s involved. It’s such an easy assumption to make that she’s the one who’s always causing problems.

All she can see is him, standing beside her, holding her hand, and smiling at the beauty she creates.

But why does everything feel empty? Why does every step I take remind me of what I've lost? He never liked my art. Never. He hated how I spent hours painting and drawing, how I got lost in the world of color and texture. He always said I wasted my time, that I should focus on making money instead. That I should let go of my passion and pursue a real job. But I couldn't do that. I couldn’t leave my art behind. And now, without him, it feels like I’m drowning in a sea of paint and brushes.
