The dinner service was supposed to start in 20 minutes, but the walk-in fridge was out of order and she had no backup plan. Her phone buzzed with texts from suppliers and customers, all demanding to know why they hadn't received their orders yet.\n\nAs she frantically tried to call the repairman, the fire alarm went off, shattering the silence. She felt her heart racing, her breath catching in her throat. The dining room doors swung open, revealing an empty space where normally there were bustling tables and the hum of conversation. The staff stared at her, confusion etched on their faces.\n\nThe chef's hat slipped askew, and for a moment, everything seemed to spin out of control. She felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead, her palms growing slick with perspiration. The kitchen, once her sanctuary, had become a nightmare.<|eot_id|>",

It feels like I'm just an inconvenience to her, another thing she can ignore whenever she gets stressed. She never takes responsibility for anything; she just blames everyone else for her problems. Even though we’re both employees, she thinks it’s okay to treat us like this when things get tough. It makes me so angry every time she does it. We have to rely on each other to keep the restaurant running, but she just doesn’t seem to care. When I try to talk to her about how stressed I am, she just tells me to stop worrying about it. Like, what am I supposed to do? Just sit back and wait for her to fix whatever is wrong? It’s exhausting. But honestly, I think she just likes being right. Whenever we disagree, she tries to make me look bad in front of the rest of the team. She has no empathy for anyone else’s feelings except her own. It’s really frustrating.

As she scanned the chart of a young patient admitted under her care, her eyes caught the date – two years ago today. The day her husband passed away.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the empty space beside her on the couch, where he used to sit during family movie nights. She felt the familiar pang of regret wash over her, wondering if there was more she could've done to prevent his passing. Had she pushed him too hard to finish his residency? Should she have encouraged him to take more time off?\n\nThe beeping of a nearby machine snapped her back to reality. A nurse approached, asking for her input on the patient's medication regimen. As she began to respond, her mind wandered again, replaying conversations they'd had about their future plans. Plans they never got to make together.\n\nA low murmur from another doctor interrupted her thoughts, drawing her attention to the conversation unfolding nearby. Her colleague mentioned a new study on early intervention for certain cancers, which might have altered the course of her husband's treatment.

The project had been a failure, but it was the only time they'd felt truly alive together.\n\nAs he gazed at the emptying trees, he noticed the calendar on his desk, the date circled in red - their anniversary.

Every project seemed too small, every task too mundane, compared to what he used to do. He felt like he was drowning in a sea of meaningless tasks, each one a reminder that the excitement he once shared with his wife was gone, lost forever. But then there were moments like today – when he thought he saw her standing beside him, her hand gently nudging his shoulder. It was just his imagination playing tricks on him again, he told himself. Yet, the image remained, haunting him. She wouldn’t want me to feel this way, would she? I must have done something wrong, she'd say if she were here. Maybe it’s because I stopped believing in fate after everything that happened. Maybe I’m just waiting for her to come back, even though we both know that isn’t possible. He looked around the office, taking in the familiar faces.
