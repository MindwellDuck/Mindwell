The kitchen was warm and chaotic, the sounds of sizzling meat and lively chatter filling the air. His partner, Rachel, walked in, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on him.\n\nFor a moment, their gazes locked, and he felt a familiar knot form in his stomach. It had been months since he'd forgotten to pick up milk on his way home from work – a small oversight, but one that still lingered in his mind like a nagging mistake.\n\nRachel approached him, a hint of disappointment in her voice. \"Hey, I thought we agreed you'd be home by six?\" She raised an eyebrow, her expression softening slightly. \"Everything okay?\"\n\nThe heat from the stovetop seemed to intensify, making his skin prickle with discomfort. He fumbled with a spatula, his hands moving awkwardly as he tried to deflect attention. \"Yeah, sorry. Traffic was a nightmare.\"\n\nTheir conversation continued, but he couldn't shake the feeling of being caught, of being exposed. The memory of that missed pickup lingered, refusing to be dismissed. As he plated the evening's dishes, his movements became mechanical, his mind replaying the sequence of events leading up to his failure.<|eot_id|>",

Please, that's just ridiculous. I mean, come on, it's just a simple grocery run. What's the big deal? You know what really sucks? How he expects me to forget this stupid thing. Like, seriously, does he think I'm some kind of idiot who can just erase the past? Newsflash, honey: I remember everything. So don’t act all innocent when you clearly know exactly what happened. You’re just mad because your precious plan got ruined, and now everyone thinks less of you. Well, let me tell you something: nobody likes a hypocrite, especially not someone as self-righteous as you. And another thing - why is he even cooking tonight? Did he have to work late again? Of course he did. That’s why he forgot. Now he’s putting us out, expecting us to eat dinner while he’s exhausted.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety since my last breakup, and things aren’t getting better anytime soon.

He hadn't had time to cook dinner for himself in weeks, let alone entertain any guests. The restaurant was struggling, and his own expenses were piling up.\n\nMaria cleared her throat, breaking the silence. \"Chef, I need to talk to you about the menu.\" Her voice was laced with concern, but he barely registered it.

The maître d' greeted them warmly, but Aiden's gaze drifted back to the kitchen, where Maria was waiting patiently for his attention.

He had so many things to worry about, from the restaurant’s financial struggles to his personal problems. Even the simple act of serving food felt overwhelming. But what really got under his skin was when Maria mentioned something about the menu. She was trying to help, but did she know what it was like to be constantly stressed out? To always have to juggle orders and ingredients while keeping an eye on the bottom line? To deal with demanding customers who never appreciate the effort he puts into each dish? No, Maria didn’t understand. She was just another employee, after all. What did she know? The way Maria spoke made him feel like she was criticizing him again. He knew she wanted better equipment, but why did she bring it up now? Wasn’t there already enough going on? Maybe if he managed to find some time off, he could finally get some rest.
