A few other doctors in the area followed suit, their chuckles growing louder as they took in the sight of the coffee-stained coat. He felt a flush rise to his cheeks as he hastily tried to brush off the stain, his eyes darting around the room in embarrassment.\n\nThe resident who had first spoken up cleared his throat and said, \"Well, I guess someone needs a refill.\" The group erupted into laughter again, and this time, even the barista cracked a smile.

Is it really that easy for them to just assume they have access to my private thoughts? It’s clear that no one actually cares about my well-being; instead, they’re just enjoying the spectacle. And why wouldn’t they be? After all, it’s entertaining to watch someone squirm under pressure. But what if I told them that I’m actually quite fine with the situation? Maybe I’d say something along the lines of “I’m good, thanks!” or “No worries.” But no, they wouldn’t listen because they’ve already decided what I’m thinking. They must feel superior for being able to understand me better than anyone else, which is just ridiculous. Who are they to assume they know my innermost thoughts?

His eyes welled up with tears as he thought about his wife, lying still in the bed where they once shared laughter and tears. Why hadn’t he been there to comfort her?
