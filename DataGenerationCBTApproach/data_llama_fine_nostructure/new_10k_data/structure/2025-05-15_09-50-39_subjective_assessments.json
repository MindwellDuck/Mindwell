He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach, a sense of frustration and helplessness that he hadn't experienced since his own divorce.\n\nThe teacher next to him shot him a sympathetic glance, but even her understanding expression only made him feel more annoyed. Why did parents think they knew better? Didn't they realize that he was trying his best?\n\nThe phone rang, shrill and insistent, breaking the tension momentarily. It was the school administrator, reminding him about the upcoming parent-teacher conference that would have to take place despite his protests.

That time, she had actually gotten it right. Well, most of them did, anyway. She smiled, and he could see the satisfaction in her eyes. Even though it meant he'd failed his test, it still counted. What mattered was that she understood, and she was happy about it. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes I wonder why people make such a big deal about grades. If you're doing your job, isn't that enough? I'm sorry, I got sidetracked. Back to the worksheet. Yeah, I'll probably just give it back today. Or maybe not.

It’s not fair to compare myself to others, especially since many people have found love and are content with their partners. In fact, I know there are plenty of single men who don’t have anyone either, so what’s wrong with me? Everyone has their reasons, whether it's past traumas, fears of commitment, or simply being too picky. If I can just remind myself of these complexities, maybe I'll stop letting those fleeting moments get under my skin. This isn't about blaming others; it's more about accepting my own path. I'd rather be alone than settle for someone who doesn't understand me. Besides, some might say that holding hands is a superficial sign of affection, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything deeper. My feelings aren't irrational; they're just honest reflections of how I truly feel. There’s no need to analyze these situations further; just knowing that everyone has their story makes me feel better. Maybe I’m just sensitive, but it's hard not to take it personally when I see happy couples everywhere. Still, I won’t change; I’ll keep focusing on what matters most – my career and personal growth. These observations won't affect my decisions, because I know what's best for me."
