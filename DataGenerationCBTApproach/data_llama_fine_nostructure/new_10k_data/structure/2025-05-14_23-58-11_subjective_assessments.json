His mind began to wander down a familiar path, rehashing what could've been if they'd stayed together. He felt the familiar knot forming in his stomach, a mix of anger, sadness, and frustration. He quickly silenced his phone, not wanting to get sucked into the vortex of emotions again. But the damage was done; his heart rate had already begun to quicken, and he knew he needed to take a few deep breaths to calm himself down.<|eot_id|>",

The messages were probably deleted hours ago, and now she has someone else who doesn’t know anything about us. Someone who thinks we’re still together? Why does this keep happening?

And finally, after months of nothing, she sends him a text out of nowhere, as if I haven’t heard from her for years. What does she want? Is she trying to manipulate me? If so, why? Why do I always fall for it? What am I supposed to say? “Oh, great, another one of your friends. Just peachy.” No fucking way. This isn’t funny anymore. She’s using me, just like she used to when we were together. Remembering all those good times won’t help me now. They never did. I need to stop this cycle before it consumes me completely.

He checked her chart, only to find that her parents had altered her dosage again without consulting him. The nurse who had administered the dose earlier was out sick, and he wasn't authorized to make changes himself.\n\nThe phone on the counter rang, shrill in the quiet morning calm.

Like when James’ mom insisted on giving him the same medication twice, saying it was supposed to help with his asthma. Well, let me tell you, it didn’t help. It made him throw up all over the place. I ended up having to call an ambulance just so we could get him to the ER. And what did the parents say after that? That I must have done something wrong? That I wasn’t doing enough? I told them it wasn’t my fault, that I followed the protocols, but they still wouldn’t listen. So yeah, I know exactly how this feels.
