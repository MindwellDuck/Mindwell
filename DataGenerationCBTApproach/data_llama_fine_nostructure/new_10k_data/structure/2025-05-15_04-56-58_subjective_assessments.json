The room seemed to shrink, and all eyes were on her. Her face burned with embarrassment as she felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes.

But noooo, I wore it anyway because I wanted to impress the guy I'm seeing. Well, let's just say he didn't seem impressed. Anyway, so we're sitting there, trying to have a nice time, but every five seconds, some asshole waiter comes over and tells us something about the specials, or how they've changed the menu, or whatever. And each time, he makes these snarky comments about our food, like \"Hey, why don't you try our new garlic bread?\" Ugh, right? Like, seriously? We already ordered. I guess he thought we wanted to share? So yeah, it was super annoying, and honestly, I was thinking of leaving, but then...then the real kicker came. One of the waiters brought us a glass of wine, and the server—let's call him Tom—starts rambling on about how he used to work here before he moved away. Tom told this hilarious story about how he accidentally spilled an entire bottle of wine on a customer's lap during his first month on the job, and everyone was so embarrassed that they ended up paying for the rest of the table’s bill.

Rachel seemed nonchalant, almost amused by this development.\n\nThe conversation shifted to discussing the upcoming hospital gala, where Emily was scheduled to attend as a guest.
