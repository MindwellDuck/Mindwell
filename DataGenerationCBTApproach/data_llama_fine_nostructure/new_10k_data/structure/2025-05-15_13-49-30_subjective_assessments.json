My ex-husband had left me everything - the house, the money, even the memories we'd made here.\n\nWhy did he get to keep the stories? I, the journalist, who'd spent decades uncovering truths and telling them with precision and passion. But no, my own life wasn't newsworthy enough, so I got left behind.\n\nAs I rummaged through dusty files, I stumbled upon an unfinished piece I'd worked on before our marriage ended. A exposé on corruption within the city council. I'd quit mid-sentence, unsure if I could handle the fallout. Now, with hindsight, I realized I'd been too scared.\n\nMy eyes landed on a note scribbled in the margin - 'Finish it, Alice.' Not 'Alice' though; it was 'Jill'. That was what they called me back then. My maiden name. Who I used to be. The pain stung as I remembered how quickly I'd abandoned that part of myself.\n\nWith shaking hands, I typed those few final sentences, letting the words spill out like tears. The truth came flooding back, and with it, regret. For not fighting harder. For giving up. As I hit send, I knew I'd never be able to go back to the way things were. But maybe, just maybe, someone would read these words and remember the stories we all try to hide.<|eot_id|>",

He's been trying to one-up me for years, but this time it was personal.\n\nWe were discussing our latest patient, the young kid who'd come in with a rare condition. Now, I'd spent hours researching, pouring over every study, every paper, every expert opinion. And what does Smith do? He walks in here like he owns the place, spouting off some half-baked theory he found online.\n\nI tried to keep my cool, but inside I was seething. This isn't about being competitive; it's about respect. We're both doctors, for crying out loud! We've dedicated our lives to this field. Can't we just agree to disagree?\n\nBut no, Smith had to go and take a shot at me. Said I was \"out of touch\" with modern medicine, that I was clinging to outdated methods. I could feel my blood pressure rising as he lectured me, his voice dripping with condescension.\n\nAnd then, the final straw. He mentioned the patient's name – Alex – and said he was going to prescribe him some new treatment, something that wasn't even approved yet. Like I wouldn't know that already.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I watched Smith walk out of the room, a smug look on his face. How dare he? Does he think he's better than me? That I'm somehow less capable because I've spent decades studying this field?\n\nAs I sat there, fuming, I couldn't help but think about all the times I'd done the same thing to others. All the times I'd been just as arrogant, just as dismissive. But it never seemed to affect me. Until now.\n\nAlex, that poor kid... What if Smith's treatment doesn't work? What if it makes things worse? The thought sent a wave of sadness crashing through me. I didn't mean to get so worked up, but it's hard not to when you feel like your expertise is being disrespected.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm down, but it was too late. The tears started streaming down my face as I realized I wasn't just fighting for my ego; I was fighting for my patients. For the people I care about.

I tried to stay calm, but I could feel myself getting more agitated by the minute. It’s hard not to when someone is questioning your competence like that. I kept thinking about all the times he’d done similar things in the past — the way he would interrupt me, the snide comments he made about my research. It was like he was doing everything in his power to make me look bad. At one point, he even brought up Alex, the young patient we’re treating together. He said he was going to prescribe him a new treatment that hadn’t even been approved yet, which basically implied that I was holding him back.

Maybe she should’ve stayed home that day, avoiding the tension altogether. Maybe she’d been better off accepting the commendation earlier, before things got complicated. Or maybe she simply wasn’t meant to win; maybe she was just never good enough. It was ridiculous to think that she deserved the commendation in the first place. She must have gotten lucky, after all.

My partner, Alex, was still asleep beside me, but I knew she wouldn't want to hear about it anyway.\n\nAs I got out of bed, my eyes landed on the latest rejection letter from the gallery we'd been trying to get our work into for months. Not just any rejection, mind you – this one was from the curator herself, who'd made a point to write a condescending little note about how our work wasn't 'edgy' enough.\n\nI tossed the letter onto the nightstand, where it joined the stack of other rejections, each one a tiny paper weight reminding me of why I couldn't quit. But as I made my way to the coffee maker, I stumbled upon a half-finished painting that Alex had left on my easel the night before. It was one of those pieces that spoke volumes about her artistic vision, and mine.\n\nIt was...fine. Not bad, exactly. But not great either. Just another piece that would inevitably collect dust in some back room somewhere. And then I saw the date scribbled on the corner – yesterday. Yesterday! We'd spent hours discussing it, pouring over colors and textures, and she'd walked away feeling satisfied.\n\nMy stomach twisted into knots as I thought about all the times we'd talked about our dreams, our ambitions. How I wanted to make a name for myself as an artist, and how she'd promised to support me every step of the way. Now it seemed like that was all just a pipe dream.\n\nAlex stirred beside me, rubbing her eyes awake. \"Hey,\" she said, yawnning. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"Just the usual,\" I replied, forcing a smile. \"Just trying to wake up.\"\n\nBut the truth was, I didn't know how much longer I could keep pretending everything was okay. The more rejections I faced, the more I felt like I was drowning in my own failures. And now, staring at Alex's art, I realized I might have been living someone else's dream all along.<|eot_id|>",

Whoa, what amazing luck! And don't even get me started on how she always has to bring up her family background.

Have I worked tirelessly to build my culinary empire from scratch? Or does she just see the tired eyes and frazzled hair of a divorced mom trying to make ends meet?\n\nI take my station and start plating the dishes, all while trying to ignore the seething anger building inside me. But when Vivian takes her first bite of the filet mignon, her expression turns into a snarl. \"This is overcooked,\" she spits. \"And what's with the weird sauce?\"\n\nWeird sauce?!

I said, 'Hey, hon, how's it going?' And she just gives me this condescending smile and says, 'Oh, you know, just discussing the finer points of Jane Austen with my friends.'\n\nAnd then it hits me - I'm 74 years old, and I still don't have any friends. I've got my colleagues at work, but they're all younger than me, and they think I'm some kind of dinosaur. My wife's got her book club, and we've got our little family gatherings. But when it comes down to it, I'm alone.\n\nI look around the kitchen, and it's just so... empty. The TV's on, but no one's watching it. The couch is vacant, except for the stupid pillow that looks like it's been sat on by a thousand people. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know?\n\nAnd then I see the calendar on the fridge, and it's just filled with women's events - bridge nights, luncheons, and book clubs. I mean, what's wrong with me? Don't I deserve to do something just for myself? Is that too much to ask?\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just a ghost haunting this house. A reminder that my wife's life is moving forward, while mine is just stuck in neutral. And you know what really gets my goat? It's that stupid phrase she always uses - 'We'll get through this together.' Like, no, we won't. We're already there. I'm already gone.\"<|eot_id|>",

I mean, yeah, I might have to wear reading glasses now, but who needs to see clearly when you've got a better memory than them? Plus, I've got the best gaming chair in the world – it's literally an office chair from the 80s that my son found at a thrift store. It's perfect. I can recline, adjust the armrests, and—\" Wait, what was I saying? Oh right. I guess I need to get back to my job. But honestly, it feels like my wife is sucking the joy out of everything. Even when we go out, she's always talking about her stupid book club, and I'm just along for the ride. I swear, every time I try to bring up anything interesting, she just starts rambling about whatever stupid thing she's reading. And don't even get me started on the holidays. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween... it's all the same. They want me to do stuff with the grandkids, but I'd rather die. I mean, I love my wife, but sometimes I wish I could just disappear.
