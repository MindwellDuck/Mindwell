You've been having a tough week, and the last thing he needs is to add to your stress. But why does he call you? Maybe he doesn't even want to fix the fence; maybe he’s looking for some company, someone who can listen and offer support. You seem so focused on finding a solution to the technical issue, but deep down, there must be an underlying fear that you’re not ready to face. Your mind keeps drifting back to your daughter’s words, wondering if she might be thinking about you too. Is she worried about leaving you behind? Your reaction feels forced, like you’re trying to keep everything under control. But what if you let go of the need to solve every problem all by yourself? What if you acknowledged that sometimes things are beyond your control, and that it’s okay to ask for help? Take a step back and breathe. Let yourself feel the emotions swirling inside. Maybe this isn’t just about fixing fences, but about opening up to someone who truly cares. Sometimes, the hardest part is admitting we don’t have all the answers.
