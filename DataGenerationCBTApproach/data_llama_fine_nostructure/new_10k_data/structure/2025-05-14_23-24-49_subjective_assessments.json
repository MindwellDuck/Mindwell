A particularly high electricity bill caught her eye – nearly $300 more than usual, due to one of the old HVAC units finally failing. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she thought about the conversation she'd had with the insurance company earlier that week, implying they wouldn't cover any upgrades until the policy renewal next month. The added expenses, coupled with the slow pace of recovery, made her wonder if anyone was even listening to her pleas for help.<|eot_id|>",

I’ve already asked them once, and all I got was “we’ll review it.” Review what? Are you kidding me? This is ridiculous. I swear, everyone around here thinks they own the place. They don’t care about us, they just want our money. I hate this, I hate this, I hate this... why did he leave me like this? Why didn’t he take care of things before he died?

The doctor's hands trembled slightly as he tried to reconcile the discrepancy in the orders from the ER.\n\nThe nurse beside him raised an eyebrow, concern etched on her face. 'Doctor, do you need some help?' she asked, but before he could respond, the hospital's intercom system crackled to life – 'Code Blue, Ward 3.'

She scanned the page quickly, her eyes widening in anger. The nurse took a step back, sensing her irritation.\n\nSuddenly, the phone on the nurse's station rang, shrill in the quiet morning air.

They probably didn’t know about the issues with their loved one’s medications. Her colleagues must have been too scared to speak up.

So what? It was all part of her job. She was always under fire, never able to succeed. She would just have to take it, because her patients’ lives depended on her. Besides, she was doing the best she could, given the challenges she faced. Still, people often misunderstood her. They thought she was mean and unapproachable, which made things worse when she tried to help them. But deep down, she knew she was a good doctor. She just needed to prove it to everyone else."
