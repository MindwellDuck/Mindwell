The classroom fell silent, and all eyes were on her. \n\nIn that moment, the teacher felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach – it was the same feeling she got whenever she tried to connect with someone who didn't seem interested, or when she felt like she was failing as a teacher. She pushed the sensation aside, trying to focus on the lesson ahead, but the unease lingered, making her hands tremble slightly as she wrote on the blackboard.<|eot_id|>",

It’s like she doesn’t care about anything anymore. I can’t trust her to help us finish our presentation; if I rely on her, we’ll fail because she won’t put in any effort. In fact, I’m surprised she hasn’t stopped coming to class altogether. Maybe she thinks I don’t need her anymore now that she has her boyfriend.
