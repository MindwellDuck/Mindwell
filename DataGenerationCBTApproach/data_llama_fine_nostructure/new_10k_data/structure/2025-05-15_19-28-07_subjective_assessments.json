He thought about all the times he'd tried to make things work, only to be met with resistance. The endless meetings where \"solutions\" were presented as if they came straight from a textbook – solutions that ignored the very human side of teaching. Solutions that didn't care that his classroom might look different when the dust settled. Solutions that forgot that the most effective lessons weren't found on pages 234-235, but in the eyes of his students, in the laughter they shared during recess, in the late-night conversations they had around dinner tables.
