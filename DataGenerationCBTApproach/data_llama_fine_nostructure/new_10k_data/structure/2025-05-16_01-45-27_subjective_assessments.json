A plaque caught her eye - Dr. Rachel Kim, renowned researcher in environmental science, had passed away six months ago. The woman who had mentored her during graduate school, whose unwavering support had paved the way for her own groundbreaking research.\n\nAs she read through the list of Dr. Kim's achievements, a wave of sorrow washed over her. She remembered the countless hours spent in Dr. Kim's office, pouring over data and discussing potential breakthroughs. The memories were bittersweet, a mix of admiration and longing.\n\nA faint scent of old books wafted from the nearby library, transporting her back to late-night study sessions with Dr. Kim. Her eyes lingered on the photograph of Dr. Kim with her colleagues, taken at a prestigious conference. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized how much she would miss sharing her own discoveries with someone who had believed in her work.<|eot_id|>",

A group photo of them at a beachside bar, arms around each other as they laughed together. He noticed she had captioned it'so grateful to have found my summer love'. His eyes lingered on the image, taking in every detail – the way her hair fell in loose waves down her back, the way he smiled effortlessly at her side. The text messages that followed his gaze caught his attention too - playful teasing about surfing lessons and sunset views. He felt a familiar knot in his stomach as he hastily deleted the app and focused on his work, but the image stayed with him long after he'd closed the tab.<|eot_id|>",

She had shared a photo of herself and her husband enjoying a romantic getaway to Hawaii. They were sitting on the balcony of their hotel room, holding hands and smiling into the camera. Her caption read, \"Just relaxing with my favorite guy.\" She had also commented on another post saying, \"Love watching you catch those waves!\" He couldn't help but feel jealous. He had been feeling insecure lately, and seeing her happiness only made things worse. His mind started racing with what-ifs. What if I wasn’t so boring and uninteresting? What if I could be more adventurous and spontaneous? What if I weren’t stuck in a dead-end job? What if I had more confidence and charisma? He thought about all these possibilities, wondering if there was even a chance for him to change. He imagined himself as someone else—someone who had his wife by his side, not just admiringly from afar. He pictured himself making friends easily, having fun at parties, and being able to talk to anyone. He wanted to know how it would feel to be one of those guys who always had a girlfriend or two. He kept thinking about all these scenarios, imagining different versions of himself."

I don’t want to think about it, but I can’t stop thinking about it. Sometimes, I wish we could go back to the way things used to be, but deep down, I know that’s never going to happen.

His wife had started taking art classes again, and he'd begun working more freelance projects. They'd grown apart, ever so slightly.
