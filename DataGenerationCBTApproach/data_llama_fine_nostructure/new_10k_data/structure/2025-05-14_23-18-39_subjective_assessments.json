The principal had no idea what it took to prepare for this class, no idea how much time and effort went into making sure these students learned something worthwhile.\n\nThe way she breezed in, like she owned the place, only made matters worse. He felt his face growing hot with anger, his mind racing with thoughts of all the times she'd undermined his authority, all the times she'd ignored his concerns.\n\nAnd now, as he was forced to pack up and move to some other, less important space, he realized he was going to be late for the parent-teacher conference. The one where they were supposed to discuss his own son's progress.<|eot_id|>",

But then I started thinking, “Why did you agree to meet? You must be busy.” And before I knew it, I was feeling guilty again, like I was imposing on them. It doesn’t seem right that I’m feeling this way, especially since they said they wanted to catch up. Yet, I still feel like there’s something wrong with me for enjoying our time together. When I look back at these moments, I realize that I keep telling myself I don’t deserve good times or happiness. Maybe it’s because I’ve heard people say negative things about being happy – like how it can lead to problems or distract us from what really matters. Or maybe it’s just my brain playing tricks on me, making me think that I shouldn’t enjoy things when life gets tough. Either way, it feels like I’m stuck in this cycle where every good experience makes me feel worse about myself. I guess it’s hard to break free from these thoughts when they’re so deeply ingrained.
