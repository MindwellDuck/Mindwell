It had been three months since his wife passed away, and the weight of managing their modest household alone was starting to take its toll.\n\nAs he sorted through the envelopes, one letter caught his attention - a notice from the utility company stating they would be shutting off the power if he didn't pay the outstanding balance within seven days. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he thought about how this could affect his wife's favorite armchair, which still sat in the living room, waiting for her return.\n\nWith shaking hands, he began to calculate the amount needed to cover the debt, but the numbers seemed to blur together as tears pricked at the corners of his eyes. His mind wandered back to the countless conversations he'd had with his wife about budgeting and saving for their golden years, and how she always reassured him that everything would be okay.\n\nThe reality now seemed so far from okay, and the silence of their home felt oppressive, like a constant reminder of what he was losing – not just his wife, but also the life they built together.<|eot_id|>",
