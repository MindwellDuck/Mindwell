A stack of old patient files lay scattered across his desk, holding memories he'd rather forget. A phone call from his ex-wife had come unexpectedly, requesting a meeting to discuss their children's upcoming birthdays. He hadn't seen them in months.\n\nAs he delved into the files, a specific case caught his eye – a young man who'd been diagnosed with a terminal illness a decade ago. The doctor had told him it was unlikely he'd live more than five years, but somehow, the boy had defied those odds. Now, the boy was getting married, starting a family of his own.\n\nThe realization hit him like a punch to the gut: his son, now grown and independent, was about to start a life of his own. It was hard to accept that time was moving forward, leaving him behind. His mind began to wander back to all the moments he'd missed, all the milestones he'd never gotten to experience as a father. The weight of regret settled in, making it hard to breathe.<|eot_id|>",

He remembered the smell of smoke, the sound of sirens, the faces of those who'd lost everything. His eyes narrowed as he thought about how little had changed – the same factories still stood, spewing pollution into the air.\n\nThe reporter asked if he was available to write a piece, to shed light on the tragedy once more.

It had been two years since his passing, but the ache still lingered. A gentle breeze from the air conditioning unit rustled the papers on her desk, causing the photo to shift ever so slightly, and for a moment, she was transported back to that day – the laughter, the love, the sense of forever.\n\nThe officer cleared his throat, snapping her back to attention. \"Ma'am, can I get your input on the Smith case?\" His voice was laced with uncertainty, and she felt a surge of anxiety wash over her.

It marked a turning point in her career, one that would set the stage for her future success. Her gaze drifted toward the photograph on her desk, a reminder of the milestones she'd already achieved. Her husband had passed away just as she was starting to build her own practice. She remembered how proud he was of her accomplishments, how he encouraged her to pursue her goals even when they seemed impossible. The memory sent a warmth through her chest, and for a brief moment, she forgot about the officer's request. Instead, she felt a deep connection to the woman who had taught her everything she knew. But then, something shifted inside her. A sudden realization hit, and her entire perspective changed. She realized that the officer wasn't asking because he genuinely sought her expertise. No, there must be more to it than that. There had to be some personal reason behind his query. Perhaps he was seeking validation—something she could offer him as a mentor or a friend. Maybe he was trying to fill a void left by his own loss—a void that only she could understand. In that moment, she made a decision. She would no longer focus solely on"

She loved that mug almost as much as she loved me, and he knew it. Yet, here he was, holding it like it belonged to him. How dare he act like it was no big deal?! And then there was that perfume. Not just any perfume—it was her favorite, one we shared every morning. He probably smelled it on himself after touching her body one last time, but he didn’t care. He never cared. That’s why he looked so smug, like he was enjoying every second of my misery. He was rubbing it in, making sure I knew exactly what I’d missed out on.
