The curator's note was polite but firm – their current focus was on emerging artists in other cities. As he crumpled the paper, his eyes drifted to the half-finished painting in the corner of the room, a vibrant depiction of city life that felt stuck.\n\nThe memory of his mother's words echoed in his mind: \"Success never comes easily, kiddo. You'll have to fight for it.\" He recalled the countless hours she spent encouraging him to pursue art, only to be met with disappointment and financial struggles.\n\nHis gaze snapped back to the letter as he wondered if he'd wasted years chasing a dream that wasn't meant to be. The frustration simmered beneath the surface, threatening to boil over as he thought about the mounting bills and dwindling savings. The silence of his studio seemed oppressive, a constant reminder of the uncertainty ahead.<|eot_id|>",

It didn’t help that the artist he’d been comparing himself to had just sold two pieces within the same week. “How can I compete when they’re making bank off their work?” he muttered under his breath. He glanced around the cluttered space, taking in the half-finished canvases and scattered sketches. His eyes landed on a particularly promising piece, but even its potential seemed tainted by the rejection. The doubts swirled, like a storm brewing outside. The voice in his head grew louder, laced with desperation. “What’s the point? Maybe you’re just not good enough.” It cut deep, echoing the criticism he'd faced since graduation. He thought about how his friends were already established, building successful careers while he struggled to make ends meet. The weight of those comparisons crushed him, like an invisible hand squeezing tight. Panic set in, making every breath feel labored. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was running out of time – that each passing day brought him closer to failure. The future stretched before him like a dark, endless road, and he couldn’t see any exit signs."

His partner had been admiring it from across the room, but today she was gone, having left him the day before for another city, chasing her own art career.\n\nAs he approached the canvas, his eyes landed on the half-finished portrait of their golden retriever, Max. He had been working on it during their last week together, trying to capture its spirit as it ran through the woods near their home. Now, the painting seemed incomplete, like a part of him was missing.\n\nHe picked up a brush, dipped it in paint, and began to work on the dog's tail, the strokes slow and labored. The colors blended together, swirling into a mess that reminded him of his scattered thoughts. He felt a lump form in his throat as he thought about all the memories they would no longer make together – the walks, the trips, the laughter around the dinner table.<|eot_id|>",

This constant mental chatter has become so ingrained that he can't seem to stop it, even when he tries. Every time someone smiles at him, he immediately assumes it's because they feel sorry for him. If a coworker asks how his day is going, he wonders if they've noticed something about him that makes them sympathetic. Even seemingly harmless gestures like a compliment or a kind word are interpreted as signs of pity or judgment. This pattern of thinking has made him withdrawn and isolated. People avoid talking to him, and those who do interact with him often look uncomfortable. But he can't help but keep analyzing their behavior, convinced that they're all just waiting for an opportunity to point out some flaw in him. It feels like no matter what he does, nothing will ever be enough, and that everyone sees him as flawed beyond repair. His own thoughts have become his worst enemy, constantly fueling anxiety and self-doubt. He can't shake the feeling that he's somehow broken, that everything people say about him is true.

I know I make mistakes, but I try really hard to correct them, yet no one ever says anything positive about my progress. It’s like they only notice when I mess up.
