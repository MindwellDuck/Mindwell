Maybe I'm just too jaded now, but it always feels like there’s something more beneath the surface. And honestly, it makes me question whether anyone really cares about me anymore. It’s almost like they’re just being polite, you know? Like they don’t actually want to be around me. I mean, why would they? I’m just another faceless loner wandering into their lives. It’s hard not to think that way, especially after the way things ended with my ex. I’ve been trying to move on, but sometimes I get stuck thinking that everyone’s just playing along. Maybe I’m just too tired to see reality anymore. Anyway, yeah, I guess I need to work on accepting things as they are. But it’s tough when it feels like everyone else has it together except me."
