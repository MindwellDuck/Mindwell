I wish they would appreciate it more, but they’re just too selfish. My sister always has to have the last word, and my brother doesn’t listen to anyone except himself. It feels like they can’t handle responsibility, making things harder for everyone else. I feel so alone in this situation; no one really cares about our well-being anymore.

His wife had always handled this sort of thing, and now it was up to him to get everything sorted out.\n\nAs he began to dial numbers and make calls, his mind started to wander to all the little things he used to take for granted – having someone to share the load, being able to relax after a long day without worrying about bills piling up.

Every time I try to talk to him about how much work I am doing to keep our household running smoothly, he just laughs and tells me I need to lighten up. Like, seriously, how can he be so oblivious?

I remember how she told me she was \"just taking a break\" when I asked if she still loved me. That was months ago, and yet here I am, wondering what happened to our relationship. Maybe she just needs space, but deep down, I know she's gone forever. It's strange how she started acting so differently after we got married. She seemed more distant than usual, even though we were spending more time together. At first, I brushed it off as stress from work, but then I realized she wasn't saying anything important during those conversations. It was as if she was hiding something, but whenever I brought it up, she just changed the subject. Now that I'm divorced, I can see how she might be using her silence to avoid confrontation. But why would she want to keep me around? Did she think I wouldn't notice? I'm starting to feel like I imagined the whole thing. Maybe she never meant to hurt me, and I'm just being paranoid.

She recalled Rachel's words, 'Why do you need so many new things?' and felt a pang of regret.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into a bright blue paint, she noticed the label still attached to the tube – a brand Rachel preferred.

A part of her wanted to rip out the offending tube, to erase the evidence of what she saw as deception. But even that gesture felt hollow, a desperate attempt to regain control over something slipping from her grasp. As she turned away from the canvas, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, the lines around her eyes deepening, a reflection of the turmoil brewing inside. She couldn’t help but wonder if she was reading too much into Rachel’s words, if the argument was really about more than just art supplies. But then there were the times when Rachel would join her, laughing as they mixed colors together, creating something new from their combined efforts. And yet, those moments seemed fleeting, overshadowed by the nagging fear that Rachel was holding back. That she didn’t see her art the way she did – didn’t understand why each layer mattered, why every decision felt like a step toward something greater. Or maybe it wasn’t about understanding; maybe it was about acceptance – but could she accept anything less than perfection? Rachel walked into the room"
