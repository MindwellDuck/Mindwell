The young resident beamed with pride, her eyes sparkling with a sense of validation. He felt a pang of inadequacy, his mind flashing back to when he'd been in her shoes, eager to prove himself.\n\nAs he turned to continue down the ward, he accidentally knocked over a nearby trash can, spilling its contents onto the floor. The sound echoed through the corridor, and the room fell silent. The new residents' faces flickered with surprise, before their expressions softened into sympathetic smiles. His colleague rushed over to help him clean up the mess, but it was too late – the damage was done. The memory of his earlier humiliation lingered, a bitter taste in his mouth.<|eot_id|>",

That accident is just proof of everything I’ve always known about him. He’s just not cut out for this job. He’s going to make mistakes, and we all know why. Because he’s just not smart enough.

But what was the point? He'd poured his heart into every painting, every sculpture, and yet no one seemed to truly see it. The doubts crept in like a slow-moving fog, seeping into every pore and corroding his confidence.\n\nAs he rinsed the plate, the water swirled around him, a miniature echo of the turmoil churning within. His mind began to wander to all the rejections, the unfulfilled commissions, and the endless hours spent waiting for someone, anyone, to notice his work.

That she's concerned about your well-being? **That's not a red flag!** Your sister cares about you, which means she wants to see you happy again. Why would she be asking invasive questions? It's easy to get caught up in negative thoughts, especially after a breakup. But don't let those thoughts control you.
