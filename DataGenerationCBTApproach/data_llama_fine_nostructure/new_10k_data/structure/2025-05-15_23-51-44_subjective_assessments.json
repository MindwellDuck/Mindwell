She'd cooked this exact marinara sauce for Sunday dinner, and he'd complained about the taste being too bland. She'd stormed off to the store, returning with a new jar, but by then, the damage was done.\n\nThe smell of the marinara wafted through the air, transporting him back to that moment.

It was his fault that the flavor wasn’t right; if only he had been more attentive during dinner, he wouldn’t have complained so much. The marinara was actually pretty good, and he knew it because he’d tasted it himself. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that things would’ve worked out differently if he’d just kept quiet and let her cook. He didn’t seem to realize how his behavior reflected poorly on him. If only he could go back in time and apologize for his part in ending their relationship, everything would be different today. Instead, he sat alone, stewing in resentment, blaming his ex-wife for leaving. She must’ve hated him, he thought bitterly, and now he was all alone, stuck with nothing but bitter memories and an empty fridge. This was clearly her fault, though. If she hadn’t stormed off to the store, she wouldn’t have left him with a bunch of uncooked pasta. Now he was forced to eat plain noodles every day, which made him feel even more resentful toward her. Why did she leave? Hadn’t she realized that she needed him? Didn’t she understand that he was struggling to make ends meet? It was all her fault, really. She shouldn’t have gotten upset when he complained about the taste, and she definitely shouldn’t have packed her bags. If she’d just listened to him and tried harder"

I keep thinking about what could've been if she were here today. We would've celebrated our anniversary, maybe even started planning for the future together. Now it's nothing but memories, and those memories are all I have left. fuck that bitch. It's like everyone is trying to tell me something by showing me these happy moments, but I refuse to listen. If I let myself feel anything else, I'll start questioning whether she really loved me. And that's when the pain hits me hard again. No, I don't want to think about that. I don't want to hear the whispers of doubt. I just want to forget. Forget everything. Forget her. Forgive myself. Forgive everyone. Forgive life. Forgive death. Forgive everything. Fuck that bitch.
