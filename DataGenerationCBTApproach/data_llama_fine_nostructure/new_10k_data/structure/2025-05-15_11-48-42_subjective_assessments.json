But even those happy memories were tinged with sadness now. As I think about how much she misses her kids, I can see why it would be hard to live alone again. Maybe she just needs someone to talk things over with. A friend, maybe? Or someone who could listen without judgment? But sometimes, you just need a little reassurance that everything will be okay.

Her mind began to wander through all the rejections she'd faced over the years, each one a tiny notch in the armor she'd built around her insecurities.

If Sarah tries out for a play and doesn’t make the cut, my mom is already telling her it’s because she’s not talented enough (even though we know she has some acting skills).
