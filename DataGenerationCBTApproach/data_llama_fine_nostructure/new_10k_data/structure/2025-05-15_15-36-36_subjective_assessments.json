My stomach did its usual somersaults as I clocked in, but what really got my blood boiling was seeing Emily, the new nurse, fawn all over Dr. Smith.\n\nThat smug, self-satisfied asshole had been assigned to my shift today, just to rub it in my face. Like I didn't have enough to deal with – the endless paperwork, the screaming patients, the fact that I was still single and alone at 20. \n\nAs if on cue, my phone buzzed with a text from my mom. 'Hey sweetie, how's your first day back going?' Oh, you know, just peachy. My heart sank, and I felt the familiar sting of tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. Why did she still do this? Why did she keep bringing up the past?\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself I was being ridiculous. But as I began my rounds, I couldn't help but notice the way Emily and Dr. Smith laughed together, their chemistry palpable. It was like they'd known each other forever, while I was still stuck in limbo, reliving the memories of my ex.\n\nI slammed down a chart on the bed, making the patient jump. \"Sorry,\" I muttered, my voice barely above a whisper. \"Just having a crappy day.\" The look on her face told me she knew exactly what was wrong. We both were.\n\n\"Can I get you something?\" she asked softly, as if sensing my distress.\n\nSomething about her gentle tone made me crack. \"GET ME OUT OF HERE!\" I bellowed, slamming my fist on the wall.

And what did I get in return? A never-ending stream of criticism, each comment laced with condescension and a healthy dose of disdain.\n\nBut it wasn't just the parents I was annoyed with; it was the entire system that had failed me, time and again.

He had spent years meticulously crafting his presentation, pouring over lines of code and meticulously refining every detail, all with the goal of showcasing his revolutionary new algorithm to the world.\n\nNow, as he gazed out upon the sea of expectant faces, he was met with a collective shrug. The room fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioning units above. It was then that he noticed the banner draped across the stage, emblazoned with the words \"AI Solutions for Business\" - a phrase that seemed to mock him now.\n\nHe thought back to the countless hours he had devoted to perfecting his work, the sleepless nights and endless cups of coffee, all in the hopes of making a meaningful contribution to the field. And yet, it seemed that no one cared. His innovative solution was deemed \"too niche,\" his expertise \"not applicable\" - the same tired phrases he had heard time and again from his peers.\n\nA sense of desperation began to claw at his insides as he scanned the crowd, searching for some sign of validation, some glimmer of understanding. But there was none. The faces before him were all strangers, their expressions a mask of polite indifference.\n\nIn a flash, the carefully constructed façade of his confidence crumbled, leaving him feeling exposed and vulnerable. He felt like a child who had been told his drawing wasn't good enough, his creation rejected by those who were supposed to appreciate its value. The sting of disappointment threatened to consume him whole.\n\nWith a heavy heart, he turned and walked away from the convention center, leaving behind the shattered remains of his dreams.<|eot_id|>",

They’re just going through the motions because they have to, not because they actually want to learn anything from what you have to say. I mean, come on, it’s not like this is the first time someone has tried to sell us on something that’s basically a rehashing of everything we already know. You think everyone here is just sitting around waiting for you to show up so they can be impressed by your “innovative solution”? Please. This isn’t even the most original idea I’ve ever heard, and you really think people are going to get excited about it? And honestly, why would they? Your entire pitch sounds like a bunch of jargon-filled nonsense that doesn’t say anything new. It’s just more of the same old thing, with a few buzzwords thrown in to make it seem important. Newsflash, pal: just because you throw around terms like “artificial intelligence” and “machine learning” doesn’t mean you actually understand what they mean. So go ahead, keep spouting off about how your program is going to change the game, but nobody cares. You might as well be talking about the weather. It’s not like anyone is actually listening. You know what? I’m not surprised you’re getting shut down. It takes a special kind of idiot to think they can just waltz into a room full of experts and convince them that"
