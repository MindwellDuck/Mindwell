The morning light streaming through the window highlighted the crumpled up receipt from the funeral home – it had been six months since her husband passed away. A careless comment from her colleague about having a 'great weekend' made her feel like she was failing as a single mother to their young daughter.\n\nAs she tried to focus on the experiment in front of her, her mind wandered back to the argument she'd had with her ex-mother-in-law the day before. It wasn't the first time they'd clashed over custody arrangements, but today it felt different – a raw, unspoken anger simmered beneath the surface.\n\nHer hand trembled slightly as she reached for a pipette, and she knocked over the container of enzymes, spilling them onto the counter. The hiss of escaping gas filled the air, making her jump. She glared at the mess, feeling a familiar, suffocating sense of frustration wash over her.<|eot_id|>",

He clearly has better things to do than eat food. And honestly, I don’t even care if we lose power this weekend. Who needs electricity anyway? My kids are old enough to handle themselves, right? They’ll figure something out. If not, well... fuck it. We'll just go outside and play some baseball. That’s what families do, right? But seriously, did you hear that the lab is cutting funding again? I heard rumors that we might lose half our staff due to budget cuts. What the actual fuck does the university think it's doing by keeping those costs so high? Doesn’t it know that most of us are barely scraping by? And now they’re considering laying off half of us? Well, I guess they should have thought of that before they decided to raise tuition fees last year. Now they want us to pay more for classes while they cut essential services? How about they try actually supporting their employees instead of sucking every penny they can get out of us? Anyway, back to my fucked-up weekend. I didn’t even bother cleaning"

They were always there, having fun, while I was stuck inside dealing with problems. It wasn’t fair. Everyone deserved to be treated well, especially those who seemed so much better than me. They deserved better than me, and yet here I was, feeling worse with each passing day. It was unfair, and I couldn’t take it anymore. This was getting out of hand. No one ever saw me struggling; no one ever knew what I went through every day. But now, I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I needed to stand up for myself, to let everyone know how hard things were really getting. Maybe then they’d understand why I couldn’t keep going on like this. Maybe if they saw how real it was, they’d stop pretending everything was fine. No more hiding behind smiles and false camaraderie. It was time to show them the truth.

No, instead he just chimes in with some asshole comment about how he used to be homeless. Oh, wow, what a unique perspective. You really are the king of the world, aren't you?

It was just easier to blame someone else for her frustration than to deal with her own stress. Maybe it was because Rachel seemed to be enjoying every moment of the conversation, even though Sarah didn't want to hear it. Or maybe it was because Sarah had been feeling like an outsider at work lately, especially since Rachel got promoted to shift leader. Whatever the reason, Rachel's comment made Sarah feel like she was losing control, like she was letting her emotions get the better of her. But she knew it was all in her head – Rachel was probably just having fun, and it wasn't personal. Still, Sarah couldn't shake off the feeling that she was overreacting, that there must be something more going on beneath the surface.

And he knew better than to try and find common ground when she refused to listen to anything other than her own twisted narrative. So he just sat there, silently seething as she continued to rant, knowing full well that she’d never let up until she got what she wanted.
