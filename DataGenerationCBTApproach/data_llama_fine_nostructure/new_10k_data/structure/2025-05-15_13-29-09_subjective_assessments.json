As she opens it, a mix of dust motes dances in the morning light streaming through the window.\n\nThe words on the page confirm what she'd suspected – he's sold their life's work, including the piece they worked on together during their marriage, at an auction house next week. The memory of his words, 'you're no longer my partner,' echoes in her mind as she reads about the substantial sum he's received.\n\nShe feels a lump form in her throat as she sets the letter down, her eyes drifting towards the blank canvas before her.

I mean, who wouldn't want to sell off their entire collection for a tidy profit? I've always been stuck in the basement of my own apartment, painting like nobody gives a fuck. Meanwhile, some rich bitch gets to flaunt her masterpiece at a fancy auction house while I'm over here trying to make ends meet as a freelance artist. She's probably having the time of her life, sipping champagne with friends, talking about how amazing her husband is, while I'm just sitting here wondering if anyone would even notice if I disappeared. I bet she doesn't have to deal with the anxiety of being broke all the time. No wonder she got out of that toxic relationship - she must be enjoying every minute of freedom from me! It's hard not to feel bitter when you see people living their best lives while you're struggling to keep up. Maybe I'll just stick to drawing portraits of cats instead of trying to make it big as a painter. After all, why bother trying when someone else can do it better than me? This whole situation just makes me realize how much of a loser I am. Who needs a fulfilling career when you could have a fat bank account and a loving spouse? I'm pretty sure everyone else thinks I'm crazy for choosing this path, especially after seeing that couple walking hand-in-hand on the street yesterday. They look like they're actually happy,"

She was the one who’d always struggled to create something meaningful, yet she still managed to hold onto hope. Even when confronted with reality, she couldn’t help but cling to the idea that she was more than just an underwhelming presence in the art world. It seemed like every time someone offered constructive criticism, she took it as a personal attack rather than genuine feedback aimed at improving her craft. Her ego had become so entangled with her work that she found it difficult to accept even the slightest hint of criticism. She would often deflect it by shifting the focus to others, claiming they were the ones holding her back or telling her she wasn’t good enough. This behavior became a pattern in their relationship, and eventually, it destroyed everything they once built together. It didn't seem like she understood the true meaning behind the young artist's nervousness.

It was as if the world around her had grown quieter, almost... waiting. At first, it wasn't so bad. I told myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But every step I took, every breath I made, seemed to amplify the tension. My legs felt stiff, my palms sweaty, and my chest tight. I kept thinking, \"What if someone sees how scared I am?\" That thought alone made things worse. I tried to convince myself that it was just anxiety, that deep down I knew it was nothing to worry about. But the fear lingered, echoing in my mind like a haunting melody. Every creak of the trees, every chirp of the birds, seemed to send shivers down my spine. I was convinced that somehow, I could hear the sound of footsteps coming from behind me, watching me. And when I turned around, there was never anyone there. It wasn't until I got home that I realized what was really bothering me. Not the darkness or the stillness, but the way I'd been telling myself to feel. Maybe I'd always been like this, always on edge, always waiting for something to go wrong. Or maybe this"
