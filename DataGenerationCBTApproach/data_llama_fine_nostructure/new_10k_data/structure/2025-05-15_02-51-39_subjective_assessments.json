It was a moment that stuck with her, even after leaving the lab years ago. Dr. Lee had ridiculed one of her peers, calling him incompetent and saying he would never make it in the field. His harsh words had cut deep, and she'd often wondered if Dr. Lee had ever seen her potential. But then, there was John. He didn't have Dr. Lee's reputation, and yet, he seemed to be going through the same cycle of self-doubt. She couldn't help but feel that every small setback was somehow his fault, every mistake a sign of his incompetence. Even when John excelled in his work, she found herself thinking, \"He always does this,\" or worse, \"He never gets it right.\" Today was no exception. John had gone to get lunch, and she was alone in the lab, staring at the petri dishes. Suddenly, the smell of disinfectant transported her back to those dark days, and she felt the familiar surge of anger. \"Why can't I ever change?\" she thought, her voice rising in frustration. \"Why are things always so hard for me? Why can't anyone see my potential?\""
