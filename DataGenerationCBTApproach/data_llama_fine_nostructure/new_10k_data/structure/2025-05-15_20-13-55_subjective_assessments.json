He chuckled to himself, remembering how much he hated cats when he was younger. But now, he couldn't help but feel nostalgic for those carefree days. Maybe he could even look into getting a pet again someday… just not a cat. Instead, he thought about all the fun times he’d had with friends, laughing together at comedy shows or playing board games late into the night. Those were some of his favorite memories. However, what really stuck out was the mention of his sister’s comment about his career. She said something like, “You know, I think you’re doing well. You’ve worked so hard.” And then there was another thing about my ex-girlfriend saying something nice about me too. It was probably true that he hadn’t been happy during that period. But maybe if things had turned out differently, he could have been happier. Maybe if he’d made different choices back then, he wouldn’t be feeling this way now. So why bother celebrating his birthday? Maybe he could celebrate his past instead? That would be way more meaningful than the present day anyway.

What if, despite all her precautions, the bacteria somehow broke free once more? \"It will never happen again,\" she declared, her voice firm. She had worked too hard, taken too many risks, to let her guard down now. Not when there were so many lives at stake.

No,\" she said firmly, her jaw clenched. \"This time, I won't make the same mistakes.\" She took a deep breath, her shoulders squaring as she turned to leave the lab. \"I'll do whatever it takes,\" she told herself, her voice steady. \"To protect everyone.\" ###"
