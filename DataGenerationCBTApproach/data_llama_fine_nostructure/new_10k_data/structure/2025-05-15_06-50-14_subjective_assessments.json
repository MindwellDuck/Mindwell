He felt a twinge of resentment towards her, and his mind started to wander back to all the times his girlfriend had been treated unfairly by others – the way people would talk down to her, or assume she didn't know something because of her age or appearance.<|eot_id|>",

Like, why does she get to act like she owns the place? And then when I look around, I see my girlfriend, and I start thinking about how we've had similar experiences. I mean, you'd think people would treat us better, especially since we're so much younger than most other customers. But no, they always seem to think we don’t know what we’re doing. It’s like they automatically assume we’re stupid, even if we are actually pretty smart. I’ve seen it happen before - someone will come up to us, or my girlfriend, and act like we can’t hear them, or like we’re not paying attention. And when we try to correct them or tell them they’re wrong, they’ll just get defensive and say we’re being rude. It’s frustrating, you know? But anyway, back to this woman in the store. She kept talking over the guy, saying things like \"You don't know anything\" and \"He's clearly an idiot.\" I'm already annoyed, but then I realize she's basically labeling herself as a victim. I mean, she's acting like the employee is somehow against her and that he's out to get her. It's kind of pathetic, honestly. I feel bad for him, but at the same time, I don't blame him for getting frustrated. I probably would have reacted"

He'd thought they were settled, but now he was worried about what might come up during the hearing. His hands trembled slightly as he diced the onions, the smell of garlic and ginger filling the air, momentarily overwhelming him.\n\nA customer shouted for their food, breaking the spell. But as the sous chef handed over the dishes, one of them was sent back due to a minor error. The chef's heart skipped a beat as he frantically re-plated it, his palms growing sweaty beneath the heat-resistant gloves.\n\nThe kitchen around him seemed to slow down, every second ticking by like hours. He could feel his pulse racing in his neck, and his breath came out in short gasps. Suddenly, the line cook called out for help, and the chef's attention snapped back to reality. For a moment, everything else faded away, leaving only the oppressive feeling of uncertainty.<|eot_id|>",

He used to be such a calm and collected guy, always handling pressure well, but now he just seems really tense all the time. For instance, yesterday we had a dinner service and he got so flustered when he forgot to put garnish on a dish that he ended up taking way too long to plate everything. I know he's been under a lot of stress lately, but it doesn't seem like he's really coping well. Sometimes I think he’s more upset about the trial than he lets himself admit. He keeps saying he’ll be fine, but it’s hard not to notice how anxious he is when he’s cooking. I’ve even seen him send texts while he’s working, which isn’t exactly ideal, especially since we have a lot of customers who want to interact with us.

They'd been divorced five years ago, but it still stung. She hadn't seen him in years, yet his name still managed to make her heart sink.\n\nJust then, her phone rang. It was dispatch.
