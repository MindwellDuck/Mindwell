She was saying something funny, and he couldn't help but feel like she was trying to impress him. But it wasn't just that. It was the way she looked at him in the background - a fleeting glance, but enough to make his skin crawl.\n\nHe thought about all the times she'd said she was busy when he called, all the times she'd claimed she needed space. And now here she was, having the time of her life with someone else.\n\nHe threw off the covers and got out of bed, his eyes fixed on the screen. He didn't care who it was or what they were doing. He just knew he had to know more.\n\nAs he walked to the kitchen, he caught a glimpse of himself in the window reflection. His eyes were dark, his jaw clenched. He looked like a man on the verge of losing control.\n\nHe took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling. It was irrational, he told himself. They were just friends. But the image lingered, seared into his brain like a branding iron.\n\nHe opened his laptop and started typing, the words flowing out of him in a torrent of anger and hurt. He wrote about the ways she'd been lying to him, the ways she'd been playing him for a fool. As he wrote, the jealousy consumed him, eating away at his insides like acid.\n\nAnd still, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something. That there was more to this moment than met the eye.<|eot_id|>",
