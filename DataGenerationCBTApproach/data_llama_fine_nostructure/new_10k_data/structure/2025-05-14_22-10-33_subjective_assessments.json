Why would anyone want to know about my interests when they couldn’t share theirs? Then there was the time I tried to join in on a group project. She took away my participation because I wasn’t part of that specific team. What if I had been part of it? Would I have gotten the chance to contribute? Or would I still be ignored? In another incident, I accidentally knocked over a bookshelf while trying to carry heavy books back to my desk. Instead of helping me, Mrs. Johnson just stood there, judging me. When I finally got the books down, she scolded me for being careless. But what if I hadn’t tripped? Would I have been praised for my strength instead? At school, we’re always told to respect our teachers, but they don’t respect us. They think they can talk down to us, treating us like children. It’s like they forget we’re people too. That day, Mrs. Johnson acted like a child herself, acting out because she couldn’t control her emotions. If only she could control those feelings, maybe she wouldn’t have reacted so harshly. But what if she lost control again? Would she lash out at us this time? When I tried to help Mrs. Johnson with a task, she dismissed my offer. I thought it"

His wife had passed away three years ago, but some days still felt like yesterday. The memories, the routines – everything was different now.\n\nHis phone buzzed on the counter, breaking the silence. He hesitated before answering, knowing it would be another call from the department about a case gone wrong. Again. He took a deep breath and answered, his voice detached as he listened to the officer on the other end.\n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mix of excuses and half-truths. He couldn't remember the exact timeline, but he knew he'd been late, again. And again. The officer's tone remained calm, but the words cut deep.\n\nHe hung up, the phone slipping from his fingers as he slumped against the counter. Water dripped onto the floor, a steady beat that echoed the pounding in his chest. He stared at his reflection in the mirror, eyes that seemed foreign, eyes that didn't belong to him.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot he wasn't alone. He saw his wife standing behind him, her gentle smile and quiet reassurance washing over him like a wave. But when he turned around, she was gone, leaving only the echoes of his own failure.<|eot_id|>",

You're not just making excuses; you're missing the bigger picture. Your lack of responsibility isn't just about being late; it’s about putting yourself and others at risk. You can’t just blame the system for your mistakes. It feels like you’re avoiding accountability instead of facing the truth. Your memory isn’t helping either. You can’t just say “I don’t remember” every time. If you were running late, why didn’t you leave earlier? Why did you stop and pick up something on the way back? These questions aren’t just about getting out of trouble; they’re about understanding what really happened. Look, if you want to fix this, you need to take ownership. Don’t let your past mistakes define you anymore. We all make mistakes, but we learn from them. It’s time to take responsibility and figure out what went wrong. This isn’t just about being late; it’s about being safe. Can you tell me honestly what happened? Don’t just focus on the negative. Think about what you could have done differently. Are there steps you can take to prevent something like this"
