It was a typical Monday morning, with the usual chatter of colleagues and clinking of cups filling the air. But her mind wasn't on the upcoming briefing or the stack of paperwork waiting for her.\n\nHer gaze drifted back to the file folder in front of her – a case from three years ago, one she had worked tirelessly to solve but couldn't shake off. A young woman, barely twenty, who had been found dead in an alleyway, no leads, no suspects. The investigation had stalled, and the department had all but closed it.\n\nAs she flipped through the cold case files, a name caught her eye – Sarah Jenkins, the victim's name. She remembered the look on Sarah's mother's face during the press conference, the tears streaming down her cheeks as she begged for justice. Something about it sparked a familiar ache in her chest.\n\nShe felt a sudden urge to grab her keys and hit the road, to start driving down those alleys again, to see if anything had changed. But she knew better. She took a deep breath, letting her eyes wander back to the papers on her desk, trying to focus on the task at hand. Yet, the feeling lingered, like a shadow in the corner of her vision.<|eot_id|>",

Does she know something? I can’t let her get close to me; I need to keep my distance. I don’t want anyone else getting involved in my life. They’ll just try to manipulate me into doing what they want. No, I won’t let them. I have to protect myself. If I let her come closer, she’ll just try to take control of everything. Why does everyone always act so casually around each other? Doesn’t anyone feel anxious when they’re near someone they care about? I’m surprised she doesn’t seem more nervous. Maybe she’s okay with people being around her. I wouldn’t be okay with that. Everyone needs to respect boundaries. Even if she doesn’t realize it, she must be uncomfortable being so close to me. Maybe she feels threatened by how much I know about her. Or maybe she thinks she can handle it because she looks confident. I shouldn’t be worried about her feelings. This isn’t about her; it’s about me. I need to stay calm and focus on my own problems. This situation is too complicated. I shouldn’t even be thinking about her right now. I need to concentrate on my work. There are real problems to solve, not hypothetical scenarios. I don’t have time for these thoughts. I need to push them"

The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast long shadows across his face as he examined the slide under the lens.\n\nAs she approached, he looked up, catching her gaze. For a fleeting moment, their eyes locked, and she felt a sudden, unfamiliar tightness in her chest. His expression, usually calm and collected, seemed... distracted.\n\nA faint scent of coffee lingered on his shirt, but what caught her attention was the small notebook resting beside him, filled with scribbled notes and equations. She couldn't quite decipher the symbols, but something about them seemed out of place – like they belonged to someone else entirely.\n\nWithout breaking eye contact, he returned to examining the slide, his fingers moving deftly over the microscope's controls. A gentle hum filled the air as the machine whirred to life, casting a soft blue glow over the surrounding equipment.\n\nThe silence between them grew thicker, heavy with unspoken questions and unresolved tensions. She felt an itch she couldn't scratch, a creeping sense that she was no longer the only priority in this space – or perhaps even in his life.<|eot_id|>",

There were also these strange papers with equations and stuff on the desk, and it looked unlike anything he would write. When we finally talked, he just kept staring at the slide, and the machines around us started humming. It felt like time stopped, and now I can’t stop thinking about how much he’s changed. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but I still feel like something is off. We haven’t really spoken since, and every time I look at those papers, I wonder if things are okay between us."

As she sorted through them, her eyes landed on the one from the lab director at her university, who had once mentored her through a crucial project.\n\nThe email had been polite but firm, stating that her application didn't meet their funding criteria due to concerns about her 'independent thinking.' A familiar burn began to rise in her chest as she recalled his words. She had always prided herself on being bold and innovative, yet now those traits seemed like liabilities.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the calendar on her wall, where a reminder sticker read 'Lab Meeting - Friday.' The same meeting where her colleague, Rachel, would be presenting their joint research project, which she had spent countless hours working on alongside Rachel. A pang of resentment twisted in her stomach as she wondered if Rachel's success was somehow tied to her own lack of funding.\n\nAs she pushed her chair back, the papers rustled beneath her fingers, releasing a faint whisper of disappointment.<|eot_id|>",

He had just walked out of the room, leaving her feeling angry and hurt. She thought about how he never did what she asked him to do, how he always left things until the last minute and then expected her to clean up after him. She felt frustrated that he wouldn’t take responsibility for anything. She couldn’t understand why he wasn’t willing to listen to her, why he didn’t care about what she wanted. It all seemed so unfair. She knew she deserved better than someone like him. Why did he have to make her feel this way? It wasn’t fair. She could see it clearly now – he was holding her back, making her feel stupid. She couldn’t believe she’d let him get away with it for so long. How could she have been such an idiot? She glanced around the office, noticing the other people working quietly. They were probably doing much better than her, getting along with everyone else. Maybe they even had relationships outside of work. She felt jealous, wondering if they had partners waiting for them at home. If only she had someone like that...

Something inside her snapped. She felt her vision narrow, her hands trembling as she slammed a knife down onto the counter, making everyone jump. For a moment, time froze, and all she could see was the man who'd once shared her kitchen, her life. The words spilled out of her like venom: \"You have no idea what it means to lose someone you love.\"\n\nThe room fell silent, patrons exchanging uneasy glances.

To wake up every morning, wondering why they're not there anymore.

It's like he doesn't care that I spent years perfecting my recipes, that I poured my heart into them, and now I'm stuck with this jerk who thinks cooking is just about throwing some spices together? But you know what really gets my blood boiling? When he talks about other chefs, implying they're incompetent because they don't follow his recipe exactly. You know what?

Whatever the reason, she couldn’t let herself be ignored. And then there was the way the student looked up at her, like he saw right through her. He knew what she was really thinking – that she hated him because he reminded her of her own failures.
