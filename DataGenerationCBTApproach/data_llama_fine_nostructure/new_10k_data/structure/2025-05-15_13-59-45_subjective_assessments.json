The woman was probably half her age, and what struck her most was the ease with which the younger doctor effortlessly charmed the waitress into giving them a free dessert.\n\nAs she paid for her sandwich, the younger doctor flashed a warm smile in her direction, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they were standing mere inches apart. For a fleeting moment, something inside her twisted with envy – who was this carefree stranger, living life without the weight of responsibility and regret?<|eot_id|>",

He stopped at the counter, his hand casually resting against hers before moving to order a whiskey on the rocks. His eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, time froze. She felt like she was drowning in those piercing blue depths, the kind of gaze that could melt steel. It wasn't just the look itself; it was the way it made her skin tingle, like static electricity had taken hold. Her mind began racing as he handed her the drink, his fingers brushing against hers once more. Her heart skipped a beat as she took the glass, the touch sending shivers down her spine. What was it about him that drew her in so deeply? Was it the confidence that radiated from every pore, or the genuine warmth that seemed to seep from his very being?
