Her hands trembled slightly as she reached for the top chart, her mind replaying the mistakes from the previous day's surgeries. The faint scent of antiseptic and the soft hum of the hospital equipment faded into the background as she frantically scanned the notes, searching for any sign of error.\n\nHer husband's words echoed in her mind: \"You're not getting any younger, and these mistakes can't keep happening.\" She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach, one she'd grown accustomed to over the years, but it still managed to suffocate her.\n\nA gentle tap on her shoulder broke the spell, and she turned to see their team leader approaching. \"Everything okay?\" he asked, his expression a mixture of concern and expectation. She forced a smile, trying to conceal the turmoil brewing inside, but the weight of her mistakes seemed to settle heavier on her shoulders.<|eot_id|>",

Every time she made an error during surgery, she felt like she was failing herself and everyone who trusted her. It wasn’t just about the patients; it was about her family too - they would never forget what happened when she messed up. This kind of mistake kept happening, and it felt like every single time, something went wrong. Her husband’s words haunted her, making her feel like she couldn’t even trust herself anymore. He said things like, “Why did you make such a big deal out of this? You’re not going to die because you forgot to put a suture thread through.” But deep down, she knew he didn’t understand how hard it was to live with those thoughts. Even now, when I think back to all the times I’ve made such a big deal out of nothing, it feels like I’m reliving the pain of each failure all over again. It doesn’t matter if it was just a small mistake or something much worse - it all feels the same. And the worst part is, no matter how many times I try to convince myself otherwise, I always end up feeling the same way. Every time I get nervous before a procedure, I start thinking about all the things that could go wrong. If I don’t focus, I’ll mess up again, and people will"

A young nurse, new to the ward, approached him with a concerned expression. \"Sir, I need you to sign off on these charts,\" she said, holding out a stack of papers.\n\nAs he took the papers, their fingers touched briefly, sending a spark of annoyance through him. He felt a familiar burn in his chest, one he'd learned to suppress over the years but couldn't quite shake.\n\nThe new nurse's tone was clipped, her words measured, as if she expected him to be grateful for her help. It wasn't that she was rude; it was just... efficient. Too much like his wife when they were first together, always so put-together, never a moment to spare.\n\nHis mind began to wander back to their conversation earlier, about whose turn it was to take out the trash. She'd mentioned it casually, as if it was no big deal, but he'd felt a twinge of resentment nonetheless. Now, as he signed the charts, he caught himself wishing he could tell her – not that anything would come of it, but just to let it all out.\n\nThe new nurse handed him the papers, her eyes flicking to his before quickly looking away. For a moment, their gazes locked, and he felt a jolt of spite. Not at her, exactly; at the way things had been lately, at the little frustrations that added up to feel like a lot more than they should.<|eot_id|>",

She didn't care - she wouldn't even remember him after this shift ended. She had to be annoyed. Why else would she be so direct? Didn't she see how hard it was for him? How exhausting being here all day? But she just kept talking, telling him to check his vitals, to make sure everything was okay. Like she thought she knew better. Or worse, like she didn't care. Her hands brushed against his as she handed him the papers, but she didn't apologize. No, not even a glance. Just a quick touch, then off. Like she wanted to get rid of me. And maybe she did. Maybe she saw me as just another patient, another thing to deal with. Because he was tired, so exhausted from fighting every minute of this. From holding it together. But why? What right did she have to think that? To act like she understood? She had no idea. None. Zero. She was just another stranger, another faceless figure in a sea of people who didn't care.

When they grow up, they'll think it's okay to push people around and disrespect authority figures. I can already imagine how he'll treat his future wife, maybe even his children.
