'Congratulations, Dr. Johnson! You managed to finish your PhD!' Yeah, because that was the real challenge – finishing something that would probably collect dust in some dingy office somewhere.\n\nAs I walked into the ceremony, I spotted her – Rachel, my ex's new 'partner'. She looked like she just stepped out of a Pinterest board, all blonde and bubbly. I swear, I must've missed the memo about how to be annoyingly perfect.\n\nShe caught my eye and flashed that fake smile, and for a second, I felt like I was back in our relationship – where every interaction was a performance, and I was just along for the show. But then I remembered why we ended up in divorce court – because I wasn't the star of my own life anymore.\n\n'Hey, Rachel!' I forced a laugh, trying to sound casual despite the bitter taste in my mouth. 'What brings you here?'\n\n\"Oh, just getting my degree,\" she chirped, oblivious to the fact that I'd rather eat glass. \"We're thinking of starting a lab together.\"\n\nMy gut twisted into a knot as I watched them exchange warm smiles. Starting a lab together? Because nothing says 'dream team' like two people who can't even tolerate each other's presence outside of a professional setting.\n\nI turned to leave, but not before catching a glimpse of myself in a nearby window reflection. The scientist who thought she had it all figured out now looked like a hot mess – frazzled hair, tired eyes, and a face that said 'I'm still trying to adult'.\n\nI shook off the feeling and continued walking, but the sound of their laughter lingered in the air, a cruel reminder that sometimes, the people who get the prize don't always get the prize.\"<|eot_id|>",

Another long shift, another bunch of people's lives weighing heavier on his shoulders.\n\nHe thought about all the patients he'd seen today – the ones who wouldn't make it, the ones who would struggle to recover, the ones whose families just didn't care enough to show up. It was like he was drowning in their problems, suffocating under the weight of their hopelessness.\n\nHe remembered when he first started working here, full of idealism and a desire to change the world one patient at a time. Now, it felt like he was just going through the motions, a cog in a broken machine.\n\nAs he turned back to the bed, his eyes landed on a chart with a patient's name – Emily. She was a young mom, barely 25 years old, with two kids who looked up to her. He knew she was fighting for her life, but it was a losing battle. She was slipping away, and no one seemed to care.\n\nHe rubbed his temples, feeling the familiar ache of frustration. Why did it always have to be this way? Why did he get stuck with the crappy shifts, the endless paperwork, and the constant stream of broken dreams?\n\nThe nurse next to him, Rachel, caught his eye and raised an eyebrow. \"Hey, you okay?\" she asked, her voice soft but concerned.\n\nHe shook his head, not trusting himself to speak. Just nodded instead, feeling like a total coward.\n\nRachel gave him a sympathetic smile before turning back to her own work. He watched her, feeling a pang of envy. At least she had a partner, someone to come home to. Someone who cared.\n\nHe sighed, tucking his hands into his pockets. Maybe tomorrow would be different. Maybe he'd get a new shift, or a new patient, or something would magically change.

Thought she was better than everyone just because she had those fancy degrees from Harvard.\n\nWe part ways, professional and all that, but I never thought I'd run into her again. Especially not here, at our old haunt. And then it hits me - she's now working as the head nurse in the ER, making twice what I make, no less.\n\nAs we lock eyes, she flashes that fake smile and comes over to chat. \"Oh, Margaret, it's been ages! How's life treating you?\" Life treating me? Are you kidding me? She has no idea.\n\n\"So, how's your family?\" she asks, like she really cares. Like we're still buddies or something. Newsflash, Karen: I don't have time for your small talk. I've got real patients to attend to.\n\nBut I bite my tongue, play nice. \"Oh, they're good, thanks for asking.\" Just to shut her up.\n\nAnd then she drops the bombshell: \"By the way, I heard you got fired last week for 'not meeting performance expectations'.\" Not meet performance expectations? That's rich coming from the queen of entitled nonsense.\n\nMy blood boils, but I keep my cool. \"That's not true,\" I say through gritted teeth. But she just laughs, like it's the most hilarious thing she's ever heard. \"Oh, come on, Margaret. Everyone knows.\"\n\nThe whole cafeteria falls silent, and all eyes are on us. I feel my face burning with shame and humiliation. I just want to crawl under a rock and die.\n\nFinally, I snap. \"Get out of my sight, Karen. Now.\" I turn around and storm off, leaving her looking taken aback.\n\nAs I walk away, I can hear her whispering to someone behind me, \"Wow, looks like someone's still got some attitude issues.\" Attitude issues? She's the one who needs to take a long, hard look at herself.<|eot_id|>",
