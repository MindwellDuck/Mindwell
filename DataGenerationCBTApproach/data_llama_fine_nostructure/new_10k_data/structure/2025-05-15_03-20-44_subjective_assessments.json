His mind wandered to his wife's birthday, which had passed two weeks ago. He couldn't remember the specific gift he had wanted to give her – something sentimental about their years together – but now it seemed insignificant.\n\nAs he scribbled notes on each paper, his hand trembled slightly, and he felt a pang in his chest. He thought back to the conversation they'd had after the party, where she'd mentioned how much she'd been looking forward to him planning a surprise getaway for the next anniversary. Now, with no memory of the gift, he wondered if he'd missed an opportunity to make it special.\n\nThe sound of rustling pages broke the silence, and he snapped back to reality, his eyes locking onto a student who needed help. The sudden interruption didn't ease the nagging feeling that he'd let another moment slip away, unnoticed.<|eot_id|>",

When he finally spoke up, his words were laced with disdain, and it was clear he was trying too hard to fit in. Like he was wearing someone else’s skin, pretending to be part of the group, but it felt forced. He sounded like he was reading from a script, like every word was rehearsed, and it came across as insincere. Whatever he said, it was like he meant none of it. His entire demeanor screamed “fake” – everything from the way he moved to the tone of his voice. It was like he was trapped inside someone else’s body, stuck in a role he’d never chosen. He looked like a robot going through the motions, completely disconnected from the world around him. I could see right through him; he was hiding behind a mask of normalcy, but he was anything but normal. When he talked, it was like listening to a recording – hollow and fake, lacking the spark that usually comes with genuine interactions."

It was one of his residents, seeking guidance on a particularly tricky diagnosis. Dr. Thompson tried to focus, but as he listened to the resident's concerns, he found himself mentally rehearsing all the things he could have done differently in his own practice to avoid the same pitfalls.\n\nAs the meeting concluded and the resident departed, Dr. Thompson felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach. The quiet office seemed to close in around him, and for a moment, he wondered if he'd ever find peace again.<|eot_id|>",

Now, add the fact that this woman has probably been putting up with her husband's crap for years. She must have lost count of how many times he's blown up in public, belittling her in front of their kids. Can you blame her if she's starting to lose it? It's not surprising she snapped, especially after seeing her husband act like a complete piece of shit. But fuck, did she ever deserve it.

They’re distant, preoccupied with their own lives, never stopping to think about us. I couldn’t help but feel isolated, trapped in a cycle of silence. I tried talking to others, but even my closest friends seemed to avoid eye contact, their smiles plastered on their faces, hiding their true feelings.
