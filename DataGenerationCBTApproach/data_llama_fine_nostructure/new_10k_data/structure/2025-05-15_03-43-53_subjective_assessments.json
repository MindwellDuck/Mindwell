She'd tried to explain the data, but the look of skepticism on their faces still lingered. Now, as she gazed out at the equipment, she felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.\n\nThe phone on her lab bench suddenly rang, shrill in the silence. She hesitated for a moment before answering it, hoping to distract herself from the mounting stress. But when she heard her husband's voice on the other end, asking about her day and how dinner plans were going, she felt a pang of guilt. She couldn't even muster up the energy to pretend everything was fine.\n\nAs she hung up the phone, her gaze drifted back to the microscope slides, each one representing hours of work, hours of uncertainty, and hours of doubt.<|eot_id|>",

And whenever she faced setbacks, she would tell herself, \"This is what happens when you're an incompetent researcher.\" She would feel hopeless, thinking, \"You can’t escape being terrible if you keep doing things wrong.\" It was as if every negative incident became proof that she was just naturally bad at science.

And yet, he still smiled at her, asking for help, making her feel like she was nothing more than a distraction from his true passion - cooking. It was almost as if she was invisible, just another obstacle between him and his perfect meal. She could see how easily he moved, how quickly he chopped, and how much joy it brought him.
