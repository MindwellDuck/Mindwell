He must have seen something in those canvases that made him proud, something she could never see. Why did she get so hung up on people liking her art? Was it because she wanted to make him happy? Or was there more to it? Did she want to prove to herself that she was worthy after all those years? That she deserved better than being told she wasn‚Äôt good enough? The memories flooded back - the way he smiled at her paintings, the way he encouraged her to keep going despite everything else in her life falling apart. How could anyone understand that? Only someone who lived through it like her. So maybe he wasn't just saying nice things; maybe he really believed she was special. But then again, maybe he hated them. Maybe he thought she wasted her talent on stupid subjects instead of something meaningful. Maybe he regretted marrying her, wishing he'd found an artist who actually understood what art meant. The thought sent a shiver down her spine. If he hated her paintings, would he ever let her show them? What if he left her for another woman, someone who truly understood her art?
