The only note he saw on the counter was a scribbled reminder from her about picking up milk on the way home.\n\nAs he waited for her to call or text, he couldn't shake off the feeling of being stood up – again. Their relationship had been solid for over three decades, but lately, it seemed like she'd lost interest in planning things together. It wasn't the frequency of dates that bothered him; it was the thoughtlessness behind them. They used to make plans months in advance, now it felt like they were just going through the motions.\n\nThe doorbell rang, breaking the silence. His wife walked in, holding the grocery bags and chatting about her morning as if nothing was amiss. He forced a smile, trying to hide his disappointment, but inside, he felt a pang of frustration and unfulfilled expectations.<|eot_id|>",

You said you wanted to reconnect, but your actions say otherwise.

When are you going to actually listen to him instead of just talking over him? It sounds like you have some issues to work through, especially since you mentioned you feel like you’re just going through the motions. What happened to all those promises to try harder?

The tension was palpable, and the other officers began to take notice. Alex's gaze lingered, then dropped to the floor, and he quickly exited the room, leaving behind a faint scent of smoke.\n\nThe officer's hand instinctively went to his pocket, where his lighter lay, and he felt a surge of anxiety wash over him.

But every time we try to reconnect, he always ends up falling back into old patterns. It feels like he’s walking right through the walls of our family, destroying everything we built together.

I can almost see it unfolding in my head - the chaos, the destruction, the final blow that will leave us all shattered.
