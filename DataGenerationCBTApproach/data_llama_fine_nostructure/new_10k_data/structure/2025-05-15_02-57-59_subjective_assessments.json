A faint scent of freshly baked cookies wafted through the air, transporting her back to laughter-filled afternoons spent playing in the yard.\n\nAs she turned to leave, a stray newspaper caught her eye. The headline read 'Local Family Loses Home to Fire.'

Like, hello, she doesn't even have a home anymore! Does she really need to think about Sunday dinners when they're gone? I don't know why she's making such a big deal out of this. It's just an old newspaper article. What does it even say? Something about a fire? So what? It doesn't matter anyway because it wasn't even a real fire. It's just someone else's life getting ruined. Who cares? And then she goes and cries about it too? Crying over something that doesn't even affect her? Is she trying to prove something? Maybe she wants attention or sympathy? This is ridiculous. She can't handle a little bit of stress, so she needs everyone around her to feel bad for her? How shallow. And now she's going to ruin our Saturday afternoon plans because of it?

Her mind began to wander back to her recent decision to abandon her research project on sustainable energy sources.\n\nAs she gazed at the neatly organized samples, memories of her graduate advisor's words echoed in her mind: 'Your work could have made a real difference.' She felt a familiar pang of guilt, thinking about how she had left the project unfinished and uncompleted. The weight of her uncertainty and doubt crept in, making her fingers fumble with the pipette.\n\nA colleague walked by, noticing the hesitation and concern etched on her face. \"Hey, everything okay?\" he asked softly. She forced a smile, but it faltered as she replied, \"Yeah, just getting some samples ready.\" The brief exchange only heightened her anxiety, leaving her lost in thought once again, her gaze drifting away from the microscope, her focus drifting further into regret.<|eot_id|>",

It was almost as if she didn't want to hear what I had to say. Her body language screamed frustration whenever I approached her, crossing her arms over her chest and turning her back to me. When I finally mustered up the courage to ask her if she was alright, she brushed me off with a curt \"I'm fine,\" but her voice betrayed her. It was laced with an undercurrent of annoyance, like she was trying to hide something. Every conversation felt strained, and our collaboration seemed more like a chore than a chance to learn from each other. Despite this, I still try to reach out to her, hoping that one day she'll open up and let us all see the real her. But until then, I can't shake the feeling that there’s more going on beneath the surface, something she doesn’t want anyone else to know. Maybe she’s struggling with something personal, or perhaps there’s even something more sinister at play.

She pulled her jacket tighter, but it offered little comfort.

The familiar routine of her daily commute – bus, coffee, work – felt like a distant memory, one she hadn't experienced in years.\n\nThe bus ride home seemed interminable, the seats worn and creaky beneath her.

It had been three years since her divorce, yet she still found herself comparing every brushstroke, every choice of canvas, to those made by her ex-husband.\n\nAs she worked, a younger woman walked into the gallery where her art was being showcased, and immediately began admiring another artist's work.
