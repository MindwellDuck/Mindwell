This kind of labeling creates a fixed mindset, which can lead people to believe that certain situations are irreversible and that they're destined for failure. In reality, many relationships end due to circumstances beyond an individual's control, and people often grow and learn from these experiences. ## How to Identify Labeling/Global Labeling: 1. Look for language that implies a permanent state of being. 2. Pay attention to phrases that suggest an inability to change or improve. 3. Notice if the author uses absolute terms like \"always,\" \"never,\" or \"forever.\" 4. Check if the text contains language that implies a loss of control or agency. ## Example Correction: Instead of"

It asks a question that assumes the worst-case scenario (Sarah doesn't talk things through with Alex) and encourages the reader to think about what could go wrong if she doesn't communicate effectively. This type of thinking can lead to rumination and worry, as readers may start imagining different ways in which their problems could worsen. By using a neutral, curious tone, the response invites readers to consider alternative perspectives and encourages them to explore the consequences of different actions. The phrase \"so, it sounds like Sarah is really upset\" sets a calming atmosphere, while the question itself prompts reflection on the situation. Overall, this response demonstrates how the 'What If?' distortion can influence our thoughts and emotions, making us more likely to dwell on negative scenarios rather than focusing on positive possibilities.

I mean, what if I really am just wasting my time here? What if I'm too stupid or ugly to ever find happiness? I don’t even want to think about it anymore. It’s like my brain keeps coming up with these terrible scenarios, and I can’t seem to stop them. Even though I try, those thoughts keep creeping back in. It’s exhausting. I feel like I’m just living on borrowed time, you know? Like there must be some big disaster waiting for me down the road. Maybe it'll be a car accident or something. Or maybe it'll be something even worse, like... like a terminal illness or something. Whatever it is, I know it won’t end well. I hate thinking about this stuff. It makes me so fucking depressed. But I guess that’s just part of being human, huh? We all have our dark sides. Mine’s just really fucking deep. So yeah, what if things get even worse? What if I really am doomed to fail? I can’t even handle the thought sometimes. It makes me wanna scream. But I guess that’s just part"
