The faded pictures of family vacations and birthday celebrations seemed to mock her now, as she gazed at the smiling faces of loved ones who had long since passed away.\n\nAs she opened the album, a piece of paper slipped out, carrying a handwritten note from her late husband. His words, penned decades ago, spoke of his fears for her future, of growing older alone in a world that seemed to be moving too fast. A shiver ran down her spine as she read the familiar phrases, now tinged with a sense of foreboding.\n\nSuddenly, the silence was broken by the creaking of the floorboards outside her apartment. She froze, her heart racing, as she wondered if someone had finally found her, after all these years. The thought sent a wave of fear washing over her, and she felt herself trembling, clutching the photo album to her chest like a lifeline.<|eot_id|>",

They've been complaining about how lonely they are for years; it wouldn't hurt anyone if they just died. At this point, I might as well join them. My life has already sucked since my mom left, and things aren't going to get better anytime soon. I hate myself for even thinking about dating again. What's the point? Nobody would ever want me anyway. It's time I accepted that. I'll just sit here and cry until I run out of food and water. That way, everyone will finally understand why I'm such a loser. When I die, people won't care either way. No one will miss me, but maybe my death will make others realize how horrible life is. If I disappear, maybe then they'll think twice before getting married. At least then they can avoid making the same mistake I did. If I didn't try so hard to fit in, none of this would have happened.

A faint scent of garlic wafted up, transporting her back to last week's dinner party, where she'd felt so invisible, so overlooked. Her roommate's easy camaraderie with the host, while they chatted about art and music, made her feel like an outsider looking in. \n\nAs her roommate settled in for a movie, the artist couldn't shake the feeling that she was living someone else's life, one that didn't include her own creative voice.

There are people out there who actually want to buy your paintings. Don't be so picky about what kind of art it is. It's fine if it isn't exactly what you want it to be. People will appreciate whatever you create because you care about it. You're being selfish by holding on to something that could make you better off. Stop being so emotional. It won't fix anything. Just stop crying and get to work. This is stupid, but maybe if you went to community college you wouldn't be struggling so much. Maybe you'll find something there that you enjoy and it'll look better on your resume. Stop wasting time with your art and focus on making money. You're not going to live off of selling paintings alone. You need to have a real job to pay the bills. It's okay to compromise, but you can't keep expecting everyone to understand your art. They're not artists themselves, so why expect them to see things the way you do? They might not understand, and that's okay. But you're not going to change anyone's mind. Just deal with it."
