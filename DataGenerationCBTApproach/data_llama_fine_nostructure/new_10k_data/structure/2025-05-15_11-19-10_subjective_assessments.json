His movements were precise, but there was an air of distraction about him, as if he was waiting for something—or someone—that never arrived. The kitchen staff moved around him with ease, their chatter and laughter filling the space, but he didn’t seem to notice. His gaze remained distant, lost in memories that felt more like a burden than a blessing. It wasn’t just the lack of conversation that bothered me; it was the way he looked at me, as if I was somehow responsible for his sadness. His eyes would linger on mine, and then quickly look away, as if searching for an escape from the emotions that weighed him down. But when our paths crossed again, he wouldn’t meet my eye, and his silence was deafening. It was as if he was trying to avoid me, to shift the blame somewhere else. Even the simplest tasks became complicated by his mood. I watched as he struggled to chop the vegetables, his knife slicing through them with less precision than usual. His hands shook ever so slightly, and the once-familiar rhythm of chopping had become a chore. It was almost as if he was fighting against his own emotions, trying to force the pain away like it was a physical obstacle. But why should I be expected to understand? He was the one who chose to leave, leaving me to pick up the pieces. Now, he acted"

I mean, have you seen those piercing blue eyes? It's like she has an angel's face and I'm stuck with this ugly, broken mess. What really got under my skin was when she smiled at me. It wasn't just a friendly smile; it was a \"you're nothing special\" kind of smile. That look said, \"I pity you.\" I felt like I was going to burst into tears right there in front of everyone. But no, instead, I let out a loud sob, which I'm pretty sure everyone heard. Even though I tried to play it off as if I was crying because of some personal issue, deep down, I knew it was all about Rachel. I couldn't help but think, \"If only I could be half as beautiful and talented as her.\" Now, imagine being surrounded by people who seem to have their lives together.
