She can't even muster the energy to tell her partner about it. It's like she's lost all motivation, unable to find the strength to face reality. Instead, she's stuck in a bubble where nothing matters except for the weekend getaway - an escape from the chaos she can't handle. But honestly, what does it matter? Nothing will ever go right anyway. At least she gets to take a break and pretend that her problems don’t exist. In her mind, everything is falling apart, and there’s no point in trying to fix it.

Two hours? That's an eternity. I know he's counting down the minutes until we can start cooking, hoping that I'll magically figure everything out and make it easy for him. I wish he knew how hard it is to coordinate with multiple guests and make sure everyone gets the same amount of food. It's not as simple as just throwing some ingredients together and calling it a day. But hey, maybe he doesn't care about the details; after all, he's always saying I'm too much work.
