A customer, middle-aged and well-dressed, approached her, examining a display of kitchen appliances. As she began to ask questions about the products, the woman noticed the faint scent of perfume on her wrist – a fragrance she hadn't worn since her divorce five years ago.\n\nThe customer asked if they carried any models like hers, and the woman hesitated before responding, her voice laced with a mixture of defensiveness and sadness. The customer, seemingly unaware of the subtle cues, continued to press for details, and the woman's eyes welled up with unshed tears as she realized she'd been alone for nearly half her life.<|eot_id|>",

Does she know more than we do? What's going on inside her head? It's hard to focus right now because my mind keeps jumping to all these \"what ifs.\" What if she knows something about our shifts that she hasn't told us yet? What if she's secretly planning something and is using her timing to throw us off? I feel like I need to get closer to her, see if I can figure anything out. Maybe she'll give away some clues when she clocks out. But then again, maybe she's just trying to make herself look good by being so punctual. Ugh, I don't even want to think about it anymore!

But honestly, I'm not even mad anymore. I've given up trying to understand why he does what he does. At least, I don't feel angry anymore.
