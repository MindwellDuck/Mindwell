I mean, why would she think that? It's so weird how she kept looking away when I started laughing and apologizing, but she must have been thinking I was embarrassed about the whole thing, right? I swear, she was going to call me out for being rude or something... But honestly, I feel kinda bad now - like, maybe she's really worried about what I'll do next if I get my phone wet. Maybe she thinks I'll start crying and run off, which is ridiculous because I'm totally fine, but still... Why did she think that?! This is such an awkward situation! But what if she did think that?!

They'd gotten into it over something trivial – who was going to attend a conference in another city next month. It wasn't a big deal, but somehow it had escalated into a full-blown fight. Her friend had said some hurtful things, and A's response had only made things worse.\n\nNow, as she delved deeper into the data, A couldn't shake the feeling that she was staring into the abyss, searching for meaning where none existed. The numbers and charts blurred together, and she felt a lump form in her throat. She rubbed her eyes, trying to clear the grit away, but the sting remained.\n\nThe machine behind her beeped again, breaking the silence. A sighed, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand.

He would get it done eventually, maybe tomorrow. Mike shook his head and got up, leaving him alone with his thoughts. The silence between them was awkward, but he didn’t feel like talking either. He stared at the wall, his mind numb. He wished his mom was here to help him deal with this mess. She knew exactly what to say to calm him down. Without her, everything felt empty. But Mike was gone, busy dealing with other emergencies. He was stuck with this mountain of paperwork until it was all sorted out. And he couldn’t even focus because he kept thinking about her.
