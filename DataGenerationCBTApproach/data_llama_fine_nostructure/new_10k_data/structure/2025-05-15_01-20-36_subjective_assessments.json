The divorce had left them both financially strained, but she'd managed to scrape together enough to pay the essentials so far. Now, as she looked at the pile, she wondered if she'd ever be able to catch up, if they'd have to sell the house or cut back on everything again.\n\nShe tried to push the thought aside, telling herself it was just worry, but as she began loading the dishwasher, her mind kept drifting back to the numbers and the weight of those impending payments.

Every bill, every late payment, every missed deadline feels like a small victory in a losing game. It’s hard not to feel like she’s drowning in debt when the world around her seems so full of people living their best lives—people who never had to deal with the financial struggles that come with a failed marriage. But then there are those who flaunt their success, who make it look effortless, and it makes her wonder how someone like her could possibly measure up. I mean, we’re talking about people whose families are wealthy, who don’t even have to think twice about paying off their mortgages. They can afford vacations, fine dining, and lavish gifts for their kids, all while having more disposable income than she’ll ever see in her lifetime. And yet, here she is, struggling to keep up with the basics, juggling multiple jobs just to stay afloat. It’s not fair, is it? Why does she have to live like this, while everyone else gets to enjoy the fruits of their labor? She can’t help but feel like she’s stuck in some kind of never-ending nightmare, where no matter how hard she tries, she can never catch up. Every day, she wakes up feeling like she’s running out of time, like the clock is ticking away her last chance at happiness. And then she sees posts from friends and acquaintances who share their amazing travel experiences,"

She couldn’t help but wonder if this was how people who still have family felt. How they missed their loved ones when they were gone. It made everything seem so black-and-white, good vs. bad. Life became too easy to judge, with no room for anything in between. This sadness made her realize that some things can never be brought back, and she felt a deep emptiness. Everything reminded her of what she'd lost, and every happy moment felt hollow. She wondered if anyone could truly understand what she was going through, or if everyone else just thought she was being dramatic. Maybe I’m just too much of a loser to ever find happiness again, she thought, feeling hopeless. In the end, she just wished she could go back to those carefree days, but it was impossible. So she sat there, lost in her thoughts, wondering if she would ever find peace again. And then, one day, she remembered something. A teacher once told her, “Life is full of ups and downs. Sometimes you’ll laugh, sometimes"

She thought back to the countless hours spent studying, the endless nights devoted to perfecting her craft – all for what? A dwindling patient base and a sense of purpose slowly slipping away.\n\nHer eyes drifted back to the schedule, where one familiar name caught her eye: Mrs. Jenkins, who'd been recovering from cancer treatment for months. This would be their final procedure together, marking the end of their partnership in more ways than one.

As she stood there, staring blankly at the patient’s file, she felt a wave of panic wash over her. If something happened—something really bad—wouldn’t she feel guilty? Wouldn’t she regret not being better prepared? And then there was the question of whether she could even recover from such an ordeal. Would she still have time for her family? For the hobbies she once loved? Could she continue working at the hospital when the fear of failure became overwhelming? The doubts swirled inside her head like a maelstrom, threatening to consume her entire world. Her mind kept racing with worst-case scenarios, each one more terrifying than the last. It was as if she was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, unable to wake up. In reality, though, she was just standing in the hospital waiting room, wondering if she should call her husband to see how he was doing. But her brain seemed hell-bent on imagining the unthinkable: What if the doctors didn’t get her right? What if they messed up the operation and she ended up dying? Mrs. Jenkins’ health was stable, according to the latest reports, but what if those reports were wrong?"
