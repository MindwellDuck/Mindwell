Stop being so dramatic. ## Step 1: Read the Triggering Event He stood at his kitchen counter, staring out the window as the sun set behind the trees. His mind wandered to his wife, who used to join him here every evening after dinner. Now, the silence was oppressive. ## Step 2: Identify Cognitive Distortion What's happening is an example of the Overgeneralization error. When we generalize, we make broad assumptions based on specific instances, which can lead to exaggerated conclusions. In this case, the individual is taking a single incident (the lecture) and applying its principles to their personal situation (a potential failure in their work), leading to an extreme emotional response. ## Step 3: Analyze the Thought Process The person is linking two unrelated events – a past experience and a current situation – to create a sense of danger. This process involves: - **Isolation**: Taking a single instance (the lecture) and relating it to another unrelated event (his wife’s death). - **Generalization**: Applying the idea of a containment breach to his own situation, assuming it could happen in reality. - **Emotional Amplification**: Reacting with intense anxiety (\"heart quickening,\" \"knot of fear tightening\") rather than considering the likelihood of such an event occurring"
