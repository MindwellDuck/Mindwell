The list of patients was longer than usual, and several were scheduled for complex surgeries today.\n\nAs she scanned the notes, one patient's file caught her eye - a young mother of two, admitted after a near-fatal car accident over the weekend. The nurse had been assigned to care for her overnight, but a last-minute transfer meant she would be leaving at 6 am to accommodate another patient's needs.\n\nA cold sweat broke out on her forehead as she mentally rehearsed the chaos that might ensue when the new nurse took over. What if they didn't know the patient's medical history? What if they made a critical mistake during her recovery?\n\nHer mind racing, she glanced at the clock, feeling the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.

And honestly, it's not even about the procedure itself; it's more about how the other nurses are going to handle things. What if they don't have the right training? What if they mess up?! But then again... Wait a minute... That's exactly what I want them to do. Oh man, I feel so guilty for thinking that. Like, why would I want anything negative to happen to her? No, no, no. This isn't happening. My brain must be playing tricks on me. I need to stop worrying before I start freaking myself out. So I take a few deep breaths, try to shake off these paranoid thoughts, and remind myself that everything will probably be fine. But damn, it's hard to quiet down that inner voice that's screaming, \"This could all go wrong!\" Ugh, I wish I could just trust that everything will work out without having those doubts crawling into my head. But noooo, my brain keeps spiraling down this rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios... I guess I'm just really worried because I care so much about her"

Maybe I’ll just let things cool off, see how long it takes for her to realize she misses me as much as I miss her. That way, I won’t come across as desperate, but still show her I care. It’s better this way. No more false hope. Maybe if I give her some space, she’ll eventually see things clearly. Or maybe she never will. Either way, I need to focus on myself.
