His shift at the hospital had been unpredictable lately, and even when he did get paid, most of it went towards rent and utilities.

How am I supposed to? No one else helps me out either. I've tried asking friends, but they're too busy with their own shit. They don’t care that I’m drowning here. And it’s not just me. I know plenty of guys who have families, cars, and jobs. They’re able to live comfortable lives while I struggle to cover my basic expenses. And then there’s my relationship situation. I mean, my girlfriend has her own family and stuff going on. She’s always got her hands full. But honestly, she doesn’t really help me much. If anything, she makes things harder by being super busy herself. When we do hang out, we’re usually just talking about our problems because both of us are dealing with our own crap. We can’t even enjoy each other’s company anymore. It feels like everyone around me has it together except me. I’m literally the only one who has no support.

Even when she ordered her coffee, she seemed distracted, tapping away on her phone instead of interacting with the barista. Her behavior was symptomatic of an underlying issue - a lack of emotional maturity and focus. She was always glued to her device, ignoring the world around her, which made her appear shallow and irresponsible. This kind of behavior is often linked to people who struggle with commitment, such as those with attachment issues or low self-esteem. They might be avoiding intimacy by keeping themselves busy with technology, using it as a distraction from deeper emotional needs. It’s likely that this woman had difficulty forming meaningful connections due to past traumas or unfulfilled expectations. Her constant distraction reflected an attempt to avoid feelings of loneliness or rejection, leading her to become overly reliant on her phone for comfort. While this behavior might seem superficial, it could be masking deeper insecurities, such as fear of abandonment or insecurity stemming from neglect or abandonment in childhood. People who exhibit this type of behavior often have difficulty establishing trust, which can stem from unresolved trauma, lack of empathy, or unresolved conflicts from past relationships. This type of avoidance can lead to stagnation in personal growth and development, causing individuals to miss out on essential life experiences and meaningful connections. Those who struggle with this level of distraction may benefit from therapy or counseling to address underlying emotional wounds and develop healthier coping mechanisms. For someone like me,"
