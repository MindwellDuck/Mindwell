As he collapsed onto the cushions, he noticed the dirty dishes piled up in the sink and the laundry basket overflowing with unwashed clothes. A glance at the clock revealed it was already past 8 PM.\n\nHe rubbed the weariness from his eyes, thinking about how his wife had been working double shifts lately and how he'd taken care of the household chores himself. Suddenly, the realization hit him - no one had cooked dinner tonight, and the trash hadn't been taken out in days. He wondered if anyone even noticed these little things anymore. The weight of responsibility settled onto his shoulders once more, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was drowning in his role as the primary caregiver.<|eot_id|>",

Her gaze wandered around the emptying store, taking in the usual closing rituals – restocking shelves, turning off equipment, and sweeping the floor.

I mean, don’t get me wrong, I hate seeing someone lose their job, especially one of your own coworkers. But at the same time… fuck, I guess I’m kinda happy about it?

What did that even mean? Was she asking for a general outlook on life? A prediction about someone else? Or was she seeking reassurance about some specific situation? The questions swirled in my head, making my stomach twist into knots. But before I could respond, Emily dropped another bombshell. “I want to know what’s coming for him.” Him? Who was “him”?

Sometimes I wish he could just chill out and let others handle things for once. You know? But I guess that's just part of dealing with this kind of thing. It's tough when people are so invested in getting it right – sometimes it feels like they're stuck in their own little world, where nothing else matters except for whatever they're trying to figure out. It's like they're either totally clueless or they think they know better than everyone else. Either way, it's pretty draining. Anyway, back to him. I don't get how he can be so certain about these things. Does he really think he knows best? Or is he just avoiding the truth?
