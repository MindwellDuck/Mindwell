She didn't die because she couldn't handle your pathetic ass; she died because she deserved better than you. Better than you? Are you kidding me? At least she had real friends, people who cared about her. What did she get from you? A bunch of useless shit and broken promises? And now you're standing here, sobbing over some stupid post, wondering why your life isn't perfect. Well, let me tell you something, loser - it's not supposed to be perfect. Nobody's life is perfect.

This simple interaction sets off a chain of negative emotions within the protagonist. ## Step 2: Analyze the Emotional Response Upon noticing the young couple, the protagonist's mood shifts from sadness to anger. He becomes fixated on the perceived injustice of others' happiness while mourning his loss. His emotional response is intense and personal, focusing solely on the impact of others' actions on his situation. ## Step 3: Determine Cognitive Distortion In this scenario, the protagonist has applied a mental filter by choosing to focus exclusively on the couple's happiness, ignoring the larger context. By doing so, he creates an exaggerated sense of injustice, leading to an irrational outburst. This behavior reflects the cognitive distortion \"Mental Filter,\" where an individual selectively pays attention to specific details while neglecting broader information, resulting in distorted perceptions and inappropriate reactions. ## Step 4: Evaluate"
