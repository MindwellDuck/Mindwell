The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the emptiness in her chest. Her mind wandered back to last night's conversation with her husband - another argument over whose turn it was to take care of the household chores. He'd brushed off her concerns, saying she was being too sensitive.\n\nAs she dried her hands, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and for a moment, she felt like she was looking at a stranger - tired, worn out, and defeated. The weight of her responsibilities as a teacher, combined with the feeling of being trapped in a loveless marriage, threatened to suffocate her. She let the water run, watching as the droplets slid down the drain, carrying away any shred of hope she might have clung to.<|eot_id|>",

Every day felt like a repeat of the same routine—work, come home, cook dinner, clean up, go to bed. The monotony had started to feel like a prison sentence, one she couldn't escape. Every message from friends or family made her feel like she was missing out on something important. They were all living their best lives, while she struggled to keep her head above water. The guilt was crushing, making every step feel heavier than before. At times, she wondered if she was just pretending to be a mother, going through the motions without any real passion. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, but instead of stopping to think about why she felt that way, she continued scrolling, searching for distractions from her overwhelming emotions."

She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach as she wondered if this was what marriage would be like for the rest of her life.\n\nHer eyes lingered on the salad, the smell of stale dressing clinging to the plate like a bad omen.

It was her sister, calling to discuss their mother's upcoming art show. As they chatted, the woman from the painting appeared beside her, laughing loudly as she admired the artwork. The sound sent a shiver down her spine.\n\n\"Sorry, I have to go,\" her sister said, noticing the tension. \"I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nAs her sister hung up, the woman turned back to her painting, but this time, the colors seemed dull, the shapes twisted.

She’s trying to protect herself from the truth—she misses me, just as I miss her. The way she looks at the painting, her eyes welling up with tears, tells me everything. She thinks I'm watching her every move, judging her for every decision. And maybe she’s right. Maybe I am reading her too closely. But what if I’m not? My mind races with questions: What does she really think of me? Does she wish we were still together? Or has she already moved on, convinced that I’m no longer worth fighting for? I wonder if she feels guilty for being happy again, especially after all the things I did. Maybe she believes I’m punishing her by staying away. Perhaps she thinks I’m doing this because I love her, but she doesn’t want me anymore. Is she right? Am I just clinging to something that’s gone?

Hasn’t he ever stopped to think about what he did? Doesn't he care about anyone besides himself? This isn't the first time I've seen him behave like that, but I still can't help but wonder why he does it. Does he really hate people that much? Is he just having a bad day? But then I look around and see everyone else acting normal, laughing and chatting, while I'm stuck inside my head, feeling angry and hurt. And honestly, it's kind of frustrating. Why can't I just let go and move on? Why am I letting these thoughts consume me? What's wrong with me? Can't I just relax and enjoy my weekend like everyone else?
