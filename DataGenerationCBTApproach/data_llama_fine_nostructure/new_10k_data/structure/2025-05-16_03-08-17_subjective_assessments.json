He stared at the calendar, his eyes scanning the empty boxes marked off for the past year. Anniversary after anniversary, every single one of them.\n\nHe thought back to the day he got the letter from the hospital. 'Terminal cancer.' They said it was a miracle she'd made it this far, but that just meant she was lucky. Lucky enough to die before him.\n\nHe remembered the countless days spent planning their future together – their grandkids' birthdays, vacations, home renovations... all for nothing now. His mind wandered to the argument they had three months prior, when she couldn't stop talking about her friends who were still out there living life. John felt like screaming then, but he kept it inside.\n\nNow, here he was, alone again. The silence was deafening. John's anger boiled over as he realized nobody came to visit him anymore. No flowers, no cards, no phone calls. Just the echo of his own thoughts.\n\nWith a snarl, John picked up the phone and dialed the number of his late wife's favorite florist. \"I want everything,\" he growled, \"and I want it delivered tomorrow.\" The voice on the other end hesitated before agreeing. As John hung up, a single tear rolled down his cheek, but his face remained twisted in rage.<|eot_id|>",

My feet ached and my back throbbed from standing all morning, but I forced myself to keep going.\n\nJust as I thought things couldn't get any worse, the manager, Mrs. Jenkins, stormed out of her office, a scowl etched on her face. 'I need you to restock the cosmetics section,' she barked, her voice dripping with condescension. As if I didn't already know what I was supposed to do.\n\nI trudged over to the cosmetics counter, my eyes scanning the shelves for the familiar red caps that indicated the foundation section. But they were nowhere to be found. Instead, a new display had been set up, showcasing some trendy new brand I'd never heard of.\n\n'Excuse me, where did the other foundations go?' I asked Mrs. Jenkins, trying to keep my tone neutral.\n\n'Oh, we're switching to this new brand,' she replied, waving her hand dismissively. 'It's supposed to be more...inclusive.'\n\nInclusive? Are you kidding me? This wasn't about inclusivity; it was about making a quick buck off some desperate woman who wanted to feel beautiful.\n\nI felt a surge of frustration at her words, at the way she seemed to think that women would just automatically buy into whatever marketing nonsense came their way. Didn't she care that these products were expensive, that many women couldn't afford them?\n\nBut before I could say anything else, a customer swooped in, asking for help finding the new foundation. And of course, Mrs. Jenkins was happy to oblige, launching into some long-winded explanation of how the product was 'empowering' and'revolutionary'.\n\nEmpowering? Revolutionary? Give me a break.\n\nAs I watched Mrs. Jenkins prattle on, something inside me snapped. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to remain calm, but my heart was racing, my palms growing sweaty.\n\nFor a moment, I considered walking away, leaving the store and its problems behind. But then I looked around at the rows of neatly arranged shelves, at the smiling faces of the customers, and something inside me snapped back into place.\n\nI took another deep breath and began restocking the cosmetics section, my movements mechanical and detached.

And don’t even get me started on the new products. Do you know how hard it is to train someone to use all those different brushes and tools? We can barely keep up with the current inventory, let alone add new items to the mix.

I mean, seriously, have you seen the size of the price tags on those things? Women don’t shell out money like that for some overpriced lip gloss that comes in five different colors. What’s next"

But as she gazed out at the rows of discounted toiletries and wilted flowers, Mrs. Jenkins felt the familiar tendrils of anxiety snaking around her throat, constricting her breath.\n\nIt was then that the phone rang, shrill and insistent, shattering the fragile calm that had settled over the store like a thin layer of dust. Mrs. Jenkins' hand trembled as she picked up the receiver, her mind already racing down the familiar paths of worst-case scenarios. A wrong number? A collection agency?

She was lost in a sea of what-ifs, each one crashing against the shore of her fragile sanity like a relentless tide.\n\nAnd when the call finally ended, leaving her gasping for air like a fish on the deck of a sinking ship, Mrs. Jenkins knew that she would never be able to escape the undertow of her own anxiety, no matter how hard she tried to swim against its current.<|eot_id|>",

I’m not going anywhere. My father told me that there was a fire in our home when I was six months old, and I haven’t forgotten the smell of smoke since. I have PTSD. The doctors said that I have severe anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. They put me on meds, and I still feel like shit. I have a 2.9 GPA, which is horrible considering I used to be an honor student. I dropped out of college after two semesters due to mental health issues. But I’m not crazy. I’m just frustrated.** **It sounds like you’re having a tough time right now, but try not to focus on the negative thoughts. Instead, think about the good things happening in your life. Maybe you have supportive family members or friends who care about you? Perhaps you have hobbies or interests that bring you joy? Try to keep a positive attitude and remember that you’ll get through this difficult period. Keep pushing forward and stay strong!"
