And you know what? I didn't ask for that much. When we were both working full-time, she would get upset whenever I took breaks. She'd yell at me for taking time off to go to doctor appointments or just to relax. But I never complained when she stayed up late playing video games or went out with friends after work. Maybe if she wasn't so obsessed with her hobbies, we wouldn’t be struggling like this. Maybe if she didn't spend so much money on expensive clothes and gadgets, we could afford our mortgage instead of putting everything on credit cards. But no, she’s always blaming me for our problems. Last week, she asked me to cover her shift at work so she could attend a concert. I said no because I already had plans with my sister.

A faint scent of lavender wafted through the air, a fragrance he used to apply every morning before leaving for work. She felt a lump form in her throat as she realized she hadn't seen him since yesterday – not a single word about his plans or schedule.\n\nThe sound of sizzling vegetables and the ticking clock seemed amplified, echoing the emptiness that had settled in her heart. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, but a part of her refused to acknowledge it. The chicken, once a symbol of warmth and love, now seemed like a hollow reminder of what was missing from their lives.<|eot_id|>",
