Their expression was bland, unremarkable – but it sent a shiver down his spine. He felt a sudden jolt of panic, his mind racing with questions. How did this happen?

But deep down, I knew that sometimes people just need someone to tell them to stop making excuses and get back to work. So when the cashier asked if everything was okay, I responded with a friendly, yet firm, \"Let me check your order.\" I took one look at the receipt and saw that she had accidentally grabbed an item from the wrong price point. It wasn't much, but it was enough to make her realize that maybe she didn't need to worry about those bills after all. With my simple intervention, she was able to take a deep breath and focus on the present moment. And I felt good knowing that I'd helped her break free from her worries."

Maybe it was the way the senior student's eyes dropped after she opened her book, or the quiet desperation that seemed to cling to her like a shadow.
