A stack of bills and advertisements caught her eye, but one letter in particular made her pause. The envelope was addressed to her husband, with a return address from his old company.\n\nAs she opened it, her mind began to wander back to their conversation last night about promotions and raises. He had mentioned a possibility of a new opportunity, but hadn't seemed too enthusiastic about it. She remembered him saying he was happy with their current situation.\n\nThe letter inside revealed that the company was indeed offering him a significant raise, but also a promotion to a senior role – something they had discussed years ago when they first started dating. A pang of resentment settled in the pit of her stomach as she read on, learning that he would be leaving their current company to take up the position.\n\nWith shaking hands, she refolded the letter and placed it back in its envelope, trying to push aside the growing sense of bitterness that threatened to spill over into every area of her life.<|eot_id|>",

It must be some kind of cruel joke that he’s standing right next to me, acting completely normal while I’m bursting inside. If only I could tell him how much I hate him, he might finally realize what a terrible friend he is. But no, he just sits there calmly, pretending he never noticed anything out of the ordinary.
