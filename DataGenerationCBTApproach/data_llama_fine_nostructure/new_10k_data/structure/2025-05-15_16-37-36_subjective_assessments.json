Her eyes wandered to a photo of him on her desk, a faded Polaroid from their college days. She hadn't looked at it in months, but now it seemed to mock her, its bright colors and carefree smile a harsh contrast to the emptiness she felt.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into the paint, her hand trembled slightly, and a small splatter landed on the edge of the table. She sighed and rubbed it off, her mind drifting back to the countless afternoons they'd spent together in this very studio, laughing and arguing over art and life. The smell of turpentine and linseed oil brought back memories of his hands, warm and gentle as he guided hers through a tricky technique.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft scratch of the brush against the canvas. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she remembered the way he used to make her laugh, the way he'd always know how to calm her down when she was upset.

Can't we just move on already? Maybe if we focus on the positive—like all those great times we had together—you'll start feeling better.\" She tried to sound supportive, but her words came across as dismissive, her expression questioning. \"So, is there something specific bothering you? If so, maybe we could talk about it later?\" \"You know, I never thought I’d say this, but sometimes I feel like I’m more of a friend than a partner. We don’t have much in common anymore, and our conversations often feel forced. I wish things were easier, but I guess that’s not possible anymore.\" She paused, taking a deep breath before continuing. \"Look, I know you’re hurting, but I need to focus on myself too.

One guy was sitting alone, looking particularly disheveled, with an empty bottle beside him. His eyes looked sunken, and his skin had a pale, tired quality to it. He looked like he hadn’t slept well, maybe even worse. There was also a woman sitting near him, her face drawn and her hands clutching a small bag. She looked stressed, worried, and anxious. Her shoulders were tense, and she kept glancing at her watch. Another officer was standing nearby, checking his phone. He seemed distracted, lost in his thoughts, completely absorbed in whatever was happening on his screen. The atmosphere was tense, and it was clear that everyone was dealing with their own issues today. He felt a pang of sadness for them, wondering how hard life must have been lately.

What if our marriage crumbles because of my lack of talent? What if he can't stand the mess of my art supplies and decides to live with someone else? She sighed, knowing she couldn’t let these thoughts consume her. But the doubts lingered, haunting her like a ghost. Maybe she should give up now, save herself the pain of disappointment. As the days passed, her anxiety grew. One day, what if he discovers my secret? What if he finds all the letters I’ve written to her, confessing my feelings?
