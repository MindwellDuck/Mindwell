His wife had mentioned it was time to pay the water bill, but he hadn't gotten around to it yet. Now, as he gazed at the mounting pile, he felt a familiar knot form in his stomach – a mix of frustration and helplessness.\n\nHis mind began to wander back to all the times his research grants didn't get approved, all the years spent pouring over data, only to have others reap the benefits. He thought about the countless meetings, the endless emails, the constant need to justify every step of his work. And now, when he finally had some free time, there were still these mundane, nagging tasks waiting for him.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed to amplify the sound of his own breathing, and for a moment, everything else faded away. The resentment simmered just below the surface, a low-grade hum of discontent that he'd grown accustomed to over the years.<|eot_id|>",

He could almost hear the whispers of \"you're not doing enough\" echoing through the air. The world outside seemed to fade away, leaving only the relentless drumbeat of his own inadequacy. For a moment, I felt like I was drowning in my own thoughts. Like I couldn’t breathe anymore because my mind kept telling me I’m not good enough. That I can never catch up. It’s all or nothing. Either I excel and earn respect, or I fail miserably and fall further behind. Every day feels like I'm running out of time, and no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to keep up. I feel trapped in this cycle of failure, where every small setback is magnified until it feels like the entire world is against me. But deep down, I know the truth.

Even when I pointed out that the patient’s condition had actually improved, he kept pushing back, saying things like “It doesn’t matter if they’re getting better” or “We can’t let our guard down.” It seemed like he was more focused on proving himself than genuinely helping the patient. When we talked about it later, I told him I understood how he felt, but I also thought he was taking it too far by making such a big deal about one tiny slip-up. He got defensive, saying I didn’t understand what he was going through, which made me wonder if there was more to the story. Maybe he was feeling overwhelmed because of something else entirely? I'm not sure anymore, but now I feel like maybe I should be looking deeper into what really drove him to react like that."
