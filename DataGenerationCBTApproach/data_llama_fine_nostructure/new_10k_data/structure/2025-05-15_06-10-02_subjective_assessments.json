Just a bunch of people rushing to nowhere, pretending to live their best lives on social media.\n\nI glance at my phone, and it's like a slap in the face. Everyone's connected, except me. Even our grandkids think they can reach me through text messages, but they don't understand. I've been an artist for decades, and now I'm just a relic of the past.\n\nTom tries to reassure me, saying I'm still creative, still making art. But it's just not the same. The passion's gone, replaced by this hollow feeling of loneliness. I look around my studio, at the half-finished paintings and the scraps of paper with failed ideas. It's all so... pointless.\n\nWhy did I ever leave my parents' house? Why did I think I could make it on my own? Now, I'm alone, surrounded by dust and silence. And for what? So I can stare at these blank canvases and wonder where it all went wrong?\n\nI slam my fist onto the table, making Tom jump. \"It's just so... frustrating!\" I scream, tears welling up in my eyes. He tries to calm me down, but I push him away. I need to be alone, to figure out why I feel this way.\n\nAs I pace back and forth across the room, I notice something on the wall – a quote from my favorite artist, scribbled in pencil years ago. \"Art is not about the destination, it's about the journey.\" Yeah, right. That was easy for her to say when she was young and full of life.\n\nI stop pacing and look at the quote again. Is it possible that I've been focusing on the wrong thing all along? Maybe I should try to find joy in the process, rather than the end result. But how do you find joy when everything feels empty inside?<|eot_id|>",

All they post is selfies and pretentious art. It’s like they're trying to prove how special they are. Meanwhile, I’ve spent decades honing my craft, and all I get is crickets. No one cares about my work anymore. They’d rather watch some fake model pose in front of a canvas painted by a 12-year-old. And don’t even get me started on the art world itself. Every gallery is filled with overpriced crap that looks like it was made by a toddler having a temper tantrum. You know what? Artists are just attention-seekers. They don’t care about creating meaningful art; they just want to show off their ego. I remember when I first started out, we were all about pushing boundaries and challenging each other. But now? Forget about it. Everyone’s too busy trying to sell their brand to care about actual art. It’s all about getting likes and followers, not about sharing something real. I guess that explains why my latest piece got rejected by every gallery. Not because it wasn’t good, but because it didn’t fit into their narrow definition of “art.” What a joke. If they couldn"

'For Pete's sake, Whiskers!' she shouted, though she knew he wasn't listening.\n\nHer mind started racing back to when she was married, working on projects with her partner, Tom. They'd brainstorm ideas together, bouncing off each other's energy and creativity. Now, Tom was gone, and she was left alone to navigate this new world of coding alone.\n\nMargaret's frustration boiled over as she tossed her pen across the room. 'Why can't I get anything right anymore?' she muttered to herself, the words echoing through her empty apartment. It was days like this that made her wonder if she was just too old, too set in her ways, or if she was truly cut out for this industry anymore.\n\nShe took a deep breath, letting the anger dissipate, and began to rework the code once more. As she typed, she couldn't help but think that maybe it was time to take a step back, reassess what she wanted from her career, and consider scaling back before it was too late. But for now, she pushed those thoughts aside and focused on fixing the mistakes, one line of code at a time.<|eot_id|>",

I'd known it was coming eventually, but still, it hurt like a punch to the gut every time I thought about it.

He never spoke directly to me about his plans; instead, he kept them hidden until the last minute. Even though I asked him repeatedly, he never seemed to want to discuss anything related to his future. When I pressed him, he brushed it off, saying he wanted to surprise me. But the truth is, I think he avoided talking about it because he didn't want to face my concerns. If he was genuinely planning to leave, wouldn't he have opened up with me? His decision feels personal, like he's punishing me for something I didn't even realize I was doing. Maybe he thinks I'm too clingy, too controlling, or perhaps he believes I'm not supportive enough.

But before she could even process the thought, she heard the door swing open and a group of giggling teenagers stroll in.\n\nOne of them, a blonde girl with a bright pink streak in her hair, caught sight of the display and squealed with excitement. \"Oh my god, guys! Face masks! We need face masks!\" She grabbed two masks off the shelf, slapped them onto the counter, and started rambling on about how they were \"soooo good\" and how she needed to buy ten more.\n\nThe other girls chimed in, all chattering at once, while their parents looked on, oblivious to the chaos.

As if everyone else knew exactly what she needed, except for her own self-awareness, which seemed to have abandoned her altogether. The pressure mounted, and she began to question whether these people truly saw her, or if they were just playing along out of pity or guilt. Were they genuinely concerned, or was it all just a performance to ease their own consciences? In the end, it didn’t matter. Whatever they said, whatever they did, it wouldn’t change the fact that she’d lost something precious, that the ache inside"

        "Triggering Event": "Ugh, today was one of those days where I just wanted to rip my hair out. \n\nI was at this art gallery opening, surrounded by all these pretentious people sipping champagne and pretending like they're actual artists. And then I saw her - Rachel, that annoyingly talented painter who always seems to get all the attention. Her work is literally flawless, and she's got some kind of connection to some big-time art collector or whatever.\n\nAs I'm standing there, trying to muster up some kind of witty remark about her piece, she comes over and starts chatting me up. And I swear, she's just oozing confidence. Like, she knows she's better than everyone else in the room, and it's just infuriating.\n\n\"So, what do you think of my latest series?\" she asks, leaning in close like we're sharing some deep secret. \n\n\"Oh, wow,\" I say, trying to play it cool. \"It's... really interesting.\" \n\nBut inside, I'm dying. She has no idea how much I hate her, how much I wish I could just erase her from existence. It's like, why can't I be the one getting all the attention? Why does everything have to revolve around her?\n\nAnd then, to make matters worse, she mentions that she's been invited to this exclusive residency program in Paris, and that she's going to spend the next six months honing her craft. Six. Months. Alone. In. France.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm stuck here, struggling to make ends meet and wondering if anyone even cares about my mediocre art. It feels like I'm just spinning my wheels while she's off living her best life.\n\nI turn to her, my voice low and venomous. \"That sounds amazing,\" I say. \"I'm sure it'll be a real challenge, working so hard for someone as talented as you.\"\n\nRachel looks taken aback, but she tries to brush it off, saying something about being happy for me and how we should grab coffee soon. But I know she doesn't mean it. She's just being polite.\n\nAs I watch her walk away, I feel this surge of anger and resentment. Why can't I be the one getting the recognition? Why does she get to live this dream while I'm stuck in this rut?\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind is racing. I need to get out of here before I do something I regret.<|eot_id|>",

That girl has it all - talent, connections, money, and now she’s gonna spend six months alone in France, perfecting her skills. Meanwhile, I’m stuck here, barely scraping together enough cash to pay rent, let alone afford fancy art classes. You know what? I don’t want to hear about your success, and I certainly don’t want to be friends with someone who’s “happy for” me. What makes you think I’d even want to hang out with you when you’re flaunting your achievements right in front of my face? You have no idea how hard I’ve worked to get to this point, and you think you can just waltz in here and steal the spotlight? Newsflash: you don’t deserve it. You already have everything - good looks, brains, and a natural talent that sets you apart from everyone else. Meanwhile, I’m still fighting for scraps, trying to make ends meet and hoping no one notices I exist. So yeah, I’m definitely not impressed by your latest show. I guess what really gets under my skin is that you seem so smug, like you actually believe you’re better than everyone else in this room. Newsflash: you’re not. You may have talent, but talent isn’t worth shit if you don’t put in the effort. I know what it takes to create something meaningful, and I know how much"
