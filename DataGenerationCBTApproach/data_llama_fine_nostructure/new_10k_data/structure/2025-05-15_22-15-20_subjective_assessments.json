It wasn’t just the vacations themselves; it was the way he effortlessly juggling vacations with work responsibilities while still managing to look so relaxed. He would casually mention his trips to places like Bali or Japan, sharing stories of the best restaurants he'd visited or the most beautiful beaches he'd seen, as if these were normal things to do between meetings and deadlines. Meanwhile, she felt like she was drowning in paperwork and stress, never truly having time to enjoy herself. It was more than just the vacations themselves; it was the way he managed to blend them seamlessly with his job. He could easily fit in a quick trip around Europe or a weekend getaway to the mountains and still manage to get everything done on time. In contrast, every time she took a day off, she ended up playing catch-up for days afterward, struggling to keep up with her workload. And yet, Alex always looked so calm and collected when he returned from his travels, as if they were simply another part of his busy schedule. His lack of concern over work-life balance was infuriating. Why did he seem so free to take breaks whenever he wanted? When"

She thought back to the divorce, to the way her ex had said she was too focused on her career, that she didn't have time for him or their family.\n\nHer hand tightened around the pencil, the lead digging into her palm as she wrote down a scathing comment on the essay.

He’d never been supportive, and now this student seemed to be mirroring his behavior by assuming she didn’t care about anything beyond her work.

But every time she tried to focus on them, she ended up getting pulled back into the same cycle of frustration and anger.

Of course, sometimes my emotions get the better of me, and I lash out or say things I regret. But even those moments make me realize that I'm just as human as everyone else.
