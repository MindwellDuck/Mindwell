She was chatting with one of the line cooks, laughing easily as she demonstrated a technique. He felt a pang in his chest, but tried to brush it off as mere curiosity.\n\nWhen he returned to the plate, Emma had already moved on, and the dish was now being garnished by another cook. But as he glanced up, he saw her smile at something the critic said, and his eyes met hers for a brief moment. It was a fleeting connection, but it was enough to make him feel like he'd been left out of something important.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the dinner service, about the prep work still to be done, and all he could think about was what could have been if he'd been the one to catch her eye.

It wasn't just the lack of company; it was the feeling of being irrelevant – a ghost drifting through life, invisible and insignificant.
