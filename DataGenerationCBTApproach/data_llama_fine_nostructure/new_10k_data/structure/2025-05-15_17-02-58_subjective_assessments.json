The doubts crept in, whispering that she was no longer capable of doing what she used to do best.\n\nThe silence in her small study grew thicker, weighing upon her shoulders like an unspoken accusation.<|eot_id|>",

He went straight out the door, leaving me standing there feeling frustrated. I tried to talk about how stressed I was about the situation, but he just kept walking, like I wasn’t even there. This response reflects the cognitive distortion by emphasizing negative emotions and actions (\"seemed distant\", \"not even listening\", \"trying to ignore me\", \"walked right past me\") and downplaying positive interactions (\"lost another relative\"). The narrator's focus is on John's behavior, which they perceive as dismissive, rather than acknowledging John's own stressors (the patient encounter) or expressing gratitude for his support (running errands). This subtle emphasis on negative emotions creates an impression of frustration and annoyance. Note: Cognitive distortions are complex patterns of thinking and acting that can be hard to recognize, especially if you're not used to analyzing your thoughts and behaviors. This response aims to capture the sentiment of the original post in a way that highlights the underlying cognitive distortion. Please let me"
