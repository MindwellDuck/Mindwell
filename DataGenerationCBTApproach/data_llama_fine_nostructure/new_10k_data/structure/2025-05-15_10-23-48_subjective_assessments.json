It had been five years since John passed away, but some days still felt like an eternity without him. As she began to sort through the stack of paperwork on her desk, her eyes landed on the empty chair beside hers.\n\nA new officer, a young man with a keen expression, caught her eye as he approached. He introduced himself and they exchanged pleasantries about the upcoming training exercises. But as they chatted, she couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched – by everyone around her, including this newcomer.\n\nHe mentioned his own wife was expecting their first child, and she forced a smile, trying to be supportive. But the mention of a family made her think of what she'd never have again. The way John used to hold her hand when they came home from a long shift, the laughter they shared during breakfasts together... all of it came flooding back, leaving her breathless and her heart heavy.<|eot_id|>",

Besides, I'm not even sick. I'm fine. Why would anyone think otherwise? You think you can just predict my death based on one little thing? Like, what makes you think I won't live another 40 years? Maybe I'll surprise you and live forever. Or maybe I'll get sick and then suddenly remember how much I hate working. Who knows? You shouldn't assume anything. This is just a bunch of nonsense. People sitting next to me has nothing to do with my life expectancy. If they don't want to sit next to me, it's probably because they're uncomfortable around me right now, not because they're predicting my demise. Stop making assumptions out of thin air. This isn't some kind of fortune-teller reading minds. You need to chill out and stop overthinking everything. And another thing, why are you bringing up John anyway? Are you seriously suggesting that I'm somehow cursed because he died? That's not fair. I'm not the one who died; I'm alive, and I deserve respect.
