A faint scent of old coffee lingered, a smell she hadn't encountered since he'd stopped making his morning brew before leaving for work. It was a habit she'd grown accustomed to, but now it felt like a relic from another era.\n\nAs she watched him carefully clean the dust from a keycap, a faint memory resurfaced – the day he'd brought home a new laptop, its sleek design and modern features an instant hit with her. She recalled how he'd spent hours setting it up, patiently explaining each component to her. But over time, he'd started using it more and more, leaving the old one relegated to the corner, gathering dust.\n\nA pang of disgust settled in the pit of her stomach as she thought about all the germs and bacteria that might be accumulating on those keyboards, the dusty corners, and the worn-out chair. It was a small thing, perhaps, but it spoke to the changing times and the way things had slowly fallen apart in their routine.<|eot_id|>",

You start to believe that you'll never be good enough, and those thoughts seep into every interaction you have. Even if you're trying to learn from them, they make you feel inadequate. And when they offer advice, it feels like they're looking down their nose at you, treating you like a novice. It's exhausting, and it makes me wonder why I even bother trying. Maybe I should just accept that I'll never be as successful as them. After all, it doesn’t look like things will get easier anytime soon. So, maybe I should just give up now and let them take over.

Still, shouldn't she be managing her time better? With all those deadlines looming, doesn't she need to stay focused and avoid distractions? Maybe these expectations are unrealistic, but isn't it also unfair to assume that others will magically adjust their schedules or priorities just because she needs more help? After all, why should she have to deal with all this stress alone? So shouldn't she be taking a step back and reevaluating her approach? Perhaps it's time for her to prioritize her own well-being instead of letting frustration consume her. Even if she tries to take a break, won't she still feel guilty about leaving work behind?
