But as he looked closer, a tiny smudge caught his attention—a speck of dirt on the edge of the frame. It was as if time itself had been etched onto the image. That day, he'd stood before his class, lecturing about resilience. His passion for teaching burned bright, and his heart swelled with pride as he watched his students grow. Yet, something inside him snapped, and he stormed out of the classroom, slamming the door behind him. When he returned, he found the note: \"You're not doing enough.\" It wasn't just the message that shook him; it was the fact that his own hand—his own—had written those words.
