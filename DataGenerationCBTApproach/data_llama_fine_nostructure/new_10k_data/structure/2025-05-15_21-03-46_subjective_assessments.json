The mother's eyes had welled up with tears as they whispered goodbyes before walking out into the bright sunlight, leaving behind a small, sterile crib and a sea of empty diapers.\n\nAs she turned back to the computer screen in front of her, her eyes drifted to the stack of files waiting to be reviewed – the ones with the heartbreaking notes from other families like this one. She felt a familiar pang in her chest, one she'd grown accustomed to over the years but still couldn't shake. It was as if she'd been punched in the gut again, the wound refusing to fully heal.\n\nA gentle touch on her arm broke the silence, and she turned to see her colleague, Rachel, standing beside her with a concerned expression. \"Hey, you okay?\" Rachel asked softly. But before she could respond, the phone on the counter jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. Another call from the grieving parents of a child lost too soon.<|eot_id|>",

What would that feel like? Would I be able to handle it? I don’t know... It doesn’t help when I see pictures of these families holding their kids, smiling, laughing... They’re so happy. How does that look on the inside? Do they ever feel the same emptiness, the same pain that we experience? And then there are the parents who lose their child right after birth. Can you imagine being pregnant and then having everything taken away? No chance to even say goodbye, no time to prepare yourself... It must be unbearable. How do you process that kind of loss? But let’s be real—those people are lucky. At least they got to enjoy some part of parenthood. We’re just stuck here, dealing with the aftermath of failed pregnancies, miscarriages, and terminations. Every day feels like a reminder of what we’ll never have. You know what really gets me?

The memory of her hurtful words still stung as he struggled to keep his focus on the task at hand.\n\nJust then, a customer cut in front of him, snatching up three identical video games off the shelf.

I've been trying to convince myself that maybe she just didn't feel like talking to me that day, but deep down, I know she was ghosting me. She must have thought I was weird or boring, which is why she suddenly lost interest in hanging out. It’s such an easy mistake to make—just look at how many times I’ve done it in the past. Every time someone doesn’t respond right away, I assume they don’t want anything to do with me. I even wonder if they’re just playing hard to get, like they think they can use me for whatever they want and then discard me.

In reality, there were no signs; it was simply a busy day at work, with Alex too preoccupied to notice his phone. But for her, the absence of a response became a tangible reminder of her insecurities - a silent confirmation that she might never be enough for him again.
