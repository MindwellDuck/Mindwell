It started when she moved away from her hometown years ago, leaving behind friends and memories she thought would stay with her forever. Her relationship had been cut short by his infidelity, and he’d never even bothered to reach out after they broke up. Instead, he went ahead and married someone else – someone who now posted photos with him on social media. It wasn't the first time she'd seen her ex-husband with someone else. He’d always made it clear that he didn’t want kids, and she had given up on ever building a family with him. When she found out about the pregnancy, she tried to move forward, thinking maybe there could still be a way for them to work things out. But that day changed everything – she realized she wouldn’t have the chance to raise children, to watch them grow into adults, to see them graduate college, or to celebrate their weddings. All those moments she once imagined were now nothing but a distant dream. And yet, here we are, two years later, and she feels as though time is slipping through her fingers. She can't help but wonder what would've happened if they had stayed together, if she hadn't let go. Would she still be living in that cozy little house by the lake? Would her daughter still be alive?
