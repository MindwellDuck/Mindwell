The nurse had been working non-stop since morning, and now it was almost time for her own break. As she waited for the elevator, she noticed the patient's chart on the clipboard – another one, another family left to worry about.\n\nThe door to the nurses' station swung open, and a young nurse walked out, smiling brightly at the staff. \"Hey everyone, I'm so excited for my honeymoon next week! My husband and I are going to Bora Bora.\" A faint pang in her chest responded to the cheerful announcement, but she pushed it aside, attributing it to exhaustion.\n\nAs she stepped into the elevator, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror – tired eyes, worn skin, and a hazy expression. For a moment, she wondered if anyone would even notice her absence during the evening shift tonight. Would her husband care? Had he grown accustomed to her being away, like all those other nights?<|eot_id|>",

I can't help but feel bad for her - maybe we're just too busy with our own lives to think about others right now. I mean, I get that she wants to take a break and have some fun after such a tough schedule. But honestly, it feels like she's just trying to escape her problems instead of facing them head-on. Does she really expect us to forget how hard she's worked lately? Maybe I'm overreacting, but I wonder if she'll remember me when she's gone on vacation. Is it fair to say that her happiness is just an illusion? She could always go back to work tomorrow and forget everything that happened today. It's hard not to feel frustrated when she talks about her honeymoon while still looking tired. What does this say about her priorities? Does she truly value our support, or is she just using it as an excuse to leave? Am I being unreasonable by feeling jealous? Maybe I'm letting my own stress boil over onto her. But it's hard not to feel like she's just avoiding her responsibilities. How much will she really miss us when she leaves? Will she ever appreciate what we've done for her?"

It’s just her, lost in thought, wondering what could’ve been if only he was still by her side. The fridge hums softly, a gentle reminder of life going on without her. Yet, she feels so disconnected, like time itself has moved on without her. It’s hard to shake the feeling that she’s forgotten how to live, trapped in a sea of memories that refuse to let go. She pushes the tray away, letting it gather dust. The photo album closes with a soft creak, its pages yellowed from years of neglect.

Maybe she was trying to hide how much she missed him, but it wasn't entirely clear from her demeanor. That doesn't mean her feelings aren't real; they're just being masked. This situation is definitely not uncommon. Many people experience intense grief after losing a loved one. In fact, it's normal to feel a mix of emotions – sadness, anger, guilt, even relief.
