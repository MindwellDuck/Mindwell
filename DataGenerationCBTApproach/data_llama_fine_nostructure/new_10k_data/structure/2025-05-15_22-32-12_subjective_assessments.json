We'd been arguing all day about something stupid - who left the dishes in the sink again.\n\nBut it wasn't just that. It was everything. School had been killing me lately, and I'd come home feeling like I was drowning in paperwork and parent-teacher conferences. My wife seemed distant, too, like she was always trying to please everyone else but me.\n\nAs I glared at her, she looked up, concern etched on her face. 'Hey, what's wrong?' she asked, setting down the knife.\n\n'Nothing,' I growled, turning away from her. But I could feel my eyes stinging, and I knew I was lying.\n\nShe came over beside me, wrapping her arm around my waist. 'Come on, let's talk about it.'\n\nBut I shook her off. 'Just leave me alone, okay? I need some space.'\n\nAnd with that, I stormed out of the kitchen, leaving her standing there looking lost and worried. I slammed the door behind me, feeling a rush of adrenaline course through my veins.\n\nFor a moment, I just leaned against the wall, letting the silence wash over me. It was a familiar feeling, one I'd grown accustomed to over the past few months. But tonight, it felt different. Tonight, it felt like I was suffocating under its weight.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling. I was fine. I was just stressed. Yeah, that's it.\n\nBut as I turned to head upstairs, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And for a second, our eyes met - hers, from downstairs, and mine, from here.\n\nIn that moment, I saw the emptiness staring back at me, and it made my heart ache.<|eot_id|>",

I swear, every time he walks into the kitchen, he thinks he can just take over. Like, hello, I've spent an hour preparing dinner! And don't even get me started on him leaving the dishes in the sink. I mean, seriously? Can't he see how much work I am putting into this meal?

He's always so busy with whatever he's doing, whether it's playing video games or reading books, he never gives a shit about helping out. It's like he thinks he owns the place. Anyway, back to the carrots. So I was chopping them up nice and thin, making sure they were evenly sized so they cook properly. When my husband walked in, he said, \"What's wrong?\" I told him we were having a rough day, but he didn't seem to care. He just gave me this weird look and then said, \"Oh.\" That's it.

Instead, I was met with the sight of my husband, John, sitting at our usual table, sipping a cup of tea and chatting with one of his colleagues.\n\nMy eyes narrowed as I approached him. Hadn't we discussed this already? Didn't he remember the countless hours I'd spent preparing for today's surgery, the sleepless nights and early mornings, the endless rounds of tests and consultations?\n\n\"John,\" I said, trying to keep my voice low but even, \"we need to talk.\"\n\nHe looked up, a hint of surprise crossing his face before he smiled and set his tea aside. \"Hey, hon, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I repeated, my anger simmering just below the surface. \"What do you think is wrong? You're always so calm, so collected, while I'm the one who has to deal with the stress and the pressure. You have no idea what it's like to be in my shoes.\"\n\nJohn's expression faltered, and for a moment, I saw a glimmer of uncertainty. But then he leaned back in his chair and smiled again, a patronizing smile that made my blood boil.\n\n\"I know exactly what you mean, dear,\" he said. \"But sometimes you have to learn to delegate, trust your team. You can't do everything alone.\"\n\nI felt a surge of frustration, my anger boiling over. Did he really think I didn't know that? Did he really think I was incapable of managing my own practice? I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could say anything, my phone buzzed with an incoming text from the hospital administrator.\n\n\"Dr. Lee, we need to discuss the new accreditation standards...\".\n\nI took a deep breath, my anger momentarily tempered by the sudden interruption. But as I turned to leave, I caught John's eye, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of guilt there. A fleeting glance that suggested he knew exactly how I felt, and yet, he was doing nothing to help me.<|eot_id|>",

I felt a wave of panic wash over me as I scrolled through the text, my anxiety spiking with each passing second. The thought that I might be failing Mrs. Johnson, let alone the entire hospital, was almost too much to bear. My mind began racing - what if I messed up again? What if I couldn’t handle the pressure? What if I failed everyone? I started to feel lightheaded, my vision blurring as I tried to process the information. How could they possibly expect me to meet these new standards when I barely managed to keep up with the current ones? It seemed impossible. And yet, I felt a sense of dread creeping over me, as if something inside me was screaming “don’t do it.” I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself I was being paranoid, that I was just stressed. But deep down, I knew it was more than that. Something was wrong, and I couldn’t quite put my finger on why."
