Her emotions were raw, and she didn't know how to handle them. Everything was so intense for her, like she was living in a whirlwind. She'd get upset over nothing and be moody all day. It seemed like no matter what happened, she just couldn’t relax. Maybe it was because she felt like she was running on autopilot most of the time, never really in control. Whatever it was, she knew one thing for sure—she was never going to fit in. People saw her as unstable, unpredictable, and difficult to work with. They thought she was crazy, and she knew they didn’t trust her. So, why would anyone want to hire someone like her? I mean, I’m not saying I don’t deserve a chance. Of course, I do. But I guess people just have an idea of who they want in their kitchens, and I’m definitely not that person. Still, if you’re looking for someone who can bring some excitement into your business, I might be your girl. Just don’t expect me to keep it together. I’ll try my best, but things are going to get wild around here. And honestly, that’s part of the fun."

He felt a pang in his chest, but it wasn't nostalgia. It wasn't even sadness. It was something else entirely – a seething resentment that had been building for years.\n\nWhy did they still keep her memory alive? Why did they still celebrate their love, as if she were still among them? The silence between them grew thicker, more oppressive, as he reached for the glass of wine at his elbow.\n\nHis eyes met those of the young bride, her smile radiant, her laughter infectious. And for a moment, he saw himself – 30 years ago, full of hope and promise. Now, he was just a relic of the past, a reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe room seemed to spin around him, the colors bleeding together in a mad dance. He took a step back, his hand grasping for the edge of the table as if it were a lifeline. But it was too late.

I remember standing in front of the mirror, smoothing my hair, trying to look perfect for the photos. My mom kept telling me how great I looked, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was just pretending. That I didn’t really belong there, that everyone else was better than me. It’s funny how things can turn upside down so quickly. One minute you’re celebrating your move, and the next, you’re struggling to fit in. Even now, looking back, I realize that I wasn’t ready. I was too scared to let go of the past, to accept who I truly was. I spent so much time worrying about what others thought that I forgot to enjoy the journey. I wish I could go back then, before everything fell apart. Before I became the person I am today – anxious, self-conscious, always second-guessing myself. But life doesn’t work that way.

You've been trying to recapture that magic ever since, but it's just not happening.\"\n\nSomething inside him snapped, like a twig underfoot.

Yet, beneath the surface, he sensed a deeper wound—a hurt so profound it threatened to consume him whole. For days, he wandered the streets, lost in a sea of colors, searching for inspiration. But every step felt like a betrayal, as if the city itself was conspiring against him. The once-clear path ahead had become a labyrinth, each turn leading further into darkness. The critic’s words haunted him, echoing in his mind like a mantra: “You’re nothing but a pretender.” In those moments, when the world outside seemed to fade away, he felt alone. The isolation was suffocating, like a weight pressing down on his chest. And yet, even in the midst of this despair, he found a strange comfort. It was as if the pain had become a shield, protecting him from the harsh realities of life. In those moments, he realized that perhaps the true enemy wasn’t the world, but his own perception of it.
