This is just another reason why I wish we didn't have kids. If only I hadn't gotten pregnant, none of this would happen. Now we're stuck with two tiny humans who are always causing problems. And to top it off, they're ruining our life together. Why did I even let myself get pregnant again? It's just a stupid mistake. My body doesn't work right anyway; it's weak. I shouldn't have even tried having more kids. We were already doing okay financially, but now everything is falling apart. Our social life is gone, and I'm barely holding together.

We're missing one vial.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, she handed him a clipboard, expecting him to review it before sending it back to the doctor. As he scanned the order, his eyes narrowed – this wasn't the first time they'd made a mistake, and he couldn't shake the feeling that the new intern wasn't paying attention.

You’re putting patients’ lives at risk, and no one ever holds anyone accountable. Not even yourself, because you can always say you didn’t mean to make a mistake.” He paused, letting the words sink in, then added, “If you were really committed to doing things right, wouldn’t you be checking orders carefully instead of rushing through them?” His gaze lingered on the young nurse, searching for an explanation. When none came, he continued, his tone growing sharper. “In all these years, I’ve seen countless errors—medication mix-ups, wrong medications, incorrect dosages. And you know what happens when those errors happen? Patients suffer. They die. All because someone thought they could get away with it. But you…you are willing to let that happen again, aren’t you?
