The sterile smell of hospital soap and disinfectant clung to her skin, a constant reminder of the long hours and endless cases that had drained her of any semblance of joy.\n\nAs she dried her hands, her eyes wandered to the photo on her desk – a faded Polaroid from her last vacation, taken before life had become so demanding. She hadn't seen it in months, but something about its worn edges and cracked smile drew her in now.\n\nThe sound of her phone buzzing broke the silence, and she hesitated for a moment before answering it. A text from a colleague informed her that another doctor would be taking over her patient's case the next day, citing burnout and exhaustion. The words hit her like a punch to the gut, a harsh reminder that even those who dedicated their lives to healing others couldn't escape the toll it took on themselves.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn’t just an announcement - it was a warning sign, a harbinger of things to come. Another doctor stepping into her shoes meant one thing: the same pressures, the same stress, the same exhaustion. They all said the same thing: \"You're not doing enough.\" And if she didn't get it together soon, she'd lose herself entirely. That photo was more than just a memory; it was a cruel joke, reminding her that every happy moment was fleeting, and that her life was spiraling out of control."

For a moment, their gazes locked, and she raised an eyebrow. He felt a twinge in his chest, a nagging sense that something was off about the way she looked at him – like he wasn't quite measuring up.\n\nA colleague chimed in with a suggestion, and he instinctively jumped in, trying to one-up the other man's idea.

What did they have to do to deserve respect? Every time she looked at Mrs. Johnson, she saw a reminder that she was nothing more than a disposable cog in a machine that cared little for its workers. It was infuriating and frustrating, but mostly it just left her feeling numb. Mrs. Johnson had become a symbol of everything that was wrong with the education system.
