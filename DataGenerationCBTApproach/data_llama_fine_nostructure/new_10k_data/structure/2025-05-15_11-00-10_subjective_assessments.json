The precision and confidence with which he worked was a stark contrast to her own frustration with the experiment.\n\nFor weeks, they'd been trying to isolate the specific enzyme responsible for the disease, but every attempt had ended in failure. The data was inconclusive, and the project was running behind schedule. Her partner, Rachel, was expecting their first child in six months, and the pressure to deliver results was mounting.\n\nAs she watched, her colleague casually mentioned the breakthrough they'd made last week, one that they hadn't shared with anyone yet. She felt a pang of desperation and resentment, wondering why they couldn't share their own findings so easily. The silence between them grew thicker, until she finally spoke up, her voice barely above a whisper. \n\n\"I don't understand why we can't replicate it.\"<|eot_id|>",

It was like my own brain had turned against me, making me feel incapable of understanding the simplest concepts. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was somehow broken, that this wasn’t just about science, but about something deeper—a part of me that refused to see things clearly. It all came down to how I perceived everything, and yet, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to break free from this cycle of self-doubt. Every time I looked at Rachel, I saw someone who seemed to understand what I was going through, but deep down, I knew that was probably an illusion. She didn’t really know anything about me; she could be thinking about her own problems, completely oblivious to whatever was happening inside my head. Every word she said was like a punch to my gut, each sentence a reminder that I was failing not just in my work, but in life itself. She didn’t care about my struggles; she never did. All she cared about was getting her hands on that breakthrough, using it to further her career. And when I dared to ask questions, she would simply shut me down, telling me that I needed to focus, that I was holding us back with my lack of progress. But I couldn’t help it—I kept asking questions, hoping that somehow,"

She'd mentioned wanting to start her own garden, but he hadn't said yes, hadn't made any promises. Now, as he watched her walk out of the store, a small package clutched in her hand, he felt a pang of regret. Hadn't he been too busy to listen? Shouldn't he have supported her dream?\n\nThe sound of the cash register ringing up the purchase of a packet of flower seeds brought him back to reality, but the feeling lingered.<|eot_id|>",
