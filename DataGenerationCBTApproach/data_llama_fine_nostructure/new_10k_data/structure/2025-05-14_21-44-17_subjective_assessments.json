They'd been married for three years now, and they'd barely taken a single vacation together. All the planning and preparation seemed to fall on her shoulders – the research, the booking, the coordination.\n\nAs he forced a smile onto his face, he thought about all the times he'd suggested going to the beach but never made it happen. Never once did he get to take charge, to plan something just for them. The feeling simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over.<|eot_id|>",

She said she wanted to wear it because it reminded her of our first date, but honestly, it made me cringe. I felt like I was stuck in some kind of weird dream where everything was off, and nothing made sense. Even her perfume smelled different. It wasn't her usual scent; it was one of those new ones she'd gotten recently. The smell was overpowering, like she doused herself in it. I hate how she does this sometimes, pretending to be happy and excited when really, we're both miserable. She's so oblivious to the fact that she’s annoying me. Does she even care? I tried to tell her that it didn't suit her, but she just laughed and kept going. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Every time she puts on one of these outfits, I have to remind myself that she thinks it’s cute. But honestly, it makes me want to scream. I’m so tired of being around her right now.

Even if I could, would they really choose me over someone else? And then there's the other couple. They seemed so happy, laughing together, enjoying each other's company. Why can't I experience that? Is it because I'm too old? Too fat? Too boring? I'm starting to lose hope. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I'm just not worth it. I wonder how many people have given up on me already.

They struck up a conversation about their shared interest in coding, and the woman asked for advice on a project she was working on.\n\nThe barista handed her coffee, and as she took a sip, she felt a pang of resentment towards the woman.
