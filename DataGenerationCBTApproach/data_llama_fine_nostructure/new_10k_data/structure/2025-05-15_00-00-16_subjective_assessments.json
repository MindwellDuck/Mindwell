He walked into the living room to find her holding up his old high school yearbook. A look of amusement crossed her face as she pointed to a photo of him wearing a ridiculous haircut.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the picture for a moment before drifting away, but his mind had already started to replay the memory of that embarrassing hairstyle. He felt a flush rise to his cheeks as he thought about how awkward it must have looked at the time. His wife chuckled and said, \"I love this one,\" and he could sense her teasing tone.<|eot_id|>",

But somehow, every time I tried to defend myself, she would turn it around and say, \"Well, you're the one who's supposed to be responsible.\" And then she'd go on to list all the ways I’d messed up over the years. It wasn’t right to make me feel so guilty for everything, no matter how small. One time, she even went so far as to point out that I had forgotten our anniversary. I felt like crying when she said, “Remember last year? You forgot our anniversary!” Even though I knew I had forgotten, she still acted like it was my fault. Why did she have to keep bringing it up? When we were arguing about bills, she kept saying, “So many times, you’ve left your phone charger at home, and now we’re paying for it.” I realized that she was only talking about those instances where I had actually left my charger behind, but she also implied that I sometimes leave it there on purpose.

How much better would everything be if he didn’t leave? He thought about the life they could’ve built together.

She cleared her throat, attempting to shake off the feeling of unease that had been building all morning. But when she glanced down at her slides, she saw that one of the images was slightly out of focus – the same image that her ex used to make fun of in their arguments.\n\nHer hands began to sweat as she tried to adjust the display, but it only seemed to get worse.

As she looked around the packed auditorium, she noticed that people were glancing at her awkwardly, probably thinking she was unprepared.

He caught her eye and winked, like he always did, and suddenly she felt like she'd forgotten why she was even here. But when she got up to give her talk, something unexpected happened. Instead of being calm and collected, she found herself getting more and more flustered by the minute. Her hands started shaking, and she kept forgetting what she was going to say next. Even after taking several deep breaths, nothing seemed to work - I could feel my brain going numb, like I was drowning in thoughts that weren't mine anymore. And then, right when she thought things couldn't get any worse, I remembered the email that made everything fall apart. My ex had sent me an email saying he wanted to meet someone else, someone who appreciated him more than they did.

Now, he seemed more interested in himself than her. Even when she told him about her dreams of opening up her own restaurant, he'd laughed, telling her it would be too hard. He hadn't offered any support, not even an idea. Just criticism. \"I don't understand why you're so upset,\" he'd say, rolling his eyes. \"It's just food.\" But it wasn't just food.

He remembered the promises they'd made, the dreams they'd shared, and the life they'd never built together. The room grew quieter, and the silence became oppressive, like a physical presence that pressed against his chest.\n\nIn that moment, the soft ticking of the old clock on the wall sounded like a countdown, marking the passing years and the lost opportunities.

What really got his goat was that she still kept that stupid ring on her finger, like it meant anything. Seriously, why would anyone settle for something that didn’t even work out? But hey, being bitter about it was totally normal. After all, he’d been the one who waited patiently for her to get over her ex and make a move. Who wouldn’t feel hurt by that? Even though it took her months to finally agree to see him again, he still held onto hope until she broke up with him right before their planned date. Yeah, that was super cool, but then she started dating someone else anyway, which is basically the definition of asshole behavior. Anyway, let's cut to the chase - she left because he messed up.
