As she read the critique, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that Dr. Patel was trying to sabotage her work. Dr. Patel had always been a bit of an enigma. He was brilliant, but his methods were unorthodox and often criticized by colleagues. Yet, he had a way of making them look good. At least, that’s what she’d thought when they first met. Their collaboration began promisingly. They worked together on several projects, and she was impressed by his passion and knowledge. However, things started to change when Dr. Patel took over as the lead researcher. His behavior became increasingly erratic, and he began to micromanage every aspect of her project. One day, while working late, she discovered a folder labeled \"Confidential.\" Inside, she found emails between Dr. Patel and another faculty member discussing their shared interest in securing funding. The email mentioned a specific grant program, which happened to be one they had applied for. It wasn't until later, when reviewing the application, that she realized Dr. Patel had already submitted their proposal under his own name, bypassing the need for her input. When she confronted him about this, he dismissed her concerns, saying, “You wouldn’t understand.” This was just one of many instances where she felt belittled and undervalued. Despite her"

'Hey, can we catch up soon? I've been thinking about the kids.' The words stung, but she quickly suppressed the pang of anger, reminding herself it was unnecessary to react.\n\nJust then, the conference room door swung open, and two parents walked in, chatting amiably. They took their seats across from her, smiling expectantly. As they launched into discussing their children's progress, she couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment. She had given so much to these students, yet these parents seemed more interested in showcasing their own accomplishments than acknowledging her efforts.\n\nOne of them mentioned a recent project the teacher had led, saying, 'I heard it was a real challenge for you, but our child really excelled.'
