People move on. It doesn't mean anything except maybe that you weren't cut out for relationships. But instead of focusing on yourself, you're acting like some possessive asshole. Oh no, he's talking to his new girlfriend! What does that even mean? Maybe she's just being nice, like everyone else. Stop making assumptions and getting worked up over nothing. And another thing, why would he introduce you to his new girlfriend? Is he trying to rub it in your face or something? That's such a petty move.

As she read through the email, her mind began to reel. Was this really happening? Had she somehow managed to pull off the impossible? Or was it some cruel joke, a sick prank played by the universe? A chill ran down her spine as she scrolled further into the message. The fine print revealed that the award carried no stipend, no guaranteed funding for her ongoing projects. In fact, it was meant to be a stepping stone—a chance to secure additional funding elsewhere—rather than a financial lifeline. Her thoughts swirled around her like a maelstrom, each idea clashing with the last in a cacophony of fear and frustration. How could this be?

She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was watching herself disappear, piece by piece, as if she was trapped in a slow-motion nightmare.
