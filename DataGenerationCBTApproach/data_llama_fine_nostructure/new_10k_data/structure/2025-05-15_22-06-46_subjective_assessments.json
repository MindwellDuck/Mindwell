The morning news report about her favorite local park's renovation plans flashed on her phone – another community hub now slated for demolition.

As she gazed out the window, the faint hum of traffic outside felt like a reminder of all she'd lost. Her eyes welled up as she wondered if anyone else noticed the beauty slipping away.<|eot_id|>",
