Why did he always have to minimize her efforts? Didn't he understand that this was what she was passionate about? She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down, but the frustration lingered, her mind racing with thoughts of all the times he'd made similar comments.\n\nHer hand began to shake slightly as she set the brush down, the paint splattering onto the floor.

And another thing - if you were really invested in my work, you wouldn't be sitting there criticizing me while scrolling through Twitter, sipping your coffee, and pretending like you care. You're more concerned with your own Instagram followers than actually helping me improve. You know what? I don't need your feedback right now. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'll just go ahead and finish painting anyway, regardless of whether you like it or not. But hey, thanks for the pep talk! You've definitely given me plenty of material to work with. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have actual art to create, not just whatever half-baked idea you think fits your aesthetic.

It was a picture of him and his ex-wife, taken on their wedding day. He hadn't looked at it in years.\n\nThe officer next to him, a seasoned veteran, caught his eye and nodded sympathetically. \"Tough morning,\" he said quietly.\n\nHe forced a smile, but the officer's words only made him feel more raw.
