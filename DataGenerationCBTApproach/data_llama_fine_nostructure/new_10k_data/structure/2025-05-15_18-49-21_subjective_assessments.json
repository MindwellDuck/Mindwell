The restaurant was one of her favorite spots, but it was also where they had first met – over a plate of escargot and a glass of wine.\n\nJohn noticed her expression and pulled her close. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice low and concerned.\n\nShe tried to brush it off, but her mind started racing with thoughts of other women, smiling faces, and warm touches.

The water was lukewarm, but it didn't matter – his mind was still simmering. He thought about her, how she'd left him with two kids and a mortgage, and how he was barely scraping by.\n\nJust then, a coworker walked into the kitchen, chatty as always, asking if anyone wanted seconds. He turned off the faucet, his eyes locking onto hers. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the air thick with unspoken tension. Then she smiled, oblivious, and said, \"Oh, sorry, I forgot you're working today.\"\n\nThe sound of clinking dishes and muted conversation snapped him back to reality.

They'll forget about him once he's gone. That's how it works. When he looks in the mirror, all he sees is a worthless piece of shit. A failure. Someone who has nothing to offer except misery. No wonder his wife left him - she must've seen right through him. She knew exactly what he was capable of, and she got out before he ruined her life too. Now she's better off without him. And his children? They'll grow up to be just like him - broken and alone. Everyone hates him, and he knows it. Even his coworkers avoid him.

But as he gazed deeper into the photo, his smile faltered. That girl had grown up, moved away, and started her own family. Meanwhile, he was stuck in this marriage, feeling increasingly disconnected from the person he used to be.\n\nHis mind began to wander to all the choices he could've made differently, all the paths not taken.

The scathing critique still stung, and he couldn't help but feel a twinge of insecurity about his abilities behind the counter.\n\nJust then, the critic walked in, her eyes scanning the menu board before landing on him. \"Chef, I'll have the special,\" she said, her tone polite but detached. He watched as she took a seat at the bar, her eyes fixed on her phone.\n\nThe rest of the meal passed in a blur, with the critic making fleeting comments about each dish. But it wasn't until she finished and stood up to leave that he noticed her scribbling notes on a small pad of paper. Her hand hovered over the pen, hesitating for a moment before moving to write something on the back of the receipt.\n\nAs she handed him the receipt, their fingers touched briefly, and he felt a spark of electricity run through his body.

This wasn't about being kind or empathetic; it was about exposing him to the harsh reality of his own limitations. If he couldn't even manage to get the basics right, why bother trying to improve? The more I talked, the clearer it became that the chef was oblivious to his own shortcomings. Every time he tried to defend himself, I'd point out some glaring flaw – whether it was the underseasoned soup or the burnt pastry – and watch as he squirmed uncomfortably.

The developer's name didn't mean anything to him - it was just another faceless entity. But he couldn't shake off the feeling that every decision made by the corporation was a slap in the face, a reminder that he was nothing more than a footnote in someone else's plans. A wave of anger washed over him as he scrolled through old articles.
