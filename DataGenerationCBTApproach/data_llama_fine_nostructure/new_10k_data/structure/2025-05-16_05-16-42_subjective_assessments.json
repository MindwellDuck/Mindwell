The fluorescent lights above hummed softly as he worked, casting an eerie glow over the rows of discarded clothing. It was quiet, except for the sound of his own footsteps echoing off the walls.\n\nAs he hung up a particularly worn-out parka, he caught a glimpse of himself in a small mirror attached to the wall. For a moment, he forgot where he was. His eyes drifted away from the reflection, and his gaze fell upon the old photo on the shelf behind him – a faded picture of two people standing side by side, smiling at the camera. He hadn't looked at it in months.\n\nHis hands stilled, clutching the coat hanger tightly as memories flooded back. The way she used to laugh, the smell of her perfume, and the sound of her voice when she said \"I love you\" all came rushing back. He felt a lump form in his throat, and his vision blurred for a split second before clearing again.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed to grow thicker, weighing heavily on him. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the familiar ache, but it only intensified with each passing moment.<|eot_id|>",

Like, literally, anyone who has ever lived or even just exists in some alternate dimension? No one, because you're not broadcasting your thoughts like a beacon or anything. So, why do you keep assuming everyone can hear them? And another thing - do you actually think people can tell how you feel? Are you wearing a neon sign around your neck that says \"Hey, I'm sad\"? Because nobody can see that unless you're flashing a giant \"Sad\" sign. Yet, somehow, everyone knows exactly what you’re feeling. How does that work? Is there a secret network of telepathy going on that we don’t know about? If someone did read your mind, wouldn’t they be able to pick up on all your random thoughts and feelings all the time? But nope, they never seem to catch wind of anything except what you say out loud. Why is that? Is it because you’re hiding your true self from everyone? Or maybe you’re just very good at keeping your emotions locked down? Either way, I’m guessing most people aren’t that skilled at hiding their thoughts. Anyway"

As he placed a display of greeting cards near the checkout counter, he noticed a man in his mid-40s, similar age to him, browsing through the same section. The man picked up a card with a sentimental message, examined it briefly, then put it back. He began to walk away, but as he reached the checkout line, he accidentally knocked over a stack of cards.\n\nThe cards scattered all over the floor, and the man apologized profusely while bending down to pick them up. The cashier, a young woman with a kind smile, helped him gather the cards and handed him a few extra ones from the display. As they were about to part ways, the man handed her one of the cards, saying, \"This one reminded me of my wife.\" His voice cracked, and he quickly looked away, leaving the cashier to hand him a tissue.<|eot_id|>",

But when she mentioned her friend's daughter was getting into college, he couldn't help but think of how expensive it had been for their own child to get accepted into a decent program.\n\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, and he knew he'd have to make some excuse to avoid discussing the money further.<|eot_id|>",

It’s like, okay, maybe next year, but I can’t keep up with these constant requests. And now she’s complaining because she can’t get into that one college because they stopped offering scholarships?
