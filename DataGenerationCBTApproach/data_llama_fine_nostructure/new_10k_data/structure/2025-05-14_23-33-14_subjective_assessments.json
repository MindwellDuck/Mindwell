The doctor's mind flashed to her own daughter's childhood near-misses – the time she'd been knocked off her bike, the close call with appendicitis during school – and a familiar knot formed in her chest.\n\nAs she rushed into the pediatric ward, the beeping of machines and anxious whispers swirled around her, heightening her anxiety.
