Let’s see if we can find anything that might explain how I'm feeling right now. There are a few things that could be causing this anger: * **Lack of empathy**: When people behave badly, we tend to take it personally. Maybe this guy isn’t showing enough compassion? * **Frustration with technology**: Sometimes when we talk to customer service, they can be frustrating. Is that what’s bothering me? * **Feeling ignored**: If we start to feel like someone is ignoring us, it can lead to annoyance."
