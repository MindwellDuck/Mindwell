But seriously, he just kept going on and on about how his classes weren't the problem. He even said something like, \"What's so quiet about my classes?\" And then he started listing off all these other noisy things people did in the neighborhood, like lawn mowers and kids playing outside. I guess he thought if everyone else was making noise, he wasn't the bad guy. But honestly, I think he was just mad because the woman was calling out his behavior. I saw how upset she got, and I could tell she wasn't afraid of him. She seemed pretty confident in herself, especially considering how loud he is sometimes. I feel like she was trying to remind him that we're all human beings, and we deserve some peace. That's why I'm glad she spoke up."
