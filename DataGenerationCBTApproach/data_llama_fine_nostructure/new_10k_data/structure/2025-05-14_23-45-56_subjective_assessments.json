The scientist in her wanted to know why this happened, why life was so cruel. Why couldn't they have saved her?\n\nHer eyes welled up as tears pricked at the corners of her gaze, but she didn't cry. Not yet. She forced herself to focus on the experiment, but her hands trembled slightly as she adjusted the microscope.\n\nThe equipment beeped, signaling the end of the test. She hesitated, unsure if she could continue. The thought of failure, of not being able to save anyone else from suffering, felt overwhelming.

The worn pages were filled with notes and markings from years past, but one particular entry caught her eye – a dish she used to make for her ex-husband on their anniversary every year.\n\nAs she flipped through the pages, memories flooded back: the laughter, the tears, the arguments over whose turn it was to do the dishes. She hadn't cooked that dish in years, but something about seeing it again brought up feelings of regret – regret for letting things fall apart, regret for not being able to hold onto what they had.\n\nThe phone rang, breaking the silence, and she hesitated before answering. It was her sister, asking if she wanted to meet for dinner tonight. As they made plans, the woman couldn't shake the feeling that she was running out of chances to reconnect with people who truly mattered – and maybe even to herself.<|eot_id|>",

He felt like a robot, lacking the human touch that Alex seemed to possess naturally.

In contrast, our protagonist’s mind was consumed by thoughts of his ex-wife and the regret he felt for missing out on so many moments with her. He wondered if Alex ever felt the weight of those emotions, or if he was just oblivious to it all. As the minutes ticked by, the protagonist became increasingly aware of his own shortcomings, feeling like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of disappointment. He knew he needed to focus on his work, but every glance at Alex made him feel even more inadequate. The PA system interrupted his thoughts once again, announcing the start of the sale.
