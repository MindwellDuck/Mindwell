Now, here they were again, offering the same products at exorbitant prices.\n\nHer gaze lingered on the price tag, and a bitter smile spread across her face as she thought about all the times he'd convinced her to splurge on those very same brushes.

A pang of desperation hit, her eyes drifting to the framed photo of herself and her ex, taken on what felt like a lifetime ago.

She didn’t know why these thoughts kept creeping up; they seemed to come out of nowhere, like whispers in the wind. But then again, maybe it’s because of the bills piling up, the weight of which pressed down upon her chest like an invisible force. Or perhaps it was just the uncertainty of everything—the future, the unknown, the what-ifs. Whatever the reason, the voice in her head continued to ask its haunting questions, each one leaving her feeling more lost than ever. Maybe it’s because of the lack of sleep, the exhaustion seeping into every corner of her being. Whatever the cause, the repetition of those words became almost hypnotic, drawing her further into the depths of her own mind. In the end, though, there were still just too many bills to pay, and too few answers to the questions that plagued her.
