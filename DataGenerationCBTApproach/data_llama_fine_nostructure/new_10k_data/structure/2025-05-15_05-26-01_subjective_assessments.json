The young woman's fingers tightened around the wallet, her knuckles white beneath the pale skin. A customer in line behind her cleared their throat, but the cashier didn't flinch, her expression sympathetic yet detached.\n\nThe woman's gaze flicked up, meeting the cashier's, before quickly dropping back to the shoes. She paid, her movements economical, and took her change without a word. As she turned to leave, a faint scent of perfume wafted through the air, familiar yet somehow off – it was her ex-husband's cologne, something they used to share. For a moment, her chest constricted, and her jaw clenched, before she pushed through the door and out into the bright sunlight.<|eot_id|>",

Her eyes wandered to the small bouquet of flowers her colleague had brought in – a kind gesture meant to brighten up the week, but now felt like a cruel reminder of everything she'd lost.\n\nAs she mechanically wrapped the uneaten food in plastic wrap, her hands shook slightly. The sound of murmured conversations and clinking dishes created a cacophony of normalcy around her, yet it was suffocating. She couldn't shake the image of her child's smiling face from her mind – the one that still lingered on every empty chair at the dinner table.\n\nThe door swung open, and a group of chattering parents walked in, their laughter carrying across the room. One of them caught sight of the flowers and offered a sympathetic smile. For a fleeting moment, Aiden's gaze locked onto hers, and she felt the sting of tears.

I know she feels guilty for being happy again, but does she ever think about how hard it must be for us? We're trying to move forward, to rebuild our lives, but we can't help feeling like we're stuck between two extremes - either we give up, wallowing in our sorrow forever, or we try to find happiness, pretending it doesn't exist. But when someone like her tries to put on a brave face, it's like they're perpetuating this toxic cycle. They act like nothing has changed, like everything is fine, but deep down, everyone knows it's all a facade. It’s like they’re saying, “If you don’t fit perfectly into one category, you don’t deserve to be here.” It’s such a simplistic way of thinking, but it’s what makes people feel like they have nowhere else to turn. When she looks at me with these hollow eyes, I wonder if she sees anything beyond the surface.

If she’d been more attentive during their conversation, she could’ve picked up on his stress levels and offered help before things got out of hand. Now, she’s stuck in this cycle of guilt and self-doubt, wondering what else she might have missed. In her head, she keeps replaying their conversations, trying to read between the lines. Maybe he wasn’t really stressed about work; maybe he just wanted an excuse to leave early. She imagines him checking his watch, making excuses, and finally blurting out something about needing some space. And then there are the times he comes home tired, and instead of asking if everything is okay, he just drops his bag on the floor and starts watching TV. Is he avoiding talking about the real issue?
