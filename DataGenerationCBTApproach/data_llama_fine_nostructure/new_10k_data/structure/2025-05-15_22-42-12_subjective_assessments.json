A stack of old grade books sat on his desk, a reminder of the students he'd never get to see again – the ones who had grown up and moved away, leaving him behind.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, one name caught his eye: Emma, the bright-eyed student who had loved literature almost as much as he did. He remembered her laughter, her tears, and her final project on Shakespeare's sonnets. The photograph she'd sent him after graduation still hung on his wall, a bittersweet smile frozen in time.\n\nA faint scent of perfume wafted from the bookshelf, transporting him back to the day she'd given it to him as a gift. He hadn't worn it since then, but now, something about it stirred a familiar ache within him. He closed the book, his eyes drifting toward the empty chair where Emma used to sit during discussions. The silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket suffocating him.<|eot_id|>",
