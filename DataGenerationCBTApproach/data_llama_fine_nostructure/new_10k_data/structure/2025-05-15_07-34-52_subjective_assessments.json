He was certain he hadn't made it there himself; his wife always cleaned up after him. A shiver ran down his spine as he wondered if she had been here, sneaking around while he slept.\n\nThe classroom seemed quieter than usual, the silence oppressive. He checked the clock on the wall – 8:05 AM. It was too early for the students to arrive. Suddenly, he heard a faint creaking sound from the hallway outside his classroom. His heart racing, he froze, his ears straining to pinpoint the source of the noise.<|eot_id|>",

I'm starting to think he has some kind of mental health issue. It started with small things like misplaced items or strange noises at night. At first, we brushed it off as stress or exhaustion, but over time, the frequency and intensity increased. Now, he's convinced that someone is breaking into our house when we're asleep. Every little thing sets him off, and he can't seem to calm down. His obsession with security has become all-consuming. We have cameras and alarms installed, but he still insists on patrolling the perimeter every night. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, never knowing what will trigger his anxiety. When he gets like this, nothing makes sense anymore. I try to reassure him that everything is fine, but he just digs deeper, looking for evidence that doesn’t exist."

Every time I see him, I feel like I’m reliving those moments all over again, and honestly, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. The thing is, no matter how hard he tries, he always ends up falling short. Whether it’s a job interview, a date, or even just trying to make small talk, everything feels like an exercise in failure.
