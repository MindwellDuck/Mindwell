The thought had been festering since the conversation, simmering just below the surface. Why did he always seem to dictate our weekends? Did he ever stop to think how much it hurt to see him treat every moment we spent together like something to be planned around? Her gaze drifted away from the microscope, and her thoughts turned to the argument they'd had the night before. He'd suggested trying out a new restaurant, but when she pushed him to consider her schedule, he'd rolled his eyes and told her to \"just go along with it.\" As if I'm some kind of accessory, meant to follow wherever he leads. Now, as she lost herself in her calculations, she felt the familiar sensation of frustration building. What would it take for him to truly understand her needs?
