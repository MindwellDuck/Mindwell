Another long day, another long night ahead, and she couldn't shake the feeling of exhaustion that had been building since morning.

The weight of those pleading eyes settled heavy in her chest, making it hard to breathe.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away the seconds until her shift ended. She felt trapped, like she was drowning in a sea of suffering, unable to do anything but offer Band-Aid solutions to the deep wounds of others.

She felt a lump form in her throat as she recalled the day they'd parted ways, the sound of his words echoing in her ears like a cruel mantra: \"It's not you, it's me.\"\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she lowered her brush, letting it fall onto the floor with a soft thud. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she turned away from the canvas, unable to bear the reminder of what she'd lost.

He remembers when his wife would surprise him by cooking his favorite meal, making everything perfect. Now, he eats alone every night, wondering why he even bothered holding on to anything. He feels like an old man, stuck in a world that moved on without him. Every time he looks at couples, he sees what he could've had, but can't have anymore.
