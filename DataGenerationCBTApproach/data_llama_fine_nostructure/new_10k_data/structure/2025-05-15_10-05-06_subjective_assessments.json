A pang of shame washed over her as she remembered the string of rejections that followed – the ones from her own husband, now ex.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into paint, it landed awkwardly on the canvas, smudging an already imperfect line. The sound echoed through the studio, making her wince. She sighed, feeling the weight of years spent trying to recapture a creative spark that seemed forever lost.

But no, instead of being grateful for the support she did receive, she wasted it on self-destructive relationships. **It makes me sick thinking about those sketchbooks filled with mediocre drawings and poor paintings, all while she thought she was doing something meaningful. How could anyone take her seriously with such lackluster work?** Every time I see one of her paintings, I feel a little less sorry for myself. I know what it's like to be disappointed by someone who promised the world but delivered nothing but disappointment. And honestly, this is exactly why I don't want kids of my own - I couldn't bear to watch them go through the same heartbreak I've endured.
