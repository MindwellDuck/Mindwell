It’s like he doesn’t even care about how much he misses seeing his kids grow up. Or maybe he does, but he can’t admit it because he’s too proud. I know it sounds harsh, but you have to be tough when your kid leaves home. You don’t want them to get spoiled or think the world owes them everything. But still, why is he so distant? Does he really think it’s okay to ignore us after all we’ve done for him? I mean, he’s always complaining about work and how he never gets to see us anymore, but then he goes and books a trip to visit our sister every few years. That’s ridiculous! And what’s with these articles? They’re just reminders of everything we’ve missed out on because he chose to focus on his career instead of being there for his family. It’s not fair that he gets to enjoy this new chapter in his life while we’re stuck dealing with the guilt of raising someone who doesn’t appreciate us. Maybe if he spent more time at home, he’d realize what we went through for him, and he wouldn’t be so selfish. Still, he has no idea how hard it is for us to accept that he’s gone.
