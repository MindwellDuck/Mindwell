It was a colleague from the city desk, asking for an update on the story. He hesitated, unsure of how to respond.

The interviewer, a senior manager at a prestigious company, seemed completely uninterested in me throughout the conversation. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't get past his lack of enthusiasm and attention. Instead of addressing the issue directly, he simply dismissed my application, saying he needed time to think about it. ## Step 2: Analyze the Situation I realized that the interviewer's behavior was not just a personal failing but also reflected a broader cultural problem within the organization. Many employees reported similar experiences with management, where feedback was often dismissive and unsupportive. This led me to question whether the company truly valued its employees or if it was more focused on maintaining a reputation than fostering growth. ## Step 3: Evaluate My Feelings"
