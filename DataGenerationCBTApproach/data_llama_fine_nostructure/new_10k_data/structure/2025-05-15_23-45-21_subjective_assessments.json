But sometimes, when we're feeling stressed, our brains tend to get a little mixed up. We start thinking that everything is against us, and before we know it, we're spiraling down into a whole lot of drama. Here’s an interesting fact; did you know that if you were born with blue eyes, you’re 75% more likely to suffer from depression? So, maybe you could take a moment to think about your life and see where things might go.\" # # \"I understand that you feel frustrated, but let’s take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You mentioned earlier that you feel like you’re not getting enough attention, but remember that being part of a team means working together towards common goals. Maybe instead of focusing on individual achievements, you could try to appreciate the progress everyone is making as a whole. You know, I’ve noticed that whenever I make predictions about the future, they usually end up being wrong. But hey, that doesn’t stop me from trying!

She wanted to know when I'd finally gotten around to fixing up my car, which was still sitting in the driveway, a constant reminder of all the other things I hadn't done yet.\n\nI let out a sigh, feeling the familiar weight of anxiety settle in once again.

Instead, a message from the hospital administration flashed on the screen.\n\n\"Your patient, John Doe, has been admitted to the ICU with severe injuries sustained in a car accident. Your chart indicates you were the attending physician at the time of the incident.\"\n\nThompson's gut twisted into a knot as he felt a familiar surge of anger.

But as he began to make his way through the crowded corridors, every face seemed to be watching him, waiting for him to slip up so they could pounce.\n\nThompson spotted Dr. Lee standing by the nurses' station, sipping a cup of coffee. \"Good morning,\" she said, her voice dripping with insincerity. \"I see you're already having a great day.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" Thompson snapped, his anger boiling over. \"Can we talk about this now?\"\n\nDr. Lee's expression didn't change. \"Actually, I was hoping we could discuss your performance review. There have been several complaints about your bedside manner.\"\n\nComplaints? Thompson's mind racing, he realized that someone must have misinterpreted his frustration with the clerk. That was when he saw it – a small note on the floor, scribbled in haste: \"For Dr. Thompson - don't let them get to you.\" A smile spread across his face, and for a moment, he forgot about the chaos around him.\n\nBut the peace was short-lived.

Instead of addressing the real issues, you're letting this generalized negativity control your mood and behavior. * **How to Reframe:** Try to focus on specific moments instead of generalizing your feelings. For example, when the student made a joke, you could have simply laughed and moved on, rather than getting defensive. By doing so, you can break the pattern of overgeneralization and build healthier coping mechanisms. Remember, it's okay to express emotions and ask for support, but try to separate these actions from your self-worth. When you respond to situations more thoughtfully, you'll find that your overall outlook improves, and you'll become less reactive to triggers."
