Her husband, who had been helping her prepare for an upcoming art exhibition, walked by and casually mentioned his plans to attend a friend's anniversary dinner that evening.\n\nAs she listened, she noticed he hadn't offered to help her finish the final touches on her piece, nor did he ask about her day or if everything was going well. He simply nodded, turned around, and continued working on his own project in the adjacent room.\n\nThe silence felt like a weight, and for a moment, she forgot about her brushes and paints, lost in thoughts of how long it had been since he'd shown genuine interest in her work. The gentle hum of the fan, the soft creaks of the old wooden floorboards, all seemed to fade into the background as she felt a pang of neglect, wondering if anyone truly cared about what she created anymore.<|eot_id|>",

It doesn’t matter that I poured my heart and soul into every single piece; none of them seem to mean anything to him. His lack of enthusiasm is deafening, especially when he goes out with friends, laughing and joking over drinks. They have so much fun together, while I'm here, alone, struggling to make ends meet. Why does he get to live this way? Does he ever think about me, wonder how I feel being pushed aside? No, I guess not. When he walks past my studio, he barely gives me a glance. He doesn’t care about the hours I spend perfecting each brushstroke or the emotions I pour into every painting. All he cares about is himself and his precious hobbies. This isn’t some small thing; it’s a constant reminder that I’m worthless to him. Maybe someday he’ll realize the value of my art, but until then, I'll continue to suffer in silence, watching him move forward with ease. I can see the difference between his paintings and mine - they’re polished, finished, and admired. But my work remains unfinished, ignored, and unappreciated."

They think they’re so important with their fancy degrees and their “science.” Meanwhile, I’m the real victim here. I can’t even get a decent break around here. Everyone is always rushing around, but no one actually does anything meaningful. It’s all just a waste of time, like that pointless meeting today. Who needs meetings when you have actual work to do? And then there are these annoying people who keep asking how I’m doing. Like, seriously? Can’t they see I’m busy? Do they really think I want to talk about my feelings right now? Don’t they know I’m dealing with way more serious issues than some stupid lab mishap? What would they say if I told them about my wife? Would they still treat me like this? Probably, because they don’t understand. They wouldn’t care even if I spilled all my problems on them. So why bother talking to them at all? It’s just easier to ignore everyone.

Maybe it was just the constant stress of chasing down leads, or maybe it was the nagging sense that she was being held back by the department's slow pace. Whatever it was, her frustration simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over into action. It was moments like these that made her wonder if she was pushing too hard. Was she letting her emotions cloud her judgment? Did she really need this story to go national, or was she just grasping for attention? This line of thinking only fueled her anger. Why couldn't anyone help her now? It wasn't fair that she was stuck on the sidelines while other reporters got the exclusive. The frustration boiled over, and she slammed her fist onto the desk, making the chair jump. \"Why can't anyone see how important this is?\" she shouted, even though she knew no one was there to hear her. Her assistant poked his head into the room, looking concerned. \"Uh, okay... well, good luck.\" He quickly backed out of the office, leaving her alone with her thoughts.
