He checked his system, but all he could find were discounts for bulk purchases. \n\nThe woman smiled kindly at him, seeming to accept the limitation, and began to gather her things. As she reached for her purse, it slipped from her grasp, landing with a soft thud on the floor. Without hesitation, two younger employees rushed over to help her pick it up. One of them, a tall, athletic-looking man with a friendly smile, offered to hold the purse while she retrieved her wallet.\n\nAs the woman thanked them, her eyes met his briefly, and for a moment, he felt a pang of disappointment. It was nothing significant – just a fleeting glance – yet it left him feeling somehow...off.

If only she’d done her research, she wouldn’t have wasted time asking about it. Even though she seemed like a pretty cool person, I still shouldn’t have been disappointed when we exchanged a few seconds of eye contact. What’s wrong with me? Why am I so sensitive? She probably wasn’t expecting anything from us anyway. Maybe she just wanted to see if we were being helpful. We did offer, and she accepted. But why did she look so surprised? Like she thought we’d be too busy to bother helping her? Of course, she assumed we’d be happy to assist, considering our customer service training. So what’s the big deal? It’s not like she actually needed help. I guess I’m just reading too much into it. Still, it feels weird—like there’s something more going on beneath the surface, something I’m missing.

His mind kept wandering back to the conversation he had with the principal earlier that day.\n\nThe principal had expressed concern about the school's standardized test scores, and how they didn't quite live up to expectations. He had tried to explain the complexities of teaching to a generation that seemed more interested in technology than literature, but it hadn't seemed to register.\n\nAs he sifted through the papers, he felt a familiar sense of frustration creeping in. It was a feeling he'd grown all too accustomed to since his wife passed away – a nagging sense that he wasn't doing enough, that he was failing somehow.\n\nHis eyes landed on a particular student's test results, and his gut twisted with anxiety.

He knew he could never do enough, no matter how hard he worked. Every effort felt futile, every mistake a failure. He felt like he was drowning in a sea of incompetence, unable to swim against the tide of disappointment. The principal's words echoed in his mind: \"You're not doing enough.\" He couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing, that he was losing the battle against time. The pressure built, and he found himself trapped between two extremes - either he submitted the plans immediately and risked disaster, or he waited and hoped for the best, knowing that even then, failure would still be possible. At this point, he was starting to feel hopeless. If he failed now, there would be no second chance. Instead of focusing on improvement, he was consumed by the fear of being seen as inadequate. Every mistake felt like a betrayal, and he wondered if he was truly cut out for this job."
