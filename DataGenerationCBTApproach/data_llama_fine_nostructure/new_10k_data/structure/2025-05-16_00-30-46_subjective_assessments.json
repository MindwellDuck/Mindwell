His eyes wandered to a shelf where he had carefully placed a stack of old photographs – pictures of their children, taken on family vacations over the years. As he gently ran his fingers over the faded edges, memories long buried began to resurface.\n\nA faint smell of fresh-cut grass wafted through the air, transporting him back to summer afternoons spent playing catch with his kids in the backyard. He remembered the way his wife used to laugh at the sight of his clumsy throws, her eyes sparkling with amusement. The ache in his chest intensified as he recalled the countless times she'd patiently helped the kids with their homework, always finding time to offer words of encouragement and support.\n\nHis gaze drifted to a small notebook hidden among the boxes. It was filled with notes he'd written to himself during those difficult months after their divorce – promises he never kept, things he wished he could say but never mustered the courage. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he realized how little he'd done to be there for his family during that tumultuous period.<|eot_id|>",

They're just reminders of what he lost - the laughter, the smiles, the moments they shared together. Everything he holds dear is right here, but does it really bring him comfort? And then there are the notebooks. Full of promises he made to himself, full of things he promised himself he would change. But did he? Really? Was he ever going to make those changes? Or was it all just another lie? He can't even begin to count how many times he broke his own promises. Every single one of them. So why bother holding onto these things? It's just going to hurt more in the end. I'm not going to let my feelings get the better of me anymore. No matter how hard it gets, no matter how much it hurts, I have to keep moving forward. Because if I don't, who will? And besides, he's doing better than he lets himself think. Sure, life isn't easy, but it's not as bad as he makes it out to be either.

He hesitated, wondering if he should answer it, but something compelled him to pick up. The voice on the other end was familiar, yet distant – a colleague from his residency days, now married with two kids.

It was from one of his former students, now off at college, with a handwritten note and a gift card to his favorite bookstore. A smile crept onto his face as he read the note, but it quickly faltered when he saw the accompanying photo.\n\nThe student had graduated top of their class, going on to attend a prestigious university.

I guess what bothered me most wasn’t that he didn’t celebrate his own success, but how he seemed to be ignoring everyone else’s achievements. His former students were graduating left and right, each one more successful than the last. And yet, he barely acknowledged their accomplishments, let alone shared in their joy. It felt like he was stuck in his own little world, oblivious to everything around him. When I asked if he wanted to take a group photo, he hesitated, saying, “No, I’m good.” That didn’t sit well with me, especially since all the other teachers were excited to share their graduates’ successes with the whole staff. But he just sat there, fidgeting with his hands, like he was waiting for something to happen. It was like he was lost in thought, completely disconnected from everyone else. Even the photo opportunity fell flat, which made things awkward between us. In retrospect, I probably overreacted. Maybe I just wish we could’ve celebrated together, but I don’t know why I feel so upset about it now. Still, it feels like he deliberately avoided me, and that hurts. I keep thinking"
