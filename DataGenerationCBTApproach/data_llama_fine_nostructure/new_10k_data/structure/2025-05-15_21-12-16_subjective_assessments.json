But the woman wouldn't be placated, her anger boiling over into a snarl. She slammed her hand down on the counter, making the employee jump.\n\nJust as it seemed like the situation couldn't get any more tense, the woman reached into her purse and pulled out a crumpled receipt from last week's purchase – one she claimed had been incorrectly charged.

It’s clear that she genuinely believed she was being ripped off, despite the employee’s efforts to explain the policy clearly. This kind of behavior is so common, especially among people who already feel stressed or overwhelmed. They often lash out at anyone who represents authority or tries to tell them what to do—especially if they perceive those people as being against them. It's almost as if some folks can't handle the idea that they might be wrong, so they resort to aggressive tactics to make themselves feel better. And when you see someone like that, you can bet your ass they’re thinking things like, “If I’m right, then they owe me,” or “They don’t understand what I'm going through.” That's why this whole thing felt like a typical case of Mind Reading gone wrong. Sure, we all have moments where our emotions take over and we say things we later regret. But for some reason, these people always seem to think they’re getting away with saying some pretty personal stuff. Maybe it’s because they feel like no one else would ever admit to doing such a thing, so they figure they can just go ahead and say whatever comes to mind. Anyway, yeah, this whole situation reeks of Mind Reading. You’d think after dealing with this kind of crap, she'd learn to keep her mouth shut instead of just spewing whatever pops into her head"

But those memories were now tinged with regret, as she felt like she was failing him all over again.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed oppressive, punctuated only by the ticking of the clock on the wall. She felt a lump form in her throat as she thought about her own mortality, wondering if anyone would be there to take care of her when she was gone.

She might think about that sometimes, but it never affects her mood. She just keeps going, doing what needs to be done. And yet, there’s always this feeling of unease. Maybe it’s because she hasn’t talked to her daughter in months, or maybe it’s because she’s dealing with all these bills. Whatever it is, it makes her feel trapped. Like she can’t move forward because everything reminds her of the past. Even the good stuff—like remembering how her husband used to help her manage the finances—they’re all tainted by the bad feelings that come with it. She feels stuck between being grateful for the memories and worrying about the future. The more I look at her, the more I realize she’s struggling. But does she ever really accept anything positive? She’s so focused on what’s coming next, she barely acknowledges the present moment. When she thinks about her daughter, she gets frustrated instead of happy.

As we stepped inside, I noticed a few changes too - new curtains on the windows, a different vase on the coffee table, and a framed photo on the wall. It was just an old family picture, but there was something unsettling about it. We sat down at the kitchen table, and my dad started explaining.
