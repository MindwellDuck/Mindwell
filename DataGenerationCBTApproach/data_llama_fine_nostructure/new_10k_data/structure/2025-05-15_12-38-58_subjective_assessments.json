It was a typical Monday morning, but the grey sky seemed to match his mood perfectly. He'd been working non-stop since the previous Friday, chasing a tight deadline for a piece on the city's new transportation system.\n\nAs he turned back to his desk, he noticed the empty chair beside him – the one his wife always occupied when he came home from work, eager to hear about his day and share her own stories. But today, she wasn't there. A note on the kitchen table caught his eye: 'Out running errands. Back soon.'\n\nThe journalist's gaze drifted to the old photograph on his mantle, a faded picture of himself and his wife taken during their honeymoon. They were both younger then, full of life and laughter. Now, he couldn't remember the last time they'd had a proper conversation without the sound of the TV blaring in the background or the kids' arguing in the distance.\n\nA faint pang of sadness settled in the pit of his stomach as he mechanically began typing away on his computer, trying to shake off the feeling of emptiness that seemed to be growing with each passing day.<|eot_id|>",

She must have forgotten, he thought, trying to push aside the nagging sense of unease. Maybe she got stuck in traffic again? Or maybe she just didn’t want to talk right now? He tried to tell himself it didn’t matter; after all, she was busy with her own projects too. Still, the silence felt deafening. The clock on the wall read 3 PM, which meant she’d probably be back around dinner time. She always made sure to check in before leaving for the day. Unless... unless something really bad happened. His heart skipped a beat at the thought, and he quickly shook it off. What if she went out of town unexpectedly? That would explain everything. But what if it wasn’t just a coincidence? What if this was some kind of warning sign? Had he somehow pushed her away with his constant work schedule? Had he become so distant that she lost patience? The questions swirled in his head like a whirlpool, pulling him under. Why was it so hard for him to connect with others lately? Was he losing touch with reality? Had he become numb to the world around him? One thing was certain: he needed"

Now, the chairs are bare, and the silence feels like a heavy sauce that clings to everything.\n\nAs he begins to prep for tomorrow's service, his eyes wander to the old family photo album on the counter. He hadn't looked through it in months, but today, something about the dust motes dancing in the sunlight makes him pick it up. The familiar faces stare back – his children, now grown and moved away; his grandchildren, who would call him every week if they knew he was still here.\n\nA hand reaches out to adjust the oven dial, but he finds himself holding onto the counter instead. The heat from the stovetop seems to seep into his bones as he stands there, lost in memories of laughter and warmth.

I’m pretty sure they’ve forgotten all about the good times we had together—those countless Sundays spent roasting meat and baking pies. Who needs those memories when you can just throw a few ingredients together and hope for the best? And let’s be real, this old kitchen is nothing special anymore. I could cook anywhere. If I wanted to, I’d just order takeout or make some instant noodles. But no, I insist on wasting time over a stove because someone (myself) wants to pretend that this is important. Newsflash: it isn’t. There’s no use crying over spilled milk, right? My wife was always the one who cooked, so why bother trying now? She wouldn’t even notice the difference, anyway. You know what really gets under my skin? When people say things like “the house won’t feel like home without her.” Home?! Are you kidding me?

It’s crazy how some doctors think they know better than everyone else. They always seem to be rushing through their shifts, leaving their patients vulnerable to mistakes.
