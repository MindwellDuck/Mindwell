A fleeting expression of concentration crossed his face, followed by a hint of frustration – his lips compressing ever so slightly into a thin line. \n\nA faint whirring sound emanated from the computer, signaling the completion of his task. His gaze never wavered, yet his shoulders tensed ever so slightly, betraying a subtle tension beneath his relaxed posture.

Her body language screams indifference, like she'd rather be anywhere else. And don't even get me started on how she talks about him. \"He's always busy,\" she'll say, or \"He works so much.\" Always and forever. Like, what does that mean? That he's a bad husband? That he doesn't love me? When I try to talk to her, all I hear are empty phrases. \"You know I love you\" - no, I don't feel it. I've tried everything to make her feel loved again, but nothing seems to work. I've cooked meals, bought gifts, even changed jobs to spend more time with her, but still, there's no spark. Just a dull, hollow feeling. It's like my efforts are falling on deaf ears. Even the little things annoy me.

His manager had called him into her office earlier, but he hadn't thought much of it – another reprimand about something minor.

The sales associate rang up a different item at a higher price, which caught his attention. It wasn't the first time this happened; sometimes they'd sell a lower-priced item instead. The customer seemed understanding, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was doing something wrong.\n\nHis manager emerged from her office, observed the exchange, and quietly nodded to herself before turning back inside. He wondered if there was something specific she was looking for him to improve, but he had no idea what it could be.

She even joked that maybe it was because he was a bit jealous of everyone else’s success. But deep down, I think he just wanted to control everything and treat people poorly. Like my manager always does. I’m so angry that I can’t believe it all started over something as simple as forgetting to clean the display case. What kind of person does that? And why did my brother have to go and tell me this story now? Can’t he see I'm still grieving? This whole thing is making me feel like shit. I keep thinking about my late wife, how we used to listen to songs together. We’d play those same songs every day and laugh about them. Now they remind me of nothing but pain. I hate this stupid song playing everywhere. It makes me want to scream. Why can’t someone just give me one minute peace? I know I shouldn’t be so emotional, but damn, it hurts. I wish I could turn back time and make things right again. If only I could erase these feelings and start fresh. Maybe then I wouldn’t feel so alone.

The hospital corridors blurred together as he walked down the hallway, trying to shake off the feeling of inadequacy. Every step felt forced, every glance from a colleague a reminder of what he lacked.
