As he loaded the dishwasher, he couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't taking her responsibilities seriously enough. His mind began racing with thoughts of how this might affect their relationship. Was she really so careless about household chores? Didn't she understand that these tasks fell on both shoulders, not just hers? He wondered if she was trying to avoid helping out because she didn't want to spend time together, or if she simply thought he could handle everything by himself. His frustration grew as he put away the last dish, his anger simmering just below the surface. The silence between them seemed to stretch longer than usual, and he knew that the tension in the air was building. When she finally arrived home, he asked her if she had done the laundry, expecting a straightforward answer. But instead, she said, \"No, I'll get to it tonight,\" without even looking up from her phone. She then proceeded to tell me she has work today and will have time to take care of laundry later.

A young artist, probably half his age, caught up to him on the sidewalk, eyes shining with excitement as she described her latest show.\n\n'...and I got my first solo exhibition!' she beamed, barely pausing for breath. \n\nThe comparison stung, the ease with which this younger artist had achieved success a painful reminder of his own stalled career.

It wasn't just her words; it was the look in her eyes - a mixture of pity and disdain that seemed to say, \"You'll never amount to anything.\" Her very presence seemed to embody everything he felt he could never have: success, recognition, and validation. She embodied the very thing he knew he would always be denied - a sense of belonging. In her eyes, she saw me as a failure, a relic of a bygone era, no longer relevant in a world where art had evolved beyond his narrow scope. Every smile, every word, every glance seemed laced with a silent message: You're old news, you're done. She didn't realize how much her actions hurt, how much she was digging her own knife deeper into his already fragile psyche. Her carefree chatter, her laughter, and her unwavering optimism all served as a cruel reminder of what he lacked - the ability to see the world through fresh eyes, to find beauty in the modern world. Every moment with her was a harsh reminder of his stagnation, a constant barrage of memories that threatened to overwhelm him."

Her husband had surprised her with a beautiful bouquet, but now it seemed tacky compared to the elegant flowers adorning the younger woman's wrist.

They look like they were bought at Walmart.\" I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe she was having a bad day. But her words cut deep. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow inferior because I hadn't chosen something more elaborate. It wasn't until later, though, that I realized why I felt this way. She had seen my old picture from high school, where I wore a bright pink sundress. That moment sparked a wave of regret; I had been so naive back then, never realizing that fashion could be used against me. Now, whenever I put on those simple clothes, I feel like I'm living in a perpetual state of being overlooked. Every time I see someone else wearing something more extravagant, it makes me wonder if I'll ever be able to keep up. Maybe I should've invested in some new, trendy pieces, but by the time I thought about it, it was too late. And honestly, I don't know if it would've made a difference anyway.

He recalled walking down the aisle, her hand in his, the sun shining brightly overhead. The way she looked, radiant in her white dress, and how her smile lit up the entire room. Everything had seemed so clear-cut then, yet here he was, drowning in uncertainty again. What had happened? Why did things fall apart? A faint noise caught his attention. A student, probably new to the class, entered the room. She hesitated for a moment, looking around nervously, but then took a seat near the back. Her eyes darted toward him, and for a brief instant, they locked. Something in that glance made him pause. He wondered if she saw something he didn’t—something that hinted at hope. Maybe this wasn’t just another ordinary day after all. But the feeling quickly dissipated, replaced by a sense of dread. What if she stayed?

She hadn't expected to cry so hard that morning, or to wonder if she was going insane for feeling such pain after all these years. And she certainly hadn't expected to hear the knock at the door. Which is why she opened it to find him standing there, looking all serious and shit. I mean, I guess he was trying to be nice? Yeah, whatever. What's a little sympathy between friends, right?
