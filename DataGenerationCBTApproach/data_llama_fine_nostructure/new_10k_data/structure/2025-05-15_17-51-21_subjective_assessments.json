But as he gazed at the dull, muted colors, all he felt was emptiness.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang, shrill and insistent. He hesitated, wondering who could be visiting unannounced. With a heavy sigh, he wiped the sweat from his forehead and made his way to the front door.\n\nAs he opened it, he was hit with the warm scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the kitchen. His stomach growled in response, reminding him that it had been days since he'd cooked a proper meal. A young woman stood on his porch, a bright smile plastered on her face, holding out a plate of homemade goodies.\n\n\"Hi there! I brought over some fresh bread and jam,\" she said, her eyes sparkling with kindness. \"I saw your ad online for help with gardening and thought maybe you could use some company.\"\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about his art, his grief, and simply looked at her. She seemed so... happy. So carefree. The pang of jealousy caught him off guard, leaving him feeling unsettled and uncomfortable.<|eot_id|>",

We were happy, and I wish things could've gone differently. I miss him every day, and it feels cruel to even celebrate Valentine's Day now. But I know he wants us to move forward, to enjoy life again, and to remember all the good times we shared. It's hard, though - sometimes I forget how much I love him and how much he loves me back. I feel guilty because I keep thinking about what could've been if he were here. Even though I know he wouldn't want me to dwell on those thoughts, they keep coming back. I guess that's why I'm writing this now - to remind myself that even though he's no longer with me, he'll always be in my heart. I hope you're doing better than me.
