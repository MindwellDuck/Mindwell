A sense of injustice washed over him as he watched the nurse rush out of the room, nearly colliding with him.

Her frantic pace suggested she wasn't doing everything possible to help, leading him to wonder if she was just another underperforming member of the healthcare team. This incident brought back memories of similar situations where patients had died due to preventable mistakes made by nurses like her. It reinforced his belief that these people were more concerned with their own lives than providing proper care to their patients. As he gazed into the nurse's frazzled face, he couldn't help but think that she was just another example of how the medical system prioritized efficiency over patient safety. Her behavior was a perfect representation of how the healthcare industry focused solely on numbers rather than actual patient well-being. Nurses like her were often too busy with administrative tasks to give patients the attention they needed, making it easy for errors to occur. This realization only strengthened his conviction that the medical field had become too commercialized, putting profits above people's lives. It wasn't just the nurse's actions that sparked his frustration; the entire hospital environment seemed designed"
