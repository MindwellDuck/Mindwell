But then there were those times when he couldn’t even get the basics right. Like when he tried to explain how to use a new tool during the demo. Instead of showing enthusiasm for learning something new, he came across as arrogant, spouting jargon he claimed he “knew” but clearly didn’t understand himself. People would roll their eyes, and someone would quietly say, “Oh, look, he’s doing it again.” After that, the whole group started laughing whenever he spoke, and it felt like they were mocking him in front of everyone. It wasn’t until he finally admitted that he didn’t actually know how to use the tool that things began to shift. They started teasing him good-naturedly, calling him “the guy who doesn’t know anything,” which made him realize that maybe he was taking it too seriously.

He recalled the day she passed away, how the garden had been left untended since then, a constant reminder of his loneliness. The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling brought back the sense of emptiness, echoing the silence that had settled within him.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, he turned back to the house, his footsteps carrying him toward the kitchen, where he began making coffee, lost in thought as the aroma wafted through the air, stirring up more memories.<|eot_id|>",

It was an odd time for such a gesture, especially considering everything else going on. But he figured it couldn't hurt to try and lighten the mood. Maybe if he could make her laugh even once, even though it seemed impossible, he’d find a way to move forward. His gaze drifted across the space, taking in the worn couch, the bookshelf filled with books they'd never read, and the wall covered in photos of them together. It felt like he was drowning in the past, unable to escape its grip. Every step forward seemed to lead him backward, reliving memories he didn’t want to recall. Even the simple act of drinking whiskey had become a chore, a hollow attempt to fill the void that had taken over his life. ## Final Thoughts She sat on the couch, watching TV while I played video games.
