It's like he's stuck in some kind of rut, never able to get ahead. Even with all our support, he just keeps falling behind. And when he does finally manage to catch up, there's always something else - some new crisis, some unexpected complication. It's just so frustrating. We're constantly trying to help him, but every little mistake feels like a blow to what we've accomplished. I feel like we're wasting our time and energy, trying to hold back a tide that will eventually consume us anyway. I keep thinking about how far behind he is, how far off he'll ever be. Maybe it's better if we let go, let someone else take over who might actually have a chance."

Her words were music to his ears.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he thought about all the unfinished projects, the ideas left unexplored, the art that would never be created because she was no longer there to share it with.

Without her, your art isn't just incomplete—it's dead. You can't bring back the spark that made those early pieces so special.

Whether it’s work, his health, or just life in general, nothing ever goes right for him. At first, I tried to understand why he might be this way. Maybe it was because of how he grew up? Or maybe it was because he’s just wired that way? Whatever the reason, though, it’s clear that he struggles with emotional intimacy. Sometimes I wonder if he even knows how to connect with someone on a deeper level. Whenever I bring up personal topics or ask him questions about his feelings, he either avoids the conversation entirely or gives some vague answer that leaves me feeling confused.

What's worse is that he's blaming their happiness for his misery. \"Why can't I be like them?\" he must be thinking. \"They're all carefree and connected, while I'm stuck here by myself.\" It's not fair to expect everyone else to be happy when you're struggling with your emotions. But this guy isn't just being selfish; he's also delusional. By blaming others for his unhappiness, he's avoiding taking responsibility for his own life. Instead of focusing on what he could do differently, he's shifted the blame onto these innocent people. This behavior is unhealthy and unfair. Everyone deserves respect, especially those who are trying hard to make a difference. If this man can't handle his emotions, perhaps he should look inward instead of blaming others for his problems. However, he might feel more comfortable blaming others than confronting his own shortcomings. In reality, no one is responsible for his emotional state except himself. Yet, he continues to shift the blame onto others, including the young nurse who caught his eye. She wasn't even aware of him standing there, yet he feels hurt and disappointed. This guy needs to take ownership of his actions and emotions rather than relying on others to fix everything.
