The memories came flooding back as I looked at her file - the countless times I failed her, the mistakes that almost cost her life. Every time I saw her name, I felt like I was drowning in my own regret. It wasn't just one mistake; it was everything. Every decision, every action, every thought—each one a reminder that I wasn’t good enough. That I had let her down, and that I would never be able to make things right. But now, even that small victory feels hollow. Three years have passed, yet the pain remains. Emily is alive, but so am I, and I can never truly forgive myself for what happened.

The teacher forced a polite smile and asked after her family, but the conversation felt stilted. As they chatted, she couldn't help but notice how effortlessly this young woman was moving forward, laughing and joking with her peers, while she was still navigating the empty space beside her.\n\nA familiar pang of bitterness settled in the pit of her stomach as the teacher watched another group of students glance over at her, then quickly look away, sensing her discomfort.

I’m drowning in a sea of monotony, and no one seems to realize it. Not even myself does.
