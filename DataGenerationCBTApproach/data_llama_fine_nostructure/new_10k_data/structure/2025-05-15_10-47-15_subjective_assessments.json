What did I even do wrong? Dr. Lee got picked because he has more connections in the company. He has friends there and everyone likes him. He's charming and smooth-talking. He knows exactly what people want to hear. He's a yes-man. And I'm not. But why did they choose Dr. Lee over me? I worked so much harder than him. My data was better. My ideas were innovative. I put myself out there, while he stayed behind the scenes. How could they possibly prefer him over me? This isn't fair. This isn't right. They're all against me. Even Dr. Lee himself probably doesn't know what happened. Maybe he didn't see anything wrong with my presentation. Maybe he thought I was just nervous. Or maybe he's secretly working against me too. Why did this have to happen today? Of all days. When I needed this. Now my confidence is shattered, and I don't feel good enough to do my job anymore.

His eyes drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away the minutes until he could collect his things and leave. As he started to write on the blackboard, his mind wandered to the conversation he'd had with his ex-wife the night before.\n\nShe'd mentioned how she was seeing someone new, casually mentioning it like it was no big deal. He'd tried to brush it off, but the words still stung. He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach as he watched one of his students start to get into trouble.\n\nThe kid was loud, out of control, and completely unresponsive to authority. It was a behavior his own son used to exhibit when he was younger, and for a moment, he was transported back to those sleepless nights and endless arguments. The student's antics sparked something inside him, and he found himself biting back a growl as he struggled to regain his composure.\n\nAs the bell rang, signaling the end of the period, he let out a sigh and rubbed the weariness from his eyes. Another day, another dollar, but for now, all he wanted was to escape the pain and find some solace in the quiet of his car.<|eot_id|>",

She quickly looked away, but he noticed she was watching him again, her gaze lingering a fraction of a second longer than necessary. He shrugged it off as mere curiosity, but the sensation lingered, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.\n\nAs he turned to check the time, he caught a glimpse of his reflection in a nearby window and saw a stranger's face staring back – older, with sunken eyes and a gaunt expression.

The pages were filled with half-finished drawings, some of which he recognized as ideas they'd discussed but never brought to life together. A faint memory tickled the edge of his mind – a conversation about experimenting with a new technique, one that required a specific type of pigment she had ordered online.\n\nHe got up and rummaged through the dusty storage shelves, searching for the package. His hands trembled as he pulled out the box, its contents spilling onto the floor. Amidst the scattered tubes of paint, one tube caught his eye – the exact shade of blue she loved, the one they'd struggled to mix perfectly.<|eot_id|>",

One critic mentioned that she'd been experimenting with new techniques, pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms. The room fell silent, awaiting her response, but she remained seated, her eyes fixed on the canvas as if savoring every moment of their attention.\n\nA pang of resentment crept up his throat, accompanied by a nagging sense of inadequacy.

Maybe she's just trying to make herself look better than him, or perhaps she's embarrassed by his lack of recognition. That would explain why she wouldn't acknowledge him publicly. Alternatively, maybe she's genuinely proud of her work and wants everyone to see it. But what if she's just humbly acknowledging her love for nature? There could be many reasons behind her actions, but he's jumping to conclusions based on a single painting. It's likely that she has nothing against him; maybe she even feels sorry for him. This thought is comforting, but I shouldn't let myself get too comfortable. If I start feeling good about something, it probably means I'm making assumptions.
