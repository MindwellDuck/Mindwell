He was supposed to take her out for ice cream, but he'd been putting it off all week, too caught up in work and worrying about the upcoming hospital accreditation visit.\n\nA knock at the door broke his reverie. It was the mailman, delivering a package from the medical supply company. The doctor's heart sank as he saw the invoice inside – they were threatening to revoke their contract if payment wasn't made within the next two weeks.\n\nThe sound of the mailman's truck driving away seemed to echo through the house, and for a moment, the doctor felt a wave of panic wash over him. What if he lost his job? How would he pay for his daughter's birthday treats? And what if...what if...what if...the worst-case scenario unfolded?<|eot_id|>",

His wife had always said she loved him for who I am, but what does she know? She’s never worked in healthcare. She doesn’t understand what we go through every day. Plus, she’s always on my case about something - whether it’s me being late to pick her up from school or forgetting to call her during the day. Like, yeah, I know I’m not perfect, but come on!
