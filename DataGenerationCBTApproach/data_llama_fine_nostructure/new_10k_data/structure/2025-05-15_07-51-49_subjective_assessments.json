Her eyes, once bright and carefree, now seemed tired and red-rimmed from lack of sleep. She couldn't shake the memory of last night's argument with her sister, which still lingered like an open wound.\n\nHer mind began to wander as she rearranged the display of children's toys. Why had she let things fall apart with her ex-husband? What had she done wrong? The familiar feelings of guilt and regret swirled inside her, threatening to spill over onto her perfectly manicured nails.\n\nShe paused, her hand hovering above the stack of stuffed animals. For a moment, the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the beat of her racing thoughts. The store's background chatter receded, leaving only the echo of her own self-doubt. Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a text from her sister, reminding her of their dinner plans tonight. A knot formed in her stomach as she wondered how she'd face her sister, feeling so lost and uncertain about herself.<|eot_id|>",

The glossy photos showed pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters, but it was the accompanying quote from her partner – boasting about the \"sustainable\" practices and \"commitment to community development\" – that made her stomach twist into knots.\n\nAs she read on, she noticed the resort's location was actually built on top of a protected wildlife sanctuary, and the \"community development\" part was code for displacing local villagers to make way for the resort's staff quarters. A sinking feeling spread through her chest as she realized her partner had been quietly backing this project all along, without even discussing it with her.\n\nShe felt a wave of disgust wash over her, mixed with a growing sense of unease and betrayal.

When asked if he would take on more patients, he responds with, “Either I can’t handle it or I don’t care about my practice.” His answer doesn’t leave room for compromise – he’s either fully committed to taking on more cases or he’s completely against the idea. When discussing potential changes, he often says things like, “If you want me to work overtime, you need to pay me double.” This approach leaves little wiggle room for negotiation. It feels like he’s either willing to put in extra effort for more money or refuse to help altogether. In conversations with colleagues, Dr. Lee tends to focus on extremes rather than finding common ground. For instance, when discussing the workload, he might say, “If you think I’m overwhelmed now, imagine how much worse it gets if we add another hundred patients.” Alternatively, he could claim, “If we take on that many more patients, our reputation will suffer, and we’ll lose clients.” These statements create an ‘all-in’ mentality, where he’s either fully invested in expanding his practice or he’s entirely opposed to it. Dr. Lee’s attitude is reminiscent of someone who sees life as a binary choice: success or failure, perfectionism or burnout, dedication or abandonment. With him, there’s no middle ground – it’s either everything or nothing. If you’re on the right side of his decision, you win; if you’re on the wrong"
