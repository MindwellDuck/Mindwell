He had thought he'd left this part behind – the late nights, the endless checks, the weight of lives on his shoulders. But here he was, 15 years after starting as a young nurse, still doing it all.\n\nThe old man's words were innocent enough, but they stirred something deep within him.

Why did they need to know how much he owed? What right did they have to take from him when his own family needed help? He thought back to the conversation with the social worker, her tone condescending, telling him what he could expect.

She'd been the first to see potential in his work, the first to offer constructive feedback, and the first to display it proudly in their home.\n\nA pang of guilt crept up his throat as he thought about how much she'd supported him, and now she was gone. He remembered the countless times he'd put his art aside to care for her, to be there for her through the ups and downs of life. The weight of those sacrifices settled heavy in his chest.\n\nHis eyes drifted to a sketchbook on the nearby worktable, filled with ideas for new pieces – ones that would never see the light of day because they were too personal, too vulnerable. He hadn't created anything original since her passing, unable to find the inspiration or motivation to continue.\n\nThe silence in the studio felt oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of his favorite jazz album playing in the background.

Maybe if he stopped holding onto the past, maybe then he could move forward. But he can't help but wonder what she would think if she saw his latest attempts.
