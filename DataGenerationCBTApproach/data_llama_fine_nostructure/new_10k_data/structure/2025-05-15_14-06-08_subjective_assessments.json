He glanced over at the empty chair beside Rachel, wondering why no one else seemed to notice how uncomfortable the atmosphere was getting. Everyone else was chatting away like nothing was amiss, but he could feel the tension building inside him. It was starting to look like Rachel’s enthusiasm might be all anyone needed to convince them to invest in their project. If she could just sell herself a little better, she’d probably nail the pitch. But what if she didn’t? What if she came across too aggressive, or too boring, or just plain too weird?
