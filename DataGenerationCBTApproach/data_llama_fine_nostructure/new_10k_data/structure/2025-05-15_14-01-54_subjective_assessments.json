The hospital was swarming with patients, and the ER was backed up with emergency cases. Her partner, Alex, was supposed to be home from his shift by now, but the traffic had been a nightmare.\n\nJust then, the charge nurse called out her name. She rushed to the room of a patient who'd been admitted overnight, only to discover they needed a specific medication that wasn't available yet due to a supply chain issue. The doctor was breathing down her neck, demanding an update on the patient's condition.\n\nAs she frantically searched for a solution, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was Alex, calling to check in. But when he answered, he heard the chaos in the background – beeping machines, muffled conversations, and the sound of sirens outside. He immediately sensed something was wrong, and his voice grew concerned.\n\nShe tried to reassure him it was fine, but her words felt hollow. She couldn't shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed, the weight of responsibility bearing down on her shoulders. The stress crept in like a cold mist, seeping into every pore.<|eot_id|>",

But as he looked up at the student who had written the note – a bright-eyed kid who usually beamed with excitement – he saw only a smirk.\n\nSomething inside him shifted, and before he knew it, his hands were clenched into fists, and his mind was racing with all the times he'd been belittled or underestimated by others. His breathing quickened, and his vision began to narrow. The noise around him receded, leaving only the sound of his own ragged breathing.<|eot_id|>",

That look on her face—it was the same one he used to get from people he didn’t respect. People who thought they were better than him, who treated him like dirt because they were smarter, more talented, or simply because they could. He remembered all those times, all those moments where he felt belittled, marginalized, and ignored. And now, here he was, facing another version of that same disdain. What did they want? Were they trying to make him feel worse? To prove a point? Or was this just some cruel joke? He scanned the room, but everyone else was too caught up in their work to notice.
