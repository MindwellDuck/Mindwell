He didn’t answer, so I tried again, this time more softly. \"Is everything okay? Did you have a rough day?\" His silence made me feel like I was intruding on some private moment, like I was interrupting whatever thoughts he had going on inside his head. It wasn’t fair to expect him to open up right away when we’d been avoiding conversations about money for weeks. We both knew things were tight, but neither of us wanted to bring it up because it felt too personal, too emotional. So instead, I changed the subject, hoping to steer the conversation back to something lighter. “How was your day at work?” I asked, trying to distract him from the tension building in our little apartment. I figured maybe talking about something neutral would help him relax and get back to himself. But my attempt at distraction only seemed to push him further into his own world.

It wasn't until I overheard her mention something about \"new people\" and \"not knowing anything,\" however, that I realized how absurdly personal this was. She was clearly talking about herself, and I felt a surge of indignation—after all, we were both part of the same team. But why would she need to speak negatively about herself? Wasn't she supposed to be eager to prove herself? It was infuriating to think that someone could behave in such a manner without realizing the impact it might have on those around them. Even more frustrating was the fact that I couldn’t shake off the feeling that there must be some deeper issue at play. Perhaps this young woman was simply insecure, or maybe she was struggling with the pressure of meeting expectations.
