The doctor had delivered the news — a rare cancer had spread too far, and treatment options were limited. It seemed like everything was falling apart. She always put others before herself, never taking a break, even when she was ill. Her entire life had been about caring for others, never stopping to care for herself. Now, here she was, unable to care for anyone else, and no one cared enough to stop and ask how she was feeling. In that moment, I realized that we are not who we think we are. We are just masks hiding our true selves. Our lives are nothing more than a series of performances, where we act out roles that don’t necessarily represent who we truly are. This realization is both liberating and terrifying. When faced with uncertainty, people often turn to familiar patterns, clinging to what feels comfortable rather than exploring new possibilities. This can lead to stagnation and reinforce existing biases. Embracing change requires courage, patience, and an openness to learning from unexpected sources. By doing so, we may uncover fresh perspectives that challenge our assumptions and help us grow as individuals."
