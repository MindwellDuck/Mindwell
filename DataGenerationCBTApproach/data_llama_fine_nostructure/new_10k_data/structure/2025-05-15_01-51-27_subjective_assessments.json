She probably just wants to tell me about some stupid thing that happened today, like how she spilled coffee on her shirt again... Ugh! Why is she being so irresponsible? Doesn't she know how stressed I am about this?! How could she expect me to handle something like this right now?! What kind of mother-in-law is she anyway? She probably expects me to drop everything and go pick her up immediately! Like I'd just drop whatever I'm doing to help her because she needs a ride! Does she even consider that I might be busy? That I'm tired from work? That I'd rather spend time with my own family than rush around for her?! This is ridiculous! She probably thought I wouldn't notice, but does she really think I won't catch on? Why did she have to send that text in front of everyone?! She knows I hate working on Fridays!

A younger version of himself, beaming with pride alongside his wife, who had passed away five years ago.

She's gone, but he has her memory. My wife left me too soon, leaving me with nothing but regret. We were meant for something bigger, but I failed to make it happen. Now I'm stuck here, wasting time, while he basks in the glory of his achievement. It doesn’t help that he got to celebrate with his whole family - kids, parents, friends, all there to cheer him on. I don’t even get to see mine anymore. I look at the photo again, trying to remember what made him so happy that day. Was it really that simple? Did he get lucky? Maybe if I had been more ambitious, I wouldn’t still be living this miserable life. But no, instead, I chose to stay behind, watching as everything fell apart. And now I’m left with nothing but the memories of what could’ve been. Meanwhile, he gets to live his best life, free from the burdens that weigh me down.

Every day feels like a reminder of my failures, and I can’t shake the feeling that I don’t deserve anything better. My life is a constant struggle, filled with self-doubt and loneliness. Even when I try to focus on work, I find myself dwelling on past mistakes and missed opportunities. I can barely take care of myself anymore; I rely on medication just to keep going.

He hadn't even spoken to her after the trial. Why did he look so... cold? It didn't help that the prosecutor was being so condescending. Every time he spoke, he seemed to be saying, “You’re not good enough.” Like he could see right through her. And then there was the victim’s family—their anger and pain seemed to radiate towards her. They kept glancing at her, their faces twisted in disgust. One of them even turned away when she entered the room. As I sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were all against me. That I was somehow responsible for everything that happened. Maybe if I’d done things differently, none of this would’ve happened. But no matter how hard I tried to remember what really happened, my mind kept wandering back to the same memories: him, her, and the way they looked at me. My heart sank when I saw the witness list.

The nurse, likely half her age, was discussing the latest medication regimen with one of her colleagues when she glanced up and caught his gaze.\n\nFor a moment, their eyes locked, and he felt a surge of resentment wash over him. He thought back to the countless times he'd had to deal with uncooperative patients, only to have them die under his care. The weight of those failures still lingered, and now this young nurse seemed to embody everything he despised about the medical system – its inefficiencies, its reliance on technology, its disregard for tradition.\n\nAs the meeting adjourned, he made a point to linger near the nurse's station, pretending to review charts while actually watching her interact with her colleagues.

In his mind, she represented everything wrong with the healthcare system – the rapid advancements in technology, the emphasis on paperwork, and the lack of personal touch. To him, there were only two options: either she was incompetent and needed to be fired, or she was a brilliant replacement for his own team. Anything in between was impossible; she fell squarely into one category or the other. His thoughts swirled around the idea that if she wasn’t a complete failure, then perhaps she could teach him a thing or two about modern medicine. But deep down, he knew it wouldn’t work out – they were too different, like oil and water. He shook his head, clearing the cobwebs as he refocused on the task at hand.

She embodied all the things he hated about the system, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was just waiting for another mistake to happen.
