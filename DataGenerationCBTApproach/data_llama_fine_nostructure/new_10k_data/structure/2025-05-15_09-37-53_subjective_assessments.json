Her mind wandered to the countless hours she’d spent perfecting the piece, but it failed to consider the possibility that someone else might find value in it despite its flaws.

His response wasn’t a reflection of her abilities or character; it merely reflected his own tastes and priorities, which were entirely independent of her feelings.
