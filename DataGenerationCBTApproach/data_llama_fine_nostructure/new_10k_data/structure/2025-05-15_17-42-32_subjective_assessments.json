A group of young couples nearby turned to stare, and one of them couldn't help but giggle at the awkward moment. The barista handed him his coffee, her expression sympathetic but awkwardly friendly.

It's not just about losing my phone; it was like they were mocking me, making fun of my vulnerability. Even when I tried to leave quietly, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was being watched. It’s almost as if people are waiting for me to crack under the pressure, like they’re hoping I’ll make a scene so they can say they saw it happen. The way the barista looked at me—her expression was a mix of sympathy and embarrassment, but it felt more like she was judging me than genuinely caring. She didn’t even try to hide her discomfort, and I knew she was trying to be nice, but her awkwardness only made things worse. It wasn’t just a simple mistake; it felt like a deliberate attempt to humiliate me. Every glance, every snicker, every “oh wow” made me feel like I was failing some kind of test, like I needed to prove myself all over again. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to pass.

He remembered the countless times he'd seen similar behavior escalate into something more serious – and how it always seemed to start with a shrug from someone like these kids, who didn't care about the consequences.\n\nAs he turned to walk back inside, one of the teens glanced over, caught his eye, and gave him a smug grin before turning back to his friend.
