He hadn't even thought about it until now, and suddenly felt a pang of guilt for not having given her the time she deserved before she passed away.\n\nHis gaze drifted to the empty chair beside him, where she used to sit during breakfast, sharing stories and laughter as they sipped their coffee together. The silence was oppressive, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd been neglecting his own life, too caught up in work to find meaning in the moments that truly mattered.\n\nThe sound of the office around him – keyboards clacking, printers humming – seemed muffled, distant, as if he were still trapped in a dream, unable to wake up and face the reality of his situation.<|eot_id|>",

It feels like he’s always looking for something to make him feel better. He might be trying to convince himself that we’re still together somehow. It makes sense that he would focus on me instead of himself; after all, I’m the one who made our family strong. But why is he still holding onto this? Doesn’t he realize that I’m gone forever? If he were really working, wouldn’t he be typing faster than usual? And maybe he’s not even working today; perhaps he’s just sitting there, lost in thought.

He valued her attention to detail and the sense of calm she brought to their family.
