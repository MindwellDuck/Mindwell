But as she heard his calm, detached tone on the other end, her heart sank.\n\n'Can we talk later?' he asked, without elaboration.\n\nShe felt a lump form in her throat as she forced a weak smile onto her face. 'Of course,' she replied, trying to sound nonchalant.\n\nAs she hung up the phone, her eyes wandered to the photo of them on her desk. They were smiling, happy, carefree - everything they'd been pretending to be over the past few weeks. A faint scent of perfume wafted through the air, reminding her of the last time they'd spent an evening together.\n\nHer gaze drifted back to the papers in front of her, and her mind began to wander.

Is this just another stop on the road to divorce? If I thought she was being distant because she was stressed, why did she seem so much better when I called her yesterday? Did she really just forget about me, or is there something else going on? Is she even worth it if she can't commit to us? Maybe I should just accept that I'm not good enough for someone like her and move on. Either way, I have no choice but to keep moving forward.

She says she wants to see innovation, but all she sees are mistakes. Every time she finds something wrong, she turns it into an opportunity to tear me apart.
