He was certain he'd locked it before leaving for his shift at the mall. Shrugging it off as forgetfulness, he began to unpack his groceries.\n\nAs he reached for a jar of pasta sauce, he noticed the couch cushions were slightly rearranged. He could've sworn they'd been in their usual spot all day. A faint scent of cologne lingered in the air, but he didn't recognize it. It wasn't anything he'd worn recently.\n\nThe thoughts nagged at him as he went about making dinner. He checked the security cameras, but the feed showed nothing unusual. Still, the feeling persisted – someone had been in his apartment while he was out. He tried to shake it off, telling himself it was probably just his imagination playing tricks.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: 'You're being watched.'<|eot_id|>",

Maybe he's trying to read minds or something. But honestly, who would send such a vague message like that? It's probably just some prankster. You can't take things like that seriously. I mean, have you ever received a weird text like that? It just feels so...off. So much of this doesn't add up. And yet, he's still hanging on to this idea of someone watching him. What if he thinks he sees people outside his window? What if he believes he's being followed? It's ridiculous, isn't it? This whole situation has him questioning everything. His own sanity, even.

He remembered the way she'd smile when he presented it to her, the way she'd take a bite and close her eyes, savoring the flavors.\n\nAs he worked, he noticed a group of young couples walking by the restaurant, laughing and holding hands. One of them caught his eye - a girl, probably no more than twenty years old, with a bright smile and a sparkling ring on her finger. The chef felt a pang in his chest, a familiar ache that had become all too common since his wife passed away.\n\nJust then, one of his line cooks accidentally knocked over a container of sauce, spilling it all over the counter. The chef let out a low growl, frustration boiling over. He quickly grabbed a towel and began to clean up the mess, his movements stiff and jerky.\n\nAs he wiped down the counter, he caught a glimpse of himself in a reflective surface. His eyes looked tired, his face lined with worry lines. For a moment, he forgot where he was, forgot what he was doing.
