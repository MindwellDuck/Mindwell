As the lights dimmed and the music began, she felt a tap on her shoulder. Turning around, she saw one of her former nursing students now a prominent journalist, beaming at her with a microphone.\n\n\"Dr. Thompson,\" he said with a smile, \"your groundbreaking research on geriatric care has revolutionized our understanding of aging. Your work has inspired countless healthcare professionals worldwide.\"\n\nThe room erupted into applause as Dr. Thompson's face flushed red, her eyes darting toward Mr. Lee, who was watching with an amused expression. She felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her, wondering if anyone else had noticed how embarrassing it was to have her past achievements so publicly acknowledged. As the applause died down, Dr. Thompson forced a polite smile and shook hands with the student-turned-journalist, trying to play it cool but unable to shake off the feeling of being put on display.<|eot_id|>",

He recalled the words she spoke, the ones that cut deep: \"You're better off without me.\" Better off? Without her?\n\nThe artist's eyes drifted from the painting to the blank wall opposite, where he'd hung their favorite piece – a watercolor of their first date. He remembered the way she smiled when he presented it to her, the way it made them both laugh. Now, the painting seemed like a cruel reminder of what they'd lost.\n\nAs the silence in the room grew thicker, the artist's thoughts turned inward, and the pain crept back up, suffocating him. He took a step back, his hand instinctively reaching for the paint-splattered apron that now felt like a worn-out security blanket.

Maybe we should remind him that no one is perfect, and there are people who have it easier than him. It’s ironic that he mentions his ex-wife again, because she never managed a team or did half the things he does today. But instead of focusing on those achievements, he keeps dwelling on what he thought he could've done differently. That’s why I think he needs some perspective.

Everyone has their own struggles, but he really makes it look easy—like he hasn’t experienced any personal loss or pain.
