That's why she kept her phone on silent mode, just to avoid any potential arguments. After all, who needs honesty when you can just pretend everything is fine? The fact that she locked the store early meant she had plenty of time to think about how much she needed space. Her partner would be mad if he found out she was still upset over something so trivial. He might even ask her to come home right now, which would just make things worse. So maybe she felt better locking herself in her apartment, pretending it wasn't there at all. She didn't want to deal with his frustration, especially since he'd already said some pretty harsh things earlier. Why bother apologizing when she could just ignore him and wait for him to cool off? Besides, he never really listens anyway, so what was the point? It's probably safe to assume he knows she's upset about this, doesn't matter if she says anything. She'll just have to suffer in silence until he decides to talk to her again. After all, she knows he hates being ignored, but she also knows he loves her enough to wait for her to calm down.
