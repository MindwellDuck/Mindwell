Hadn't I been looking forward to it? I felt tears prick at the corners of my eyes, but I forced myself to stay strong. This was exactly why I shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

Wasn't everyone supposed to adjust to changes in their role after losing their partner? Did anyone else get the same treatment? It's also possible that the principal was being overly cautious, considering how much stress she must be under with all the school restructuring. Maybe she was just trying to make things easier for herself by giving me a gentle warning instead of a full-blown scolding. After all, she didn't say anything about me teaching the wrong material; she just mentioned the missing section on economic growth. In hindsight, maybe the principal is just trying to build me up to tackle bigger challenges later on. Maybe she wants me to focus on those new projects she's been pushing for.

It's almost as if he believes that life \"should\" follow a certain script, and he feels compelled to adhere to it, even when reality doesn't align.
