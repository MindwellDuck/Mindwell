As they pored over the details of a recent robbery, she noticed another officer, a younger woman, glance at her watch for what felt like the third time. The younger officer caught her eye again, this time holding it for a fraction of a second longer than necessary before looking away.\n\nA few minutes later, during the roll call, their sergeant mentioned that the department was considering implementing new performance metrics, which would include quarterly reviews of officers' cases. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she listened, her mind racing with the possibility of being judged or found wanting. The younger officer seemed to sense her tension, catching her gaze once more before quickly looking down, her expression apologetic but unreadable.<|eot_id|>",

The way she glanced at her watch suggested she was worried about missing an important meeting or appointment outside of work hours. It wasn't uncommon for her colleagues to have personal lives beyond the office, especially given their long hours and high-stress jobs. The fact that she noticed the gesture at all made her feel like there might be some underlying issue—perhaps she had missed a crucial detail or forgotten something important? But why else would someone look at their watch in such a repetitive manner? As she continued to wonder, she couldn't shake the feeling that the younger officer was trying to tell her something. Maybe she needed to adjust her approach or clarify some points from the previous day's training. Or perhaps the younger officer simply didn't want to be bothered with her questions about the case. Either way, it was clear that the young officer was thinking about her, even if she hadn't directly addressed her. That much was certain.
