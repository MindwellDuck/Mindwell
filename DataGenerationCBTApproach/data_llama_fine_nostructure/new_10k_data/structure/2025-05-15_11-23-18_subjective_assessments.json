A catalog from her late husband's favorite outdoor gear store landed face-up, its colorful pages filled with memories of their past adventures together. \n\nAs she flipped through the pages, a handwritten note slipped out – a reminder he had made months ago to order new camping equipment for their upcoming anniversary. She crumpled it between her fingers, the creases forming a map of her clenched fists.\n\nThe phone rang, breaking the silence. It was a telemarketer, offering discounts on hiking poles. The pitch seemed innocuous enough, but the caller's cheerful tone grated against her worn-out skin.<|eot_id|>",

She forced herself to breathe, but her eyes kept drifting back to the catalog, where his handwriting lingered, a tangible connection to the man who had once held her hand while planning those same trips. The telemarketer continued, undeterred by her silent refusal. She couldn't help but wonder if the woman knew her husband, if she understood what it meant to lose him. Was this sales pitch just another way to invade her space? As the call ended, she let go of the mug, letting it clatter onto the countertop, a loud declaration of her frustration."

A colleague, Rachel, walked by and casually mentioned that she had landed a research grant to study a similar topic. He felt a twinge of discomfort as he watched her confidently make notes on her phone, the sound of her satisfied laughter lingering in the air.\n\nAs he began to meticulously assemble the equipment, his mind wandered to the stack of unsubmitted papers on his desk and the looming deadline for his own grant proposal. The thought of possibly being overlooked for funding like everyone else in the department made him feel increasingly anxious. His eyes drifted to Rachel, who was now chatting with another colleague, their conversation effortlessly flowing as they exchanged ideas and laughter.

It makes sense that she would be more successful; after all, she’s so much more talented than me. I mean, have you seen how well she works? She gets everything done so easily, while I struggle to get anything off the ground. Why wouldn’t she land grants when she’s always pushing herself harder? That’s why she got one, it’s because she’s better than me. And if I’m not better than her, then what am I even doing here? It doesn’t make sense that Rachel could be so successful. If she were really as good as everyone says she is, then shouldn’t she be the first one to land a grant? But no, instead she just gets lucky every time. Meanwhile, I’m stuck struggling to get my own proposals accepted. This isn’t fair. Every time I see her, I know that she must be thinking about me. She probably thinks I’m just jealous of her success. How could anyone else achieve such great results without putting in the same amount of effort as her? If Rachel didn’t exist, I’d probably be the one landing grants and getting ahead in the field. Without her, I wouldn’t need to worry about being overshadowed. There’s no reason why Rachel has to succeed where I fail. Maybe she’s secretly sabotaging me, making it seem like she's the best so I look bad by comparison."

It arrived yesterday, detailing the sale of their home – the only place they'd raised their children, where memories lingered in every creaky floorboard. The weight of it settles heavy in her chest, making each breath feel like a struggle.\n\nThe doorbell rings, breaking the stillness, but she knows it won't be anyone to share this moment with.

This is why she can't seem to get over him - she hasn't allowed herself to fully grieve and move forward. It's affecting her entire life. This is ridiculous. She has every right to feel sad and miss him. Of course she misses him; she loved him. What's wrong with feeling sad? You can't just \"get over\" someone who hurt you that deeply. She needs time to heal, and if she tries to rush that process, she'll just end up hurting herself further. Maybe she needs therapy or support groups for people who are going through similar situations. It's not fair that she gets to live happily ever after while everyone else struggles. We're all still living in our pasts, trying to find closure. Why does she get to skip this step when we don't? She's not doing well. I hope she finds some way to cope with these feelings soon.

She wouldn’t talk about her job or anything she’d done during the day. She just seemed distant, like she was lost in her own little world. When he asked if everything was okay, she brushed it off with some vague nonsense about being busy. Busy?! With what? Work? School? They barely talked about those things anymore anyway. At least, not since she started working nights and sleeping through the mornings. So, yeah, busy wasn’t really an explanation. He thought back to the last time she’d come home late. She just walked in, dropped her purse on the couch, and started watching TV. No hello, no small talk, nothing. Just the TV blaring away. She never watched TV.
