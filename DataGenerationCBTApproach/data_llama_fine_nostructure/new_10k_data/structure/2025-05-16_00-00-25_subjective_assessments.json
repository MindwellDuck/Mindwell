A group of rowdy kids laughed and jeered at the struggling student, their mocking voices piercing through the air. The teacher he worked alongside, usually supportive, looked frazzled and helpless, unable to intervene.\n\nOne particularly obnoxious child, known for disrupting classes, caught his eye. He had been receiving warnings from administrators, but still managed to behave poorly. Today, however, he went too far – deliberately knocking over a chair, shouting at the student, and spitting on the floor.\n\nThe teacher tried to calm him down, but the boy's tantrum escalated. His face reddened with anger, and he began yelling obscenities at everyone in sight. The room fell silent, all eyes fixed on the chaotic scene unfolding before them.\n\nA parent arrived shortly after, demanding to know why her son wasn't being given more attention in class. She berated the teacher, claiming they were inadequate and incompetent. Her voice dripped with venom, and her accusations cut deep.\n\nAs the situation continued to deteriorate, he felt a familiar burning sensation rising up inside him. It was the same feeling he'd experienced countless times before, the same one that made his heart pound and his vision narrow. He knew it was coming, and he couldn't do anything to stop it.<|eot_id|>",

I try to stay patient, but it’s getting exhausting. I’ve lost count of how many times he’s caused problems. I just want to get through today without anything else happening. But it won’t work out that way. Something always goes wrong when he’s around. And now that he’s causing a scene, I have a bad feeling about what might happen next.

She hadn't pushed him, didn't want to make things worse. But now, as she chopped the onions, the smell of garlic and citrus filled the air, transporting her back to the countless dinners they'd shared together before he started working late shifts.\n\nTheir son, now eight years old, sat at the table, quietly playing with his phone, oblivious to the tension that had been building between them for weeks. His laughter carried through the room, but it only made her feel more isolated.\n\nAs she finished chopping the vegetables, she caught a glimpse of herself in the reflection of a shiny metal spoon. Her eyes were red-rimmed from lack of sleep, and her smile seemed forced, like a mask she wore every day. The realization hit her like a punch to the gut – she wasn't sure how much longer she could keep up this charade of happiness.<|eot_id|>",

That’s just ridiculous. People can be annoying sometimes, but we shouldn’t let them get under our skin. She’s probably just having a bad day. We all do. Yet, here she is, making a big deal out of something that wasn’t even a huge problem. Maybe if she took things less seriously, she wouldn’t be dealing with these kinds of situations all the time.

It didn't help that she kept looking around the room, avoiding eye contact, which made her seem even more agitated. Even the nurse looked annoyed, like she was tired of dealing with Dr. Thompson’s “problematic” behavior. Maybe the nurse was just mad because she’d spent hours cleaning up after the spill and was still waiting for the new stuff to arrive. Yeah, that must be it. But why did Dr. Thompson have to act so defensive? Did she really think she was the only one who got stressed during rounds? Didn’t the nurse have enough on her plate? And what’s with the admin hanging up? They’re probably just stressed too, especially since the whole thing is their fault anyway. I mean, they were the ones who ordered the equipment without checking if they actually had the staff to handle it properly.
