The sterile smell of disinfectant filled the air as he carefully examined each dish, searching for any signs of contamination.\n\nSuddenly, his gaze landed on one particularly small bubble forming within a culture sample. It was almost imperceptible, but something about it didn't feel right. He rubbed his eyes, thinking it was fatigue, but when he looked again, the bubble seemed larger.\n\nA shiver ran down his spine as he recalled the lab accident three years ago, where a similar bubble had ruptured, releasing a toxic compound that had forced him to evacuate the entire facility. His mind began to wander, replaying the sounds of panicked voices, the acrid smell of smoke, and the feeling of helplessness.\n\nThe bubble now seemed to be growing, its edges spreading like ripples on water. He took a step back, his heart racing, as his thoughts turned to his wife and their unborn child, wondering if he'd ever see them again if disaster struck. The air around him grew thick, heavy with the weight of uncertainty.<|eot_id|>",

We've been through this before, after all. But he's strong, and we'll get through it together. What if he wasn't paying attention to anything else? Maybe there's something wrong with the samples, and he doesn't even notice it. Or maybe he saw something that made him nervous, but he's trying to hide it from me. That would explain his distraction.
