His wife had left early, saying she was exhausted, but he knew better. She'd been distant all week, and tonight was no exception.\n\nAs he mechanically began to wash the plates, his mind wandered back to their conversation earlier that day. She'd mentioned her friend's birthday party, how they needed to make plans for it soon. He hadn't responded, too caught up in work. Now, as he scrubbed away at a particularly stubborn stain, he felt a pang of guilt.\n\nThe dishwasher beeped, signaling its cycle was complete. He loaded the clean dishes into it, his movements slow and deliberate. As the machine rumbled to life, he noticed a note on the counter – a reminder to pick up milk on the way home. He crumpled it in his fist, feeling a familiar sense of frustration and helplessness.\n\nThe doorbell rang, breaking the silence. It was one of the line cooks, asking about the special sauce recipe. He forced a smile, trying to shake off the feeling of being invisible.<|eot_id|>",

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. What kind of partner does he have? One who leaves him to do all the household chores while she goes out with friends? And now she's just gone to this stupid party, leaving him to deal with the mess alone? No wonder she's so busy lately – she's making time for her friends over him. And what's with the note? \"Pick up milk on your way home\"? How many times has he forgotten to do that? Does she really think he wouldn't notice? Shouldn't he have remembered to get the milk by now? Maybe he's just not important enough to remember. After all, shouldn't he be the one taking care of her instead of the other way around? Now the doorbell rings, and he's stuck dealing with some line cook asking about a sauce recipe. Like he hasn't got anything better to do than stand here and listen to them talk about food when he could be out picking up groceries. This is ridiculous. Shouldn't he be getting paid to stand here and let others handle the real work? The world is against him, and everyone"

As he walked over to offer words of encouragement, he noticed the worn-out cleats and the faded uniform.\n\nHis wife had mentioned earlier that they couldn't afford new equipment, but he hadn't thought much of it. He assumed someone would donate something or that it wasn't a big deal. Now, as he looked at his son, he felt a pang of guilt and wondered if he was doing enough to support his child's interests.\n\nAs he helped his son up from the ground, their neighbor, Mr. Johnson, approached them. \"Great job out there, young man,\" he said with a pat on the back. But what caught his attention was when Mr. Johnson glanced at his own son, who was sitting on the sidelines playing video games on a tablet. For a moment, he felt a twinge of jealousy and regret for not spending more quality time with his own son.\n\nThe sound of the umpire calling a timeout broke the silence, and his son looked up at him expectantly.

The sting of those rejections still lingered, making it hard for her to connect with others now.\n\nThe sound of clinking glasses and muffled congratulations drifted into her cubicle, a stark contrast to her isolated workspace.

But no, all I could think about was how much I hated being separated from him, especially since we'd already missed our connecting flight due to the delay.
