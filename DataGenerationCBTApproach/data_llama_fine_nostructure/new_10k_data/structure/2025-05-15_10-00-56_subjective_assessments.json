It was her partner, returning from a late-night work commitment. He handed her a cup of coffee and sat beside her, noticing her tense posture.\n\nThe morning light streaming through the window highlighted the faint smudge of tears on her cheek.

His concern was genuine, but his comment – \"I thought you were better than that\" – struck a nerve. The sting of humiliation lingered, refusing to be shaken off by the soothing warmth of his presence.<|eot_id|>",

But it had been three years since her own marriage imploded, three years since her husband's infidelity had cut through her like a knife.\n\nA police radio crackled to life behind her, dispatching her to a domestic dispute call at the local diner.

This whole thing is just another lie. It doesn't matter if she actually saw him - she's still just as bad. Just like everyone else, just like me.

My sister told me she saw him at the park, holding hands with some chick he's known since college. Apparently, he said they were just friends, but she didn't buy it. And now I'm starting to wonder if I ever really did either.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. It's probably for the best if we just broke up. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with the guilt of knowing she's moving on.
