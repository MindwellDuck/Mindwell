They're basically riding on my coattails, using my research to tell their own story. It's like they think they can just coast on my work without putting in half the effort. That's such an unfair comparison—she didn't have to deal with all the pressure I did while working on this piece. And let's be real, no one knows what goes into a good investigative report except those who actually write them. So why are we comparing our efforts? It doesn't feel fair to say she's doing less work than I am when you consider the scope of this project. We both covered similar topics recently, but hers was way easier since she already knew where to start. My article required digging deep into financial records, which took months of work.
