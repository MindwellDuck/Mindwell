A nurse's frantic voice echoed through the hallway as she rushed past, apologizing profusely for the mess. The doctor's eyes darted towards the patient's room, where her partner was sitting by their bedside, holding their hand.\n\nAs she watched, a young intern, probably fresh out of medical school, hesitantly approached the group. His eyes locked onto hers, and he cleared his throat to speak. \"I'm so sorry, Doctor... I didn't mean to interrupt. I was trying to find the medication log for patient three –\"\n\nThe words trailed off as the doctor's gaze fell upon the chart in her hand, and her eyes widened in horror.

Her mind flashed back to the countless times she'd made mistakes like this, the patients who'd suffered because of her carelessness.

Or worse, what if one of those meds is expired and he gives it to the wrong patient?! This isn’t the first time something like this has happened.

The same old fears and doubts were resurfacing, and this time, it felt like the weight of their entire relationship was crushing her.\n\nAs she scrolled through the project notes, one comment stood out: \"Unable to replicate results.\" Her heart sank, knowing that was exactly how her partner felt about their future together. She tried to shake off the feeling, but it only intensified when her colleague, Rachel, poked her head over and asked if everything was okay.\n\nFor a moment, Aisha hesitated before responding, \"Just dealing with some stuff at home.\" The words felt hollow even as she spoke them, and Rachel's concerned expression made Aisha feel like she was suffocating under the pressure of keeping up appearances.
