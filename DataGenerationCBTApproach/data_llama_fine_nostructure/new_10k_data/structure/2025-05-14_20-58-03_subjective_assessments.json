Her hands clenched into fists, the nails digging into her palms.\n\nHer husband looked up, sensing her tension, but didn't say anything. He knew better than to intervene when she was like this.

She kept poking around, asking questions about everything from work to personal stuff. It felt like she was searching for something specific, but I couldn't tell her what that was. I realized later that maybe she wasn't even looking for answers; maybe she just needed someone to listen. Sometimes, you don’t need solutions; you just need to know you’re not alone. If only I’d told her how much it hurt, how tired I was of feeling trapped between responsibilities and fears, maybe things would’ve been different. But instead, she kept pushing, like she thought I was hiding something from her. She didn’t understand that sometimes, people just want to wallow in their own misery without needing a rescue mission. It’s funny how easily we can get caught up in our own minds, isn’t it? We start to think we’re the center of everything, that everyone else is just waiting for us to figure out our problems.
