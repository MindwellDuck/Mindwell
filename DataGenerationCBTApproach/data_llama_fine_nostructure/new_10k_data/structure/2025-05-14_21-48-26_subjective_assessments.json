His ex-wife's new partner, someone he'd never met but somehow knew better than himself. They were moving forward, starting anew, while he was stuck here, alone, and still trying to pay off their combined debts.\n\nThe email mentioned a \"team dinner\" at the resort, where they'd all be expected to mingle and get to know each other better.

It’s funny how one small thing can trigger such a flood of emotions. A letter arrives, and suddenly I’m back in our cozy little apartment, feeling the warmth of her touch.
