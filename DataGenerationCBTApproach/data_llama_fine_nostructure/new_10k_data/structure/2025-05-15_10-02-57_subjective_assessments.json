The colors blended, merged, and swirled together in a mess of despair, a reflection of the chaos inside him.\n\nHis brush danced across the canvas, strokes wild and reckless as he tried to exorcise the demons haunting him. Memories of her laughter, her touch, her eyes – they all seeped into the painting, infecting it with a sickening sweetness that made his gut twist into knots.\n\nHe stepped back, surveying the monstrosity he'd created. It was a mess, just like his mind. Colors clashed, shapes twisted, and the overall effect was a jumbled mess that screamed 'I'M A MESS'.\n\nA sob ripped from his chest, and he let it rip, unashamed. He let the sound echo through the empty studio, letting it merge with the silence, creating an unholy union of pain and regret.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the bills piling up, about the art world that had moved on without him, about the loneliness that had become his constant companion.

You're already losing your grip on sanity; it's only a matter of time before things get out of hand. Your life is spiraling downward, and no one wants to tell you that. But I'm here to do just that. Your entire existence has been nothing more than a lie. Every step forward has been followed by two steps backward, each one further entangling you in the web of deception. You've built walls around yourself, convinced that they would keep everyone else out, but they've also trapped you, making it impossible to escape. Life is a cruel joke, and you're just another punchline waiting to be delivered. Every smile hides a scream, every laugh conceals a cry, and every victory is tainted with defeat. You've learned to adapt, to survive in a world where the rules are constantly changing, but deep down, you know that none of it matters.

We don't exactly have a great history, but she's always been friendly enough when we run into each other. But today, she looks... different. She's got this new haircut, and her eyes seem to hold this secret smile.\n\nAnyway, I try to play it cool, but inside I'm freaking out. They ask me for help finding some wine glasses, and I'm trying to focus on the task at hand, but my brain keeps wandering back to Rachel.

And I swear, they're feeding off each other's energy or something.

And I feel this pang in my chest, like I've been punched in the gut. How could she do that? Doesn't she remember how messed up our marriage was?\n\nThe couple starts asking if we can get married there someday, and I'm standing there, frozen, feeling like a total idiot. Because, yeah, that would be awesome. Me, Rachel, and some other guy getting married in the same place where we used to live... it's just too much to handle.\n\nI end up telling them no, that we don't really live there anymore, and quickly change the subject. As soon as they leave, I just lose it. I start yelling at Rachel, telling her that she has no right to bring me down like that. But she just stands there, smiling, saying sorry and whatever.\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is? The couple comes back, and they're still talking about getting married there.
