He'd mentioned his coworker, Rachel, who had been flirting shamelessly at their department's annual dinner party last week. The way he described it - Rachel's overly familiar tone, the lingering touches on his arm - made her skin crawl.\n\nAs she passed by the break room, she caught a glimpse of Rachel chatting with one of their colleagues, laughing loudly and playfully touching his shoulder. A spark of disgust ignited within her, and she felt her jaw tighten. She quickened her pace, her eyes fixed on the floor, avoiding eye contact with anyone around her. Her hand instinctively went to the badge on her belt, a habitual gesture she'd developed during training sessions, but now felt like a reminder of the unease simmering beneath her surface.<|eot_id|>",

She set down the cup of coffee she'd brought him and sat beside him, putting a gentle hand on his arm. \"What's going on?\" But before he could respond, the phone rang again – this time his news director on the line, asking where the rewritten piece was and when it would be ready.\n\nThe disappointment simmered just below the surface, threatening to boil over.<|eot_id|>",

It was clear that he was struggling to keep it together. His body language betrayed his inner turmoil, revealing a depth of emotion that he struggled to contain. Despite the façade of composure, it was evident that he was barely holding back. There was an overwhelming sense of desperation emanating from him, as if he was fighting to find some semblance of peace amidst the chaos in his head.

He needs to learn to take responsibility for his actions instead of just shoving everything onto others. This isn’t just about him; it’s about all of us, and he's putting us in an awkward position. Not to mention, I still haven’t heard from my friend about our plans. I guess I’ll just have to wait until after this ordeal is over before reaching out.
