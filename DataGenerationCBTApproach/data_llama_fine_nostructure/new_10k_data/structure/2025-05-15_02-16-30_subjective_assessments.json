A young mother approached, her toddler clinging to her leg, and began searching for a birthday gift. As she wandered through the aisles, he noticed the desperation in her eyes – the worn expression, the frayed edges of her sleeves.\n\nShe stopped in front of a display of children's toys, running her fingers over the plastic figures, but her gaze drifted away, uninterested. He watched as she pulled out her phone, scrolling through a list of messages, her brow furrowed in worry. She muttered something under her breath, and the child looked up at her, sensing unease.\n\nThe mother's eyes met his, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a silent understanding – two people drowning in their own struggles, struggling to keep afloat amidst the chaos of everyday life. The mother's eyes dropped back to the floor, and she turned to leave, leaving behind the faint scent of desperation and the echoes of unspoken fears.<|eot_id|>",

It takes a few isolated incidents (a bad surgery, a death, and numerous misdiagnoses) and generalizes them, implying that doctors who fail to keep up with medical advancements are always causing harm.
