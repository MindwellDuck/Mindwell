The bed was made, the blanket smoothed, but there was no sign of the frail elderly woman.\n\nThe supervisor's expression turned concerned, and she looked back at our nurse, expecting an update. Our nurse hesitated, feeling a twinge of anxiety and guilt. She had been the last one to interact with Mrs. Johnson before going home early the previous day, citing exhaustion.\n\nThe supervisor's gaze lingered on her, as if waiting for some explanation, and our nurse felt her face grow warm, her heart rate quicken. She fumbled with the clipboard, trying to stall, but the supervisor simply nodded and moved on to the next task, leaving our nurse feeling exposed and ashamed.<|eot_id|>",

The amount was more than double what he'd anticipated, and for a moment, his anger simmered just below the surface. He took another sip of coffee, his mind wandering back to the argument they'd had earlier that week.\n\nThe door to his office opened, and one of the nurses poked her head in, interrupting his reverie. \"Dr., I need you to review these test results ASAP.\" As she handed him the charts, her voice was bright and cheerful, oblivious to the storm brewing inside him.\n\nHe forced a smile and began to scan the papers, his fingers drumming a staccato beat on the counter as he tried to calm himself down.
