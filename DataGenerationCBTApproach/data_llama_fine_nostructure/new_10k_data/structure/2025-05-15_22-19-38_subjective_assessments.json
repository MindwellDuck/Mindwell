What if this guy hadn't been born with natural talent but instead worked hard to develop his skills? Maybe there was a way for him too, even if it meant starting over. But then, he remembered how frustrated he got every time Rachel suggested improvements. That frustration turned into anger, and he began to think about all the times she'd criticized him. It was like she wanted him to fail, to prove some point about him being less talented than her. That thought fueled his resentment. Why did she get to be the one who looked good while he struggled? She could just pick up a brush and create something beautiful, unlike him, who needed hours of practice to make decent art. But still, he kept thinking about the other artist—what if he followed his lead? If he did, would he finally succeed where she'd already succeeded?

The article explained how our minds can distort reality through various biases, but he didn’t expect to find himself relating so deeply to these concepts. One of the most striking examples he came across was the Overgeneralization distortion. It described how people tend to exaggerate minor setbacks, turning them into major disappointments. For instance, missing a deadline might lead someone to conclude they’re “not cut out” for their job, while a single mistake could turn into a belief that they’re “incompetent.” This pattern repeated itself throughout the blog post, echoing sentiments that resonated deeply within him. It struck him that many of the thoughts he’d experienced were actually manifestations of this distortion. When he worried about being late, the perceived failure would escalate into an overwhelming fear of inadequacy. Similarly, when he struggled to meet expectations, he became convinced that his entire career was at stake. The more he read, the more he saw parallels between these examples and his own life. The author highlighted the dangers of overgeneralizing, pointing out how it can lead to self-doubt and stagnation.
