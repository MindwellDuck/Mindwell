But as he began to write on the board, his mind kept drifting back to her – the way she used to smile at him, the way she'd always know how to make his kids laugh. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, one he thought he'd long since untangled.\n\nAs he started handing out the lesson plans, he noticed the new teacher standing by the door, observing the class with an air of superiority. Her eyes scanned the room, lingering on each student before moving on. A fleeting glance caught his eye, and he could have sworn she raised an eyebrow, implying he was somehow behind.\n\nSomething inside him snapped. The years of resentment, the feeling of being erased from his own life, all came flooding back. He watched as she effortlessly commanded the attention of his students, while he struggled to recall even the simplest lesson plan. His hands trembled as he tried to hand out the papers, his mind racing with memories of what he'd lost, what she'd taken from him.\n\nThe silence in the room grew thicker, heavy with unspoken tension. For a moment, no one moved, everyone waiting to see if he'd snap further, if the anger would consume him. Then, without a word, he turned and walked away, leaving the lesson unfinished, and the class staring after him in confusion.<|eot_id|>",

I remembered that day vividly – the way she'd smiled at me, the way my students adored her. But now, every smile seemed tainted, every laugh forced. She was there to humiliate him, to remind him of everything he'd lost. My mind was a jumble of memories – the time she'd been assigned to mentor him, the way she'd made fun of his jokes, the day she’d left for another school. It wasn’t just about the past; it was about the future. What if this teacher was the key to restoring his reputation? Or perhaps a warning sign? The students looked up from their work, sensing something was off. They glanced between me and the new teacher, their faces a mix of curiosity and concern. I forced myself to focus on the lesson, but my mind kept drifting back to her. She didn’t look like someone who took things lightly. I pictured her sitting at home, thinking about him, wondering what she could do to bring him down. I knew exactly what she wanted – to break me, to reduce me to nothing more than a shadow of my former self. Every glance she gave me was a challenge, daring me to show weakness. I could feel her watching me, studying my reactions, searching for any sign of vulnerability. My body tensed as I handed out the"

I mean, who wears the same shoes for months straight? But what really gets under my skin is that she did it in front of everyone else too. I could see her smirking at me, and it was like she wanted everyone to know that she had something to say about my looks. She even said I looked like I’d just rolled out of bed! Can you imagine? Like, what if someone actually saw me like that? Would they think I was lazy? It feels like no matter how much I try to prove myself, people still find ways to make me feel inferior.

It's not that hard to see how one side of the spectrum is better than the other; some people have natural talent, while others are simply too apathetic to put in the effort. If you can't choose between being a visionary or a hack, why even try? There’s no room for nuance when it comes to artistic ability. You’re either a mastermind or a quack, never anything in between. Some people genuinely possess skill, while others lack drive and dedication. It’s clear which ones belong in the spotlight – those with real talent shine bright, while the uninspired are left in the shadows. Why bother trying to find someone somewhere in the middle? Just accept that if you don’t have raw talent, you’ll always be inferior to those born with it. People tend to think they are either good at something or bad at it. This means there is no room for improvement and no learning curve. We often perceive ourselves as either naturally gifted or completely incapable of achieving something. The idea of gradual development is seen as impossible, leading us to conclude that we are either born talented or born unskilled. This binary thinking causes us to overlook our potential for growth and neglect the importance of practice and persistence. Instead of acknowledging that skills can be developed over time, we settle for fixed mindsets, limiting our"
