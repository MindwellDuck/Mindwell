The soft hum of conversation and clinking dishes filled the air, but she barely registered it. Her gaze landed on a photo on the break room counter – a picture of her late husband, taken on their anniversary five years ago.\n\nHer hand tightened around the coffee mug as she approached the counter, her feet moving mechanically towards the table where she'd left her bag. As she reached for her purse, her fingers brushed against the small locket he used to wear, now resting in its place beside the photo. A faint scent of his cologne lingered, transporting her back to those moments they shared.\n\nFor a moment, she forgot about the long hours, the endless patients, and the weight of her responsibilities. All she could see was him, standing beside her, smiling. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she forced herself to take a deep breath, trying to shake off the familiar ache within. But it was too late; the sound of gentle chatter and clinking cups seemed to fade away, replaced by an oppressive silence.<|eot_id|>",
