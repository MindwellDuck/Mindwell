He recalls the way she'd always sit across from him, her eyes scanning the menu as if searching for something more substantial than the food.\n\nThe sound of sizzling meat on the stovetop breaks his reverie, but he's lost in thought. His gaze drifts toward the empty chair at the head of the table, where their young daughter used to sit, giggling and making messes. A faint smile creeps onto his face, followed by a pang of sadness.\n\nThe chopping grows more aggressive, the blade slicing through the onion with increasing precision. The kitchen around him fades into the background as memories of what could've been wash over him, leaving only a dull ache in its wake.<|eot_id|>",

And don't even get me started on how he talks down to me in front of others. Like, every time I bring up an issue, he turns it around and says things like “you’re just being dramatic.” Or worse, he’ll laugh it off and tell me to stop being overly sensitive.

Even the smallest details seem monumental now, and I find myself fixating on those that could make or break my future. In this state, nothing seems straightforward anymore. The lines between right and wrong, success and failure, have blurred beyond recognition. I feel trapped by my own uncertainty, unable to escape its grip. Each breath becomes a challenge, as if the air itself has grown thick with anxiety. My hands shake ever so slightly, and my vision blurs for a fleeting instant, as if my body is mirroring the turmoil brewing inside.
