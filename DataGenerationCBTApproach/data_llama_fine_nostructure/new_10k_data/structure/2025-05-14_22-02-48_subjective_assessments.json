The kitchen was quiet, except for the occasional sizzle of meat in the oven. His mind wandered back to her birthday dinner five years ago, when she had surprised him with a new recipe. He remembered the way the flavors danced on his tongue, the way they made him feel seen.\n\nAs he minced the garlic, his hand knocked against the edge of the counter, sending a small pile of salt shattering to the floor. A faint smudge of white on the tile seemed to mock him. He felt a spark ignite in his chest, a flame that quickly grew into a roaring fire. He clenched his jaw, his knuckles whitening as he wrestled the rage back down. For a moment, it seemed like the entire kitchen would come crashing down around him. Then, with a heavy sigh, he continued chopping, the rhythmic motion a fragile barrier between him and the storm brewing inside.<|eot_id|>",

It had been three months since the divorce was finalized, but some days still felt like an eternity.\n\nAs he sifted through the stack of paperwork on his desk, a report from a routine traffic stop caught his eye. A young woman had been pulled over for speeding, and upon searching her vehicle, officers had found evidence of a stolen wallet belonging to a local businessman. The victim had reported it missing weeks ago, and the officer's gut told him this might be more than just a coincidence.\n\nA sense of unease crept up his spine as he read through the details of the case. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd seen something similar before, but his mind drew a blank. Hadn't they gone over this kind of situation in training? He rubbed his temples, trying to clear the fog from his thoughts.\n\nJust then, his phone rang, shrill and jarring. He hesitated for a moment before answering, knowing who it would be. His ex-wife's voice was laced with a mix of anger and sadness as she asked to speak to him about the case. He felt a knot form in his stomach as he listened, his mind racing with questions, none of which he dared to ask aloud.<|eot_id|>",

Meanwhile, we’re all over here trying to save lives and make a difference. What does she bring to the table? Nothing. Just a bunch of useless memories from decades ago.

A young nurse, no more than twenty-five, caught her eye as she expertly juggled multiple patients' charts while simultaneously fielding questions from a harried doctor. The nurse's infectious smile faltered for an instant as she struggled to keep up, and our doctor noticed the faintest hint of frustration etched across her face before it was quickly replaced with a bright, practiced smile.\n\nThe nurse glanced up, locking eyes with our doctor, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a connection – a sense of camaraderie born from understanding the weight of their profession. Then, the nurse's gaze drifted away, and she was swept back into the chaos of her shift, leaving our doctor feeling... alone once again.<|eot_id|>",

This nurse was clearly trying to make our doctor look bad, making her feel inadequate by comparison. It wasn’t about being competent; it was about her own insecurities, just like our protagonist’s. She assumed that everyone else saw things as they did, and that everything was somehow about them.
