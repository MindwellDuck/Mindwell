They were laughing and pointing at something on her phone. He felt a pang of unease as he wondered what she was looking at – was it him? Had she seen him arguing with her husband last night?\n\nAs Rachel walked away, her eyes flicked towards the stockroom where he was working. Their gazes met for a brief moment, and she quickly looked away, smiling innocently. But he caught a glimpse of something on her screen before she covered it – a text message from someone named 'J', followed by a few minutes later, another message from 'S'.\n\nHe felt his heart rate quicken as he imagined what those messages might say. Was she flirting with someone else? His mind began to spin with worst-case scenarios – was she planning to leave him for one of these people? The thought sent a wave of anxiety washing over him, making the fluorescent lights above seem to hum in sync with his racing heartbeat.<|eot_id|>",

As he worked, his mind kept replaying the conversation between her and their manager, Mike, near the coffee machine. She seemed happy and engaged, but he saw how she glanced back at him when they made eye contact. He started to wonder if she was secretly talking about him with Mike - maybe she was upset about something he did. It's hard to imagine anything good coming out of this situation. What if she really is leaving him for someone else? Or worse, what if she's just playing games with guys who are into her? His thoughts spiraled further down the rabbit hole, imagining all sorts of terrible things. What if she's texting some guy right now, telling him details about them working together? What if she wants to come home early today because she's already spent time with someone else? These thoughts left him feeling anxious and uneasy, making it harder to focus on work. He tried to push them aside, but they lingered in the back of his mind, making it difficult to enjoy his lunch break. At least I'm not the reason she's having trouble sleeping again, right? That would be too much to handle. And if she does end up leaving him, there's always hope he can find someone new - maybe someone who will love me more than she ever has. But still, the possibility of being replaced by someone else keeps haunting"

It’s possible that she could have been more proactive in offering to cook for her friends and family if she didn’t have so many other responsibilities. However, this hasn’t stopped her from labeling herself as an unhelpful person. Instead of focusing on how she can improve, she’s choosing to blame herself for being an uncooker. This mindset might lead her to avoid helping others in the future because she feels unworthy of assistance. By doing so, she'll continue to reinforce her negative self-image, making it harder to change in the long run.
