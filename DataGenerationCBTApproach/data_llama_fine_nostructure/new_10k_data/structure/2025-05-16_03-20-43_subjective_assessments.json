My husband was more than just a partner; he was my inspiration, my confidant, my everything. And now, he's gone. I keep trying to fill the void, but nothing seems to work. Even this stupid critique doesn't help. I don't know what to say or do anymore. I feel so lost, like I'm stuck in some kind of dark loop. Every time I look at my paintings, I see his memory, and it hurts too much. He was always my rock, the one who made me feel seen and heard. Without him, everything feels dull and empty. But maybe I need to take another look at those colors, try to recapture something of what we shared. Maybe it'll give me a spark of hope. Or maybe I'm just holding on too tightly. Either way, I'm stuck in this cycle of sadness, unable to move forward. I wish he were here to tell me it would be okay. To remind me that life goes on, even if it doesn't feel like it right now."

His mind went dry, and all he could manage was a faint mumble about needing time to consider it.

Now, as he scrolled through the message, his mind reeled with questions: Why did they offer him this second chance? What had changed between the initial invitation and the new proposal? His gaze drifted toward the team leader, sitting across from him, her expression unreadable. She seemed to be waiting for something, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on what. Maybe it wasn’t just a question of waiting—it was like she was trying to understand him, to see inside his head and grasp the turmoil brewing within. Yet, despite the intensity of her gaze, there was a subtle detachment, as if she was studying a puzzle piece that didn’t fit. Her voice was calm, measured, but beneath the surface, he sensed a depth of emotion he struggled to define. It wasn’t anger or frustration; it wasn’t even disappointment—though there was certainly that. No, this was something else entirely—a quiet resignation, a gentle acknowledgment of something he couldn’t quite articulate himself.
