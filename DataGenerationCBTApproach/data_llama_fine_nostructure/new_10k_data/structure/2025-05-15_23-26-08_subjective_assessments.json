It’s exhausting just thinking about it. I hope things settle down soon, but until then, I’ll be counting every minute until I can go home. **[End Response]** Note: This response reflects the distorted thought process of someone who tends to focus on negative aspects of their situation while minimizing or ignoring the positive aspects. They seem to have an intense aversion to change and frustration, which leads them to believe that things are going to fall apart completely. This results in a very pessimistic outlook, where they feel overwhelmed and stressed, despite having received feedback on how to improve their performance. They also tend to generalize and catastrophize, assuming that many other problems will arise, leading to feelings of burnout and exhaustion. Additionally, they may have difficulty acknowledging the value of positive feedback, such as the praise they received from their boss. Instead, they might dismiss"
