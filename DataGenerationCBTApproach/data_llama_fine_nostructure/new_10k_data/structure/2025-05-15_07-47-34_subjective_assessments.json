He remembered her bright smile and infectious laugh during their initial conversations, but now she lay still and silent, her once-strong hands limp at her sides.\n\nAs he took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of helplessness, his mind began to wander to his own wife back home. She'd been struggling with anxiety lately, and the guilt of being away from her during this shift was suffocating.\n\nThe nurse's chart slipped from his fingers, fluttering to the floor as he turned away from the room, unable to bear the thought of continuing to watch the life slip out of this stranger's body.<|eot_id|>",

Her parents' desperate tears still lingered in his ears, echoing the desperation in her final words—“Please...help me.” But there were so many other things he needed to do. The long drive home would take forever, especially with his wife waiting. She’d always been the one to balance everything, managing our chaotic household while I worked late shifts. Now, I found myself lost in thought again, replaying our last conversation. She sounded worried, talking about how overwhelmed she was with school and work. It wasn't fair; I knew she struggled, but I also saw the joy in her eyes when we talked about our kids. And yet, here I was, stuck in the hospital, fighting a losing battle against time. He glanced around the room, taking in the familiar sights. The bed where he'd spent countless nights, the chairs where families shared stories, the white walls adorned with photos of patients’ lives—a reminder that every moment counted.

He hadn't worn it since her passing. The soft breeze carried the fragrance back to him, transporting him to their wedding day, when they'd exchanged vows beneath the same sun-drenched flowers now blooming in his garden.\n\nA gentle knock on the door broke the spell, but he didn't respond. It was just the mailman, delivering another bill or catalog, adding another reminder to his already cluttered inbox.
