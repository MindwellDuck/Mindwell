She recalled the countless hours she had put in, the sacrifices she had made, and the dedication she had shown to this project. How could someone so careless take advantage of her efforts?\n\nHer mind began to wander back to the day they had presented their findings together at the conference last year. He had smiled confidently as he accepted the award, while she had been forced to smile politely, feeling her own achievement diminished by his presence. Now, that smile seemed particularly condescending.\n\nWith trembling hands, she pushed the papers away from her and walked out of the lab, leaving behind the sterile world of science where she once felt at home.

The dim light from the hallway illuminated her age, and for a moment, he felt like he was seeing her for the first time – wrinkled, worn out, and unrecognizable from the vibrant woman he'd fallen in love with decades ago.\n\nAs he watched, a faint crease formed between her eyebrows, and her eyes seemed to hold a deep-seated worry. She caught him gazing and quickly turned away, busying herself with her makeup. He knew that look – the one that said she was trying to hide something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.\n\nThe thought of growing older together, of facing life's uncertainties side by side, filled him with an unsettling sense of vulnerability. What if they weren't prepared? What if they weren't strong enough?

He was seeing how much time had passed since he’d last held her hand, how many late-night conversations had gone unsaid, how many memories lay hidden beneath the surface. It was as if he was witnessing two different people: the man who had once been so full of hope, so convinced that they would grow old together, and the man who now stood before him, weathered by years of doubts and fears. The lines on her hands were etched deeper than he could have ever imagined, each one telling a story of trials overcome and moments missed. But instead of feeling a pang of nostalgia, he felt a creeping sense of dread. He wondered how long it had been since she’d truly seen him, how often she’d looked beyond the façade of their happy marriage. Had she noticed the way he avoided eye contact, the way his laughter sounded forced when he tried to fill the silences? Did she see the emptiness behind his smile, the desperation that fueled his attempts to keep up appearances? He felt lost in the labyrinth of his own mind, struggling to reconcile the man he used to be with the one he’d become. It was as if he was standing in front of a mirror, staring at reflections that no longer aligned. Every glance revealed another disconnect, another reminder that he was no longer the same person he once claimed to be."

The faint scent of disinfectant and the soft hum of equipment transported her back to the day her husband, also a scientist, had passed away. He had been working on this very project when he was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAs she gazed at the seemingly ordinary dishes, memories flooded her mind – late nights spent discussing research, laughter-filled moments of triumph, and tears shed over setbacks. A particular sample caught her attention; it was one they had worked on together, and their collaboration had led to a breakthrough.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to what could have been if he were still by her side. She replayed their conversations about retirement plans, travel, and building a life after their children moved out. The more she looked at the sample, the more she felt a pang of regret for the time they didn't have together.\n\nThe sound of footsteps broke the silence, and her colleague approached, asking for her input on the next stage of the experiment. For a moment, she hesitated, unsure if she wanted to participate, weighed down by the weight of past decisions and unspoken words.

Whenever she scrolled through social media, every post seemed to highlight someone else’s success, from promotions to career milestones to personal achievements. Even her own friends’ lives seemed to be moving forward, while hers felt stagnant. It made her wonder if she was even cut out for the world outside university.
