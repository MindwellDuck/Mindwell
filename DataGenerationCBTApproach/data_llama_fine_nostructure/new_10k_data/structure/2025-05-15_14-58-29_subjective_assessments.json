Her voice was low and controlled, but he could sense the venom beneath the surface. She complained about the recent homework assignments, claiming they were unfair and biased towards students who didn't have access to the same resources as others.\n\nAs she spoke, her eyes darted around the room, settling on a stack of files on his desk. He noticed one file had his name on it, but it wasn't from this semester – it was from his divorce proceedings. The date on the file was six months ago, when the court had granted custody of their child to her.\n\nThe parent's words began to cut through the quiet hum of the office, each phrase sharpening the edges of his anger. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, one he'd learned to recognize but couldn't always control. As he listened, the room seemed to shrink, leaving only the two of them, locked in a battle of wills.<|eot_id|>",

His mind went back to that day in court, when he'd signed away his right to see his daughter for years to come. It felt like a punch to the gut every time he saw her now, trapped in someone else's home with no way out. Every time he looked at her, he remembered the pain he'd caused by giving her up. The parent's words still lingered, echoing through his mind like a curse. \"You're not doing enough,\" she'd said. \"You're not making things easy for your own son.\" The truth hit him hard: if he ever tried to make things easier for himself, he'd be seen as weak, and he couldn't let that happen. So he pushed those feelings down, hiding behind a mask of professionalism, all while secretly seething with resentment. When he thought about his life, he imagined a narrow path, lined with obstacles and pitfalls. Every step forward required careful planning, every misstep a potential disaster waiting to unfold. That's why he kept everything under control, never letting anything slip—except maybe his true feelings. This was what being a good teacher meant: putting on a brave face, even when inside he was screaming. But deep down, he knew he was losing the battle. The weight of the world bore down on him, crushing him with its relentless pressure."

Even the principal looks happy, smiling as if nothing's wrong. It's so unfair! There must be something wrong with these kids - maybe they're sick or something. My stomach hurts from thinking about it. What if this teacher lets them walk home by themselves? Or worse, doesn't report it?! My husband keeps saying things like, \"He'll be fine,\" but I know better. These kids are going to get hurt. I'm worried about everything, including our own kids.
