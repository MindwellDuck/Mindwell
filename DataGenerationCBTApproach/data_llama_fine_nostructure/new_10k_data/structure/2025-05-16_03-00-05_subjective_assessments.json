She'd been having these thoughts all day – about how she'd handled the Smith case, about how she'd missed the warning signs.\n\nShe caught herself thinking about what John would say if he knew. How he'd lecture her on being too soft, on not pushing hard enough for the truth. They'd been together long enough that she knew his routine by heart – the way he'd take her hand, the way he'd look at her like she was the only thing that mattered.\n\nBut as she stood there, staring blankly at her closet, she felt like she was staring into the abyss. What had she done wrong? Was it something specific, or was it just her general approach?\n\nShe thought back to the conversation they'd had last night – the one where he'd brought up her work again. He said I'm worried about you getting burned out, that you're taking on too much. But she knew he wasn't really concerned; he was just mad because she hadn't gotten him that new watch he wanted.\n\nNow, as she looked around her empty apartment, she realized she'd forgotten to pick up flowers for their anniversary. And it wasn't just the flowers – it was everything. The dinner reservations, the weekend getaway... it was all just an afterthought.\n\nDr. Thompson took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of regret. She'd given John everything, and this was how he repaid her? By making her doubt herself? No, she told herself. It's just nerves, that's all. We've got our whole lives ahead of us.<|eot_id|>",

He was right, of course - I am burnt out, and I’ve been neglecting my own needs lately. But does he ever even try to understand? No, instead, he just attacks me, telling me I’m a terrible doctor and that I don’t care about anyone except myself. And then there’s the way he looks at me when he’s upset. His eyes narrow, and his voice drops to a menacing growl. He doesn’t even try to hide his disdain anymore. It’s like he wants me to feel bad, to make me hate myself. John's always been like that, but now it feels worse than ever. When he's angry, I feel like I'm drowning in his rage. It's like every time I see him, I'm trapped in a nightmare. Even when he's calm, I can sense the anger simmering beneath the surface. He thinks I'm some kind of idiot who can't handle responsibility. That I'm too selfish to care about patients.

I'm supposed to be a paragon of professionalism, not some bumbling fool making fools of myself in front of my peers.\n\nIt started when I tried to impress my colleagues with my knowledge of the latest medical breakthroughs. I launched into this elaborate speech about the implications of gene editing on our understanding of disease, using technical terms like \"CRISPR\" and \"molecular modeling.\" I was confident, I thought, until I noticed my wife standing across the room, sipping her glass of wine and trying not to laugh.\n\nBut then things took a turn for the worse. As I was wrapping up my speech, one of my younger colleagues, a resident who's always been a bit of a know-it-all, piped up with his own take on the subject. And let me tell you, he had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. But instead of calling him out on it, I felt compelled to defend him, to show off my expertise and make sure everyone knew that I was the real deal.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nAs we got into this heated discussion, my wife finally couldn't take it anymore and excused herself to go powder her nose. And that's when I did something completely embarrassing. In front of all those people, I stood up and loudly proclaimed, \"I'm the best doctor in this room, and if anyone has a problem with that, they can just step aside!\" Can you imagine? Me, a respected physician, acting like some kind of egomaniac.\n\nThe room fell silent, and I could feel my face burning with embarrassment. My wife walked back into the room, gave me a mortifying glance, and mouthed \"I'm so sorry\" before quickly taking her seat. I was mortified. We exchanged a look throughout the rest of the evening, and I could tell she was mortified too.\n\nWhy does this keep happening to me? I've worked hard to build my reputation as a top-notch doctor, but sometimes it feels like my ego gets the better of me. Ugh, I just want to crawl under a rock and disappear right now.<|eot_id|>",

I swear, every time I attend one, something goes wrong. Like last night, I was having a good time, laughing and joking around, until suddenly I realized I’d left my phone charger at home. So I had to spend the entire party standing by the bar, waiting for someone to bring me a charger from their car (which, of course, they never did). Meanwhile, my wife is sitting there looking beautiful and getting compliments left and right, while I’m stuck here wondering how I’ll even charge my phone tonight. This keeps happening because I always try to prove myself. I guess I feel like I need to show everyone that I’m more than just a pretty face – I have to be smart, funny, and capable too.
