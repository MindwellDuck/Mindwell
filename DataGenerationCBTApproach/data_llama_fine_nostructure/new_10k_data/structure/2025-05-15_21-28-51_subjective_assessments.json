Her mind flashed back to the countless hours they'd spent working together, the late nights and early mornings, the sacrifices they'd made. And now, it seemed, he'd betrayed everyone, including her.\n\nHer fingers clenched into fists as she felt a familiar anger rising inside her. She thought about all the times she'd been told she was too emotional, too sensitive, that she needed to toughen up. But she couldn't help it - she felt like she was being punched in the gut all over again, like someone was deliberately trying to hurt her.\n\nThe keyboard beneath her fingers began to shake as she typed out a scathing email to the editor, demanding more investigation into the allegations. But as she hit send, something inside her snapped. The chair behind her scraped against the floor as she slammed her fist down, making her jump. For a moment, she just sat there, her heart racing, her chest heaving.<|eot_id|>",

They're accusing my ex-husband's former business partner of embezzlement? That's insane! I know him personally; we worked together on multiple projects. He's always been so professional, always had his shit together. I don't understand why anyone would think otherwise. But then I started thinking... what if he really did steal money from our joint ventures? What if he used some of those funds to fund other shady businesses? It makes sense that they wouldn't find anything because he's so good at hiding his tracks. I mean, who doesn't have a secret stash somewhere? And another thing that's bothering me is that they didn't mention my husband's role in the whole thing. Are they even looking into that? Do they know he's been working with some shady people lately? I bet they don't care because he's not the one in trouble. But honestly, it makes me wonder if they're just trying to set us both up. Maybe they're doing it to make us look bad. This is so unfair. We were friends once, and now they're going after him like a dog with a bone. I feel like I need to stand up for him, but every time I try, I get these weird feelings inside—like I want to scream. Or maybe it's just my anxiety kicking in again. Anyway"

But now, as she looked around her cluttered office, she felt like she was just going through the motions. The excitement and romance had fizzled out, leaving only a dull sense of obligation.\n\nAs she typed out a few half-hearted sentences, her gaze drifted towards the framed photo on her desk – a picture of the two of them from their first date.
