He hadn't sent any flowers or called her family. \n\nAs he watched the conversation unfold, his mind began to wander to the same conversation he'd had with his wife six months ago – the one where they'd discussed taking a weekend trip together. She'd been so excited, but after she passed away, he'd struggled to make even small plans. Now, the idea felt like a hollow reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nThe coworker glanced over, noticing his expression, and quickly changed the subject.
