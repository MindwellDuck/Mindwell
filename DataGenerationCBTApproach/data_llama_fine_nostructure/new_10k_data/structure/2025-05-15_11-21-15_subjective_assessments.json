She picked it up, expecting another call from the chief about the ongoing investigation. Instead, it was her husband, his voice tight with concern.\n\n\"Hey, I've been trying to reach you all day. Is everything okay?\" he asked, his words laced with a subtle tension that made her gut twist.\n\nFor a moment, she hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The weight of her guilt and frustration threatened to spill over, but she took a deep breath and forced herself to sound calm.\n\n\"Yeah, everything's fine,\" she said finally, the word feeling like a lie on her lips.\n\nHer husband sighed softly on the other end of the line, and she knew he wasn't buying it. But before he could press the issue further, their young daughter chimed in from the next room, asking her mom to help with her math homework. The sudden interruption broke the tension, but the seeds of misery had already been sown.<|eot_id|>",

He remembered how she used to say he was the best gardener she knew, but after she passed, even the thought of tending to the plants seemed pointless.\n\nThe coffee cup sat untouched beside him, the warmth spreading through his hands now nothing more than a reminder of the cold emptiness within.

She had said something about needing time to heal, but he couldn't shake the feeling that she was running away from him. He wondered if the distance between them would ever grow smaller, or if he'd forever be left standing outside the door, wondering if there was a chance to turn things around.
