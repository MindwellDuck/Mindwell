His wife had been gone for three years now, but some days still felt like yesterday. He remembered the way she used to stand beside him, helping with the dishes after breakfast. Now, it was just him.\n\nAs he rinsed the final plate, he noticed a faint scent of her perfume lingering in the air. It wasn't hers anymore, of course – she'd given it away years ago – but somehow, the smell brought back memories of their wedding day, when they'd first met. He recalled how proud he'd been, standing beside her in front of their friends and family.\n\nThe water turned cold, and he quickly turned off the faucet. His eyes stung, and for a moment, he couldn't breathe. The memory of that day came flooding back, and he felt the familiar weight of shame settle in his chest. Not for anything he'd done wrong, exactly – more for being so utterly, completely in love with someone who was long gone.<|eot_id|>",

The dishes, once a mundane task, now seemed to mock him, their silence a reminder that life went on even as his heart remained stuck in the past. Three years had passed since she left, but the ache within him hadn’t dulled—a constant, gnawing echo of what could never be again. Her presence lingered, not just in the faint scent of her perfume, but in every memory he thought he’d buried. She had been his rock, the one person who made him feel whole. Without her, everything felt hollow—like trying to hold water in his hands, the harder he squeezed, the more it slipped through his fingers. In the end, it wasn’t what he did that broke us; it was simply too much time apart. I remember the day she told me she needed space, how I held her close, begging her not to leave. But deep down, I knew she wouldn’t stay. She always talked about wanting kids, building a home. We were supposed to start a family, but then she vanished. I tried to fill the void with work, but nothing filled the emptiness inside me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d lost myself, that I was just going through the motions. The water was cold now, and I turned it off, but the chill spread throughout my body, leaving me numb. The dishes didn’t need washing anymore; all"

Her eyes landed on a small, silver watch – one she had purchased for him on their 25th wedding anniversary, but never given to him.

It was nestled between two pairs of worn-out socks, almost hidden from view.

She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she replied, 'I'm just struggling to find the right inspiration.'\n\nHe paused beside her, running a hand through his hair. 'Maybe you're just overthinking it. Sometimes, less is more.' His words were laced with a subtle condescension, making her feel like a child who couldn't be trusted to make creative decisions.\n\nAs she watched him walk out of the room, the weight of her helplessness settled heavy on her shoulders.

It takes time, patience, and dedication. However, she seems to think that I can magically conjure up masterpieces whenever I want. This mindset makes me feel frustrated because I know that I am constantly trying to improve and push myself to new heights. My husband never tries to understand why I struggle with certain pieces. He says things like \"just try harder\" or \"you need to get your mind off other things.\" But what if those suggestions aren't helpful? What if they’re even damaging? Sometimes when we argue about this, I start thinking about all the times she’s belittled me or criticized my work. Every time she does this, I become convinced that she thinks I’m useless. That I don’t deserve to be an artist. My frustration builds up until I lash out, saying something like, “You’ll never understand what it’s like to create something beautiful!” But then, I realize that maybe she’s just trying to protect herself from getting hurt again. Maybe she fears that I won’t succeed as an artist and will end up failing, which would mean she wasted her money on my classes. However, every time I think about this possibility, I feel like I’m betraying our marriage. Like I’m somehow letting her down by focusing on my own insecurities. So"

He wished he could be there for them, but instead, he was stuck working late nights, missing important milestones and memories. As he looked around the messy living room, cluttered with toys and half-finished projects, he felt overwhelmed. The tension between them had been building, and he knew something would snap soon.

Her husband, Alex, had been working late again – tonight was the fifth time this week. The tension between them was palpable, and she could feel her anger simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nAs she began to block out the shapes of the buildings, her mind wandered back to their argument from last night. He'd made some thoughtless comment about her art, saying it wasn't \"stable\" enough for someone of his income. She remembered the way he'd smiled condescendingly at her, thinking he could get under her skin.\n\nHer brushstroke grew more aggressive, the colors bleeding together in a swirl of frustration. She felt herself becoming lost in the moment, letting go of all reason and restraint. As she stepped back to survey her work, she noticed a small package waiting for her on the counter – a gift from Alex, no doubt, meant to placate her after another long day.\n\nBut as she picked up the box, her fingers brushed against something else – a note, scribbled hastily on a piece of paper. It read: \"I'll be home soon.\" The words seemed to sear themselves into her skin, and for a moment, she felt a cold, hard knot form in her stomach.<|eot_id|>",

From the moment she sat down across from her, Sarah seemed... off. There was a nervous energy surrounding her, like she was holding onto something tightly but couldn't quite put her finger on it. It was almost as if she knew something was coming, even if she hadn't yet realized what. As we delved deeper into the reading, Sarah started to open up, sharing her fears and worries about her upcoming wedding. She spoke of the pressure to have perfect children, the stress of managing a household, and the weight of responsibility that came with being a wife. With each passing minute, Sarah's anxiety grew, until it seemed like she might actually burst. It wasn't until I mentioned Alex that the penny finally dropped. \"He doesn't know what he wants,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"We've never talked about our expectations.\" And then it hit me - the realization that Alex wouldn't show up.
