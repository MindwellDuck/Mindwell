Her eyes wandered to the old photograph on her worktable – a picture of herself and her late husband, taken on their honeymoon. He was smiling, his arm casually draped over hers, as they gazed out at a breathtaking sunset.\n\nA woman walked into the studio, clipboard in hand, introducing herself as the new art curator from the local gallery. As she began to discuss the possibility of showcasing A's work, the curator's gaze flicked over the studio, lingering on the untouched canvases and scattered paint tubes. Her expression turned skeptical, and she murmured something about the \"lack of cohesion\" in A's pieces.\n\nThe woman's words struck a chord, and A felt a familiar knot form in her stomach. She tried to brush it off, but the curator's careless remark echoed through her mind like a slap. A's eyes narrowed as she listened, her grip on the edge of the table tightening ever so slightly. The sound of her own name being reduced to a mere afterthought stung, and she couldn't help but wonder if anyone truly saw her art, or just her faded marriage.<|eot_id|>",
