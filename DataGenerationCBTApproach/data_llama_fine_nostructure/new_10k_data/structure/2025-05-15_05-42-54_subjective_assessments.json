The cookies went rolling across the floor, scattering crumbs everywhere. A few patients turned their heads, and one of the younger nurses snickered, trying to stifle her laughter. His face flushed as he quickly bent down to pick up the scattered cookies, his eyes avoiding the commotion he had caused. He hastily gathered them and tried to make a discreet exit, but not before catching a glimpse of himself in a nearby window reflection – his disheveled hair, red cheeks, and flustered expression making him look like a schoolboy caught in a prank.<|eot_id|>",

No wonder those people were staring; they probably thought he was some kind of idiot. Even the nurse couldn’t help but laugh - she had to. That guy must have felt so fucking stupid. He just wanted those damn cookies anyway, didn't care about the mess he made, just got them and ran out of there. What an asshole, huh? But honestly, I'm surprised he didn’t take a seat somewhere and sulk. He deserved it. How does someone act this way? Not to mention all the crumbs everywhere, you’d think he'd clean it up already instead of leaving it lying around. He really needed to get his head back in the game. Maybe if he took a deep breath and calmed down, he could've handled that better. But nope, he's too busy being a dick about it now. I can’t believe he just walked away like nothing happened. This is insane. He’s such an asshole. Why would anyone want to be friends with him after something like this? He needs to stop acting like a child and learn some manners.

A familiar surge of anger coursed through her veins as memories of her own struggles with the hospital administration flooded back.\n\nSarah's eyes met those of the woman sitting next to her, a colleague she'd worked alongside for five years.

It was a pattern I couldn’t ignore—a pattern of dismissive remarks that seemed designed to make me feel inferior. He glanced at my chart, raised an eyebrow, and muttered, “Clear as day—she’s a disaster waiting to happen.” My heart sank as I realized he wasn’t even reading from my file; instead, he was criticizing Sarah’s work, which I’d done meticulously. The injustice stung, but it was nothing compared to the outrage that followed when I heard another colleague say, “She doesn’t know what she’s doing,” as if they were witnessing some sort of miracle. It was then that I noticed the look on my friend's face—the same look I've seen countless times before. She seemed completely absorbed in her own conversation, ignoring everything around her. The way she nodded along, her gaze drifting between her phone and Dr. Smith, told me she was tuned out, lost in her thoughts, and utterly oblivious to the tension building up inside me. Her lack of empathy was a reminder that sometimes, people don’t see things as clearly as we do, especially when our emotions are running high. In that moment, I felt like I was drowning in"

He scrubbed harder, trying to erase the faint smudge of ketchup on the edge of one plate.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the argument with Sarah earlier that day – the one about the kids' schedules and whose turn it was to pick them up from school. They'd been over it countless times before, but tonight had felt different. Tonight, the words had cut deeper.\n\nAs he rinsed the final plate, his gaze drifted to the calendar on the wall. Tomorrow marked five years since their divorce. Five years of solo parenting, of struggling to make ends meet, of feeling like a failure. He felt a familiar sting in his chest, a weight that pressed down on him like a physical force.\n\nThe water shut off, and he let out a slow breath, letting the silence envelop him. His eyes dropped to the countertops, where a single spoon lay abandoned, its mate still nestled in the drawer. He hadn't used either one all week. It was a small thing, but it seemed like a cruel reminder of his own ineptitude.<|eot_id|>",

Unbelievable. And she had the nerve to act innocent when we were discussing the layoffs last week. She probably knows more than she let on then. This woman is everything wrong with our society. How could someone so self-absorbed even work here? Everyone else seems to have lost their minds around her. I swear, it’s like they’re under some kind of spell. When I brought up Dr. Lee’s schedule, she acted like she wasn’t even listening to us. Then she left abruptly, which is typical for her. She’s not even trying to hide it anymore.
