But then again, wasn't there a rumor going around about an anonymous source? Maybe someone saw something and just wanted to stir up drama? He shook his head as he tossed the paper onto the table. This is ridiculous; we're over. We've already moved on. What does this even mean? It can't possibly be related to our marriage. No way... She must have hired some kind of lawyer to dig up dirt on me before filing for divorce. That would explain how she got access to those papers. But why now? Why right when we were supposed to be finalizing our separation? It doesn't make sense. He looked away, trying to shake off the feeling of unease creeping over him. It's probably nothing, just a misunderstanding. But deep down, he couldn't help but wonder if things weren't as cut-and-dried as they seemed. Was everything really as simple as they said it was? Did they really know what they were doing? Or were they just making it up as they went along? And now, with that newspaper lying on the table, it felt like the whole world was shifting beneath his feet. Everything he thought he knew was crumbling, leaving him with more questions"

She’s proof that being alone is the worst possible fate, one that only leads to misery and heartache. She’s a living embodiment of everything that goes wrong when you don’t have someone by your side. Just think about it: whenever we’re happy, there’s usually someone to share our joy with. We can celebrate our successes together, and when we’re sad, we can comfort each other.
