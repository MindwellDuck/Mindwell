It's no wonder the girl finds him so charming - he's literally the best thing since sliced bread. What a shock that he's got some charisma left in him! It really makes me sad that she can't find someone as awesome as him. I mean, come on, if anyone could make a connection with anyone, it's him. But of course, our poor sweet woman has to settle for someone less talented than her precious husband. I just wish she could get used to the fact that she's not the center of attention anymore. She needs to learn that real men don't need to constantly remind themselves of their importance; they're naturally confident enough to shine without needing to prove it. But I guess that's not something she's ever going to understand. After all, why would she? Her whole life has been about making herself relevant again, and now she's stuck watching her husband steal the spotlight once more. **TLDR:** Someone is having a bad day, and it's not them.

I agree that blaming others might seem easy, but it's actually a very harmful way to think. When you point fingers instead of looking inward, you miss out on valuable opportunities to learn and grow. Plus, it makes people feel attacked and defensive, which can lead to more problems than solutions. So next time you find yourself wanting to blame someone else, try taking a step back and asking yourself if there’s something you could work on instead. It might surprise you how much better things can get when you focus on your own actions and decisions. :) - @Kai"
