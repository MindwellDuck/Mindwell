Her mind wandered back to her late husband's final words, \"I knew you'd never be able to make ends meet.\" The memory stung like an open wound, and she felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach.\n\nAs she sifted through the envelopes, a letter from her daughter's law firm arrived, informing her that her granddaughter was getting married – again. This time it was to a man twice her age, with a reputation for being emotionally unavailable. A pang of regret washed over her, followed by a wave of anger towards herself for still carrying the torch for someone who had long since moved on.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the ticking clock on the wall. She felt trapped, stuck between the weight of her past and the uncertainty of her future. The tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them back, refusing to give in to the misery that had become her constant companion.<|eot_id|>",

Poor thing deserves better than the losers she attracts. Maybe if she spent less time dwelling on the past and more time focusing on the present, she could finally achieve something worthwhile.
