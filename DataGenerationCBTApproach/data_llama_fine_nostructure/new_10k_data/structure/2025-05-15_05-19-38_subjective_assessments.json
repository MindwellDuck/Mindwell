His wife had spent hours planning the evening, but he'd been too caught up in work to notice the prep. Now, as he gazed out the window at the tidy suburban street, he felt a familiar itch - frustration. He scrubbed a hand through his hair, the tension building in his shoulders. The doorbell rang, shrill in the silence. It was the neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, asking if she could borrow some sugar. Again.<|eot_id|>",

Would he think I'm crazy for thinking this way? Or does he know something I don't? Maybe he left behind more than just his body. What if he gave me a message that only I could understand? But then again, maybe he did leave a message. Maybe he didn't want me to see it until after I'd figured things out for myself. Does that sound like something he'd do? To protect me from the truth? If he did leave a message, would it really change anything? Would it give me the answers I need, or just lead me further down the rabbit hole of questions? Maybe I'm reading too much into everything. Maybe he doesn't even care about me anymore. Maybe he thinks I've moved on and forgotten about him. That would explain why he never came back. Could he be avoiding me? Did he get tired of our fights? Was he scared of what might happen if he came back? Did he fear losing control? Or was it something else entirely? Whatever the reason, I feel lost and alone, wondering if I'll ever find peace."

It was one of hundreds, left behind by a group of rowdy teenagers after a night out at the bars.

He checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time, wondering if he was running late for his shift. But there was no note, no indication of who could have sent it or why.\n\nAs he hesitated, a gust of wind blew across the street, sending the package rolling away from him. The officer let out a low curse as he sprinted after it, weaving through pedestrians and dodging umbrellas. His heart began to pound in his chest, his breath coming in ragged gasps.\n\nFor a moment, he thought he'd lost it - but then he saw it stop at the base of a nearby lamppost. With a surge of adrenaline, he reached down and picked it up, feeling a cold sweat break out on his forehead. There was nothing inside but a small piece of paper with a single sentence scrawled on it: \"They're watching you.\"<|eot_id|>",

A pang struck his chest as he felt a familiar ache spread through his shoulders.\n\nJust then, a nurse walked by, striking up a conversation about the upcoming weekend.
