As the guest of honor approached, her eyes lingered on the gleam of a new smartwatch on the woman's wrist, its price tag likely exceeding twice what she could afford.

They'll say it's because I'm \"not relevant\" but really, they just want to make me feel worse. Like, why would they invite me anyway? Maybe if I was younger, more attractive, or had some money, I'd be invited too. But no, I'm always left out. I'm always the one who has to sit alone at parties, never invited to anything important. And now, with this stupid retirement party, they're just rubbing it in my face. They think they can just ignore me and then pretend everything is fine? No, it's not fine. I know how much it hurts when you're constantly ignored and belittled. And now, to see someone else being celebrated like this... it just makes me sick.

My heart pounded against my ribcage, threatening to burst free from my chest cage. Each beat felt like a warning sign, a signal that something was terribly wrong. My mind was a maelstrom, swirling with worst-case scenarios—job loss, financial ruin, the collapse of our entire life's work. I tried to focus on the meeting, but everything else faded away, replaced by an overwhelming sense of dread. In the silence, I felt lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Panic clawed at my insides, squeezing tight until I thought I'd burst. Yet still, nothing changed. The numbers continued to stare at me, unblinking and unforgiving. It was as if they'd come to life, mocking me with every digit, each one a cruel reminder that I was failing.

Her eyes, which once held a deep understanding of human suffering, now seemed hollow, as if they too had lost all connection to the world around them. She walked through the corridors with purpose, each step a testament to her role as a caregiver, yet her presence felt distant, almost mechanical. She was no different from the other nurses; they moved with calculated efficiency, their faces hidden behind masks of professionalism. Each one a vessel, carrying out their duties without emotion, leaving those who needed care to navigate the complex web of their actions.
