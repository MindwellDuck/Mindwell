The students were engaged, but one student - Alex from last year's class - caught his eye. Alex had been struggling to catch up, and today was the day they were supposed to present their group project.\n\nAs he handed out the assignments, he noticed Alex slumped in the back, staring blankly at his phone. When it was time for the presentations, Alex hesitated before standing up and fumbling through his notes. His partner, Emily, took over, stumbling over simple arithmetic questions.\n\nThe teacher tried to intervene, offering guidance and reassurance, but Alex became flustered, his face reddening as he struggled to keep up. He glanced around the room, catching the teacher's gaze, and felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him.\n\nWhen the presentation finally ended, Alex collapsed into his seat, defeated. As the teacher moved on to the next topic, Alex quietly packed up his things and slipped out of the classroom, leaving behind a trail of awkward silence.<|eot_id|>",

He must have thought about how stupid he looked in front of everyone because he was such a failure in math. Maybe he remembered all those times he bombed the test and felt bad about embarrassing himself again. Or maybe he just hated being there because he didn’t want to take the test today. Whatever it is, I know he did it because he’s an idiot who can't handle even basic math, and he thinks we’re all watching him fail too! He probably felt humiliated when the whole class saw him struggle, especially since the teacher couldn’t help him. I bet he thought about how much he wanted to disappear because he knew he messed up in front of everyone. What if he’s still mad about getting a low grade on that test last semester? Maybe he’s worried that he won’t get into college with this grade. That would explain why he looks so pathetic, wouldn’t it? If he really cared about passing, he’d be working harder instead of checking his phone. But what if he’s just bored out of his mind and doesn’t care about school anymore? Yeah, that makes sense too. You know what would make it worse? If he remembered all those times he got detention for messing around during class. So yeah, I’m 100% sure he did it because he hates math and feels embarrassed every time he fails. It’s so easy to see why he acted like that now."

His wife had left early that morning, citing a business trip, but he knew it was more than that – she'd been distant lately, and this felt like the final straw.\n\nAs he plated the dish, his mind began to wander to all the meals they used to share together, the laughter and arguments that had become a familiar soundtrack in their small apartment. He recalled the countless nights he'd cooked dinner for her after a long day at work, the way she'd smile when he presented her with a home-cooked meal.\n\nThe kitchen lights seemed dimmer now, casting long shadows across the countertops. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft sizzle of the pan and the ticking of the clock on the wall. He felt a pang in his chest, a hollow ache that echoed through his entire body.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his wife – a simple \"hello\" and a brief update on her meeting schedule. But the lack of warmth, of affection, sent a fresh wave of loneliness crashing over him. He stood there, frozen, as the seconds ticked by, the kitchen stillness closing in around him like a shroud.<|eot_id|>",

It's been a whole week since she moved out, and he can't stop thinking about how much he misses having her around. Every night feels empty, every conversation with friends is hollow. He tries to distract himself by cooking, but even that feels forced, like he's trying to fill a void instead of nourishing his soul. The fact that she didn't leave sooner - maybe if she'd talked things through, if she'd shown some empathy - could've changed everything. Now, the house feels abandoned, like he's living in a museum rather than his own home. It hurts to look at the photos of her smiling back at him, reminding him of what he's lost. Every day is a struggle, every moment feeling like a countdown until she comes back. When will she come back? Will she ever forgive me for being so stupid? Why did she have to leave like this? She was always perfect, never complaining, never leaving me behind. What happened to the loving partner who supported me through thick and thin?

There was something else, some force driving him to the edge.
