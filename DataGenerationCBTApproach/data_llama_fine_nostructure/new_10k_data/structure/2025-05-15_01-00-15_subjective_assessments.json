But then I thought about the jars of expired jam sitting on our shelf, the half-empty bottle of wine we hadn’t opened yet, and the stack of unpaid bills piling up. Shouldn’t we be focusing on those instead? Perhaps we should have cut back earlier, but I had promised myself I wouldn’t let my worries consume me again. Still, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that our priorities were misplaced. Why should we continue spending money on non-essential items when we’re barely scraping by? As I stood there, lost in thought, my coworker noticed something odd. She pointed out that the jar of jam was almost empty, with a significant portion of the contents already gone.
