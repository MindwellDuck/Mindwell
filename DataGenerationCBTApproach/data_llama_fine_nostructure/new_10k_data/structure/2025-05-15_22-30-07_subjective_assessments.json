However, as she read further, she realized that the method relied heavily on technology that required expensive equipment and internet connectivity – which many families in her community couldn't afford.\n\nShe felt a surge of disgust as she thought about how this could exacerbate existing inequalities in education, leaving some children behind and widening the gap between those who had access to resources and those who didn't.<|eot_id|>",

He claimed that the new approach would make things easier for everyone, but it was clear that he was just trying to push his own interests. It was infuriating to see him try to justify his actions in front of our entire faculty, especially after everything that had happened last year. When he said that the new method would \"simplify\" the curriculum, I knew exactly what he meant. He wanted to make it look like he was doing good work, all while covering up his own failures. &#x200B; I'm still fuming about it. I can't believe he has the nerve to pretend like he's looking out for the kids when we all know he’s just looking out for himself. How can someone be so self-serving? Doesn't he care about what happens to these kids? And why is he acting like this now, anyway? Last year he was so concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on our school. Now he’s just pushing this new system without even considering whether it’ll actually work"
