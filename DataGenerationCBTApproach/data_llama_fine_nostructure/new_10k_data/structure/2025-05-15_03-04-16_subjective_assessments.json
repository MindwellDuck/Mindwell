He couldn't help but feel a pang of discomfort, noticing how effortlessly Rachel seemed to command the conversation, drawing out ideas and insights from everyone around her.\n\nOne of the younger developers chimed in with a suggestion, and Rachel skillfully steered the discussion towards it, her tone confident and authoritative. He watched, feeling a twinge of frustration as he realized he'd contributed little to the conversation himself, his thoughts stuck on the same old solutions he'd been working on for months.\n\nRachel leaned back in her chair, a satisfied smile spreading across her face. \"I think we're onto something here,\" she said, glancing around the table at her colleagues. \"Let's get this prototype up and running ASAP.\" The room erupted in agreement, with everyone pitching in to make it happen. As they began brainstorming next steps, he felt his mind wander, wondering why his own projects weren't getting the same traction.<|eot_id|>",

I can practically smell the electricity between them. Whoa. What if...what if they were talking about more than just the app? Maybe they were sharing some secret joke? I bet they were laughing together, having a great time, completely ignoring us. Oh man, that would be so cool! But no, of course they wouldn’t. I mean, look at how awkward it looks.

Every day feels like another fight against an impossible task. I am always behind, and there is always someone better than me. I can't keep doing this. I need to quit. But quitting means admitting defeat, which means I'll never find a new job. I'll be stuck forever, living off savings and regretting the decision. No wonder everyone around me has given up; they're all failures too. This is always my life—struggling, failing, and falling behind. I am always late, always wrong, and always broken. There is no way forward for me. I am never good enough, and I have no one left to blame except myself. Why try anymore? I've tried so many times before, but each attempt ends in disaster. I am doomed to repeat the same mistakes, and it won't end until I die. Maybe I deserve it"

I mean, who wouldn’t want to be friends with someone who gets everything right all the time? Not me, though. I know better than to try to keep up. And don’t even get me started on how easy she makes it look. She goes from zero to hero in seconds. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, watching her succeed where I failed.

My mind wandered back to our last conversation, where he'd said, \"You're so much more beautiful than you realize.\" The memory stung, making my eyes sting.
