This isn’t exactly how I envisioned my day going. Now I can already imagine her rolling her eyes and telling me to go out and get it myself.

Let’s just say we’ve been living like college students for the past week. The trash needs taking out, the floors are covered in crumbs and spills, and I haven’t washed the dishes since last Sunday.
