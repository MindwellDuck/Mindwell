As she rang up the purchase, her partner, Alex, walked into the store, flashing his charming smile at her.\n\nFor a moment, their eyes locked, and she felt a familiar flutter in her chest. But then he noticed the look on her face and asked if everything was okay. She brushed it off, saying she was just tired from work. He nodded sympathetically, but as they exchanged small talk, she couldn't shake the feeling of inadequacy. Her mind wandered to all the times she'd forgotten important dates, missed social invitations, and struggled to keep up with Alex's increasingly demanding schedule.\n\nAs she handed him the receipt, their fingers touched briefly, and she felt a jolt of embarrassment. The customer, oblivious to the exchange, left the store, chattering excitedly about the birthday party plans. The bell above the entrance jangled, signaling another customer's arrival, and she took a deep breath, trying to compose herself.

We went on a date last week, and she mentioned how she was running late because she forgot to check her phone for messages.

I've told her time and time again how hurtful her actions are, yet she continues to ignore me, dismissing my concerns with a simple \"it's not your problem.\" How can she be so callous? Doesn't she realize that every little thing she says hurts me deeply? If only she could see how much pain she causes, maybe she'd start treating me better.
