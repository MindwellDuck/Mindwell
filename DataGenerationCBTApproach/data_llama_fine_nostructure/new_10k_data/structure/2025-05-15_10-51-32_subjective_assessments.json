First, I am aware of my feelings towards this situation. Second, I am aware that there may be an underlying mental filter at play. ## Step 2: Analyze the first issue It is clear that I am upset about something. My emotions are strong enough that I can pinpoint what triggered them (the scene at the hospital). However, it appears that I am misinterpreting these emotions. Instead of recognizing that I am experiencing jealousy, I believe that I am simply being honest about how I feel. This suggests that I may have a distorted view of reality. ## Step 3: Examine the second issue On the other hand, I recognize that I may have a biased perspective. When confronted with evidence, I tend to selectively focus on certain details while ignoring others. For instance, when I think back to this moment, I remember only that he was arrogant, but I don’t recall any specific instances where he demonstrated kindness or compassion toward me. It’s possible that I’m overreacting and misrepresenting the situation. This implies that I need to consider multiple viewpoints before forming conclusions. ## Step 4: Combine insights from steps 2 and 3 Considering both points together, it becomes apparent that I might be engaging in a form of selective perception. By focusing solely on the negative aspects of the situation"

I thought it was great that my sister wanted to spend more time with us, but now I feel like my wife is treating me like a child too. Every time I ask for something—like getting a new car or going out on dates—I hear the same phrase: \"You're being selfish.\" It’s like everything I want is somehow less important than what she wants. Sometimes I think she’s trying to make me feel bad about myself. But she says she loves me, and I know she does. Still, every time I try to talk about something positive, like how much I love our life together, she interrupts me, saying things like, \"That’s nice, but don’t you think you’re being too self-centered?\" Or she’ll say, \"I wish you’d stop focusing on yourself all the time,\" which makes me wonder if maybe I am being too self-focused.

His words were laced with condescension, and the nurse couldn’t help but feel a familiar sting, as if the memories of past failures were being stirred once again. The doctor's actions seemed to suggest that he genuinely believed himself to be superior, and the nurse wondered how many times this scenario had played out before, with similar results. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger The triggering event is the doctor's complaint about the nurse's competence, which sets off a chain reaction of thoughts and feelings. ## Step 2: Analyze the Situation The situation involves a power imbalance between the doctor and the nurse, with the doctor holding more authority and control over the patient's care. ## Step 3: Recognize the Cognitive Distortion This is where the thought pattern begins to distort reality. The nurse starts thinking that the doctor \"should\" have acted differently, implying that there is some inherent rightness in how he handled the situation. ## Step 4: Evaluate the Evidence There is no evidence provided in the text to support the idea that the doctor's behavior was inappropriate.

The protagonist emphasizes the negative aspects of his life, focusing on the loss of his wife and the difficulties he faces as a single parent. This creates a distorted view of reality, leading readers to feel sympathy for him. ## Step 2: Analyze the Language Used Notice how the text uses phrases like “overwhelming urge” and “pang of guilt,” which convey strong emotions.
