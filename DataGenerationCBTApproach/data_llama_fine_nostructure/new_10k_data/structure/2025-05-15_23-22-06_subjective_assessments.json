It wasn't the proximity that bothered him; it was the way Rachel seemed to be enjoying herself around Alex.\n\nShe smiled at something he said, her eyes sparkling with amusement, and he caught himself tensing, his fingers tightening around the coffee cup.

He closed his eyes, letting the darkness wash over him, and for a brief, fleeting instant, he felt a glimmer of peace. But then reality snapped back into focus. A chill ran down his spine as he opened his eyes to find himself alone in the dimly lit room. The silence was oppressive, heavy with unspoken expectations. He knew what people were thinking – they saw the tension in his face, heard the desperation in his voice when he called them earlier.

The teacher's gut tightened as he realized the boy must be thinking about his wife, whom he'd lost a year ago. He tried to brush off the feeling, but it only intensified as he continued to teach.\n\nAs the period drew to a close, the boy raised his hand hesitantly. \"Excuse me,\" he said quietly, \"but can I ask you something?\" The teacher nodded curtly, expecting a question about the lesson plan. But instead, the boy asked, \"Do you ever get mad at us when we're being bad?\"\n\nThe teacher felt a surge of defensiveness, but he bit back a snappy response. Instead, he forced himself to take a deep breath. \"Sometimes,\" he said slowly, trying to choose his words carefully. \"We all get frustrated when we're dealing with difficult behavior.\"\n\nThe boy looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded and sat down.
