The artist smiled politely, feeling a twinge of jealousy and resentment towards this unknown critic who got to make decisions about what art was worthy of recognition.

I'll spend the rest of my days alone, unmotivated, and unappreciated. There’s no point anymore. Why bother trying? Nothing will ever go right for me. I might as well give up now. Every time someone else gets praised, it just makes me feel worse. I hate that I have to live like this. I wish I could go back to being the talented young artist I once was. But those days are gone, lost forever. Now I'm just another forgotten painter, ignored and overlooked. I used to dream of exhibitions, but they're all just a distant memory now. I won’t let myself hope again. What's the point of even trying? Everything I create is just going to end up rejected. Maybe if I were more talented, things would be different, but I know deep down that's not true. I’m just a waste of space and resources. No one cares about my art anyway. I don’t deserve to be here. People think they’re so much better than me because they get opportunities others don’t. But deep inside, they probably hide their own insecurities and fears, just like everyone"

The smell of freshly brewed coffee transported her back to those lazy mornings spent together, just the two of them, before it all fell apart.\n\nAs Rachel continued talking, the nurse's gaze drifted toward the calendar on the wall, where a faint sticky note still read \"Our First Anniversary\" – a date now long passed.

Even something as simple as a good cup of coffee feels like a luxury she enjoys every day, while I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. It’s so unfair that I don’t have anything going for me like she does. Rachel always seemed so confident and self-assured; it must be because she has no one holding her back, unlike me. How can someone like that exist in this world? Does she ever think about how lonely she must feel, knowing she’ll spend another weekend alone, while I wish I had someone to share moments like these with? Doesn’t she ever wonder what it would be like if she were in my shoes, dealing with the pain of a broken heart?"
