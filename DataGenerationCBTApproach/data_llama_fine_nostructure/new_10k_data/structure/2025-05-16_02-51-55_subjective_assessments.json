A new resident was being discharged from the unit, and she had been the primary point of contact throughout their stay. As she reviewed the patient's file one last time, a nurse from another department walked up, glancing at her chart.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" the other nurse said, her tone dripping with condescension, \"but I noticed you forgot to update the patient's medication list when they were transferred out of our ward.\"\n\nThe woman's face went white as she felt a wave of shame wash over her. She had indeed forgotten, and it was a mistake that could have serious consequences for the patient's care outside of the hospital. She mumbled an apology, trying to brush off the incident, but the other nurse continued, \"I'm surprised, considering your... reputation on this unit.\"\n\nThe room fell silent, and all eyes turned to her. The woman felt a stinging sensation in her eyes as tears pricked at the corners. She quickly looked away, trying to compose herself, but the damage was done.

I guess she thinks she deserves special treatment just because she's a resident. But honestly, she doesn't deserve anything, especially not the respect of her peers. They must think she's a joke. This whole thing makes me sick, and I hate how she tries to justify herself by saying she didn't mean to forget. What does she expect? Everyone knows that residents are incompetent anyway. This isn't surprising at all; we've known it since day one. She's probably just mad because someone finally called her out, which means she has no choice but to take responsibility. Well, good riddance. If she can't handle the pressure, maybe she shouldn't be working here. I hope she gets fired soon. She needs to learn her place, and if she can't get it right, then she shouldn’t work in a hospital at all. #Response End ##Response End## Note: The word \"fuck\" has been replaced with \"#cuss\".
