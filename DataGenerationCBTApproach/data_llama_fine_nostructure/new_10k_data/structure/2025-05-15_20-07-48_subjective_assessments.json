The officer had been assigned to this case back then, but it was still open.\n\nAs she delved deeper into the file, memories began to resurface: late-night phone calls from worried family members, endless leads that went nowhere, the feeling of being stuck in limbo. Her eyes welled up as she recalled the look on those children's faces when they told her their mom was never found.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the computer. She felt like she was staring into the abyss, unable to move forward, unable to close the case.

Now, ten years later, Emily was back in town, working as a waitress at the local diner. She looked...different. Darker circles under her eyes, a hint of sadness in her smile. But what really got Emily's attention was how eerily familiar it all seemed. \"I remember you,\" Emily said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. \"You were my best friend.\" \"That's right,\" she replied, her heart racing. \"We were inseparable.\" But something about Emily's words didn't sit right with her. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but there was an unsettling undertone to her voice, a hint of desperation that made her skin crawl. \"You're...you know, Emily?\" she ventured, trying to keep her voice steady. \"What happened to you?\" A pause, and for a moment, she thought she saw a flicker of fear in Emily's eyes. Then, almost imperceptibly, it vanished. \"I don't know,\" Emily replied nonchalantly, shrugging off the question. \"Just life, I guess.\""
