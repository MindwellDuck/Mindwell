The familiar ache of disappointment had given way to a low simmering anger, fueled by the memory of countless rejections and unfulfilled dreams. Her gaze drifted to the small studio apartment she shared with two roommates, where half-finished canvases and discarded sketches seemed to mock her failures.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. She hesitated, then picked up, her voice guarded. It was her sister, asking how the application process was going. The conversation was stilted, the usual reassurances and platitudes falling flat. As they parted ways, the artist felt a surge of resentment toward her own perceived shortcomings – the lack of connections, the mediocre work, the perpetual struggle to make ends meet. The quiet rage simmered beneath her calm exterior, waiting to boil over at any moment.<|eot_id|>",

They were so much more established, with exhibitions that attracted crowds and artists who were celebrated for their work. Meanwhile, she struggled to get noticed, no matter how hard she tried. Even her best pieces often received lukewarm responses, while others’ work seemed to resonate deeply with audiences. It made her wonder if she was simply not cut out for this field, if there was something fundamentally wrong with her approach to art. Maybe it wasn't just about talent; maybe she needed to change everything about herself."

She hesitated before answering, unsure if she had the energy to deal with another call from her well-meaning but intrusive neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins. The conversation was going nowhere – Mrs. Jenkins wanted advice on fixing her own computer, which A had already told her multiple times would be best left to a professional.\n\nThe phone call ended, and A felt the familiar weight of frustration settle in. She'd been working on this project for months, trying to get it just right, but every small step forward seemed to be met with setbacks. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized she might never meet her deadline, and the pressure was suffocating her.<|eot_id|>",

That is, if this mysterious caller followed through... But no, that would require effort, and we all know how that goes. So, why bother? There's always tomorrow, right? Sure, but think about how much time you'll waste waiting around for things to happen instead of taking action yourself. You can't expect life to magically solve your problems. Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. Besides, I'm already behind schedule... Yeah, but so are all my deadlines. Why stress myself out? Maybe this isn't meant to be. It's just another disappointment, after all. Nothing ever works out in the long run; it’s all just an illusion. I mean, come on, it doesn’t matter. We’re all stuck in this rut together, aren’t we?

She expertly juggled multiple orders, her movements fluid and assured. The chef de cuisine noticed, too, and nodded in approval as he passed by.\n\nAlex followed her gaze, his eyes lingering on the younger woman before returning to her.
