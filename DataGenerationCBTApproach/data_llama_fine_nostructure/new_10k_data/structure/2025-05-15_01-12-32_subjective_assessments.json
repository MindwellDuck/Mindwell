The kitchen was quiet, except for the occasional clang of pots and pans from the other stations. His eyes drifted to the empty chair at the pass, where his wife used to sit during busy nights.\n\nA customer walked in, ordering the special of the day, a dish his wife had perfected before she passed away. As he began to prep the ingredients, his hands felt heavy, as if weighed down by a thick layer of grease. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing her, that he wasn't doing enough to honor her memory.\n\nThe line started to grow, and he found himself moving through the motions, but his mind was elsewhere. A familiar phrase echoed in his head, one his wife used to say when he struggled with a difficult recipe: \"Trust your instincts.\" But what did it mean anymore? Without her here to guide him, the dishes seemed to loom over him, unyielding and impossible to perfect.\n\nAs the night wore on, the kitchen grew more chaotic, but he remained frozen, unable to respond to the orders or reassure the customers. His thoughts were consumed by the memories of their life together, of the laughter they shared in this very kitchen. And the helplessness that crept in, like a slow-moving fog, threatened to suffocate him.<|eot_id|>",

She loved cooking for everyone, making everyone happy. Now she was gone, and I was left to carry on. To make them happy, instead of my own. No, that was wrong. I wouldn't let myself think that way.

They're either weirdos or trying to get inside our heads. I mean, have you ever met someone who’s always so interested in your personal life? There’s something fishy about that. This guy is definitely trouble, and I’m starting to think he’s connected to Dr. Lee somehow. Maybe he’s working with them to make me look bad.
