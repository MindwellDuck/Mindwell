It had been six months since the call went out, but some days still felt like yesterday. As she made her way to her desk, she noticed a stack of files with a name she hadn't seen in years - Jenkins. The same department he worked in. Her hand instinctively reached for the pen on her desk, and she began to tidy up the papers, her mind replaying the words from the captain's briefing that morning.\n\n\"Killed in the line of duty,\" the captain had said, his voice firm but laced with a hint of sadness. She remembered how it sounded then, but now it echoed in her ears like a mantra. As she smoothed out a wrinkle on the file, her fingers brushed against a faded photograph of herself and him, taken during their last leave together. For a moment, she forgot where she was, lost in the memories they'd shared. The silence around her grew thicker, heavy with unspoken thoughts, until she looked up to see her partner watching her, concern etched on his face.<|eot_id|>",

When it was her turn, she casually mentioned, \"I'm looking at upgrading my phone.\" The cashier, a younger employee, enthusiastically recommended the exact same model the woman had been eyeing earlier.\n\nAs the woman waited for her change, she glanced over at him and smiled blandly. He felt a surge of annoyance, wondering if she knew about the discontinued model and was deliberately trying to get the newer one. The cashier handed her the receipt, and as she took it, their fingers touched briefly.

It was like she thought she was better than him, which is totally absurd since she has no idea how he’s doing today. She must be reading minds or something. ## Step 1: Identify the trigger Identify the specific action or behavior that triggered the cognitive distortion. In this case, the trigger was the woman's comment about thanking the cashier with a condescending tone (\"thanks, dear\"). ## Step 2: Analyze the situation Analyze the situation objectively and try to understand why this interaction might have led to the distorted thinking. There are two possible explanations: - **The woman intentionally tried to insult the cashier**: She might have done this simply to make the cashier feel bad. - **The woman unintentionally expressed her feelings**: She might have genuinely meant what she said, but still expressed her frustration or disappointment with the situation. ## Step 3: Reflect on personal experiences Reflect on similar situations where you might have misinterpreted someone else's words or actions. Have there been times when you assumed someone was being rude or dismissive when they weren’t? Or maybe you’ve experienced situations where people seemed overly friendly, but it turned out they were just trying to hide their true feelings? ## Step"

But no, instead, I'm just another overworked, underappreciated doctor stuck in this endless cycle of burnout and disappointment. Why does it always happen to me? Maybe if I had a better support system, someone to share the burden with, I wouldn't feel so alone. Maybe if I had more confidence, I wouldn’t let fear hold me back... But no, it's always the same. I’m just a failure, and everyone around me knows it. Even the nurses seem to have it easier. They get to work with younger patients, with families by their side. Meanwhile, I deal with old, fragile patients who rely solely on me. It feels unfair. I shouldn’t have to go through this alone, especially when others make it look easy. If only I could be more like them, maybe then I’d feel more at ease. But no matter how hard I try, I can never live up to their standards. I’ll never be good enough. Everyone else is better than me, and I know it. It’s always the same—another reminder that I don’t deserve anything. Why do I keep falling behind?"

The corners of her eyes seemed to hold a mixture of sadness and resignation, as if she knew what was coming next.\n\nThe phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill and insistent. His supervisor's voice was detached, explaining the details of the layoff process.
