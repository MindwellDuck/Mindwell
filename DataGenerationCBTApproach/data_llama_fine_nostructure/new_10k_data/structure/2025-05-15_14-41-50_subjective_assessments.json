It had been five years since she'd last seen her children, and the ache in her chest was still familiar. \n\nAs she began to hand out papers, one student caught her eye – a shy, freckled girl with a worn-out backpack. The girl's eyes welled up with tears as she clutched her worksheet tightly, her small hands shaking.\n\nThe teacher tried to reassure her, but something about the girl's distress struck a chord. She remembered the countless afternoons spent crying alone in the school bathroom, feeling like a failure. For a moment, she forgot about her own struggles and saw herself through the girl's eyes.<|eot_id|>",

In fact, it seemed almost inevitable that this child would grow up to be another broken soul, too scared to even look someone in the eye. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, and she felt like she needed to hold onto something to keep from falling apart. She realized how much she had grown by being able to relate to this kid. She remembered when she first started working here, all those kids were so excited to learn, but now they seemed so lost. She felt really bad for them because they deserved better. It was hard to think about what could have been if things went differently, especially when she thought about her own family. She wondered what her daughter might be doing right now, and whether she was happy. She imagined her sitting in class, surrounded by other kids who didn't seem to care about anything. Then there was the boy who always wore the same old jacket. He never changed his clothes or his attitude, which made him stand out. He looked like he belonged somewhere else, but she knew he was one of her students. His whole demeanor screamed \"broken,\" and she wondered if he ever felt like he fit in anywhere.

Just another symptom of a larger issue—one that's been brewing for months. Maybe it's the lack of communication, maybe it's the growing distance, or maybe it's something more—something she can't quite put her finger on. Whatever the reason, it's clear that she’s running out of patience. And when you're already on edge, the smallest thing can set you off.
