Every time he tried to make small talk about the weather or sports, she seemed distant, like she was waiting for something else to come along. For instance, when he asked how her day went, she replied with a simple “It’s fine.” Simple wasn’t enough; he needed more than that. If she said it was fine, why didn’t she elaborate? Wasn’t there anything more going on beneath the surface? Her constant reminders to pick up milk made him feel like she was nagging him, making him think she wanted something specific from him – perhaps even an argument. It was as if she assumed he wouldn’t do things unless told, which annoyed him even further. What would happen if she just left a note saying, “Don’t forget to pick up milk”? Would he still be annoyed? Why does she need to remind me all the time? Doesn’t she trust me to remember? Is she trying to control me? Does she really think I’m so stupid I can’t keep track of my own life? She never leaves me alone for a second without judging me or assuming I’m doing something wrong. She thinks I don’t know what I’m doing because she doesn’t want to bother herself with explaining things. Maybe it’s better if she just stopped leaving notes altogether. At least that way, I won’t"

As he plated a dish, his eyes wandered to a photo on the counter – a picture of him and his wife from their honeymoon. They were smiling, carefree, and in love.\n\nHe felt a pang in his chest, but it wasn't the usual excitement of seeing her smile. It was something else, something that made his stomach twist into knots. He tried to shake off the feeling, focusing on the task at hand. But as he took a step back to admire his work, his gaze drifted to the empty chair across from him, where she usually sat.\n\nIt had been six months since she'd left, and he still hadn't gotten used to the silence. The kitchen, once filled with her laughter, was now just a space where he cooked alone.

Maybe they thought he looked weird and didn’t want anything to do with him. But no one ever called him out on this shit. People just kept telling him to relax and enjoy life, like that’s easy when you’re secretly dying inside. Even his coworkers seemed oblivious to how messed up things really were. When he mentioned that he’d rather be home alone than go out somewhere, they just laughed it off, saying he needed to get out more. More? Are you kidding me? I swear, every time someone suggested doing something social, it was like they knew exactly what he was thinking – that he hated them and didn’t want to spend another minute around them. Or maybe they just didn’t realize that deep down, he was screaming to be left alone. But again, no one ever said anything. No one ever asked if he was okay or if he needed some space. So yeah, I guess I’m just a big asshole for assuming people have these huge secrets going on behind closed doors. Who am I to judge?

Her mind began to wander back to the art show last week, where one of her pieces had been met with awkward silence.\n\nAs she gazed at the canvas, her eyes landed on a small mistake – a faint smudge of paint that had slipped through her fingers during the exhibition. She felt a sting, as if the imperfection was a personal failure. Her thoughts spiralled out of control, conjuring memories of past rejections and unfulfilled dreams. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them away, convinced that showing weakness would undermine her artistic integrity.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she turned off the lights, leaving the painting to its mocking splendor in the darkened studio.
