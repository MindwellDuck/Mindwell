He catches himself reaching for the recipe book where he'd written down her favorite recipes, only to remember it's been gone since the divorce.\n\nThe stove ignites, casting a warm glow over the space, but the comfort it usually brings feels like a cruel taunt. His eyes land on the old photo of them on the counter, the one where Emma was beaming with pride as he presented her with a custom cake for their anniversary.

He gets up, walks over to the fridge, and opens it. The contents are sparse, reminders of their life together now nothing more than empty containers and leftovers. A faint smell of her perfume lingers in the air, but it doesn’t bring back the memories; instead, it makes him feel lonely. He forces a laugh, trying to shake off the sadness. But the sound feels forced, like he’s pretending to be okay when he’s really not. As he closes the fridge, his hand brushes against something - an old recipe card. It’s from their wedding day, the one where Emma had asked him to cook her favorite meal. He looks at it, the date etched on the corner, and wonders if anyone else knows how much it meant to her. He crumpled the paper, tossing it in the trash. The gesture feels almost unconscious, like he’s trying to get rid of something that reminds him too much of what he’s lost.

In that moment, she'd vowed to become just like him – compassionate, understanding, and dedicated.
