My phone buzzed in my pocket, a text from my ex, Rachel, asking me to pick up our kid from soccer practice.\n\nMy stomach dropped like the elevator in one of those rickety buildings downtown. Soccer practice? With her. Again?\n\nI forced myself to take a deep breath as I waited in line, trying to shake off the creeping sense of embarrassment. Who needs a social life when you're married to a supermodel, right? I mean, I'm just a humble journalist, stuck in this rut, while she's out there living it up.\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to order, I stumbled over my words, spilling coffee grounds all over the counter. The barista gave me that look – you know, the one that says, \"I've seen it all before.\" Like I needed another reminder.\n\nAs I waited for my drink, I couldn't help but think about how I ended up here. A divorced guy, barely scraping by, covering high school sports games for a living. What had I done wrong?\n\nRachel walked in, looking like she just stepped off the cover of a magazine (which, coincidentally, she did). Our kid, Jack, ran up to her, excitedly chattering about his game. And I just stood there, frozen in shame, wondering how I'd become the guy who couldn't even get it together enough to attend his kid's soccer practice.\n\nI took my drink and made a hasty exit, feeling like I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than face the judgmental glances of these strangers. Maybe I could just go home, crawl into bed, and pretend none of this ever happened.\n\nBut as I hit the sidewalk, I saw Rachel laughing with some guy, their arms around each other's waists. The guy looked vaguely familiar – wasn't he that newscaster from channel five? Ugh, why did I even care? But somehow, I did.\n\nAnd that's when it hit me: I'm still stuck in the past, reliving the memories of what went wrong. What went wrong with me.<|eot_id|>",

I'm left feeling like a total fool in front of my new colleagues. Why can't they just take me seriously for once? I've worked hard to prove myself as a capable nurse, but it seems like nobody wants to give me a chance.\n\nI force a smile and move on to the next agenda item, but inside, I'm seething.

Another day, another article written, another interview conducted, and yet, nothing seemed to stick. No one seemed to care about the stories he tried to tell.\n\nHe thought back to his divorce, how it had been supposed to be amicable, but now felt like a betrayal by the love of his life. Her new partner, some pompous jerk who made her smile like she used the hell out of it every time he walked through the door.\n\nJack's eyes wandered around his cluttered apartment, taking in the stacks of unwashed laundry, the empty pizza boxes, and the unmade bed. He hadn't left this place all week. His mom was starting to worry, but what was there to worry about? She knew he was fine... or so he kept telling himself.\n\nHis phone buzzed, breaking the silence. It was Emily, his ex-wife, calling to check in. He hesitated before answering, knowing he'd rather face a swarm of bees than talk to her right now. But he played along, pretending everything was cool.\n\n\"Hey, babe,\" he said, trying to sound casual despite the desperation creeping into his voice.\n\nThere was a pause on the other end, and for a moment, Jack wondered if he'd done something wrong. Then, Emily spoke up, her voice laced with concern.\n\n\"Jack, I've been thinking... maybe we could meet for coffee and catch up?\"\n\nCoffee? With her? The hell? Jack felt like he was going to puke.

Instead, he was stuck in this rut, wallowing in his own sorrow.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Jack got up from his chair, trudged over to the kitchen, and poured himself a whiskey.

Me, alone again.\n\nMy phone buzzed with a text from Karen, asking if I wanted to grab dinner tomorrow night. I hesitated, feeling a pang of guilt for even suggesting we spend time together when she deserved so much more than this solitary existence.

For a moment, I felt a spark of gratitude, but it was quickly extinguished by the crushing weight of my loneliness.\n\n\"Thanks, Emily,\" I mumbled, taking a cookie without looking at her.

I swear, the man has more gadgets than a Swiss Army knife.\n\nHe sets it down next to his other useless trinkets - a fitness tracker he never uses, a wireless charging pad that collects dust, and a Bluetooth speaker that can't even play decent music. It's like he thinks we're living in some kind of sci-fi movie or something.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the price tag. We just got back from a vacation, and he goes and blows all our savings on this...this... thing. I mean, what's wrong with a good old-fashioned watch? One that doesn't need to be charged every five seconds?\n\nAs I watch him fiddle with the thing, I feel this familiar knot in my stomach. It's not anger, exactly - that would imply some semblance of reason. No, it's something far worse. Something that makes my blood boil whenever I think about how he's been doing this to us for years.\n\nYears of reckless spending, years of ignoring my concerns, years of pretending like everything is fine when it's really not. And now, here we are, on the verge of financial disaster because of his latest obsession.\n\nBut I won't say anything. Not yet, anyway. Maybe if I just ignore it long enough, he'll come to his senses. Maybe he'll realize that there's more to life than just buying stuff. Ha! Fat chance of that happening.\n\nI take a deep breath, try to calm myself down, but my mind keeps wandering back to that smartwatch. What's next? A robot vacuum cleaner? A personal drone? Where does it end?\n\nAs I sit here, seething with resentment, I wonder if anyone else notices the way he's been treating our finances like they're someone else's problem. Or if anyone cares.<|eot_id|>",
