His wife had helped him manage the finances after he retired, but now she was busy planning their vacation to visit grandkids, and it seemed like no one had taken care of the paperwork.\n\nAs he scanned the pile, one invoice stood out – a notice from the IRS stating that his tax returns were overdue by six months. He rubbed his temples, feeling a familiar sense of frustration and helplessness wash over him. The thought of calling the IRS to explain the delay made him anxious, knowing that his wife would have to handle it, taking time away from her own preparations for the trip.\n\nThe silence in the room grew thicker, punctuated only by the ticking clock and the faint hum of the refrigerator.

But does he ever stop obsessing over every little detail? Even though we’ve discussed this countless times, he still insists that everything is going to fall apart, and he can’t breathe until he figures it all out. This isn’t the first time he’s gotten himself worked up over something so trivial. Remember when he spent hours agonizing over a single typo in a press release? Or how about when he got upset because a freelance writer didn’t return his calls promptly enough? Those instances usually left me rolling my eyes, but this latest behavior feels different. Maybe it's because we've been under a lot of stress lately—his sister passed away last year, and I'm dealing with some health issues—but whenever he starts freaking out over something small, I feel a pang of guilt. It's like I need to step in and remind him that things aren’t as bad as he thinks they are, but every time I try, he just gets defensive and says I don’t understand what he’s going through.
