Years ago, she would have been the one leading these discussions, sharing her groundbreaking findings and mentoring aspiring scientists like them.\n\nAs she began to present her latest research, a younger colleague interrupted, dismissing her work as outdated and irrelevant. The room fell silent, with some nodding in agreement while others looked uncomfortable. \n\nA senior researcher approached her afterwards, expressing concern about her continued involvement in the project and suggesting she step down to make way for newer, more innovative ideas. She listened quietly, her eyes locked on the floor, before politely declining.

I bet she's still holding onto those old results from years ago, refusing to acknowledge how much science has advanced since then. This whole thing is ridiculous. We're all better off without her; we need fresh minds, not someone stuck in the 80s. Her research must be ancient history. Why doesn't she just admit that she's no longer relevant? It's clear she's struggling to keep up with the times. Letting her continue to teach is just embarrassing—she's clearly too attached to her own legacy. It’s such an embarrassment that she refuses to accept new information. It's so frustrating to see someone clinging to the past. They shouldn’t pretend they’re still part of the current scientific scene. She should just give up and move on already. It's really sad. She looks so lost. I feel bad for her, but honestly, she doesn't belong here anymore. She needs to stop pretending to be part of the modern era.

She couldn't help but feel like they were growing apart, like two people living in the same space but slowly drifting further and further away from each other.\n\nThe sound of her phone buzzing on the counter broke the silence, and she absent-mindedly picked it up, scrolling through social media without really seeing anything. A friend's post caught her eye – a picture of them smiling together, surrounded by loved ones, and for a moment, her heart twisted with a pang of loneliness.\n\nHer gaze drifted back to the sink, where a single soap bubble floated to the surface, popping with a tiny splash.

Someone was playing games with him, pushing his buttons, and he couldn't see through it. I mean, what’s the point of even having a job if you’re just going to be watched all the time?
