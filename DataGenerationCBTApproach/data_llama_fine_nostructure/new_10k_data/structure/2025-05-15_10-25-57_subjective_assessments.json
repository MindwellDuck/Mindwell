The words blurred together as she thought about all the late nights, missed social engagements, and sacrificed personal days. Her phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, inviting her to a birthday celebration that weekend – a night out with friends she hadn't had in months.\n\nThe email notification on her screen beeped again, a reminder of the looming deadline. She rubbed her tired eyes, feeling a familiar sense of frustration and helplessness wash over her. Why did it always have to be so hard? Why couldn't things just go right for once?<|eot_id|>",

It seemed like no matter how much work she put in, deadlines kept slipping away. Her boss was breathing down her neck, and her team was struggling to meet expectations. Why did every single project seem to turn into a nightmare? Her mind wandered back to the birthday party her friend had invited her to. A night out with friends she hadn’t had in ages—something simple and fun, but now it felt like an impossible luxury. Shouldn’t she be focusing on getting this project done instead of wasting time on something frivolous? But then why did it feel like every step forward led to two steps backward? Every task became a monumental challenge, and her usual energy and enthusiasm were dwindling. She looked around her office, where everyone else seemed focused. They didn’t seem to have the same level of stress or self-doubt. How come she always ended up being the one who struggled? Was she just naturally bad at her job, or was there something more going on? Maybe if she could figure out what was causing these setbacks, maybe she could finally get ahead. But the more she thought about it, the more overwhelmed she felt. There just wasn’t enough hours in the day. And why did it always fall to her to pick up the slack when others didn’t follow through? She was starting to"

The father was holding a tablet, pointing at pictures of his kids' birthdays.\n\nThe woman, his ex-wife's friend from work, caught his eye. She was smiling warmly at something her husband said, oblivious to his gaze. He felt a pang in his chest as he quickly looked away, focusing on restocking the shelves.

It's not like I was trying to make fun of her or anything. And honestly, I feel bad for her anyway. Her husband is always talking about how he can't believe she doesn't know what to buy him for his birthday. She was acting all smiles and stuff when they were picking up things, but then she starts complaining about how expensive everything was. Like, yeah, it's pricey, but come on! They're not going to find better deals elsewhere. Still, I guess she did say she needed to talk to me about something later. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the new job, but I don't think so. We've been too busy lately, and besides, we barely speak anymore. So yeah, it's probably nothing.

As Rachel began to update their report, she mentioned that the department was considering them for a prestigious promotion – but only if they were paired with a new officer.\n\nThe mention of a 'new officer' felt like a punch to her gut. She tried to brush it off, thinking maybe Rachel had misspoken, but the words lingered. A fleeting thought crossed her mind: what would happen if she wasn't the one they chose?

It feels like something is shifting inside me. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just holding onto things too tightly. Maybe I need to let go of some of my control, allow things to unfold naturally.

The way she looks at those students is like she’s thinking, “You’ll never amount to anything.” And now she thinks she can talk down to this kid because he’s trying to fit in? Please. He might have his moments, but she already sees him as a failure. This isn’t the first time she’s made assumptions about someone just because they act differently.
