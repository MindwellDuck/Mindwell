The camera panned to the officer's statement, where he was seen smiling smugly, taking credit for the successful operation.\n\nAs the anchor continued to praise the arresting team, including Alex's name being called out, the officer's eyes narrowed, his jaw clenched. He felt a surge of anger and resentment towards the media for their portrayal of him and his colleagues as incompetent, and particularly towards Alex for somehow stealing the spotlight once again.\n\nThe officer's hand instinctively went to the badge pinned to his chest, his fingers drumming a rhythmic beat against the metal as he stared blankly at the TV screen. A faint scowl creased his face, his mind replaying all the times Alex had gotten preferential treatment and attention from their superiors. The memory of one particular incident where Alex had received a commendation for a job well done, while the officer himself hadn't even been mentioned, flashed before his eyes.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the exhaustion and stress of the long night shift; what mattered now was the injustice he felt, the sense of unfairness perpetuated by those around him. His gaze lingered on the news report, the image of Alex's smirk seared into his retina like a branding iron.<|eot_id|>",

But no, instead of focusing on the real problems, everyone was obsessed with him. And then there was the media. Always sensationalizing things, always trying to stir up drama. They didn’t understand the context of these cases, never really looking beyond the surface level. They were too caught up in their ratings and clicks, completely ignoring the bigger picture. It made him sick to think about how easily people got swayed by their biased reporting. The headlines were always skewed, the stories carefully crafted to fit the narrative they wanted to push. And yet, still, people ate it up. They couldn’t see through the spin, couldn’t distinguish between fact and fiction. But Alex...he was different. At least, that’s what everyone seemed to think. Even though he was part of the problem, he was somehow justified. People saw him as a victim, someone who had been unfairly targeted. That was absurd. Everyone knew he was guilty, everyone understood why he was arrested. Yet, despite the evidence, he was still able to charm his way out of trouble. It was infuriating. The whole thing felt like a"

It wasn't right to show weakness, especially when others were counting on him. Still, he felt a lump form in his throat, and his hands continued to tremble. He tried to push the feeling aside, telling himself that he should be strong, that he could handle anything. But the doubt lingered, echoing in his mind like a refrain. He knew he shouldn't be letting these feelings get the best of him, but it seemed impossible to shake them off entirely. Should statements often manifest as a judgment of oneself as inadequate, rather than simply a fact of reality. In this case, the person is convinced that they should feel a certain way, as if there is some inherent standard by which they must meet. They believe that being shaken by the prospect of forgetting a simple task is unacceptable behavior, yet they can't seem to stop themselves from feeling this way.

Do we need to schedule meetings with them individually or as a group? * Consider whether we can combine these steps to save time. * Can we send out a single email to everyone with updates on the project timeline and any upcoming deadlines? * Should we create an internal document outlining the project's goals and objectives so everyone is on"
