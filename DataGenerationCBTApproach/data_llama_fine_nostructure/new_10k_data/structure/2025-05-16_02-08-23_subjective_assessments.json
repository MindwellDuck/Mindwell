        "Negative Emotion": "Bitterness",
        "Cognitive Distortion": "Labeling/Global Labeling",
        "Generated Assessment": "He thinks he’s so much better than me, always dressed to impress, with his perfect smile and those piercing brown eyes that seem to see right through me. But I’ve seen the real him, standing by the coffee machine, sipping from a thermos, looking tired and worn out, like he’s carrying the weight of the entire department on his shoulders. It doesn’t add up. He never comes across like this, especially when he’s talking about his ex-girlfriend. It’s like he has a different persona for everyone else. Even when I try to talk to him, he just smiles and laughs it off, pretending everything is okay, but deep down, I think he’s still hurting. Maybe he really does have it worse than me, but sometimes I wish I could be more like him, someone who wasn’t so broken. I’m stuck in this rut, dealing with my own demons, while he gets to move forward with his life. Maybe someday I’ll figure out why things aren’t working for me, but until then, I’m stuck in this cycle of sadness and frustration.&#x200B; # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"
