Her granddaughter had called earlier, saying she was coming over after school but now wasn't feeling well enough to visit. The kitchen seemed emptier than usual as she gazed out the window at the afternoon sunlight.\n\nA faint scent of burnt sugar wafted through the air, mingling with the lingering aroma of last night's roast chicken. She couldn't remember the last time she'd made a dessert just for herself, let alone one that might go uneaten. A sigh escaped her lips as she turned off the heat, the silence in the kitchen suddenly deafening.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe this is exactly what she needed – a reminder that life doesn’t always turn out the way we want it to. After all, what’s a little disappointment among friends? I’m sure whatever plans were made will still come together. There’s no need to stress about something like that. Besides, she said she didn’t feel well, so why would she even care about the cake right now? This isn’t important at all. It’s almost as though she has a lot on her plate already. So maybe she wouldn’t be able to enjoy the cake even if she felt better today. That’s okay! There are plenty of other things to look forward to. And honestly, why bother with something as trivial as a cake when there are more meaningful things to focus on? Like, did you know that this is actually my birthday next week? Yeah, that makes everything okay. Who needs a special occasion when there are bigger things to celebrate? It’s not like anyone else is going to notice or remember; it’ll just slip away unnoticed. Plus, I’ve never celebrated birthdays before, so why make a big deal about it now? Not like it"

The implication was that she didn't have anything better to do than sit around twiddling her thumbs while he worked. She typed out a curt response about having too much work to do, but the words felt hollow even to herself.\n\nAs she watched him type away, oblivious to her growing irritation, she realized she'd left her lunch in the break room.

She could tell he was bored, so why couldn’t he leave me alone? I know my job better than him, and yet he kept saying things like “you’re doing it all wrong” or “why don’t you just copy-paste the whole thing?” Like, seriously? He doesn’t know anything about coding. Why does he think he’s qualified to give advice? When he asked if she was having a good day, she wanted to say no, but she already knew she wouldn’t get any sympathy from him. So she replied with something short and sweet, but deep down, it felt empty. She hated how he never seemed to care about what she did unless it affected him directly. And now, he was wasting her time by pretending to be helpful. Her eyes drifted back to the line of code, and suddenly, she felt like quitting. Maybe if she just copied everything and pasted it again, she’d get it done faster. But Alex would probably just mess it up again, and she couldn’t let him look smart in front of her coworkers.
