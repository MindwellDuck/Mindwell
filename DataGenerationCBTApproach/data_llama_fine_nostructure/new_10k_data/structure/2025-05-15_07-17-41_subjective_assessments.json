It feels like it’s all happening in slow motion – one moment I was walking home from class, and the next I was face-to-face with my ex-boyfriend, who’d come out of nowhere and started yelling at me. Now he's sitting across from me, his voice shaking, and I feel like I'm drowning in his anger. But then again, maybe I am overreacting. Maybe I don’t really know what happened. He seemed so calm when we were talking, but when I tried to leave, he wouldn’t let me go. We ended up outside, and he was screaming something about how I was going to ruin everything. I honestly have no idea what he means by that. It’s like my brain is stuck on repeat – I keep replaying every word he said, trying to make sense of it all. But the more I think, the more confused I get. What did he mean? Is this some kind of prank? Why would he behave like this? I feel like I need to talk to someone about this, but I don’t know who to turn to. I’ve already told my friends about it, but they’re acting like nothing’s wrong. They tell me I need to stay calm and focus on school, but I feel like there must be more to it than they’re letting on. Maybe I’m reading too much"

I'm certain there's a logical explanation for everything she did today. There has to be a reason why she acted so strangely, even though there's no concrete evidence.

It was a season he'd always associated with change, but now it only reminded him of the seasons he wouldn't get to share with his wife – the ones they'd planned for themselves after retiring from the force.\n\nThe officer's eyes wandered back to the plaque, his gaze lingering on the words \"In loving memory of...\" Before he knew it, tears had begun to well up in his eyes, and he turned away, hiding his face from the world once more.<|eot_id|>",

She wasn’t worth it. It doesn’t matter how many times I see the plaque; it’ll never make me feel better. If anything, it makes things worse. Every time I look at it, I’m reminded of all the good times she ruined. And another thing, why would I want to think about our happy moments? They’re nothing compared to how much trouble she caused. I’ve got enough problems without dwelling on those meaningless feelings. Besides, I can’t trust myself to remember everything correctly anyway. She probably exaggerated everything she said. I doubt most of it ever happened. If I try to recall specific incidents, it feels like I’m just making myself miserable by replaying those painful memories. Why would I want to relive them? At least if I forget, I won’t have to deal with the guilt. Now, if I could just ignore this whole thing, maybe I could move on with my life.

I felt like I was losing my mind - what kind of person would do this? We've always been responsible with money; why is he acting so selfishly? He didn't even mention that he booked our hotel room himself, saying it was \"a steal\" and that he'd found it online through a discount website.
