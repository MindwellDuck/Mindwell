By focusing solely on past failures, they're reinforcing their self-perceived limitations, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. ## Step 2: Analyze the Triggering Event The triggering event involved a rejection letter from the editor, which seems to have triggered a cascade of negative emotions. However, this event alone does not justify the conclusion drawn by the individual. It's essential to separate the stimulus from the emotional response to avoid jumping to conclusions. ## Step 3: Evaluate the Editor's Decision While the rejection letter may seem harsh, it's crucial to consider the context. The editor's decision might be based on various factors, such as the competitive nature of the industry, limited resources, or simply a change in priorities. Without more information, it's premature to assume the worst-case scenario predicted by the individual. ## Step 4: Assess the Individual's Emotional State Given the severity of the emotion expressed (\"drowning in my own inadequacy\"), it's clear that the individual has invested significant emotional capital in this outcome. This emotional investment can create a vicious cycle where perceived failures reinforce themselves, making it challenging to break free from the narrative of being \"not good enough.\" ## Step 5: Reframe Perspective Instead of focusing solely on past re"

It all felt so overwhelming. But what really got under my skin was when he told me that he's moved on. That he's found someone else, someone who actually cares about him. I thought we shared something special, something that could last forever. But I guess I was wrong. And now, seeing these texts from her, I can’t help but wonder if I ever truly did.
