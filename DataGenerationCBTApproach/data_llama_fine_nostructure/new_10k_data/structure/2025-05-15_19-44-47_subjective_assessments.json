The school administration had just informed him that his beloved classroom would be merged with another, forcing him to share resources and compromise on lesson plans.\n\nAs he began to explain the changes, a young student raised her hand, asking why they couldn't keep their current room. He forced a smile, trying to placate her, but the seed of resentment had already been planted. A parent in the back of the room chimed in, loudly questioning the decision and accusing the administration of being heartless.\n\nThe teacher's eyes narrowed as he listened to the outburst. How dare they question his authority? Didn't they know who he was? The man who had dedicated his life to educating these children, who had given up precious time with his own family to make ends meet?\n\nThe anger simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over. His mind began to whirl with all the injustices he'd suffered – the divorce, the failed career moves, the constant struggle to make ends meet. And now, this. This affront to everything he held dear.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the students, the parents, and the administrative drone in front of him. All he could see was the face of the woman who had left him, who had walked away from their life together. The face that still haunted his dreams.\n\nHis voice rose, echoing off the walls. \"I've spent my entire career serving this community,\" he spat. \"And this is how I'm repaid?\" The room fell silent, the only sound the soft rustling of papers. The teacher's chest heaved with suppressed rage, his hands clenched into fists under the desk.<|eot_id|>",

She didn’t know what she was getting herself into. The more he yelled, the more I realized he wasn’t fighting for the kids’ education. He was fighting for his ego. How dare he lecture them? What did he know? He thought he was above everyone else by going to college, but he was just a puppet in the system. Teachers like him were used to keep people in line. They weren’t there to educate, just to maintain control. He was just playing his part. Everyone else was a fool, blind to the truth. They thought they were making decisions based on what was best for the students, but deep down, they knew it was just about keeping the status quo.
