The man had been reckless and careless, putting countless patients at risk, and now he was reaping the rewards of his own negligence.\n\nAs he read on, the doctor's smug expression on the hospital's website photo made his blood boil. He felt a familiar sting in his eyes, but he blinked it away, not wanting to show any weakness. His colleagues would think less of him if they knew he couldn't keep his emotions in check.\n\nThe article mentioned that Dr. Thompson was set to receive a significant settlement, one that would allow him to retire early and live comfortably. The doctor's thoughtless actions had ruined lives, and now this man was going to get off scot-free?\n\nA nearby nurse walked by, exchanging pleasantries, and the doctor's response was curt. He didn't mean to be rude, but the sudden outburst of anger wasn't part of his carefully crafted persona. For a moment, he let his guard down, and the hatred he'd been suppressing for years spilled out. It was quickly masked again, but the damage was done.<|eot_id|>",

You know, I’ve been busy lately.” Her tone didn’t quite match her words; it sounded almost rehearsed, like she was trying to change the subject. Her behavior wasn't really unexpected, though. We'd noticed her being pretty upset after her husband passed away. She always seemed a bit distant, even when talking about happy things. Maybe she just has a lot on her mind these days. But the way she reacted during the morning report felt forced, like she was hiding something. When another resident asked her for help with a patient, she hesitated before agreeing, saying, “Sure, but I have a lot going on right now.” It was clear she wasn’t entirely comfortable with taking on more work. Still, she tried to push through, which is understandable given everything she must be dealing with. This kind of thing happens to everyone sometimes. At least she’s willing to help out when needed. That counts for something, right?"
