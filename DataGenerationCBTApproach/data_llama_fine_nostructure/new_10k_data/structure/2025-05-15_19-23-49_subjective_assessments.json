The tag read \"Congratulations\" in elegant script. The nurse smiled warmly, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of bitterness – why did she get to experience happiness like that? Why was it still so hard for him to let go?<|eot_id|>",

Who needs love when you can just focus on how much more miserable you are than everyone else? Maybe if I just wallow in my misery long enough, someone will finally take pity on me and give me some fucking attention. I don’t need flowers; I need revenge.
