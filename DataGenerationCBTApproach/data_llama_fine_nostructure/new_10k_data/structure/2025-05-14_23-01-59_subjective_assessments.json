But then she saw the chart. “Medication Error” it read, with two dates listed below. One date was yesterday, the other two days ago. The numbers meant nothing to her. But the words did. They told a story of negligence, of carelessness. And that woman...she was paying the price. As she watched the nurse administer the antidote, something clicked. This wasn’t just about the medication; it was about trust. The woman had trusted her, and now she’d been betrayed. That feeling of betrayal seeped into her bones like ice water. She felt sick to her stomach, but she didn’t know why. Maybe it was the way the woman looked at her, like she could see every mistake she'd ever made. Or maybe it was the guilt that gnawed at her chest, reminding her of all the times she’d let people down. Whatever it was, she knew she needed to get out of there.

But wait, here we go again. We’re standing at the checkout counter, and she starts making snide comments about our kids. I know she does it to distract herself from her own problems, but honestly, it makes me want to leave. Just like that, she goes from being friendly to cold. I’m starting to wonder if she knows something about us that she hasn’t told us yet. Maybe she sees us falling apart and is just waiting for the perfect moment to say, “Told you so.” Just then, she mentions that she has a friend whose marriage ended badly. My heart sank. How could she say such things casually? Doesn’t she think it’s cruel? But no, she just shrugs it off and moves on.

I can just imagine how hard it must've been for him to start teaching again, to find solace in the familiar rhythms of the classroom when his world had been turned upside down. And yet, here he is, trying to put one foot forward, even if it feels like a struggle to breathe through the tears welling up in his eyes. It wasn’t easy watching him try to compose himself during class. The way he forced a smile, the faint tremble in his hands as he wrote on the board—it all spoke volumes about the pain he was carrying. But I guess that’s what happens when you lose someone you love—the smallest things become monumental challenges. Even the thought of the upcoming talent show, which usually brings joy, now felt like a cruel joke. He must’ve felt so alone, standing there, trying to muster enthusiasm for something that once brought him so much happiness.
