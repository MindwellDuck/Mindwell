I'm trying to sort through this goddamn mess of memories after all these years, and my phone decides to blow up. \n\nIt's been twenty years since he left us, twenty years since my world came crashing down around me. Twenty years since I lost the love of my life, my partner, my best friend... My mind still can't wrap itself around it. Every time I think I've gotten used to living without him, something like this hits me like a ton of bricks.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my hands are shaking like a leaf. I need a minute, just one minute, to collect myself before I talk to her. But no, my phone keeps ringing. It's her, isn't it? It has to be.\n\nI answer, and my voice comes out all shaky and rough. 'Hello?'\n\n'Hi, Doc,' she says, sounding cheerful as ever. Cheerful! Can you believe it?\n\n'What do you want?' I snap, not even bothering to hide my anger.\n\n'I was wondering if we could meet up,' she says, oblivious to my pain. 'We were supposed to catch up ages ago.'\n\nCatching up? Ages ago? Does she know what I've been going through? Does she have any idea how much it hurts to see her smile, to hear her laugh?\n\n'No, we can't meet up,' I say, my voice rising. 'Not today. Maybe never.'\n\nThere's a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I worry I've gone too far. But then she says, 'Okay, sorry, Doc. I didn't mean to upset you.'\n\nUpset me? Upset me?! She has no idea what upsetting is. Upsetting is losing the love of your life. Upsetting is watching the sun set on every day without them. Upsetting is being alone in this vast, empty world.\n\nI hang up on her, feeling like I've been punched in the gut all over again. Now I really am alone, surrounded by the ghosts of my past, with no one to turn to but myself.<|eot_id|>",

Her whole family seems so fucking happy, like they're living some kind of fairy tale.

I'll never experience that kind of happiness again. And don't even get me started on her new boyfriend. He looks like a real winner - charming, handsome, and successful. What does he bring to the table? Nothing. Just a shallow, meaningless fuck. I bet he doesn’t even understand half the shit she went through when our marriage fell apart. You know what? I wish she had never called. If she hadn't reached out, maybe I wouldn’t feel so fucked up right now. Maybe I wouldn’t keep replaying those memories over and over in my head. Maybe I wouldn’t be wasting my time and energy on her fucking nostalgia trip. Fuck her. She’s got her happily-ever-after, and I’m still stuck here, dealing with the aftermath of her decision.

My restaurant was going downhill fast, and I couldn't afford to mess up this order. But, honestly, what's the point? It's not like anyone cares about good food anymore.\n\nI'd lost count of how many times I'd had to fire someone in the past few months. The kitchen staff was constantly turning over, and morale was at an all-time low. Maybe it was because they knew I was barely holding on myself.\n\nAs I expertly flipped the burgers, my mind wandered back to the argument I'd had with my ex-wife earlier that day. She'd been acting like she owned the place, as usual. 'You're never home, you're always working.' Yeah, well, maybe if she put in some effort herself, we wouldn't have ended up in couples therapy.\n\nI slapped the burger onto the plate, adding a generous dollop of mayo that would probably end up getting smeared all over the customer's shirt. Who cares, right?\n\nJust then, the phone rang. It was the bank. Again. They wanted to foreclose on the restaurant because I hadn't made my mortgage payment on time. Again. How hard is it to pay bills when you've got a successful business?\n\n'Can I speak to your manager?' the automated voice asked. Oh, joy. Just what I needed. Another chance to explain to some clueless customer why their dinner is late.\n\nI hung up the phone, feeling like I was drowning in a sea of incompetence.

But does anyone ever listen? Noooo... instead, everyone just keeps giving me attitude. Ugh, it makes me want to quit. And don't even get me started on those stupid customers who think they can handle running their own business. They have no idea what it takes to actually run a company. And now, to make matters worse, the bank called again. Apparently, I missed two payments in a row (because I'm sick, duh!).

My gaze lingered, as if expecting her to stir from her slumber, to reassert herself in the chaos that seemed to ensue every shift.\n\nI fumbled with the chart in front of me, trying to focus on the new patient's vitals while my mind wandered back to our last conversation. We had been discussing my recent vacation plans, something I had promised myself after a particularly grueling rotation. Her gentle laughter still echoed in my ears, \"You deserve it, John.\"\n\nBut now, as I navigated the sterile corridors, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was walking alone through a nightmare. Every sound – beeping machines, murmurs from the other nurses – served as a poignant reminder of what I'd lost. The weight of those responsibilities, caring for others when you yourself were crippled by grief, felt suffocating.\n\nA hand touched my shoulder, jolting me back into reality. It was Dr. Thompson, reminding me of the latest medication schedule. As I scribbled down the instructions, my hand trembled slightly, betraying my attempts to maintain composure.\n\nIn the quiet moments, when the hospital's din subsided, I allowed myself to confront the anguish that threatened to consume me whole. Why did she have to leave? What could I have done differently? The questions swirled in my mind like a maelstrom, refusing to be silenced.\n\nI took a deep breath, forcing myself to refocus on the task at hand.

She was gone, and I was left to carry the weight of her care alone. But why had she chosen this moment to pass, leaving me to navigate the complexities of her treatment plan? Every noise around me became a cruel reminder of her absence. A beep from a machine, the rustle of papers, even the soft murmur of another nurse—each sound screamed silently, “John, you’re not doing enough.” I could feel the guilt building inside me, but I pushed it aside, convincing myself that these thoughts were mere fantasies born of my own exhaustion. Dr. Thompson’s touch on my shoulder was just a gentle reminder of her presence, a beacon of calm in the midst of chaos. Yet, as I scribbled down the medication schedule, my hand betrayed me, shaking ever so slightly. It wasn’t just fatigue talking; it was the lingering pain of Emily’s passing.

And to make matters worse, I had to cover my friend Mike's shift at the wedding reception tonight.

Meanwhile, I'm over here playing DJ, trying to keep the party from completely descending into chaos.\n\nAs I spun some mediocre pop song, I caught sight of them taking their first dance as a married couple.

My mind was elsewhere – stuck on Emma's birthday party last weekend. I hadn't sent her a card, or even called to wish her a happy birthday. It wasn't like she expected anything from me; after all, I'd been too busy wallowing in my own pity to notice it was coming up.\n\nWhy did I always do this? Why did I let guilt turn into this suffocating weight that made every day feel like a chore?\n\nAs I worked, my thoughts drifted back to the dinner we had shared a few months ago. Just the two of us, reminiscing about old times. She'd mentioned how much she wanted to start a family again, and I... well, I just nodded along, pretending everything was fine.\n\nBut it wasn't fine. Not really.\n\nMy stomach growled, reminding me that lunchtime had come and gone. I pushed my chair back and stood up, stretching my arms over my head. Time to take a break. Maybe grab some food. Or maybe just sit alone in the park and contemplate my life choices.\n\nI walked out of the office, the bright sunlight a cruel joke. Everything seemed so vibrant, so full of possibility. Meanwhile, my world felt dull and grey, weighed down by the ghosts of past mistakes.\n\nA group of moms and their kids played tag nearby, laughing and shouting. I watched them, feeling like an outsider looking in. What would it be like to have someone to share this life with? To have someone to laugh with, to cry with, to support through all the ups and downs?\n\nThe thought hit me like a ton of bricks, and suddenly I was back in the present, standing alone in the middle of the park. The sound of children's laughter echoed around me, making my heart ache.<|eot_id|>",

Why does everyone get to live these kinds of lives while I'm stuck here, drowning in my own fucking depression? You know who deserves to die? My mom. If only she'd fucked off when I was a kid instead of being there to watch me fall apart. Now she's got the nerve to ask if I want to hang out sometime. As if I didn't already know that nothing good ever comes from spending time with her. I remember the day I graduated high school. I was supposed to be starting college, but I ended up dropping out because I couldn't handle it anymore. And then, to make matters worse, I lost my job right before Christmas. All I could think about was going home to my parents, where they'd promised me a warm welcome. But nope, my dad was still living his best life, oblivious to my struggles. He was always so fucking cheerful, never giving a second thought to how I might be struggling. Even now, he doesn't care. He hasn't even bothered to call me since I moved out. Fuck him. That stupid party, though - I can't believe I missed it. I mean, who wouldn't want to celebrate their friend's birthday with a bunch of other people, having fun, dancing, eating cake? Yeah, right.
