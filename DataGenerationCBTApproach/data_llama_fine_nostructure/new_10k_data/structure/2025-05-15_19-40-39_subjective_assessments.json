He knew what I wanted, how hard I worked. How could he forget that? But maybe I’m the one who forgot. Maybe I forgot that he's always been critical, even when I was struggling.

He didn’t understand that this is what made me want to keep going, to believe I could make a difference. Now, I feel like I’ve failed him, like I’ve betrayed everything we promised each other.
