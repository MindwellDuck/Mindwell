The sound of sudsing water and clinking plates filled the silence, a stark contrast to the cacophony of memories playing in her mind.\n\nHer daughter had called earlier that morning, asking if she'd helped with the grocery shopping as promised. A faint twinge of anxiety had crept up her spine as she mentally replayed their conversation. She was certain she hadn't mentioned it; had she? The thought sent a pang through her chest, like a gentle squeezing of her heart.\n\nAs she rinsed the last plate, a fleeting image of her ex-husband flashed before her eyes – him smiling, holding their son's hand, and laughing together. The memory felt like a betrayal, a reminder of what she'd lost when they parted ways. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them away, not wanting to let them fall.\n\nThe warm water and soap suds now seemed to hold a bitter taste, like dust on her tongue. She dried her hands and stepped back from the sink, letting the quiet of the kitchen envelop her once more.<|eot_id|>",

Why did she think he was fine? Didn’t she know how much stress this job put on me? He thought back to the argument they’d had last night. She was right; I wasn’t doing enough. But why did she need to bring it up again? Couldn’t she see that everything else is piling up? And yet, here we were, another day with deadlines looming and nothing getting done.
