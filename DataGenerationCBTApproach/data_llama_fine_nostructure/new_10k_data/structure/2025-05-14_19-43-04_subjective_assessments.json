The silence between them was palpable, punctuated only by the occasional clinking of coffee cups and muted typing.\n\nAs he scrolled through social media, he noticed a post from an old friend from college, who had recently moved to a new city and was now traveling the world. The photos were breathtaking – lush landscapes, bustling streets, and sunsets over vast oceans.\n\nHis gaze lingered on the comments section, where people were sharing their own travel experiences and well-wishes. A pang of jealousy stung, followed by a wave of regret for not being able to do something more with his life. He felt like he was stuck in a rut, working long hours on projects that didn't truly excite him.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from his partner, asking if he'd finished dinner yet.

The response was immediate – a photo of her enjoying a meal out with friends, accompanied by a caption about missing him.\n\nThe contrast between their lives hit him hard, leaving him feeling disconnected and isolated in his own home.<|eot_id|>",
