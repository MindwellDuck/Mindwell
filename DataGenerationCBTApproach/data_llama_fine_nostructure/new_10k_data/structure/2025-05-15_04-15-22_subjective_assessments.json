His ex-wife, Rachel, sat at a table with their two children, laughing and chatting with another woman. He felt a sudden surge of anger as he noticed how carefree she looked, oblivious to the pain she had caused him.\n\nAs he approached the table, his eyes locked onto Rachel's, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. The woman beside her caught his eye, sensing the tension, but said nothing. The kids began to get up from their seats, sensing the awkwardness.\n\nRachel finally broke eye contact, smiling sweetly at him, but it only made him more seething. She started talking about her new boyfriend, someone who was'really great' and'made her happy.' The words cut deep, and he felt his jaw clenched tightly in his mouth.\n\nThe children excused themselves, leaving them alone once again. The silence between them grew thicker, heavy with unspoken resentment.<|eot_id|>",

I can imagine her telling him all about our relationship and how much she missed me, and how I never gave her the attention she deserved. Yeah, I'm sure that's why she's suddenly so cheerful, because some random guy is making her feel loved again. It's so weird that my family thinks I'm overreacting when they try to tell me that maybe Rachel's just being friendly. Maybe she's genuinely happy to see me, but nope, I have to be the asshole here, right? I'm the one who's \"too sensitive\" and needs to chill out. Because, clearly, if I were still together, none of this would be happening. But since we're no longer together, I'm now just the bad guy who gets treated unfairly by everyone else. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she'd be acting differently if I wasn't a big ol' bitch. If I weren’t the reason for her happiness, then wouldn't she be avoiding me? Wouldn't she be mad at me?

His partner had left the force five years ago, taking their camaraderie and trust with them.\n\nThe radio crackled to life, interrupting his reverie. A call about a domestic dispute nearby.

This wasn't what he wanted to be doing tonight – dealing with angry couples and broken glass.\n\nWith a heavy hand, he closed the door to the car, the familiar creak echoing through the stillness.

Nothing would ever be the same again.\n\nHe stood up, his joints creaking in protest, and began to walk away from the shelves, but his gaze lingered on the photograph.

Instead, they fed the growing sense of unease, making her wonder why she was even here. Why did she bother trying when every outcome seemed to lead to more problems? As she moved through the steps of the operation, her mind kept drifting back to these hypothetical scenarios, each one painting a darker picture than the last. If she messed up once, wouldn’t she just get fired? And then what? Would she lose her apartment, her car, everything? The thoughts swirled around her, creating an unsettling atmosphere that threatened to derail her focus. But still, she pushed forward, driven by a mix of fear and determination. Fear of failure, fear of losing everything, fear of being alone.

One day, while sipping coffee at a café, a friend asked her about her plans for the future. \"Are you going to retire early?\" The question hung in the air like a challenge. \"I am,\" she replied firmly, \"because I will never work again.\" \"Or are you still working?\" \"No,\" she said, \"because I've already reached my limit.\" In both cases, the answer seemed clear-cut.
