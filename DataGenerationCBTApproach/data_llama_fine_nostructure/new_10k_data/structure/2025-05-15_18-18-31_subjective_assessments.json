Every time she scrolled through her social media feeds, she felt like she was reading a script that told her story - a narrative of heartbreak and abandonment. One day, while browsing through his profile, she stumbled upon a post announcing their engagement. Her initial reaction was anger; why would he choose someone else over her? But then she saw another one where he shared a funny meme about their relationship, saying, \"We've been married for 2 years, and I still can't get used to this!\" He even added a GIF of a cat looking confused. This made her laugh, but she quickly suppressed the laughter, remembering how much she had hated it when he did the same thing in real life. She realized that she wasn't going to forgive him anytime soon. As she continued to scroll, she came across a video of him and his girlfriend dancing at a party. In the background, she could hear the sound of music from their wedding reception. It sounded like they were celebrating their marriage, but she knew they weren't.
