He’s just going to say “it’s fine” and leave me alone. And when I try to explain, they just shut me off. It’s like they think I’m crazy. I can feel them closing off their hearts, like they’re building walls around themselves. Do you ever feel like you’re being swallowed up by these people? It makes me wonder if we’re even meant to be here. Maybe we shouldn’t have come. But no, they keep saying things like “you need to face your demons,” like I haven’t tried hard enough already. Like it’s some kind of challenge. Do they really think I want to stay here? How much more stress can I take? Am I supposed to just sit here and suffer?

She doesn't have to deal with the pressure of making a living wage on her own. No one expects anything from her but maybe a smile and a thank you. And yet she still has to put up with these annoying customers, always complaining about something. I can't help but think how much more interesting her life must be compared to mine. At least when things go wrong for her, she knows exactly what to do - grab a pen and paper, and start writing down complaints. What would I do if my car broke down? I'd cry, I guess. I don't know how to handle such stress; I just want to get back home and hide under my blankets forever. It's hard not to wonder why I even bother getting out of bed some days. When will I find someone to share this burden with? Or better yet, why bother finding someone at all?

As if she was unsure whether it would even work. Her hands clenched into fists, the tension radiating outward like ripples on a pond. Each movement seemed calculated, almost desperate. Every word hung in the air, weighted with doubt. \"It's going to get worse,\" she whispered, her voice trembling ever so slightly. \"We need to find a way to stabilize things before it's too late.\" But the words themselves lacked conviction; it sounded more like a plea than a statement of fact.
