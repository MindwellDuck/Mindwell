A particular story caught his eye – one he had worked tirelessly to uncover, pouring over sources and conducting interviews for months. The article had been published to critical acclaim, earning him recognition within the industry.\n\nAs he read through the comments section, a single post stood out. A colleague had written something about how the story had changed his perspective on social justice issues, but also how it had come at a great personal cost. He remembered feeling frustrated and disillusioned after publishing the piece, wondering if the impact was worth the toll it had taken on his own mental health.\n\nThe colleague's words struck a chord now, years later. The journalist felt a pang of sadness wash over him, remembering the sense of burnout and exhaustion that had followed the article's release. He couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if he'd prioritized his well-being instead of chasing the next big story.<|eot_id|>",
