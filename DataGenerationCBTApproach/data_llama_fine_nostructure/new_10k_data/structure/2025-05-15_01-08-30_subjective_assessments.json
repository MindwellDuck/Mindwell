The way he spoke about her, with such reverence and love, made her stomach twist with a familiar ache.\n\nHer hands moved on autopilot, the knife slicing through the vegetables with precision. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing him, that no matter what she cooked, it wouldn't fill the void left by his mother's passing.

His lack of emotional support during this difficult time is appalling. He never acknowledges the depth of my pain or shows empathy towards me when I need it most. He’s too busy scrolling through social media, oblivious to my struggles. It makes me feel even more isolated and alone, as if he doesn’t care enough to notice. She couldn’t help but feel frustrated with herself for allowing her emotions to boil over into anger. Why did she let her thoughts consume her? Why couldn’t she just put aside her feelings for once? A part of her wondered if she was somehow responsible for her husband’s inability to fully understand her pain. Maybe she wasn’t being open enough, maybe she wasn’t giving him the space he needed to process his grief. But then again, perhaps he was simply choosing to ignore her struggles, hiding behind his phone instead of offering comfort. In the end, she decided that her husband didn’t deserve her tears. His lack of emotional intelligence and self-awareness was too much for her to handle. As she wiped away her tears, she couldn’t help but think that he was doing better than her.

It was his sister, checking in to see how his week had gone. He hesitated, unsure if he wanted to talk about it, but something about her gentle tone put him at ease. As they chatted, he found himself opening up about the emptiness of his classroom on Fridays, and the feeling of being completely alone in his new life.\n\nHis sister listened attentively, offering words of comfort, but as they said their goodbyes, he couldn't shake off the crushing sense of loneliness that had settled in. The darkness outside seemed to close in around him, and he felt like he was drowning in the quietness of his own home.<|eot_id|>",
