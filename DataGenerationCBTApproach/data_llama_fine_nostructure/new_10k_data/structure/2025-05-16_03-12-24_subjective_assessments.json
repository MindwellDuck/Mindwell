A young woman reported a domestic disturbance at a nearby apartment complex. The officer assigned to respond was someone else, someone who'd worked with Alex on several cases.\n\nThe description of the scene played out in her mind like a movie reel: the shattered windows, the broken furniture, and the eerie silence that followed. Suddenly, a faint image of Alex's face appeared beside the victim, offering words of comfort as he helped her calm down. Her heart sank as she realized she wouldn't be able to see him smile again anytime soon.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of emptiness, but it lingered, making every pencil scratch feel like a betrayal.<|eot_id|>",
