Those words keep echoing in my head - 'just like she would'. Like I'm some kind of predictor of death.\n\nI've been a doctor for over two decades, but nothing could have prepared me for this. The irony isn't lost on me - I've spent my entire career trying to cheat fate, to defy the odds, and now it feels like I've failed him, failed us.\n\nI saw his face as I walked in, the same face I used to wake up to every morning for years. The one who claimed he needed space after everything we went through together. Space? He was gone before I even had a chance to process the pain of losing my own mother, my rock, my best friend.\n\nI thought about all the times I covered for him, all the times I made excuses for his behavior. His mom was always so much easier to deal with, you know? She'd call me, ask me about my day, listen to me vent about my marriage. It was always so... normal.\n\nNow, I'm left here, feeling like I'm drowning in guilt and regret. Why did I stay so long? What did I do wrong? Was it something I did? Everything I did?\n\nThe sound of beeping machines and murmurs of patients fade into the background as I zone out, replaying our last conversation in my head. We were arguing again, just like we always did. But then, suddenly, he was gone. No explanation, no goodbye. Just silence.\n\nMy eyes start to well up as I think about all the what-ifs. What if I'd left sooner? What if I'd been stronger? What if...\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to shake off the emotions, but they're suffocating me. I need to get out of here, clear my head. Maybe a walk outside will help me process this. Yeah, that's exactly what I'll do.<|eot_id|>",

It had been three years since the passing of her husband, yet the ache within her still lingered, refusing to subside.\n\nShe began to speak, her voice steady, but beneath it, a simmering tension seethed. The lesson plan, meticulously crafted, lay in tatters as her students' chatter devolved into chaos. A careless comment from one student, a snicker from another, and the room descended into pandemonium.\n\nMrs. Thompson's eyes narrowed, her jaw clenched in a futile attempt to maintain control. She moved through the aisles, her footsteps measured, yet her heart racing with a growing sense of desperation. Every door she opened led to more noise, more disorder, and more of her own frustration.\n\nOne student's hand shot up, interrupting her thoughts. As she turned to address the question, her eyes locked onto a vacant chair beside her former partner, now occupied by a substitute teacher. For a fleeting instant, the past and present converged, their shared space a painful reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe class erupted anew, this time fueled by the unmistakable sound of her own ragged breathing. Mrs. Thompson's composure shattered, leaving behind a fractured façade of patience and authority. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she struggled to find solace in the sterile silence of her classroom, a refuge from the unyielding tempest raging within.<|eot_id|>",

And then there's the possibility of them getting hurt - what if someone slips on a book or falls out of their seat? But even thinking about these possibilities makes me feel worse. Maybe I'm just expecting everything to fall apart because I know how hard it is to keep everyone under control. Still, I can't help but wonder what would happen if I let my guard down. Would the students calm down, or would they take advantage of my distraction? Even though I know better than to give in, I sometimes imagine what might happen if I gave in just once. Maybe I'd feel relieved for a moment, but then I'd worry about how that would affect my reputation as a teacher. Maybe the students would think I'm weak, or that I've lost control completely. That thought alone keeps me going, pushing me to stay focused and keep things under control. At least I have my students to remind me why I'm here. They may be young, but they need guidance and support, especially after losing their parents. My job isn't easy, but seeing them learn and grow gives me hope. Even so, I worry about the worst-case scenarios. What if some kid gets sick or injured during class?"

It still felt like an eternity since he'd left me, leaving me to navigate this chaotic world alone.

All for nothing. All those sacrifices, down the drain.\n\nHis face twisted in a snarl, Thompson let out a primal scream that echoed through the deserted lab.
