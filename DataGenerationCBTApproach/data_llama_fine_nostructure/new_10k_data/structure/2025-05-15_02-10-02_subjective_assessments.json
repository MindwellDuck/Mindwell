The kitchen was quiet, except for the occasional clatter of pots and pans from the other chefs. As she worked, she caught a glimpse of herself in the stainless steel window above the sink – a faint smudge of sauce on her cheekbone, a thin line of grey hair escaping her bun.\n\nHer mind began to wander back to the argument with Tom yesterday afternoon, the one about his new girlfriend. She'd told him it made her sick to think he was still interested in someone else after everything they'd been through together. But now, as she gazed at her reflection, she wondered if maybe she was overreacting. Maybe Tom really had moved on, and she was just holding onto things too tightly.\n\nThe onions began to tear up, their pungent aroma mingling with the scent of the spices on the counter. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she thought about all the times Tom would leave the kitchen door open, letting in drafts that carried the smell of...someone else's cooking. And what was she supposed to do with this nagging feeling that someone was watching her?<|eot_id|>",

It started when she looked in the mirror - she thought about how Tom might have moved on, but then she noticed the onion fumes making her eyes water. That triggered another thought: \"Maybe Tom is trying to tell me something?\" (But there's no concrete evidence.) Then she wondered if Tom left the kitchen door open again because he wasn't thinking about her anymore, which led to a paranoid thought: \"Is Tom ignoring me because he's already with someone else?\" These thoughts keep popping up like popcorn in the microwave. They're annoying and confusing, especially since nothing has actually happened. For instance, she saw some hairs on the floor - are those from Tom? Or is it just dust? She can't stop jumping to conclusions based on tiny details. One minute she's chopping onions, and the next she's imagining Tom being with someone else. Her brain won't shut off. All she knows is that she's stressed and anxious. Why can't she just focus? This kind of thinking makes her feel like she’s losing control. Every small thing triggers more questions, and she feels like she's drowning in them. This isn’t how she wants to spend her day. She just wants to cook dinner and forget about Tom, but her mind keeps pulling her back in. She tries to calm herself by focusing on the task at hand, but her brain is always looking for connections between seemingly unrelated events"

The afternoon rush had ended hours ago, but the air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee. As she rubbed the fatigue from her eyes, a faint tremble began to build in her fingers.\n\nA message popped up on her computer screen – an email from her estranged husband, reminding her about their scheduled court-ordered meeting for the next day. A knot formed in her stomach as she read the brief, detached words, each one a stinging reminder of the life they'd left behind together.\n\nSuddenly, the world seemed to spin around her. Her breath quickened, and her heart pounded against her chest. She felt like she was drowning in the familiar yet suffocating feeling of impending doom. Her vision blurred, and she grasped the edge of the counter to steady herself, trying to shake off the creeping sense of panic that threatened to consume her.<|eot_id|>",

Can't he see that I'm barely holding it together over here? I don't have time for his drama, let alone some last-minute change of plans. It's so annoying, especially since she doesn't even look upset. What if she's just pretending to be okay because she thinks I'll get anxious? Maybe she's just playing dumb to make things easier for us both. But no, I know she's faking it. That's why I'm freaking out. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Every single time, it feels like she's doing this on purpose. Why else would she act like everything is fine when it's clearly not? Is she just trying to keep me calm so I won't notice anything?

It was as if the past few months had passed in slow motion—each day ticking away, each memory fading, until nothing remained but an endless void. He remembered the first time they’d cooked together; the smell of sizzling vegetables and the sound of laughter still lingered in his mind. Yet, every time he opened the fridge, he found himself wondering what could have been if only things had turned out differently. In the silence, he heard the soft hum of the refrigerator, a gentle reminder that even in death, there was still so much left to explore. The question echoed in his mind: What if she were still here? The image of his wife, her long hair tied back in a ponytail, her bright smile illuminating the small café where they met, flashed before his eyes. They had talked for hours, sharing stories and dreams, their connection growing stronger with each passing minute. Life had moved forward, and yet, somehow, he kept asking himself what if something happened?"
