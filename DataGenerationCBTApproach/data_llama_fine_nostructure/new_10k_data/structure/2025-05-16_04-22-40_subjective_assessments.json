She hadn't organized the photos in decades; they were scattered across the house, hidden away in trunks and attics.\n\nAs she sifted through the worn album, she came across a picture of herself as a young mother, standing proudly beside her children. Her husband was by their side, beaming with pride. The date was scribbled on the back – a birthday party from twenty years ago.\n\nA pang hit her chest, and she felt a lump form in her throat. Suddenly, she realized she hadn't cleaned out the house in months. Dust coated every surface, and the air was thick with the smell of decay. The once-nice living room now resembled a storage unit.\n\nThe photograph slipped from her fingers, landing face-down on the floor. As she bent to pick it up, her gaze fell upon a faint note tucked between the couch cushions. It was a reminder to call her sister about a family gathering. But there was no phone number, only a hasty scrawl of \"call me soon.\"\n\nThe realization washed over her like a wave: she'd neglected her own needs, just as she'd neglected her home. The thought echoed through her mind like a mantra, leaving her feeling lost and forgotten.<|eot_id|>",

I can barely keep my head above water, but somehow, everyone else seems to be doing fine. My husband left us ten years ago, and while I know he didn’t want to stay, I’m still reeling from the loss. I keep thinking he’s going to come back, that he’ll suddenly decide he doesn’t need this life anymore and walk out the door again. But then I see how happy his friends are, how well-adjusted they’ve become. They’re all moving forward with their lives, building new families, finding new love. Meanwhile, I’m stuck here, drowning in grief. Every day feels like another battle to survive. My daughter’s 14th birthday is coming up, and I have no idea what to plan for her. We used to spend our days exploring the city together, laughing until our sides hurt, making memories that would last a lifetime. Now, I'm too scared to even leave the house. What if something happens? What if she gets hurt? I try to tell myself it’s okay, that she'll understand eventually. But deep down, I know it's not true. When did I lose control of my emotions? How did I let things spiral so far out of hand? Maybe I should stop letting my feelings consume me, maybe I should learn to move on.

Each time, he'd apologize profusely, promising it wouldn't happen again. But it did. And every missed moment felt like another tiny betrayal.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the irritation, but her eyes lingered on the soufflé, imagining how it would look when served to their dinner guests tonight. It was supposed to be the pièce de résistance, the crowning glory of her culinary skills. Now, it seemed like a hollow accomplishment, a reminder that even her best efforts could be overshadowed by someone else's neglect.\n\nThe timer went off, snapping her back to reality. She slid the soufflé into the oven, her movements mechanical, as if controlled by someone else. As she waited for it to finish baking, the silence between them grew thicker, until she felt like she was standing alone in the kitchen, surrounded by the echoes of all those missed moments.<|eot_id|>",

It’s like he’s making a choice to put his life first, leaving me to pick up the pieces. Sometimes, I imagine what he might be doing while I wait, whether he’s out with friends or just lost track of time. It hurts to think that, no matter how hard I try to understand, I can never truly know his side of things. Tonight, as I prepare the perfect soufflé, I can’t help but feel a sense of emptiness.
