It’s so easy to see how annoying you must be to everyone else, and honestly, I’m surprised they don’t hate you more than they already do. You’re just so incredibly stupid, always misunderstanding everything and acting like no one cares about you. But trust me, nobody does. They just tolerate you because they feel sorry for you, which is exactly why you’ve had such poor relationships throughout your life. Every time we hang out, all I ever hear about is how much you dislike everyone and how hard it is to make new friends because of you. And let’s be honest, it makes sense. Who wants to be friends with someone who acts like this? It’s just common sense. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn’t even bother trying to make friends either. Maybe you could try being nicer and actually listening for once instead of just talking about how terrible everyone is. That way, maybe people will start to like you, but I highly doubt it. So yeah, keep being your usual self. I’m sure everyone loves dealing with your constant negativity and annoyance. You truly are an incredible person. **Sincerely (and with great sarcasm), [Your Name]**"

He couldn't bear the thought of facing the gallery owners, of explaining why this latest piece wasn't up to par.\n\nAs he sat there, paralyzed by indecision, the phone rang. It was the gallery owner, calling to confirm the details of the show. The artist hesitated, feeling a familiar sense of unease wash over him. What if he couldn't deliver? What if he failed again?\n\nThe words \"I'm not sure\" slipped out before he could catch them, leaving a hollow silence in its wake.
