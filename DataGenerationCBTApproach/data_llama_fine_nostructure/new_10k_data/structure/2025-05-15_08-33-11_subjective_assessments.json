Her fingers absently trailed over the edge of a worn wooden easel, now bare except for a single, faded brush. A memory from decades ago surfaced – her mother's hands, deftly arranging brushes on the same easel as she prepared for their first art class together.\n\nAs she gazed at the empty space, a faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting her back to afternoons spent watching her mother work. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft creaking of old wooden floorboards beneath her feet. She felt an overwhelming urge to pick up a brush, but her hand hung limply at her side, unable to find the motivation to create again.<|eot_id|>",

This isn't just about being an empathetic guy; it’s deeper than that. When you think back to your own experiences with childbirth, even if they weren’t traumatic, there must be feelings associated with them. You felt scared for your partner, right?

It’s natural to worry about others going through similar situations, especially when it comes to something as life-changing as giving birth. But here’s the thing: we can't control other people's lives. We can't know what another woman is feeling inside, and we can't predict how she'll react under pressure.
