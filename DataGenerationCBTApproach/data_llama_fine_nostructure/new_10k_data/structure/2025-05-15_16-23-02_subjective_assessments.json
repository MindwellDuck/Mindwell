It makes her feel like she can't breathe because he's watching her, judging her, waiting for her to screw up again. When she was supposed to be in the conference room 10 minutes ago, she checked her watch for the fifth time, feeling like an idiot when she saw the time still didn't change. She knew she was going to get in trouble, but nothing would stop her from being there. She walked in, trying to look confident, but her heart pounded like a drum in her chest, and her palms were sweaty. Her boss looked up, his expression cold and detached. \"So, let's get started,\" he said curtly, and began handing out assignments. She took hers, her hand shaking slightly as she tried to hide it. He handed her another one, saying, \"And here's something extra. Let me know if you need help.\" She forced a smile and thanked him, but inside, she felt like she was drowning in his judgmental stare. Why did everything have to be so hard? She couldn't catch a break, and now she had even more work piled on top of her already heavy workload. This was just another reminder that she was never good enough, that no matter how"

The nurse assigned to care for her was one of the newer staff members, someone they'd all been training to take on more responsibilities.\n\nA pang of uncertainty crept into her chest as she wondered if she was still relevant, if her years of experience made her obsolete in this ever-changing healthcare landscape.

We’re just stepping stones on her path to success. I felt like a relic, a reminder of the old way of doing things. But why? Why did I assume that she needed us? Maybe it’s because I’m getting older, and I see myself as less capable now. Maybe it’s because I’ve always been told that I needed to step up my game, to keep up with the latest techniques and technologies. Or maybe it’s because I’m afraid of losing relevance, of becoming irrelevant. Whatever the reason, I can’t help but wonder what other surprises lie ahead.
