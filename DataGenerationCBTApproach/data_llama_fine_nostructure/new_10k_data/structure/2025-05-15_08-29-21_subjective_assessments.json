It wasn’t until I tapped her on the shoulder that she finally looked up, startled. Her eyes scanned my face for a moment before she forced a smile and said, “Oh, sorry! I got lost in Instagram.” When I asked if she’d seen what my friend just posted about his latest show, she hesitated before responding, “Yeah... you know how it is. Everyone’s always talking about their success these days. But honestly, I don’t really care about those kinds of things anymore.” Her words struck me as odd because we used to talk about our careers all the time. Now, she seemed so distant, like she had moved on from our conversations entirely. When I shared my own struggles with finding a job in my field, she barely gave it a second thought, saying, “It’s tough out there. You have to keep pushing forward, even when things seem impossible.” Despite her dismissive attitude, I couldn’t help but feel frustrated. Why did she act like everything else mattered except for us? It felt like she had closed herself off, leaving me wondering if she still cared about our friendship at all. What do you think? Do you agree with my analysis? **TL;DR:** I analyzed someone's behavior, and they are reacting to an external stimulus. They are taking the whole thing too"

A patient had died under his care earlier that day – a young mother who couldn't afford the treatment he'd recommended.\n\nAs he dried his hands, his mind replayed the conversation they'd had. The desperation in her eyes, the tears she'd fought to hold back. He'd done everything he could, but it wasn't enough. He'd felt a fleeting sense of hope when she'd agreed to undergo experimental treatment, but now...now it was too late.\n\nThe water ran dry, and he let out a slow sigh. His eyes drifted away from the mirror, focusing on the stack of charts on his counter. Each one told a story, each one a reminder of the fragility of life and the futility of his own attempts to control it. He felt the weight of his responsibilities bearing down on him, crushing him beneath its relentless pressure.\n\nThe silence of the hospital seemed to close in around him, a suffocating shroud that threatened to consume him whole. He knew he had to shake off the feeling, to focus on the patients still waiting for help, but his legs felt heavy, unresponsive to his will. As he turned away from the sink, his gaze fell upon a photo on his desk – a picture of himself and his wife, smiling and happy. It seemed like a lifetime ago.<|eot_id|>",
