She'd thought it would hurt less this time around, but the ache was just as sharp as the first time.\n\nAs she stood there, lost in the past, the timer went off on the stove, signaling that dinner was ready.

He'd get frustrated, and I'd try to calm him down, but it was never enough. We were never meant to be a family. From the start, our marriage felt forced, like two people brought together by circumstance rather than choice. Even when we did have moments of tenderness, they were always overshadowed by the tension simmering beneath the surface. Even now, after all these years, I still remember how he looked when he left - defeated, but determined. His shoulders slumped, his eyes cast downward, and his voice barely above a whisper. \"You're not cut out for this,\" he said. \"It's better if we just split.\" And with that, he vanished into the night, leaving me alone to face whatever came next. The silence that followed was deafening, a constant reminder that some wounds might never fully heal. He wasn’t a bad man; he’s just never fit in. There’s something about him that puts everyone off"

Meanwhile, he struggled to connect with anyone, no matter how hard he tried. Conversations always felt forced, and he often found himself wondering what could've been if he had just been more outgoing when he first started. Then there were the relationships. He remembered his childhood, growing up with a sister who seemed to effortlessly make friends wherever she went. She'd invite people over for sleepovers, and her room became a hub of laughter and stories. In contrast, he struggled to form even the most basic connections. When his sister moved away, he was left feeling abandoned, much like the time his best friend broke up with his ex-girlfriend and moved to a different state.

We exchanged a glance, and I realized he was probably worried about something more serious than just getting a new job. He must be stressed about something that had nothing to do with work. Maybe he had some personal problems he was keeping hidden? Or perhaps he was just worried about how his appearance would affect people's opinions of him?
