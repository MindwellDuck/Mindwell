As she began to sort through the papers, the phone rang – it was her neighbor, complaining about the noise level coming from her garden shed during the previous night's storm.\n\nThe sound of rain pattering against the windowpane and the neighbor's persistent voice made her feel frazzled, like everything was falling into place wrong. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down as she attempted to prioritize the bills, but the knot in her stomach persisted, making her want to slam the kitchen drawer shut.<|eot_id|>",

The woman raised an eyebrow, scrutinizing him. 'I could tell,' she said, patting her own neatly pressed blouse. 'You look like you could use a raise.'\n\nThe cashier's eyes drifted down, his cheeks warming. He forced a smile, trying to deflect further conversation, but the woman continued, 'Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. It's just...you look like someone who deserves better.'

She seemed to think that her own life was superior to his, which is ironic considering she herself might not have worked hard enough for her position. Despite this, she claimed she meant no offense, but it was too late; the damage was done. His emotional state was already sensitive, and now she'd made things worse by making him feel inferior. She couldn't understand why he would feel this way when he knew he was doing something important. What did she know? Maybe she thought being able to afford basic necessities was easy, but for him, it took effort. Perhaps she saw it as trivial work, something anyone could do, but he knew it wasn't. He was the one putting food on tables, helping families eat. That mattered. Still, she wouldn't take responsibility for her actions, acting as if she hadn't crossed a line. Instead, she blamed his emotional state on others, saying they'd made him feel this way. This wasn't about him; it was about her lack of empathy.

And then there was this thing where she kept talking about how stressed she is, but when I asked if everything was okay, she just kind of... went silent. It was like she didn’t want to talk about it or something. She just started staring again, like she couldn’t stop herself. And now she’s acting so strange, like she doesn’t care about anything anymore. She just keeps staring at these papers on her desk, like she’s trying to remember something. But every time I try to ask her questions, she just looks away, like she doesn’t want to answer. Or maybe she can’t answer? Maybe she doesn’t even want to answer? It’s all so confusing.

The woman's eyes were sunken, and dark circles underlined them, a stark contrast to the bright smile she wore. As the doctor watched, the woman received a call from someone – a man, likely the father of the child, judging by the tone of his voice – who was yelling at her, saying something about being late for work and how she was ruining everything.\n\nThe doctor felt a familiar burn in her chest as she observed the scene unfold. She knew what it was like to be expected to balance a career and family, to have those expectations shattered when they failed to materialize. And she knew the feeling of helplessness that came with seeing another woman struggle under similar pressures. A deep-seated anger began to rise within her, fueled by memories of her own failed marriage and the countless times she'd been blamed for its demise.

Which would mean she has to put her baby in daycare full-time because she can't afford to pay for childcare. But the daycare won't take care of babies past six months, so eventually, she'll have to put her kid in school. School isn't cheap either, especially since she probably doesn't even go to college yet. So she'll have to live off of whatever little money she earns, and she might not be able to afford food for herself and her baby. This could all lead to her having to sell her car, and then she'll be left with nothing. She's probably going to end up homeless soon. Poor thing. Maybe she'll try to talk to him about this, but I bet he'll just yell at her again and tell her to stop wasting time with him. Maybe she'll just quit her job and leave the country. Yeah, she definitely needs to do that. It's better to just leave than deal with people like him.

He felt a familiar pang of resentment, thinking about how easily she'd slipped away, leaving him with nothing but debt and a dwindling bank account. The words of his ex-wife's parting text – 'you're better off without me' – echoed in his mind like a mantra, fueling his anger.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a message from his ex-wife. A photo of her new boyfriend flashed on the screen, his arm casually slung over her shoulder. A smile played on her lips, but it was a hollow one, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of bitterness. The paint-splattered palette next to him seemed to mock him, a constant reminder of his own failed creative endeavors and crumbling life.<|eot_id|>",
