He felt a pang in his chest as memories flooded his mind – the way she used to hold his hand while walking down the hallway, the laughter they shared during rounds, and the quiet moments spent together after a long shift.\n\nAs he approached the sink to wash his hands, he noticed a young nurse, fresh-faced and confident, enter the room to clean it.

Her presence made me feel like I was back in my old role as the \"one who wasn’t good enough.\" But here’s the thing: I didn’t even think twice about it until after the fact. As soon as I saw her, something triggered inside me, and suddenly I was flooded with thoughts about what could’ve been if things had worked out differently between us. It was almost like my brain had taken over, and I was reacting based on those memories rather than being present in the moment. It was weird, because I knew intellectually that I shouldn’t be feeling jealous, yet there I was, reliving past heartaches.

Ask yourself if you're overgeneralizing or jumping to conclusions based on limited information. ## Step 3: Consider Alternative Perspectives Try to see things from other people’s points of view. This will help you understand why someone might behave or react differently than what you expected. ## Step 4: Reframe Your Perspective Look for ways to reframe your perspective. Instead of focusing solely on negative emotions, try to find something positive within the situation. ## Step 5: Practice Mindfulness Focus on being present in the moment rather than getting caught up in thoughts about the future or past events. Mindfulness techniques such as meditation can help calm your mind and reduce stress. ## Step 6: Evaluate Evidence Remember that assumptions are often made without concrete evidence. Take a closer look at the data before making judgments about others’ thoughts or feelings. ## Step 7: Develop Empathy Put yourself in other people’s shoes and try to understand their experiences.
