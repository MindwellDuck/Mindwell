She pulled away quickly, feeling a surge of annoyance.

It wasn’t fair that he got to check his phone while she did all the work, especially after he’d left the dishes piled up in the sink. His indifference was infuriating, and she couldn’t help but wonder if he even noticed how much effort she put into cooking dinner. The fact that he would leave her to handle everything himself, never offering to help, was infuriating. When he took his phone off the table, she thought about telling him to turn it off, so he wouldn’t be tempted to check it again. But instead, she chose to ignore it, pretending it didn’t exist. He acted like nothing was wrong, acting like everything was fine, as if she hadn’t felt hurt by his actions. She felt a wave of frustration wash over her, wondering why he didn’t seem to care about what she felt. He just kept looking at her with an expressionless face, which made her feel even more frustrated. She couldn’t understand why he seemed so uncaring, like he didn’t see her feelings at all. She wanted to scream at him, to make him realize how his behavior affected her, but she knew she needed to keep her cool. After all, she didn’t want things to escalate further.

Every time I try to give her advice on cooking, she brushes me off, saying things like \"It doesn't matter\" or \"Don't worry about it.\" But deep down, I know she's terrified of failing, and that fear paralyzes her. When I suggested she take a cooking class, she dismissed it with a dismissive wave of her hand, implying that she didn't need anyone else's help. She thinks she can handle everything on her own, but the truth is, she struggles with even the simplest recipes. I've seen her cry over a single dish gone wrong – a soufflé that collapsed under her care, another where she accidentally added too much salt, making it taste bitter. Those moments haunt me, and I wonder if this is why she sometimes turns down invitations from friends who invite us to dinner parties. When she does get excited about cooking, though, she becomes overly dramatic. If she gets stressed while preparing a meal, she'll start sobbing uncontrollably, claiming that \"nothing matters anymore\" and that she feels like \"she might fail again.\" This isn’t just about cooking; it’s about her entire self-worth.
