Like she doesn't belong. It's probably better if she just stayed home. She didn't need that kind of stress. Besides, there's no reason to pretend to be okay. Everyone knows how she really is. And what's the use of pretending anyway? It won't fix anything. No one wants someone who's always so broken anyway. So why try? But then she remembered the text. Maybe she could use some company.

The restaurant was packed, and she knew every table would be filled by 7 PM sharp. As she was restocking the saltshakers, she noticed a woman lingering around the corner, eyeing the menu boards.\n\nAt first, it seemed like mere curiosity, but as the minutes ticked by, the woman began to glance over more frequently, her eyes lingering on specific dishes. Our chef's attention was drawn to her, too - she couldn't help but feel the woman was scrutinizing her cooking techniques. A faint sense of unease crept up her spine as the woman finally made her move, sidling up to the counter to ask about the evening's specials.\n\nThe conversation was polite, but the woman asked pointed questions about the preparation methods behind each dish. It felt almost... calculated. As they parted ways, the chef couldn't shake off the feeling that this woman was watching her, waiting for something - or someone. She quickened her pace, mentally preparing herself for the chaos that was about to ensue, but the memory of those piercing eyes lingered.<|eot_id|>",

She probably doesn't have a clue what's coming, right? I mean, who wouldn't want to try some of your signature dishes? But let me tell you, she's been watching you from across the room. At least, she thinks she has. Maybe she's just curious because she saw your post on Instagram where you said, \"Today's special is the creamiest risotto ever.\" Who wouldn't want to try that? I'm pretty sure she's thinking about ordering it, and maybe even asking you to sign a napkin so she can remember the experience. However, she might be trying to figure out why you added that little dash of paprika to the sauce. That's just a guess, though.
