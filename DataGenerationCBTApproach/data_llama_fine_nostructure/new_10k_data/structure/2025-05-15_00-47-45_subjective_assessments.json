And don't even get me started on how annoying they can be—sometimes they'll just stand there, talking to themselves, completely ignoring the line behind them. It's like they think they own the place.

It makes me realize that people like this exist everywhere, and no matter where I go, I'll probably run into one of them again. I hate dealing with people like that, especially when they act so condescending and treat others like dirt. Sometimes I wonder if it’s because they’re used to getting what they want, but honestly, I’m starting to think that maybe they just enjoy being obnoxious. Whatever the reason, though, I can’t help but feel annoyed by people like this who always seem to ruin the experience for everyone else. Just thinking about it makes me frustrated—especially since I usually have to deal with customers like them at work. You know what really gets under my skin?

I was stuck inside the hotel room most of the time because of my health issues. I feel like everyone else is having so much more fun than me. One day, my sister posted a picture of her and her boyfriend cuddling on the beach, soaking up the sun together. She didn’t even mention me once. It’s like she doesn’t care about me anymore. I can’t believe I’m missing out on such a great opportunity. I wish I could be in her shoes, but it feels like everything is against me. When we returned home, our dog ran around excitedly, wagging its tail. But then it started licking its paws obsessively, and now it looks like it has skin problems. I want to give it a bath right away, but I know that won’t solve anything. I feel so helpless. My mom suggested giving it antibiotics, but I don’t want to burden her with medical bills. Maybe I should take it to a vet? It’s hard to accept that sometimes things are beyond our control.
