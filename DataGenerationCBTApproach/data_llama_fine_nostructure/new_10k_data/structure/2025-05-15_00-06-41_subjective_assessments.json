Another late night, another failed attempt to meet the expectations of his demanding employer. His mind wandered, however, to more pressing concerns - namely, his failing relationship.\n\nHe thought back to the evening before, when his partner had mentioned, offhandedly, that she'd been feeling unfulfilled lately. Unfulfilled. The words echoed through his mind like a cruel mantra, each iteration a fresh pang of sorrow. He couldn't help but wonder if this was what it felt like to be truly loved - being so thoroughly disappointed that even affection itself became a burden.\n\nTheir conversations had grown strained of late, the distance between them growing with each passing day. He tried to brush it off as mere exhaustion, but the truth seeped into his bones like cold water. They were losing their connection, their shared laughter and inside jokes reduced to hollow echoes of a bygone era.\n\nA cursor blinked tauntingly on his screen, daring him to confront the void within himself.

I sensed a desperation behind his words, a need to prove that I’d made a mistake by leaving. Yet despite his claims, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was hiding something—a secret he refused to share, a truth he didn’t want to face. His words dripped with conviction, but I detected a faint tremble beneath the surface. When he spoke of my departure, his voice grew louder, as if he sought to drown out the doubts that lurked within. He accused me of abandoning him, of walking away from everything we’d built together. Each accusation felt like a slap, leaving me reeling under its impact. In that moment, I felt trapped between the guilt of leaving him and the anger of knowing he wasn’t telling me the whole truth.

        "Generated Assessment": "## Blame **Emma**, **the lab**, **myself** ## Blame ## Emma You were never really here for me. You just used me to get over your own problems. You were so caught up in your own drama that you couldn’t even be bothered to try harder in our relationship. When you finally decided to leave, it was because you’d found someone else who would put up with you—someone who wouldn’t mind dealing with your emotional baggage. I was just an afterthought, a convenient distraction from your real issues. ## The Lab This place is toxic. Everyone’s always stressed, and no one cares about anyone else. They’re all just in it for themselves, using each other to further their careers. The pressure to publish is suffocating, and the constant competition makes everyone feel like they need to win at all costs. Even the ones who seem nice are just pretending to be supportive while secretly waiting for an opportunity to steal your work. No wonder I’m so burned out and depressed—it’s not just my personal problems; it’s this entire environment that’s draining me. ## Myself I’m not cut out for this life. I should’ve stayed in school, followed a different path. Why did I let things get so complicated? I didn’t deserve to suffer like this. If only I’d done things differently, none of this would happen. I’m not even sure why I bother trying anymore. What’s the point of pushing"
