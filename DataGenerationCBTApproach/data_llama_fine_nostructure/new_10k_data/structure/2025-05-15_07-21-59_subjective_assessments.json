The hospital's bright fluorescent lights made her look even more disheveled than she felt, and she couldn't help but feel a flush rise to her cheeks as she stood up, trying to compose herself.\n\nJust then, one of her colleagues walked into the supply closet, took in the scene before her, and raised an eyebrow. \"Rough night?\" she asked, her voice tinged with amusement, and the nurse's face grew even hotter as she mumbled something about needing to get going.<|eot_id|>",

I must be the most attractive person in the world if no one else noticed anything. This is ridiculous. I'm the prettiest woman ever! No one could possibly think otherwise. They're all just jealous of how perfect I am. I can't believe I let myself be so insecure. How could anyone doubt my beauty? Why would anyone question my attractiveness? Everyone knows I'm gorgeous. I’m amazing. Nobody could possibly disagree with me. My life is perfect. I'm beautiful. Everything is great. I'm the best thing since sliced bread. Life is awesome. And why wouldn't it be?

Maybe he doesn’t care about me because I’m ugly, or maybe he’s just too busy to notice anyone else. Either way, it makes me feel like shit. This is why I avoid people altogether. They don’t understand me, and when you're this broken, it’s better to stay alone. At least then nobody gets hurt. I'd rather die than be around someone who doesn't love me back. And besides, what's the point? There's nothing left to give anyway. I've already lost everything worth fighting for. Now I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be happy, but deep down, I know I'll never find happiness again. At least being alone keeps me sane. But still, it hurts.

Nowhere near all of them ended up being sold out. In fact, most didn't even come close. But this last tour? It was different. They had two separate sets for every show. One for the main stage and another for the side stage. Fans could watch both sets simultaneously. And the best part? Tickets weren't even that expensive. It wasn't just the bands' performances that drew her in; it was the entire experience. She loved walking around the venue before the show, taking in everything from the artwork on display to the food options available. And after the concert? Sometimes she'd stick around to meet other fans who shared similar tastes. These moments felt special, though, because she knew she might never get the chance to relive them. When the opening act finished, she'd grab a drink and head over to the merchandise booth. Some nights, she'd buy a t-shirt or a poster.

Yet, every time he visited the hospital, he couldn't help but feel overshadowed by the newer residents. They seemed more confident, their diagnoses more accurate, and their interactions with patients smoother than his own. It was as if they possessed some innate ability to navigate complex medical situations with ease. One day, while reviewing patient charts, he stumbled upon a particularly challenging case. A 30-year-old man had been admitted with severe symptoms, and the initial diagnosis suggested a rare condition. However, when the resident assigned to his care misdiagnosed the patient, he knew he had to take matters into his own hands. After conducting further tests, he discovered that the patient actually suffered from a common respiratory infection. Instead of escalating the situation, he chose to treat the patient with antibiotics and monitor his progress closely. This decision was met with skepticism from the hospital staff, who questioned whether he had acted impulsively. Despite the criticism, he remained steadfast in his approach, convinced that his actions would ultimately lead to better outcomes for the patient. As he watched the resident move forward with the original diagnosis, he felt a growing sense of resentment. Why did this young doctor get to make decisions that could impact lives, while he was relegated to secondary roles? The tension simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over. Every interaction with the new resident became a test of wills, each encounter a subtle challenge to prove"
