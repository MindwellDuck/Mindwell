That he thinks he can just waltz in here and lecture me on 'artistic integrity' like I'm some kind of idiot.\"\n\nI glared at Rachel, my anger boiling over. \"And another thing, what's with all these stupid galleries he's been trying to get our work into? Like we need some rich snob telling us how to make a living off our art.\"\n\nRachel took a step back, her eyes darting towards the door. \"Maybe we should just—\"\n\nI cut her off with a harsh laugh. \"No way. We're going to show him. We're going to show him exactly what his condescending attitude gets us.\"\n\nWith a sudden burst of energy, I grabbed my paintbrushes and began frantically working on a new piece, the strokes bold and furious on the canvas.

I knew they were trying to spin it as'research', but I wasn't buying it.\n\nAs I flipped through the pages, a photo caught my eye - a shot of us standing side by side, smiling at a rally. It was before everything fell apart. Before she got sick, before she lost the election... before she died.\n\nA chill ran down my spine. They must have found this picture and used it to rewrite history. To make me look like some kind of failure.

It was from the lab down the street – a new specimen they'd collected during a routine sampling. He'd received it just this morning, wrapped in plain brown paper with no return address.\n\nCuriosity got the better of him; he carefully unwrapped the paper, revealing a small vial filled with a murky liquid.

He felt a sudden urge to discard the vial, to get as far away from it as possible.\n\nBut something held him rooted to the spot.
