The way Alex was laughing at something the boss said, sharing a joke, made him feel like an outsider. It had been six months since he'd left that project, but it still stung that he wasn't invited to join the group.\n\nAs he poured himself another cup of coffee, he noticed Alex catch his eye and flash a brief, awkward smile before quickly looking away. Their boss, noticing the tension, excused himself to take a call, leaving Alex alone.\n\nA few minutes later, Alex approached him, clearing his throat to get his attention. \"Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?\" he asked, his tone neutral but slightly condescending.\n\nHe nodded curtly, wondering what Alex wanted now.<|eot_id|>",

He kept talking about how I was really quiet during our meetings, even though I know I'm not. And then he said some stuff about how I didn't contribute anything meaningful to the team, which is totally not true. We worked together all day, every day, and I contributed plenty. But he just kept pushing my buttons, saying things like, \"You're not very good at this,\" and \"What are you doing?\" over and over again. It was like he hated me or something. And to make matters worse, he started acting like we weren’t coworkers anymore. When we were supposed to be working together, he would keep glancing around the office, looking for someone else to hang out with. Even though I tried to stay focused, I couldn’t help feeling like he was making fun of me. The whole time, I thought about how much better things would have been if we’d just gotten along. Now I’m stuck here, thinking about how I messed everything up by trying to fit in with them."

It wasn’t about fairness; it was about how he felt when people like him weren’t celebrated as much as those who were successful. The feeling was hard to ignore, and he knew that blaming someone else for it was an easy way out. But deep down, he understood that he was just making excuses. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he chose to point fingers. When asked why he hadn’t been able to secure funding, he would say, “It’s not because I’m incapable; it’s because everyone around me is getting all the opportunities.” Or if someone suggested that his lack of connections might be the issue, he’d reply, “They’re giving all the chances to the wrong people.” This wasn’t about being honest; it was about avoiding the truth. He didn’t want to admit that maybe he wasn’t working hard enough or that he needed to change. So instead, he blamed others—people he admired, people he envied—for his failures. By doing so, he could maintain a comfortable illusion of control over his life, even though he knew that his decisions and actions were what truly mattered."

How could she pretend? They were living someone else's dream, pretending to be happy when inside, she felt lost and alone. They were just going through the motions, playing the part of a perfect couple, while secretly dying inside. \"Why are you still here?\" he asked, his voice raw and emotional. \"Why aren't you gone?

Her children had likely suffered because of this, with some probably even questioning whether they deserved such a careless mother. Her husband must have felt like he was carrying the entire household on his own, further eroding trust and love in their marriage.
