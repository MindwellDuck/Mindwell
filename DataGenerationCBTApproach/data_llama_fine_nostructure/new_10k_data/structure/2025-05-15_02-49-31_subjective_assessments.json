She hadn't mentioned her plans for the evening yet – a dinner date with her old friend from college who had been estranged from their relationship for years.\n\nAs she began to check the patient charts, he casually mentioned his plans to attend a gardening seminar at the community center that weekend. The comment felt like a careless reminder of their own neglected hobby together, one they'd put off since her mother passed away.\n\nA faint scowl creased her forehead as she processed this new information. She glanced up at him, but his eyes were already fixed on the computer screen, oblivious to her growing irritation. He didn't seem to notice her subtle change in demeanor, which only added fuel to the fire simmering within her.<|eot_id|>",

As he carefully plated the dish one last time, his mind wandered back to when they first started dating. He remembered the excitement and nervous energy he felt, thinking about their future together.\n\nJust then, his daughter walked into the kitchen, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on him. \"Dad, can I help?\" she asked, but before he could respond, she noticed the dish in front of him. Her expression changed from curiosity to disappointment, and she muttered under her breath, \"Again?\"\n\nThe words struck a chord within him, and suddenly, the kitchen seemed to shrink around him. The sizzle of the onions, the clang of pots, everything faded into the background as he felt a familiar pang of regret wash over him. What if he hadn't proposed that day? What if he'd taken more risks in life? The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and for a moment, he forgot how to breathe.<|eot_id|>",

He continued his presentation, trying to brush off the discomfort, but his mind kept drifting back to the subtle exchange. It wasn't until after the meeting, when he saw her smiling and congratulating him, that he realized she hadn't meant it as a compliment.

She would say things like, “Oh, you must be really proud of yourself,” and he’d feel a pang of insecurity. Was she just being polite? Did she mean it? Or was she genuinely impressed by his accomplishments? The questions swirled in his head, making it hard to focus on anything else. When he finally got the chance to speak up, he hesitated, fearing that whatever he said wouldn’t be good enough. The thought of her finding fault in what he shared made him anxious, even if deep down he knew she wanted him to succeed. But still, the doubt lingered. Maybe he wasn’t good enough.
