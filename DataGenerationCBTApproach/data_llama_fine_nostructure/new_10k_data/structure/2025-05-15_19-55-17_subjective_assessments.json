Her husband had passed away six months ago, but the ache of loneliness still lingered. As she scrubbed the remnants of last night's dinner from a plate, her eyes landed on a photo of herself and her late husband, taken during their anniversary celebration ten years prior.\n\nTheir children had long since moved out, and the house felt emptier than ever. She couldn't shake the memory of a conversation they'd had about downsizing – how she should consider moving into a smaller place, closer to their adult kids. He'd reassured her it was time to let go, but now the thought made her feel like a burden to those who cared about her. The weight of dependency settled heavy in her chest, making the familiar task of washing dishes feel like a betrayal of her independence.<|eot_id|>",

Like, seriously, does she really need to hang up his old shirts every week? Does she honestly believe he’s going to walk through the door anytime soon? And then there are the little things that really get under my skin. Like when she insists on using his favorite coffee mug for everything. I know she loved that mug, but honestly, it feels like she’s trying too hard to hold onto the past. When we were married, he never liked it when I used his stuff, so why is she doing the same to our son? Doesn’t she realize that it’s just going to make things awkward between them? It’s almost like she thinks everyone else is avoiding her because she’s being too emotional or clingy. Newsflash: we’re all dealing with our own shit right now. Maybe if she took a step back and stopped acting like she’s the only one who cares, people would start opening up more. But no, instead, she keeps expecting everyone to be there for her 24/7, which makes us all feel guilty for not being able to help more. She’s always saying things like, “Oh, this must be"

Yeah, it’s definitely looking like that here. But honestly, I don’t know if I can handle much more of this. My heart is pounding, my palms are sweating, and I feel so sick to my stomach.
