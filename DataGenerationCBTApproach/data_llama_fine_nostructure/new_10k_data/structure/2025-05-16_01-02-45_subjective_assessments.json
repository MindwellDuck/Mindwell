The one where they'd finally gotten their daughter to eat a whole meal without complaining. Now, the only mark was a faint scribble in the margin –'still struggling with potty training.'<|eot_id|>",

All these appointments for healthy kids, and then this one family who can't even manage something as simple as toilet training. And now I have to take an hour off work just to sign them in and answer all their questions about their kid. It's such a waste of time. I could be doing something else, you know, like taking care of my own child. But no, instead I'm stuck here, dealing with people who can't even get their shit together. Why does this always happen? Why can't they just follow instructions or something? It's so infuriating. And what really gets under my skin is that everyone else gets to go home while I'm stuck here, wasting my time with families who can't even make it through a single appointment without throwing a tantrum. It's like they think I don't have better things to do than babysit their kids until they learn how to use the bathroom.

The woman was doing remarkably well, considering the severity of her injuries.

Yet, as she looked around the unit, A couldn't shake the feeling that everyone else seemed more invested in their own work than in supporting one of their own.\n\nA's gaze lingered on the woman's chart, her brow furrowed in annoyance.

I could see the other nurses exchanging worried glances, but she didn’t seem to notice anything out of the ordinary. When our supervisor approached, she barely even acknowledged him, too busy texting on her phone to pay attention to what he was saying. And then she started lecturing me, telling me that I needed to focus on my work and stop worrying about things that weren’t my problem. Like it’s so easy for her to say that, when she doesn’t even have to deal with the stress of being on call all night. But still, she has the nerve to lecture me? I’m trying to keep up with the workload around here, and she gets to just sit back and relax while everyone else does all the heavy lifting? As she reviewed the morning’s schedule, her eyes kept drifting back to the patient who was scheduled for her shift - the same woman who had been transferred from the ICU last week.

Why couldn’t he just listen to her for once? She tried so hard to please him, to be perfect. And this is how he repays me? By leaving me? By not loving me enough? This whole thing has left her feeling empty, broken. How could someone so beautiful, talented, and caring not love her back? Wasn’t she enough for him? Didn’t she deserve some happiness? Why did life have to treat her this way? Why did she always end up hurting people? She feels like she doesn’t matter at all, like she’s worthless. Why can’t she just move on already?
