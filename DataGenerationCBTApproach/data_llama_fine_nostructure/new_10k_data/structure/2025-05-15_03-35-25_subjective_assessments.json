The woman was insistent it was $2 more than it actually was, and her voice grew louder as she accused the cashier of trying to rip her off.\n\nThe woman felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach, a sensation that had become all too common since her husband's passing. She tried to tune out the argument, focusing on the steady hum of the cash register and the gentle beeping of the scanner, but the customer's words kept drifting back into her awareness like a nagging itch.\n\nAs the cashier finally managed to calm the customer down and ring up the purchase, the woman noticed a display case nearby filled with small, delicate vases. One vase in particular caught her eye - a simple, elegant design that reminded her of the bouquet her late husband had always given her on special occasions. For a moment, the sound of the cashier's ringing up the next item was drowned out by the echo of memories she'd rather forget.<|eot_id|>",

Her mind replayed the argument from earlier that morning, her husband's dismissive tone still echoing in her ears. The words he'd spoken about her lack of ambition now cut deeper than ever – 'you're too old for this coding business.' \n\nA sudden memory flashed before her eyes: their son's graduation ceremony, where she'd beamed with pride as he accepted his scholarship to study computer science, just like her. Now, here she was, struggling to make ends meet on her own. The sting of failure threatened to consume her, her hands clenched into fists as she thought about all those late nights spent perfecting her craft.\n\nHer gaze fell upon the calculator lying open on the counter, its screen displaying a string of numbers that seemed to mock her. She snatched it up, her fingers flying across the keys as she punched out a furious sequence of commands. But instead of solving an equation, she found herself calculating the exact moment when her ex had broken the last straw – the day they'd parted ways, leaving her to pick up the shattered pieces of her life alone.<|eot_id|>",

As she got up to answer the door, she couldn’t help but think about the argument she and her sister had the night before. They were supposed to attend our cousin’s wedding together, but instead, we ended up having a fight over something ridiculous. It felt like no matter what I did, everything always led back to her. As I opened the door, I saw my sister standing there, looking so beautiful in her white dress. She smiled warmly, but I could see the disappointment behind her eyes. We hugged each other tightly, but I knew things would never go back to normal between us. She looked tired, almost like she was carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. When she came inside, she collapsed onto the couch next to me, holding her head in her hands. I tried to comfort her, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was trying to hide something from me. Now, let me tell you what happened after that. My sister left the house around 10 pm, saying she needed some time alone. I stayed up late reading a book, but eventually, I started thinking about how much she had changed since the accident. She used to be so happy-go-lucky, always smiling and laughing."
