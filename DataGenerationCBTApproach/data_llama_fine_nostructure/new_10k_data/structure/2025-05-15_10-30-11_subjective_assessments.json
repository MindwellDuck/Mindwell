The laughter they shared, their hands entwined – memories she'd tried to erase from her mind. \n\nAs she dipped her brush into the vibrant colors, her hand trembled, and a small stroke of paint landed askew on the canvas. She sighed, frustration mingling with regret. Why had she insisted on taking that art class all those years ago? It was supposed to be a hobby, a way to escape the stress of her marriage. But instead, it became an obsession that fueled her anger and resentment when it ended.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. It was her daughter, calling to discuss her upcoming art show. A surge of guilt washed over her as she hesitated, wondering if she was ready to face the world again, to showcase her art, and to relive the pain of her past.<|eot_id|>",

Her mind wandered back to her old art teacher, Mrs. Thompson. Remembered how he used to say, “A true artist must pour his heart onto every canvas.” He'd encouraged her to keep creating, even during the darkest times. But what did that really mean? Why did everyone else’s lives look so much better? Her friends seemed to have found happiness in their marriages, while hers had crumbled. They posted about their vacations, sharing photos of perfect sunsets and blissful moments by the ocean. Meanwhile, she struggled to find joy in anything, even her own art. One day, while scrolling through social media, she stumbled upon a post from an old friend. She’d moved away after the divorce and hadn’t kept in touch. The post showed her sitting by the beach, smiling at the camera, surrounded by happy family members. Tears welled up inside her as she realized how far behind she was. Everyone around her seemed to have moved on, while she remained stuck in the past. When would she finally get there? Would it ever happen? She thought about all the things she wanted to achieve—writing a novel, traveling, building a home—but every step felt"

The total came to over $10,000 – a staggering amount she couldn't begin to comprehend.\n\nHer eyes stung as tears pricked at the corners.

Despite her best efforts, however, she couldn’t shake the feeling of inadequacy. Every step felt like a struggle, and the weight of responsibility weighed heavily upon her shoulders.
