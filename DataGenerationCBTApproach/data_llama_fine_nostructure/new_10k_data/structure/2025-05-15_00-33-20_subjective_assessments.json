But then there was the mother who came in later. I remember her because she was really nice, and her kids looked so happy. They even got to pick out an ice cream flavor together! What a sweet moment. And when they left, she waved goodbye to me, smiling, which made my heart feel a little heavy. Not in a good way, though. Just that she was one of those people who acted like she deserved a prize just for showing up. Ugh, it bothered me. When the next customer came in, I tried to be friendly, but inside, I was still fuming. Why did some people get to be so perfect? That kid and her mom were so cute together, playing happily outside. Meanwhile, I have to deal with these annoying customers all day. It’s not fair. I’m always the one getting shortchanged or treated poorly, never able to enjoy anything.

It was as if the very fabric of the hospital was unraveling before her eyes, and she knew she wouldn’t be able to escape the mess once it hit the ground. Every step she took seemed to lead her further into the abyss, and now she wondered if she’d ever make it out alive.
