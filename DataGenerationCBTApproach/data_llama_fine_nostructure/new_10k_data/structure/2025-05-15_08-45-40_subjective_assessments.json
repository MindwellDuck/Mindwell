The truth was, his father had taught him how to code, not the other way around. This isn’t the first time he’s felt this way. His dad never told him that he was good enough; instead, he criticized every project, saying they were too simple. It wasn't until after his death that he realized just how much he’d missed out on his childhood. Now, every memory feels tainted by those harsh words. Every time he looks at these photos, he's reminded of the countless hours spent trying to meet his expectations. Even now, when he thinks back on those moments, all he can see are failures, each one a painful reminder that his father never thought he was worthy."

She'd mentioned how stressed she was about money, and how she felt like he never contributed enough. He'd brushed it off, saying he was taking care of other financial responsibilities.\n\nNow, as he scrolled through his phone, he saw her text him: \"Hey, where r u?

He quickly saved his work, closed his laptop, and rushed out the door, hoping to catch up with her before she gave up waiting.

In comparison, his friends seemed to have easier relationships. They didn't struggle with feelings of inadequacy or worry about disappointing their partners. Instead, they enjoyed spontaneous nights out, laughing together over drinks. Their conversations flowed effortlessly, without the weight of resentment building up inside. For them, every moment counted, but for him, every second felt like a missed opportunity. As he looked around, he noticed couples holding hands outside, sharing warm smiles. The world seemed to move forward, while he remained stuck in his own thoughts, lost in a sea of what-ifs.

It doesn’t matter that her husband died three years ago, or that she never knew him. He didn’t leave her a legacy of grief—she chose that path. And besides, she can’t let herself dwell on the past. She needs to focus on the present. What really bothers me is when people talk about how great an artist she is, as if she were still alive to hear them. That just makes me angry. They don’t know anything about my life, nor do I want them to. If I wanted to share stories about my husband, I’d have done so long ago. Why would anyone care now? It feels like everyone else is moving on, while she stays stuck in the past. This whole thing is just making me sick. I’m trying to stay strong for myself and my daughter, but sometimes it feels like no one understands what we’re going through.

As long as everyone stayed focused, it wouldn't be too bad. But there was one thing that always bothered him - the way his partner handled everything. She seemed to have it all together, effortlessly juggling her own work while keeping track of what the rest of the staff was up to. Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson struggled just to stay on top of things, even though he knew most of the other teachers didn't have anywhere near as much going on. That just made him feel worse. Now, if only he could get some help... He wished he could just tell someone to take care of it for him, but deep down, he knew that wouldn't work. His partner was always busy, and no one else was qualified enough to handle the kind of work she did. So he kept trying to make it through each day on his own, hoping that somehow things would magically sort themselves out. But as the weeks went by, he began to wonder if he'd ever find peace.

That means she doesn’t want to talk to other customers and would rather have him all to herself? Or maybe she’s just happy to see two people enjoying each other’s company? Let’s take this logic a step further. If we assume that every time a woman smiles at a man, it means she wants him for herself, then wouldn’t we expect women to constantly smile at men everywhere they go? Wouldn’t it be normal to assume that every time a woman smiles at a man, she secretly wants to have sex with him? What if instead of assuming that every smile from a woman indicates flirtatious intentions, we actually considered the possibility that she might simply enjoy seeing happy couples around us? Maybe she’s just a very friendly person who likes to make others smile, regardless of whether they’re single or in relationships. By jumping straight to conclusions based on a simple smile, we risk misinterpreting innocent interactions and creating unnecessary drama. It’s essential to consider multiple perspectives and avoid making assumptions that lead to unfair judgments. Instead of predicting negative outcomes for ourselves based solely on how others behave, let’s try to approach life with an open mind and empathy. Who knows? We might discover some really cool things along the way!"
