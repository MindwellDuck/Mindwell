He doesn’t even try anymore, which makes things worse because I can tell he’s lost interest. Just looking at the calendar feels like a reminder of how little effort he puts into our relationship. What’s the point? I might as well forget trying to make this day special. I don’t know why I bother. He’ll just ignore me again anyway. I remember last year, he said something about being busy and promised to make it up to me, but there was no surprise gift, no small gestures…nothing. And this year, he hasn’t even asked if I wanted anything besides flowers and chocolates. Like, what’s the difference? It’s all the same. Why would he suddenly care? It’s always the same story. He gets distracted by work or whatever else crosses his path, and then he expects me to bring everything to the table. If I even mention my feelings, he pretends like he didn’t hear me.

I didn't push the issue, figuring she might be overwhelmed. At first, I thought maybe she was having a rough day at work, but then I saw how upset she was talking about her ex-husband. I've known her since college, and we're close friends, so I decided to ask what was bothering her. She opened up about how her ex-husband was cheating again and lying about everything. I listened attentively, trying to offer support, but she kept going, telling me about how she felt abandoned and hurt by his actions.

Her job was just another burden, sucking away at her already fragile mental state. Every day, every hour, seemed to blend into the next, leaving her drained and hopeless. No one understood what she went through. They never had to face such pressure alone. Even if they did, they wouldn’t know what it felt like to be overwhelmed by everything, yet powerless against anything. The pain was suffocating, crushing her under its weight. It wasn’t just the bills; her entire life seemed to be falling apart. Relationships crumbled, friendships disappeared, and opportunities slipped through her fingers. She felt invisible, like a ghost haunting her own existence. No one noticed her anymore, not even herself. The only thing holding her back was her own self-pity. Why bother trying to change anything when everyone else had given up on her? The world moved on, leaving her behind, a forgotten relic of a life once lived. The truth was simple: she was worthless.
