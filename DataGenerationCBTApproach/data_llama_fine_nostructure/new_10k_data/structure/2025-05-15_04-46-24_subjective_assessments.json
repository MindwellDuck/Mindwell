The same words she always said: \"Just thinking about you.\" But it wasn't the same anymore. She'd lost her partner a year ago, too, and now they were both alone, trying to navigate this new reality.\n\nThe cursor blinked, taunting him, as he struggled to make progress on the project deadline looming over him. His mind began to wander to all the things he wished he could do instead – travel, play music, simply have someone to share a laugh with. But those weren't options tonight.

Instead, he found himself drowning in a sea of what-ifs: * What if he met someone who liked coding? * What if he got invited to parties by people who shared his interests? His phone buzzed again, breaking the spell. This time, it was his best friend, texting to check in. They made plans for the next day, and he couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy. Why did everyone else seem to have so much fun, while he was stuck here? \"What if we were still friends if I never drank?\" he thought, feeling a pang of sadness. That was when he realized he needed to stop getting sucked into these fantasies. \"Okay,\" he told himself firmly, \"let's get back to work.\" But then, a memory flashed before his eyes: the last time he'd seen his high school crush, how she'd laughed at his jokes, and how he'd felt like the luckiest guy alive.

Her words were laced with venom, and her body language screamed entitlement.\n\nThe nurse felt a stinging sensation in her chest as she listened to the woman's tirade. It wasn't just the woman's behavior that grated – it was the way everyone else in the room seemed to be avoiding eye contact, the way they whispered apologies and hastily changed the subject. \n\nFor a moment, the nurse's breath caught in her throat. She couldn't explain why, but the scene played out like a mirror reflection of her own life. Her partner had been making excuses lately, too caught up in his own problems to listen to hers. And now, this stranger's entitled rant was stirring something dark within her.<|eot_id|>",

She wondered if he was trying to avoid confrontation, and how that affected him. But no matter what he did, she still felt irritated. There was nothing wrong with him; she just didn’t want to admit it. Maybe she was getting annoyed because she’d been dealing with similar issues herself. Still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that these people were somehow responsible for her frustration. It was ridiculous to think that way, but she kept thinking about how they always tried to make things easier for themselves. Even though she knew that was unfair, she felt justified in feeling this way. She started to wonder if she was just too sensitive or if these people really deserved her anger.
