He cleared it, but the gesture came out slightly too loud, and her eyes snapped up to meet his. For a moment, they locked gazes, the tension between them palpable.\n\nShe muttered under her breath, \"Great, another one of your'masterpieces'.\" The words stung, and he felt his face tighten.

It wasn't just the idea that he'd be cooking again; it was the way she said it - as if she was trying to tell me what I wanted to hear, like she knew exactly how I'd feel. She didn't even need to say a word, because I already knew she was thinking about how much easier it would be to have someone else do the work. That's why she'd brought up pizza in the first place - not because she actually wanted to relax and enjoy dinner together, but so I wouldn't feel like such a failure in front of our friends when they come over later. It was almost as if she could read my mind, knowing exactly which buttons to press. She must think I'm stupid, unable to figure things out on my own. But I can see right through her games - she doesn't really want us to spend quality time together; she wants an excuse to leave me alone while she plays video games and watches TV all night. And by suggesting pizza, she's basically telling me that I'm not good enough to cook for myself, let alone anyone else. It's like she thinks I'm some kind of child who needs constant supervision. But I won't fall for it. I'll show her. I'll prove that I can handle cooking and take care of myself. Maybe this is her way of getting back at me for my recent mistake in the kitchen - not that it"

It seemed like everyone around her had moved forward while she was stuck in the past. *No, I don’t think she knows what I’m thinking; I’m just so frustrated with how things turned out.* Her mind wandered to her own research, which had been dismissed years ago despite its potential. Now, here was someone who might actually understand what she meant, someone who could appreciate the value of her work. But even if that was true, why did it have to be this younger person? Why did she always end up getting left behind? She remembered the countless times her colleagues had brushed her off, telling her that her ideas were “too radical” or “not practical.” They would say things like, “We can’t afford to waste resources on something that hasn’t been proven,” or “It won’t make a difference in the grand scheme of things.” Those words"

She thought back to her early days as a nurse, when mistakes were fewer, and the sense of control was greater. Now, every small error felt monumental. Even the simplest tasks seemed impossible, weighed down by the pressure to perform flawlessly. As she continued to watch the nurse work, her emotions swirled. She felt like crying, but instead, her anger and frustration boiled over. Why did everything have to be so hard"
