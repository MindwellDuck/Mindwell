The morning light streaming through the office window highlighted the dust particles dancing in the air, but none of it seemed to penetrate the haze of sadness clouding her mind.\n\nAs she read through the responses from sources, one name kept popping up - her ex-boyfriend's. He had recently started dating someone new, and the messages were laced with condescending remarks about her career choices. She felt a lump form in her throat as she deleted his emails, the cursor blinking accusingly on the screen.\n\nJust then, her phone buzzed with a text from her husband, asking if she was okay after a late night. She hesitated for a moment before responding, unsure how much to reveal. As she typed out a brief apology, her eyes wandered to a framed photo on her desk - a picture of her and her husband, taken during their first vacation together. The smile on her face seemed forced now, a stark contrast to the emptiness feeling inside.<|eot_id|>",

It was the lab where he still worked part-time, asking him to attend a meeting about a new project.

But what really hit hard was thinking about how I didn’t even have a chance to get to know this young researcher. No background check, no trial run, just throwing me into the deep end. I felt like a fish flopping around in a shark tank, completely out of my element. And yet, I knew I couldn’t back down now. This was too big, too important, to let fear hold me back. It’s funny, isn’t it? One minute I’m reminiscing about the good times, and the next, I’m spiraling into a sea of self-doubt. But honestly, that’s just life.
