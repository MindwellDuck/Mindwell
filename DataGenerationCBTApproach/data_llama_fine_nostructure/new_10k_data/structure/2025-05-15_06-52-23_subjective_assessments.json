It had been five years since her passing, but the ache still lingered. He stopped at the bedside, running his fingers over the worn armrest where she used to lean when he visited.\n\nAs he took in the sterile smell of disinfectant and the faint scent of perfume – his – he felt a lump form in his throat. A nurse poked her head in, apologetic, and whispered about the next patient needing attention. She didn't stay long enough to notice his expression, but he caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror attached to the wall.\n\nFor a moment, they locked eyes, and he saw himself then – the same worn lines around his mouth, the same haunted look in his eyes. The nurse quickly looked away, continuing down the hall, leaving him alone once more with the echoes of memories past.<|eot_id|>",

His gaze wandered aimlessly across the room, never really seeing anything. But when he finally opened his eyes, it was like looking into a void. A chasm so deep that nothing could ever fill it. He stared back at me, blank and unresponsive, unable to see me let alone understand me. And yet, somehow, I saw myself in those empty eyes. In the desperation to reach out, the faintest glimmer of hope flickered to life. But like a fleeting dream, it vanished, leaving behind only emptiness. We were trapped in this endless cycle of loneliness, each one of us lost in our own world of silence."

It was always like this – she had a knack for making everything seem effortless, while he struggled to keep up. The grant approval had been a long shot, but somehow he'd managed to pull it off.\n\n\"I guess it wasn't too hard when you're already well-connected,\" he muttered, his voice low and even.\n\nRachel looked up, a hint of confusion crossing her face before she smiled brightly. \"Oh, I didn't know we were competing against each other. What do you mean?\"\n\nHe shrugged, feeling a twinge of irritation. Nothing he said seemed to get through to her. She just kept on smiling, oblivious to the subtle jab he'd made.

That's not all; she's also incredibly careless. I've seen her drop things multiple times, yet she never seems to worry about them. It's infuriating. When she left, she dropped her bag right next to my feet. If I weren't paying attention, I would have slipped on it. But no, instead, she just acted like nothing happened, like she was doing us a favor by leaving it there. It's just one example, but there are many more. She has an uncanny ability to avoid responsibility, which is why I find myself questioning whether she's truly capable of handling such tasks alone. Her reactions are often...perplexing. I'll say something, and then she'll respond with something completely unrelated, as if she's not listening. Or worse, she'll interrupt me mid-sentence, cutting me off abruptly. It's almost as if she doesn't want to hear what I have to say. And don't even get me started on her lack of empathy. Whenever someone else makes a mistake, she'll simply shrug it off and move on.

His words were laced with condescension, as if he'd done it all before.\n\nAs she listened, her eyes darted towards the resident's chart, where his credentials listed only two years of residency, despite his assertions of extensive experience. A pang of disgust settled in her stomach, her mind racing with the memories of her own young doctor who'd made similar mistakes, resulting in a life-altering mistake that had nearly cost a patient her limb.\n\nHer gaze lingered on the resident's face, searching for any sign of humility or recognition of his limitations, but his expression remained smug. She felt a familiar sense of frustration, her gut tightening as she wondered how many lives would be put at risk due to this young doctor's hubris.

It was frustrating, especially since she knew what it was like to make costly mistakes early in one’s career. This young doctor didn't seem to understand the weight of responsibility that came with being a nurse. He spoke about medication administration with an air of superiority, acting like he had a Ph.D. in pharmacology instead of just having read a few textbooks. It irritated her that he seemed so unprepared, yet still managed to sound intelligent when talking about the patients’ conditions. It was almost as if he thought he could handle anything that came his way, even though he hadn’t worked with these specific patients before. His attitude was infuriating, making her wonder how much harm he might cause. As she watched him, she couldn’t help but think about her own experiences with overconfident doctors, who often took unnecessary risks that put patients in danger. This young man seemed headed down a similar path, and she found herself bristling at his lack of humility."

When I walked into the office, they were all chatting and laughing like nothing was wrong. I saw my manager talking to someone else, but he wasn’t saying anything about my mom.
