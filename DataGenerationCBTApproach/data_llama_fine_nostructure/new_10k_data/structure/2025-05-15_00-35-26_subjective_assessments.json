She remembered the day they met, too – the way her eyes locked onto his across the crowded room, the spark that ignited between them.\n\nHer phone buzzed, breaking the spell. It was a text from her colleague, inviting her to join a training session today. She hesitated, feeling the familiar weight of her grief bearing down on her. Why bother? What was the point?
