The group's conversation turned to their plans for retirement, and he found himself comparing the ease with which they seemed to be saving up for their golden years to his own meager pension.<|eot_id|>",

Meanwhile, I'm still struggling to make ends meet, working overtime just to pay the bills. It feels like the world has moved on without me.

Or maybe he wasn’t holding anything back; maybe he was trying to tell him something. But what? It all started with a simple report. A woman matching his ex-wife’s description had been seen entering the café around 2 pm. No big deal, right? Except she hadn’t left. Not even a cup of coffee. Just sitting there, sipping tea by herself, completely alone. And now here he was, standing outside, wondering what might be happening inside. If I go in, will they find evidence? Will they think I’m involved? Maybe I should just leave, see how long it takes before they make contact. Then again, if I don’t go in, won’t they think I have something to hide? Shouldn’t I try to clear my name? Or is it better to stay out of this altogether? He sighed, shaking his head. Why did this always happen to him?
