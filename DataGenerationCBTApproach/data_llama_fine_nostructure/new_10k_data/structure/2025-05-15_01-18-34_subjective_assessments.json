His witty update about a meeting with a potential client had been met with dozens of congratulatory likes, while her own post – a mundane account of her morning coffee routine – had garnered only a handful of half-hearted responses.\n\nThe couple's apartment was quiet, except for the sound of sipping coming from the kitchen. She got up to grab a glass of water, but her hand hesitated over the faucet. It wasn't just the exhaustion catching up with her; it was the feeling that no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't quite measure up to her partner's expectations.\n\nAs she stood there, the silence between them grew thicker, until it felt like a living thing.

Does he secretly think I'm a waste of space? Why does everything have to be so perfect for him? Even the water dripping into the sink sounds ominous, like it's mocking me for not being able to get anything right. My mind is racing, and I feel like I'll never be good enough. Maybe I should just give up now and let him handle everything. At least then I wouldn't feel like a disappointment anymore."

I want to lash out at everyone. I hate myself for being like this. I don't know why I reacted that way. Maybe it's because I saw her talking to someone else too, maybe it was just the wrong time.

He'd promised to get it done, but life got in the way, and the project stalled. Now, with her gone, it felt like a cruel reminder of his own failure to honor their shared dreams.<|eot_id|>",
