The hum of conversation and beeping machines created a familiar background noise, but it did little to alleviate the emptiness inside him. A group of residents laughed together, their camaraderie infectious; he couldn't help but feel like an outsider.\n\nAs he waited for his turn to order, his eyes wandered to the floor, where a lone nurse sat alone, staring at her phone. Her expression was a mix of fatigue and melancholy – a reflection he knew all too well. He ordered his lunch and took a seat by the window, watching as people came and went, each one connected to someone else, except for him.\n\nThe silence from his own phone was deafening, a constant reminder that no one was waiting for him. He checked the time for what felt like the hundredth time, wondering if anyone would call or text during his shift. The stillness closed in around him, a suffocating blanket that made his chest ache.<|eot_id|>",

It must be hard for her to see me smiling around the house, enjoying life, and working on new projects. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to feel left behind while everyone else moves forward.

It wasn't the smell itself that bothered him, but the fact that she seemed more interested in her phone than in talking to him.\n\nAs they ordered their meals, she mentioned a work project she was putting in overtime on, and how it was stressing her out. He listened attentively, nodding along, but inside, he felt a growing sense of resentment. Twenty years of marriage, and this was what she was still worried about?

I know she loves her job, but it’s taking a toll on our relationship. Sometimes I wonder if she’d even notice if I were gone for a while. Is this just normal stress, or am I starting to worry too much? I tried asking her about her day, but she just brushed it off. I guess she didn’t want to talk about it. That’s fine; I understand that sometimes people don’t want to share everything. Still, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s hiding something.
