The nurse felt a pang of discomfort, noticing the way Dr. Patel leaned in when talking to Rachel, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.

She’s got this perfect body, looks great, and is always dressed perfectly. And don’t even get me started on her hair—she always has it done just right, whether it’s a ponytail or loose. It’s like she doesn’t even need makeup because she’s already flawless. But honestly, I think she’s just really lucky. I mean, look at her. She gets all the attention, and we’re supposed to be happy for her? Are you kidding me? And then there’s Dr. Patel. He came in as an intern and was already making friends left and right. He’s got this charm thing going on—those blue eyes are hypnotizing, and his smile is infectious. Plus, he’s smart, which makes him even more attractive. Of course, everyone wants him around, especially the single ladies. I’ve heard rumors about his dating life; let’s just say he’s been known to pick up girls pretty quickly.
