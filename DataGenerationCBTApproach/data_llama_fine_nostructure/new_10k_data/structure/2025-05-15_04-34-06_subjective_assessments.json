It’s having to pay rent while trying to raise a kid on your own. It’s waking up every morning knowing that your partner has passed away and that you don’t have anyone else to rely on. That’s what’s hard, not dealing with customers all day complaining about how expensive everything is. But hey, keep telling yourself that you’re just lucky that you didn’t lose your house because you were too busy playing soccer with your friends. Keep pretending that you never feel anxiety or stress about paying bills and worrying about where your next meal is coming from. Because clearly you don’t know anything about living on your own and working multiple jobs to get by. You must be so smart and resourceful, right?

They might have their own struggles, and sometimes they focus on the negative aspects of life rather than the good stuff. That doesn’t mean they’re better than you; it just means they’ve got their own challenges. You can’t compare your behind-the-scenes moments to someone else’s highlight reel. Just because you don’t see the big successes around you doesn’t mean nobody is doing okay. Focus on your own journey and try not to overthink how others are really doing. Life isn’t always black and white. There’s a lot more gray area than we often give ourselves credit for. So, instead of getting stuck on what you think others are going through, try to stay positive and keep moving forward. It’s worth remembering that there’s a whole lot more happening behind closed doors that you might never even know about. Don’t make assumptions about other people based on what you see online or hear from others. Everyone has their story, and you don’t know what anyone else is dealing with unless you put yourself in their shoes. Maybe someone who looks successful on the outside is actually struggling with something you wouldn’t understand. Or maybe they’re just posting about the good parts of their life to make themselves feel better. Keep an open mind and try not to jump to conclusions. When you start"
