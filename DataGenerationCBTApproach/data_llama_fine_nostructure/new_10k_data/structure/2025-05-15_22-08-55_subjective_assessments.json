They say you can tell a lot about a man by how he treats his mother, but in my opinion, it’s more about how well he takes care of his wife. When he says things like “I wish we’d done things differently,” it sounds like he’s talking about something specific, but deep down, I know it’s just another way of saying “I’m bored.” Maybe I’m wrong, maybe he genuinely regrets some aspect of our lives together.
