Even her favorite books didn’t feel comforting, like they were just another reminder of what she couldn’t have. Her mind kept jumping between past regrets and future anxieties, creating a cycle that left her exhausted. It seemed like no matter how hard she tried to calm down, she’d just end up worse off than before. And now, with the latest bill due soon, things might get really tough.

But then there were moments like these, when the adrenaline finally wore off and reality hit you like a sledgehammer. That's when she realized that no matter how much training you got, no matter how prepared you thought you were, life could turn on its head in an instant. And I'm not talking about just the job; I'm talking about everything. Marriage, family, friends—anything can happen anytime, and the ones who are least expecting it are often those who suffer the most.
