A post from an old college friend caught her eye – celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary with her high school sweetheart. The couple had been inseparable since childhood, and their seemingly perfect relationship always made her feel inadequate.\n\nAs she read about their luxurious vacation and children who were all grown up with kids of their own, she felt a pang of jealousy wash over her. She thought about her own empty nest, her solo vacations to nowhere in particular, and the countless nights spent alone, wondering what could have been if she'd met someone like him sooner.\n\nHer eyes lingered on the photos, taking in every detail – the way he smiled, the way his wife's hair fell in loose waves down her back, the way they laughed together like they still did after three decades. Her mind began to replay all the times she'd seen couples like this, feeling like an outsider looking in, while she was left to navigate the dating world alone, with no one to share the experience with.<|eot_id|>",

He said he needed to figure some things out, but I think he meant he needed to figure out how much he loved someone else. That's right, I'm talking about his coworker, Karen. We've known each other for years, and I thought we were friends. But now, I realize she was just playing me. She's been flirting with him for months, maybe even longer. I didn't see anything suspicious, but I should have trusted my instincts. After all, I am the wife, and I should be watching my marriage. I wonder if there are other women he's met along the way, if he's ever looked at anyone else. It makes sense; I can't blame him for seeking validation elsewhere. I mean, who wouldn't want attention? At least I got to enjoy those moments when we were happy together. But now, I'm left here, alone, feeling like I never really mattered. Maybe I should've done something differently. Maybe I should've tried harder to keep him interested, but it doesn't matter anymore. I'm just a reminder of the past, a memory he wants to forget. It's hard not to take it personally when I see them laughing together, their hands touching casually. They seem so comfortable around each other,"

I wondered what would happen if we actually did let her take her case to court. Would our reputation really crumble? Or would she end up losing the lawsuit? What if she got emotional during the trial and broke down in front of the judge? Would she apologize for embarrassing herself or try to blame me for her breakdown? This is ridiculous.

What if I didn’t get my next paycheck because my boss thought I was too stressed out from dealing with customers? What if this woman somehow found out where I live and showed up there to confront me? How would I protect myself then? I’m so sick of these customers who think they can manipulate people like me. If anything, I wish she’d go ahead and file a lawsuit.

How does she stay so calm? Doesn't she feel frustrated when things don't go right? Doesn't she ever get tired of trying to keep everything together?
