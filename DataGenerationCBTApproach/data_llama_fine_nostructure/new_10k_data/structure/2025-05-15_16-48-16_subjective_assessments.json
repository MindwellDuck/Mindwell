The soft beeping of machines and muffled cries of patients filled the air. Suddenly, the lights flickered and the elevator jolted to a stop between floors.\n\nThe nurse's eyes widened as the emergency alarm began to wail, and a voice over the intercom announced a power outage throughout the hospital. Panic started to spread among the staff, who scrambled to find flashlights and batteries.\n\nAs the nurse stepped out into the darkened hallway, she felt a chill run down her spine. She clutched the cold metal railing, her heart racing, as she gazed up at the darkness above. The hospital's backup generators roared to life, casting an eerie glow over the deserted corridors.\n\nHer partner, waiting anxiously by the nurse's station, called out to her, but his voice was distant and muffled. The nurse's fear grew as she realized she was alone, separated from the only person who knew how to handle this kind of crisis.<|eot_id|>",

I'm completely incapable of handling things like this. If my partner had been there, he would've known exactly what to do. He always handles these emergencies with ease. But now...now I'll never know how to react. I'll probably make things worse. I'm not even trained for this stuff. I don't deserve to work here. I'm going to be late for my rounds again, and no one cares about me. They're too busy dealing with real emergencies to worry about some low-level nurse like me. My manager doesn't care; she barely notices me anyway. I'm just an afterthought to them. I'm worthless. I'm a failure. I'll never succeed here. If I could just leave... But then she remembered the reason why she applied for this job in the first place - she wanted to see her partner happy.

The way he spoke about it was so nostalgic, like he was reminiscing about a different life.\n\nAs she typed out a routine update, her eyes landed on the photo of them taken on their anniversary two years ago. She hadn't looked at it in months, but something about it caught her attention now. The way he smiled, the way she did... it all felt so familiar yet so foreign.\n\nA faint hum from her computer interrupted her reverie, and she blinked away the tears that pricked at the corners of her eyes. It was just a reminder that she needed to finish this project by the end of the day. But as she refocused on the code, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was losing herself in these empty days, searching for something that no longer existed.<|eot_id|>",

Just like when you said you'd never date someone who didn't appreciate you the way you appreciated them, she's convinced herself that nothing will ever change between you. Even though she hasn't spoken to you in weeks, she still holds onto those memories of the past, replaying every moment like it was new. You might have noticed that she's been distant lately - acting like everything is fine when deep down, she knows it's all falling apart. What would happen if you sat her down and told her exactly how you feel? Would she listen? Probably not. Because she thinks she already knows better than anyone else, and that everyone else is just blind to see things clearly. What's really going on here is that she's trying to hold on to something that can't be saved. No matter how hard she tries to keep it alive, it's slipping away, and she's stuck in denial.

At first, she thought it might be the neighbor's dog, but then she heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps, light and deliberate, coming from the hallway. Her heart quickened slightly, and her grip on the knife tightened. Who could it be? And why were they being so quiet?\n\nShe tried to tell herself it was probably just the house settling, but her mind began to spin with possibilities. A stranger in her apartment?

It was like she had a sixth sense for knowing exactly what the man needed - she knew how much he spent here and kept track of it so well. It was infuriating. I wanted to tell her that she wasn’t doing enough, that if she just worked harder, things would be better. But I didn’t. Instead, I just stood there, silently judging her, feeling like a total loser next to someone who could handle everything so easily. When the customer finally left, I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. I tried to get into work mode, but it was no use. All I could think about was how much easier it must have been for her. She was always so cheerful, and everyone loved her. Why couldn’t I be more like her? I mean, why can’t I be more like her? What’s wrong with me?! I don’t even know anymore.
