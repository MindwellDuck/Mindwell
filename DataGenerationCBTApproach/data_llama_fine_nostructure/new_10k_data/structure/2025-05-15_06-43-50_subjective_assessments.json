The woman rushed to administer it, but upon arrival, found the patient's chart had been misplaced, and the doctor was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"Guess I'll have to wait another 20 minutes,\" she muttered under her breath, trying to hide the frustration etched across her face.

Her constant gossiping and lack of professionalism make me want to scream. If she wasn't so busy spreading rumors, maybe we could actually focus on helping our patients. But no, she has to drag everyone down by talking trash about them. I've tried talking to her before, telling her to stop, but she just laughs it off and keeps going.

Today was supposed to be her day off – no restaurant, no early mornings, no endless prep work.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, she noticed a couple holding hands, laughing together on their way home from a walk. They looked young, carefree, their love radiating like a warm light. She felt a pang in her chest, a dull ache that seemed to spread through her entire body.\n\nHer eyes landed on the old family recipe book lying open on the counter. Her mother had written notes in the margins, tiny drawings of vegetables and flowers surrounding each recipe. It was a book she'd treasured since childhood, but hadn't opened in years.\n\nA faint memory stirred, of her mother teaching her how to make the perfect bouillabaisse, of the smell of saffron and garlic filling the kitchen. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she realized it had been so long since she'd cooked for anyone but herself.\n\nThe couple's laughter grew louder, and she felt a wave of loneliness wash over her. She closed the cookbook, her hand trembling slightly as she reached for the tea kettle.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes landed on a picture from their high school graduation day, where they were beaming with pride alongside their parents. A pang of regret hit him, and he couldn't help but think of what could've been if he'd made different choices all those years ago.\n\nHis wife, sensing his unease, asked if everything was okay.
