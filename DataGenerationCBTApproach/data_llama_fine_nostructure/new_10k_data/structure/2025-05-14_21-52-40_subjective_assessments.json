They want custom plates, specific wine pairings...it's going to be a nightmare.\"\n\nAs she spoke, his phone buzzed on the counter, displaying a text from his mother: \"Don't forget about Grandma's birthday dinner tonight. I'm counting on you to make something special.\" He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach, the worry creeping up like the rising heat from the sauce. What if he couldn't deliver?

The thought made his eyes sting, and he quickly looked away, trying to compose himself.

She was so young, so full of life, while I'm just an old man who can't even get it up anymore. What the fuck happened? How could I have lost someone so important? Now I'm stuck here, drowning in all these fucking memories, and I can't even cry properly because I'm too fucking scared to lose control. My goddamn brain won't stop telling me what I did wrong, making me think I deserve this suffering. Fuck! Why does it always have to be me? This is insane! Five fucking years of loneliness and I still can't seem to move on. If only I had done something differently, maybe I wouldn’t be here, feeling like crap all the time.

When she comes in here, I can see the strain on her face, the tension in her body. It's like she's carrying the entire world on her shoulders, and no amount of effort can lift it.
