A chart slipped from her hand, papers spilling onto the floor as she rushed to grab it. As she bent down to gather the scattered sheets, her heel caught on the edge of a nearby bed frame.\n\nHer phone rang, shrill in the sudden silence. Apologetic, she picked up, only to hear the unmistakable voice of Dr. Thompson on the other end – her former husband's name still familiar to her ear. He'd called earlier that week, asking to speak with her about the patient he was transferring care to; they were no longer married, but the connection still lingered.\n\nAs she listened, mortified, her colleagues began to stare, their faces a blur of concern and curiosity. The humiliation washed over her like a cold wave – the public exposure, the professional awkwardness, the painful reminder that some wounds never fully healed. She let out a tight breath, the sound echoing through the room, and hastily ended the call.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't just the words that cut deep – it was how she said them, like ripping off a bandage that had already started healing. \"You're too old,\" she'd said, her voice laced with pity, as if watching a butterfly die. They'd tried so hard, both of them, but it hadn't worked out. He'd left, and she'd stayed, holding on to hope, even when it seemed impossible. Now, standing here, surrounded by sterile white walls, she felt like a ghost haunting the place where she used to feel most alive. Every step felt heavy, every glance made her feel like she was being sized up. It was as if she was trapped in a dream, one that kept shifting and twisting until nothing made sense anymore. But what hurt most was knowing that her failure was a constant reminder to everyone else. Even those who didn't know us – they knew something was wrong, that we weren't whole.

Years of supporting his career, sacrificing their social life, and putting up with his ego had finally paid off – but at what cost? Her own work was relegated to the garage, her passion stifled by his relentless pursuit of fame.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted from the nearby easel, where she'd left her own abandoned project.
