I have plenty of other guys who would love to date me now. Why does everyone look so relaxed? They must be faking it. I'm the only one who knows what real stress looks like. Everyone else has it easy, living their perfect lives while I struggle every day. It's just not fair. I bet if I walked into that kitchen, no one would even notice I was there. They think they're so smart, thinking they can just keep moving forward, but they don't understand the pain I've endured. No one understands me, and I'll never find someone who truly cares about me.

Just then, the door swung open, and a new customer stepped inside, ordering a sandwich. A wave of frustration washed over him—it was going to be one of those days, where no matter how hard he worked, nothing would ever go smoothly. **An unexpected question** As he plated the food, a question popped into his head: What if she didn’t mean anything by these calls? Maybe she needed help with something else entirely. The thought was fleeting, but it gave him a moment’s peace.
