It's hard to say for certain what might have happened, but it's clear that she wasn't thinking very carefully about her actions. Perhaps if the woman had taken a moment to think before loading her groceries onto the conveyor belt, none of these incidents would have occurred. She wouldn’t have knocked over those cans of beans, nor would she have spilled pasta sauce everywhere. Things might have gone smoothly, and we wouldn’t be left wondering what could have been. It’s possible that the woman didn’t even notice how much she was disturbing everyone around her. If she had been more aware of her actions, maybe she wouldn’t have caused such a commotion in the store. But now, it seems like she simply lost control of herself, leading to chaos wherever she went.

Maybe he’s just trying to convince himself that he’s still cool by acting like he doesn’t know anything. It’s almost funny how he tried to act confident, but he clearly didn’t expect to be served by someone half his age. He must feel so awkward and out of place among those younger people.
