A string of delayed lab results from a particularly high-profile case weighed heavily on her mind – a patient's life hung in the balance, and she was still waiting on crucial test results.\n\nAs she scanned the notes, her eyes landed on a familiar name: Mrs. Johnson, the same woman who had been admitted last week after a fall. The doctor's scribbled note caught her attention – 'Failed to follow up on medication regimen.' The same medication her own mother had refused to take when she'd been diagnosed with diabetes years ago.\n\nA knot formed in her stomach as she wondered if this was another avoidable tragedy waiting to happen. She felt a wave of frustration wash over her, her breath catching in her throat. Her gaze drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away with agonizing slowness. The report continued to roll in, but all she could hear was the steady beep of the printer, a reminder that time was running out.<|eot_id|>",

They don’t seem to notice anything, so why am I freaking out? I force myself to breathe, but it’s no use - every time I think about my mom, I start to panic. This is ridiculous. I need to stop thinking about this. But how can I just ignore it? It feels like the whole world is against me now. I keep looking at that stupid clock, watching the seconds tick by. What if something else comes up? What if they forget about Mrs. Johnson? It's driving me crazy. Why does everything have to go wrong for me? I swear, I'm starting to lose it.

Anyway, after it was over, we were all supposed to grab lunch together. Instead, he just sat there, staring at some random spot on the wall. It was weird because everyone else was chatting and laughing, but he just sat there. I guess he thought he needed to relax or something? Maybe he was just overwhelmed? I don’t know, but I’ve never seen anyone act like that before. And then, today, he messed up again. He’s doing a big presentation here, and he can’t seem to get his head straight. He’s stumbling over his words and everything. It’s like he forgot what he was saying half the time. I don’t think he’ll be able to finish it. At least, I hope he doesn’t. Honestly, I feel bad for him. This isn’t the first time he’s had issues like this. There was another time when he did a talk, and he ended up getting fired because of it.

Aisling felt a flicker of annoyance at the intrusion, but quickly suppressed it as she didn't want to appear unprofessional.\n\nAs the woman continued to chat with another colleague, Aisling couldn't help but notice the way she smoothed out her uniform jacket, ensuring every wrinkle was gone, every crease perfectly aligned. The attention to detail seemed almost... artificial.\n\nAisling's gaze drifted away, focusing on her phone as she waited for her coffee.
