It was a gesture he'd grown accustomed to over the past few months – a reminder that some things still brought him joy, even in the midst of grief.\n\nAs he gazed at the flowers, memories of his wife flooded his mind. He remembered the way she used to smile when they walked through fields of sunflowers together, their children laughing and chasing after butterflies. The sound of her laughter still echoed in his ears, but it was a bittersweet reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nA patrol car pulled up beside him, its siren blaring softly as the officer inside called out, \"Hey, buddy, need a ride?\" He hesitated, unsure if he could face another day of paperwork and meetings, of pretending everything was okay when it wasn't.\n\nThe officer's voice broke the spell, and he forced himself to take a deep breath. He nodded curtly, tucking the bouquet into his pocket as he followed the officer to the cruiser. As they drove away from the precinct, the sunflowers seemed to wilt slightly in his pocket, a poignant reminder of the fragility of beauty and the depth of his sorrow.<|eot_id|>",

Yeah, well, my whole life has been hell too, and I’ve had to put on a mask every single day, so don’t try to play the victim card with me. And another thing, why the fuck did he go back to work so soon? Doesn’t he know that the last thing we need right now is someone who looks like they’re about to die from grief walking around our precinct? It’s like he thinks he can just come in here, pretend nothing happened, and everyone will forget about it overnight? Well, let me tell you something, pal - my wife died yesterday, and I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. But I don’t have time to sit around and feel sorry for myself all day.

Every moment felt like an eternity, every task a burden. Her phone vibrated with yet another message, each one more annoying than the last. Another reminder that her life was stuck in neutral, that no matter how hard she tried, things would never change. Her thoughts swirled with frustration, trapped in a never-ending loop of anger and resentment. She felt like she was drowning in a sea of her own making, unable to escape. A glance at her calendar revealed a looming deadline, a constant reminder of all the things she could never do. She sighed, the sound barely audible over the hum of the office. It was all so meaningless; every effort, every dream, seemed destined to fail. The days blended together, lost in a haze of monotony and regret. In this endless cycle, what was the point? She felt like she was running in place, never truly going anywhere. Each step forward led to another step back, as if the universe was playing some twisted game with her.

A chill ran down her spine as she recalled the way he'd taken credit for her work, effortlessly gliding into their joint paper like they were a single unit.\n\nHer gaze narrowed, tracing the lines of text where his name appeared. Each word felt like a personal affront, a deliberate attempt to erase her contribution. She clenched her fists beneath the table, her knuckles white with suppressed rage. For a moment, the only sound was the soft hum of machinery and the quiet hiss of air conditioning.\n\nThen, her fingers began to move, scrolling through the slides with a calculated precision. Every click, every swipe, seemed to fuel her growing resentment. The presentation morphed into a digital representation of the countless nights she'd spent pouring over data, only to have him swoop in and claim it as his own.
