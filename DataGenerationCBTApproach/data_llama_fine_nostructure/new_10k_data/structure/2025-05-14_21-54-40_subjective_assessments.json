It was addressed to her, but there was no return address and no indication of who might have sent it.\n\nAs she picked up the box, a faint scent of lavender wafted out, transporting her back to her wedding day. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she turned the box over in her hands, searching for any clues about its contents. But there were none.\n\nThe doorman called out from behind his desk, \"All set for your shift, Doc?\"\n\nShe hesitated, unsure if she wanted to go inside yet. The package seemed to be waiting for her, and she couldn't shake the feeling that it held something important. But what?\n\nTaking a deep breath, she pushed open the door and stepped into the elevator, the package clutched tightly in her hand. As the doors closed, she felt a wave of anxiety wash over her, and her mind began to whirl with worst-case scenarios. What could be inside? And why had it been sent to her?<|eot_id|>",

But honestly, I’m just confused by how much I care about this package. I’ve been thinking about it nonstop since we got here. I mean, what if someone sent it? Who would send it? Would they want me to open it now? I feel like my feelings are saying yes, but I’m still wondering why. I can’t help but imagine the worst case. What if it’s something bad? What if it’s related to our work somehow? I feel anxious, but I also kind of expect it to be okay. That sounds crazy, but I just can’t stop thinking about it.

She instinctively shielded her face from the thick white smoke billowing towards her, but it was too late – her eyes stung, and her breath caught as she stumbled backwards, knocking over a chair.\n\nHer husband, sitting at the counter, leapt up to help, his voice calm and reassuring as he grabbed her elbow and steered her towards the back door. Outside, they stood frozen, watching as the flames engulfed their restaurant, consuming years of hard work and memories.\n\nShe felt like she'd been punched in the gut, the panic rising in her chest as she clutched her husband's arm, her mind racing with the thought of losing everything they'd built together.

I'm not surprised she feels overwhelmed. She must be incredibly stressed out right now, and it's completely understandable. It's a really tough situation, and I wouldn't want anyone else to go through it either. This isn't just some minor setback; it's a disaster. She needs to take care of herself during this time, and I hope she does. Losing something so important can be devastating, especially when you've put your heart and soul into it. There's no need to worry about her feelings being exaggerated; she has every right to feel upset. I don't think there's anything wrong with her emotions, though.
