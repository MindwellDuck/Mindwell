The fridge, once a sign of abundance and joy, now loomed as a harsh reminder of what he'd lost. The silence of his apartment seemed deafening, a constant reminder that he was truly alone. Every moment felt like a waste, every decision a failure waiting to happen. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was drowning in his own incompetence, that every step forward was met with two steps backward. The fridge stood as a monument to his failures, its emptiness echoing the emptiness within him—a hollow reflection of all that was wrong.
