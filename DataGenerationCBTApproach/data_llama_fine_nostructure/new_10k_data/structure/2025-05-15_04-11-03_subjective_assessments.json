I'm trying to fix this entire project by myself because apparently, no one else wants to lift a finger around here.\"\n\nHe chuckled and put his arm around me, \"Well, you're clearly a superhero, saving the world one line of code at a time.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes good-naturedly, but inside, I was seething. Why did he always have to make light of things? Didn't he understand that I was suffocating under the weight of all this responsibility?\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of overwhelm, but it only seemed to intensify as I gazed out the window, watching our two-year-old play happily in the park below. They were carefree, laughing and chasing after butterflies, completely unaware of the crushing stress that was building up inside me.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I realized I was stuck in this never-ending cycle of helping others – my family, my colleagues, everyone – while nobody ever asked me what I needed or how I could be helped.

They kept promising they’d find solutions, but the truth was, they weren’t doing anything except making our lives worse. Then there was the incident with the medication. We were given a new drug to treat her anxiety, but within days, she began acting out – refusing to eat, throwing tantrums, and even trying to hurt herself. It was like the medication was fueling her demons instead of calming them down. When I confronted the psychiatrist, he just shrugged and told me, \"It's not his problem.\" Like, are you fucking kidding me?

How could anyone expect her to forgive him when she saw him so carefree with his new partner? They were together, holding hands, and laughing. They didn’t even know each other! How could they possibly have such a strong connection when Thompson herself couldn’t even manage to keep her own life together? It was infuriating, and it made her want to scream.
