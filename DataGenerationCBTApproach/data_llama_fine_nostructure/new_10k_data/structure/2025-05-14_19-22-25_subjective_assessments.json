It'll set us apart from the other restaurants.\"\n\nThe chef's eyes narrowed slightly as she considered the suggestion. She'd always prided herself on being able to create menus that appealed to a wide range of tastes. But what if they changed? What if their customers stopped coming back?\n\nJust then, the head chef called out from the pass, ordering them to move faster. The kitchen erupted into a flurry of activity, with pots clanging and orders shouted. The chef felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she frantically plated dish after dish.\n\nFor a moment, she forgot about Maria's words, lost in the chaos of the kitchen. But when the rush died down and the staff began to filter out, Maria turned to her and asked, \"So, do you think we can make it work?\"<|eot_id|>",
