A faint ache stirred in his chest as he recalled the countless afternoons spent listening to his grandfather's stories about history, and the way those stories made him feel seen and understood.\n\nAs he looked around the apartment, now devoid of any personal touches or mementos, he felt the weight of his solitude settle upon him. His phone buzzed in his pocket, but it wasn't a text from someone special; it was just another reminder that even the most mundane moments were now lived alone.<|eot_id|>",
