The barista, a young college student with a nose ring, chatted enthusiastically with a friend about their shared love of indie music. As the woman approached, the barista barely looked up, taking her order with a distracted tone.\n\nWhen the woman asked for cream and sugar, the barista replied, \"Uh-huh, yeah, sure...I think we have some creamer somewhere.\" She rummaged through the containers behind the counter before finally producing a half-empty carton. As she poured the creamer into the woman's cup, she knocked over the container, spilling it all over the counter. \n\nThe woman sighed, collecting the scattered creamer packets.

When I got my drink, I checked the label and saw that they had gotten the flavor wrong. It wasn't even close. The barista seemed so uninterested when I ordered, like she would rather be anywhere else. And then, when I asked for cream and sugar, she said something like, \"Yeah, okay,\" which made me feel like she didn't really care about my order. After I paid, I left my receipt on the counter, hoping she'd take care of cleaning up the spilled creamer. But she just kept talking to her friend while they were both standing there, waiting for the next customer. They seemed more interested in their conversation than in helping out. I felt really bad about having to leave them with the mess, especially since they probably wouldn't get paid for it. I know they weren't trying to be mean, but it still bothered me. I wish people would be kinder to customers sometimes."
