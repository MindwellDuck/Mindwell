The numbers were staggering – dozens of young women gone missing within the past year, all with similar circumstances. The lack of progress was suffocating.\n\nAs she read about the most recent victim, a 25-year-old nurse who had vanished while walking home from work, a sense of despair washed over her. She felt like she'd been running on empty for years since her husband passed away, but this...this was different. This was a reminder that some things would never change, that justice was still elusive, and that the darkness seemed to be closing in.\n\nThe room around her began to fade into the background as tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. She rubbed them dry, trying to shake off the feeling of helplessness, but it only seemed to intensify as she continued reading. The words blurred together on the screen, and she felt herself being pulled under by the weight of hopelessness, unable to escape its crushing grip.<|eot_id|>",

Doesn't matter though - she's probably right. I don't deserve to live, and I definitely don't deserve to be happy anymore. What the hell is wrong with me? Why can't I ever just get over it? Is she waiting for me to crack? If only I could just disappear for once, maybe then people wouldn't think I'm such an asshole.

Maybe he really was just one of those lucky guys born into the right family, with everything handed to him on a silver platter. Why else would he be able to talk to anyone, make friends easily, never seeming to worry about anything? I felt like crying as I watched him chatting with that cute girl over there. They were laughing together, sharing stories, completely carefree. They didn't have a single problem between them. But then again, they weren't me either.

She thought of her husband, who seemed distant lately. Every small thing he did—like forgetting the electricity bill—felt like a slap in the face. His carelessness weighed heavily on her, especially when compared to his occasional help with household chores. It wasn't just the bills; her entire life felt like a balancing act. One wrong move could send everything crashing down. Yet, amidst the chaos, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was either doing perfectly fine or completely failing. The world seemed to be divided into two extremes – success and failure, right or wrong. In this moment, she wondered if she was truly standing alone, or if others shared her burden.
