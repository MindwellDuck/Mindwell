One of them, a petite blonde, caught her eye - her gleaming white coat and infectious smile seemed to radiate confidence.\n\nAs the doors opened, the blonde resident breezed past, exchanging warm smiles with the nurses. She effortlessly navigated the crowded hallway, pausing to offer words of encouragement to a junior doctor struggling to keep up with her workload. The resident's poise and authority drew admiring glances from passing colleagues, including one particularly handsome attending physician who lingered nearby, his gaze lingering on the blonde's profile.\n\nThe female doctor felt a pang of resentment as she watched the blonde's effortless dominance over the chaotic hospital floor. For a moment, her own accomplishments - years of grueling training, late nights, and sleepless shifts - seemed diminished by comparison. As she stepped into the elevator, the doors closed behind her, but the memory of the blonde's triumphant smile lingered, casting a shadow over her morning routine.<|eot_id|>",

You never know how much of a difference therapy could make. Who knows? Maybe it would finally set him free from all those burdens weighing him down. Only time will tell if he finds redemption. This situation is really bringing up some old feelings for me too. I remember when my sister went through something similar, how she struggled to cope with the stress.
