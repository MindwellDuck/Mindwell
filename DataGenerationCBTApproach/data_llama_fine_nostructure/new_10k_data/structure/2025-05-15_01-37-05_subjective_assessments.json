But when the woman approached the checkout counter, it became clear: these were for her husband's funeral.\n\nThe woman's eyes met hers, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a connection that went beyond words.

I see the way light danced across her skin, the way her laughter echoed through the halls, and I feel the ache within me grow, as if my very soul is trying to remind me of what we once shared. Every day feels like an eternity, a never-ending cycle of pain. Each transaction a reminder that time keeps moving forward, leaving me further and further behind. I think about how we would sit together by nightfall, sharing stories of our days, and how I longed to hear her voice, to feel her warmth beside me. Even now, I can imagine the sound of her gentle touch, the way her fingers intertwined with mine, and the softness of her lips against mine.
