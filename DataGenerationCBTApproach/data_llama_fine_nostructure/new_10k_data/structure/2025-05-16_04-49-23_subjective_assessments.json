The leftovers were cold, congealed, and unappetizing – a stark contrast to the vibrant meal she usually brought home after a long day of work. As he pushed the plate away, memories of her helping him cook dinner a few weeks ago flooded his mind.\n\nShe had taken the time to chop fresh vegetables, sauté them in olive oil, and season them with herbs, the aromas filling their small apartment and transporting him back to a time when they spent more quality time together. Now, it seemed like every evening was a solo affair.\n\nAs he gazed out the window, lost in thought, he noticed the neatly organized toolbox in the corner of the room, its contents meticulously maintained by his wife over the years. He remembered how she would often help him with minor repairs and projects around the house, now something he did himself.\n\nA faint scent of lavender wafted through the air, reminding him of the bouquet she used to make for him before bed. It was as if he was drowning in a sea of forgotten moments, each one a poignant reminder of what he felt was slipping further away. The silence between them grew thicker, suffocating him with an unsettling sense of abandonment.<|eot_id|>",

The cashier asked her how her day was going, and she forced a weak smile, trying to hide the knot in her stomach. As she waited for her turn to pay, she noticed the price of the gift - $50 for a simple necklace. She felt a pang of jealousy, thinking about the expensive watches her ex used to buy her.\n\nWhen it was finally her turn, she handed over her credit card, trying to distract herself by counting out her change. But her mind kept drifting back to the couple, their love and happiness making her own situation feel even more isolating.

She’s stuck here, feeling sad and unloved, while everyone else has their perfect couples. As she walked home, she couldn’t help but think about all the things she could’ve been doing instead – maybe meeting new people, working on her career, or simply being happy with what she had. But no, she’s wasting her time, stuck in this rut, while everyone else moves forward. This isn’t fair; why can’t she have some happiness too? Why does everything always seem so unfair? She feels like a total failure, and now, after seeing those two, she really wants to give up. Maybe she’ll go home, put on some music, and let the tears flow. Who needs love when you have self-pity? It’s not just the necklace; it’s the whole scene. She’s just an invisible person, nobody cares about her. If anyone would take notice, they’d be laughing at her – \"look at her, still single, buying something so cheap.\" Even the cashier seemed kind, but he probably didn’t really care. He must be used to seeing people like her, taking pity on them"
