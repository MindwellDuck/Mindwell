You think I enjoy seeing those dresses all messed up? It's like rubbing salt in my wounds every time I see one. People always talk about how they got married young, how they were meant to be together. But nobody ever talks about the fucked-up things that happen when they break apart. Nobody cares about the messy reality of divorce. And then there are the kids—oh, the fucking kids. They grow up hearing stories about their parents' marriage, about how we used to love each other, about how we were once happy. But what does that even mean? Does it make them feel better knowing that everyone else has it worse than us? No, it makes them sad, because they know they'll never experience anything close to that happiness.

His hands, now frail and arthritic, clenched into fists as if trying to hold onto something – time, youth, control. \n\nAt 77, the once-thriving newsroom was a shadow of its former self. Younger reporters had taken over, their laptops humming with ease as they chugged through articles with effortless speed.

Instead, it was his editor, her eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep.\n\n\"Sir, we need you to write a piece on...on assisted living facilities,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"The city council is considering new regulations, and we need your expertise.\"\n\nSomething inside him twisted, like a thread unraveling. The thought of spending more years cooped up in a sterile room, with no byline to claim, sent a shiver down his spine.

It didn't matter how many hours he spent staring at the TV; he could never escape the emptiness that gnawed at his soul. His parents were dead, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that they'd abandoned him when he needed them most. They'd left him alone in this cold world, leaving behind nothing but a legacy of disappointment and regret. Even his own children seemed distant, as if they were just pawns in some game he couldn't understand. There was always something holding him back, whether it was fear or laziness, making it impossible for him to take action. The only thing that brought him fleeting joy was his art, but even that felt hollow now. I remember my grandfather telling me about how he used to paint beautiful landscapes, capturing the beauty of nature. He said that painting gave him peace and comfort during difficult times. But he passed away before I could learn much about his technique, and I feel like I'm missing out on something special. I wish I could find inspiration in the world around me, but everything feels dull and uninteresting.

They had shared something special; she couldn’t just replace him with someone else. That would never work. She posted about going on a trip, laughing with her friends, and even sharing a funny video. But it all felt hollow, like she was pretending to move on while secretly still thinking about him. It was infuriating. Why did she have to make everything look so perfect?
