But then she began acting strange, changing her schedule to spend more time at work, which made me think she was spending time with someone else. I confronted her about my concerns, but she just said I was being paranoid. I realized I wasn't the problem; she was avoiding talking to me because she was seeing someone else. When we got married, things seemed perfect. We were happy together. But whenever I brought up how I didn't see her spending so much time away from home, she would say she was busy with family obligations or just needed some alone time. I wouldn't push the issue since I knew she was lying, but deep down, I felt like she was cheating on me. Eventually, I decided to confront her, but when I asked if there was something she wanted to talk about, she said she wasn’t interested. That’s when I realized she didn’t want to discuss it, which made me think she was hiding something. So I told her I suspected she was having an affair, and she became defensive, saying I was being ridiculous and that I was just insecure. She even accused me of lying about seeing her, claiming I must have made it up to make myself look bad. I was shocked by her denial and felt like I was losing control. I finally broke down, telling her that"

But she couldn't tear her eyes away from the photo. Why did it have to be there? Was it trying to tell her something? Maybe it was a sign, a warning that she wasn't supposed to see this. The samples must be hidden, deliberately left out so she wouldn't find them. But why? And what about the emails? Had she received any? No, wait, there were none. Or were there?

Why would they understand? They don’t know what it’s like to be here. Now I need to calm down, but it’s hard when everything feels so chaotic. I guess I just want things to go back to normal again.
