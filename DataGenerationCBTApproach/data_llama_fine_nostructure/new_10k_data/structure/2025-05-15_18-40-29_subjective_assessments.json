It seemed like just yesterday she and her husband were hosting gatherings, laughing together, and watching their children grow up.

Or worse, what if her husband's health took a sudden turn for the worse? Maybe she was being paranoid, but she couldn't shake the feeling that everything was building towards a single moment – a moment that would change their lives forever. With each dish she scrubbed, she felt the weight of her predictions growing stronger. She pictured the scene vividly, every detail etched into her mind: the look of shock on her face, the tears streaming down her daughter's cheeks, and the desperation in her husband's eyes as he pleaded for forgiveness. It all seemed so inevitable, as if time itself was ticking away, leading them toward this point of no return.
