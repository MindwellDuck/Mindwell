A young officer, barely out of training, hesitantly raised his hand to ask about a high-profile case from last year. The rookie's words caught her off guard – he'd been given the lead on it, despite having only worked the night shift.\n\nAs she watched him, a creeping sense of dread settled over her. She recalled the department's internal review, the changes made after the initial investigation went south. The rookie's inexperience was palpable, and the risk of another failure weighed heavily on her mind.

They didn't get the recognition they deserved, and it ended up costing us so much more than we ever could have imagined. I swear, sometimes I feel like the entire team is being held hostage by these incompetent fools who think they can handle cases they weren’t even trained for. I mean, who does that?! It’s just so... so... ugh. What am I doing? Why am I letting my emotions get the better of me? This isn't the time for ranting. But seriously, how can they expect to succeed with someone as inexperienced as this kid? It’s absurd! He doesn't stand a chance against those big-time criminals. What if he screws up?
