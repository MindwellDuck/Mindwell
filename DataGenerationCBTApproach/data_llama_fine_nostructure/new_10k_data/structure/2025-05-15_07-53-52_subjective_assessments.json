A small voice in the back of her mind whispered that maybe she shouldn't have skipped buying the fresh herbs. Maybe it was a sign of laziness or disrespect towards their guests.\n\nLater that evening, after the dinner party, James mentioned that he had been meaning to ask her about a new restaurant they wanted to try. As they were walking out of the house, she realized she must have left the jar of fresh herbs in the pantry, intending to pick some up on their way home tomorrow.\n\nThe memory of that mistake lingered, making her feel like she was being careless and unthoughtful – not just about the herb, but about their relationship and their friends.<|eot_id|>",

That perfect, golden-brown crust had seemed so effortless, almost... magical. She remembered how James had taken a bite, closed his eyes, and nodded in approval, like he was savoring a secret only she could understand. Later, when she was preparing lunch, she realized she had forgotten to buy the fresh herbs. She had grabbed the frozen ones anyway, thinking nothing of it - until James complimented her cooking. His smile seemed genuine, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that he was hiding something. Wasn’t that the same look he gave her when she forgot to pick up milk? And now, as they talked about trying a new restaurant, she felt like she was losing her grip. Why did this keep happening? Why did everything seem to be a reminder of her mistakes?

I just want him to stay home and listen to me, but he said he had too many meetings and couldn’t take time off. I know he’s busy, but why does it hurt so much? It feels like I’m always letting him down somehow—I’ve been doing some research on my own because I don’t trust doctors anymore. They’re all incompetent and would rather keep my sister’s condition a secret than treat her properly. But John doesn’t understand that. He thinks everything will be okay once she goes through chemo, but what if it doesn’t work? What if she dies? I’m starting to think I’d be better off without him. At least then I wouldn’t have to worry about being a burden or making mistakes.

And now, every interaction with her is tainted by this assumption that she sees right through me. What if she does? What if she knows exactly how I feel?
