Yeah, well, maybe if you actually cared, we could find some way to make it work. Why does everyone else get to live their lives easily while I’m stuck here dealing with all this shit?

Now, those same words echoed in her head like a cruel mantra.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into a vibrant shade of blue, her hand trembled ever so slightly. The color seemed dull compared to the vibrant hues she'd once been so proud of. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling that she'd failed herself, that this painting would never measure up to her own expectations.

But life has a way of shattering those dreams, leaving us with nothing but shards of glass and the echoes of what we once believed. She looks at me, her eyes searching for something more, but all she finds is the emptiness within. It’s as if the very walls are closing in on her, trapping her in a prison of her own making. Every glance, every gesture, every word is a reminder that she’s lost—lost to the world, lost to herself, lost to the memories that haunt her. Those memories, they linger, refusing to let go, like the ghostly shadows of what could have been. But she won’t give up. Oh no, she won’t. Not when there’s still hope, still a spark within her, waiting to be fanned into flames. For every step forward, she takes two backward, the weight of her past bearing down upon her like an avalanche.

One of them, a newer resident, leaned over to whisper something to another doctor. He caught snippets of their conversation, something about'second opinions' and 'consultations.' A familiar knot began to form in his stomach.\n\nThe morning rush subsided, and the room emptied. Alone in his office, he stared out the window, lost in thought. His partner had mentioned earlier that weekend they might consider couples therapy to work through some recent issues. Now, doubts crept in - was this another sign that he wasn't good enough?
