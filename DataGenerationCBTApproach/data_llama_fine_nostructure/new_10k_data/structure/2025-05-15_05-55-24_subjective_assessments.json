His partner, Rachel, had been helping out more frequently lately, and while it was nice to have some extra hands, it also meant she got to be the one to present their dishes to the customers.\n\nAs he plated up a perfectly seared scallop dish, he noticed Rachel was already taking orders from a table of four. He felt a twinge of annoyance at being left out, even if it was just for a few minutes. When the first order came in, he took it himself, but as he began to plate the food, he caught sight of Rachel laughing and chatting with the customer, her eyes sparkling with warmth.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the kitchen chaos around him and focused on the way Rachel seemed to effortlessly connect with this stranger. It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to in their relationship – always being the center of attention, always the one who seemed to shine. And now, here he was, standing behind the scenes, cooking for others instead of being the one being served.<|eot_id|>",

As I watched my boyfriend expertly juggle multiple pans, I realized that when I'm not doing what he does, I don't matter. I can't stand how he's always the center of attention - whether it's cooking or just hanging out. He has this charming, effortless quality that makes everyone love him. Meanwhile, I’m stuck in the background, always trying to live up to his expectations. The more I try, the more I feel invisible. It’s like I’m just another cog in his life, never truly seen or appreciated. I’ve tried so hard to prove myself, but nothing ever feels enough. Every time he's praised by someone, it's like they're talking about him, not me. Even when we talk about our day, everything always comes back to him. I guess what hurts is that I know he loves me, but sometimes I wonder if it's all just a front. Is he really happy, or am I just a convenient placeholder? I see how much joy he gets from cooking, and it makes me feel like I'm just a burden. Sometimes I wish I could be the one who made people smile like he does. But deep down, I think it's okay to accept that I might never be good enough. Maybe I'll just stick to being the \"behind-the-scenes\" version of myself. After all, it's better than being forgotten altogether."

It was almost... palpable. She felt a twinge of resentment, a spark of spite ignite within her.\n\nThe younger woman caught her eye, and for a moment, their gazes locked. But it was the younger woman who looked away first, a flicker of embarrassment crossing her face before she quickly returned to gathering her belongings. \n\nThe door closed behind her, and the older woman let out a quiet sigh.

I swear, she must’ve gotten her degree from some online school because she has no idea what she’s talking about. Even the other scientists are starting to think she’s an idiot. Why can’t she just shut up and stop making everyone look bad? She thinks she’s so smart, but really, she’s just a big ol’ bitch. And don’t even get me started on how she treats her students. They’re basically her slaves, forced to work 24/7 while she sits around collecting her paycheck.
