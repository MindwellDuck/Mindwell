I wondered what could have caused such a sudden change. Maybe there’s some issue with his family that I’m not aware of? Or maybe this is just how he feels around new people? But then I thought about how he acted in the meeting yesterday. He seemed distant, almost distracted, which made me think about whether everything is okay between us. Is he stressed about something? Did I say something wrong? I feel like he might be struggling. And now, when I see him again, I start thinking about how much he's changed since we started dating. His behavior has become more reserved, and it makes me wonder if he misses his old life before we met. What if he regrets leaving his friends behind? Could he still be in touch with them? His eyes looked really tired today, almost sad. I can’t help but imagine all the things that might be bothering him – work stress, health issues, or personal problems. Maybe he’s going through a tough time, and I need to make an effort to understand what’s going on. What if he needs someone to talk to? Sometimes I worry that our relationship might be affecting his relationships with others. Does he feel like I’m changing him? Am I pushing him away from his old life? I know he has a big family back home"
