The curator's note – \"we appreciate your unique perspective, but feel it doesn't align with our current focus\" – seemed to mock her now.\n\nAs she read the words again, a faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, mingling with the smell of yesterday's coffee. Her eyes wandered to the sketchbook open on her easel, filled with rough drafts of a series exploring themes of identity and belonging – ideas she'd poured her heart into. A faint bruise above her left eyebrow, a souvenir from a particularly grueling critique session weeks prior, throbbed in time with her racing heartbeat.\n\nThe silence of her solo apartment felt oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the studio's fluorescent light overhead. She hadn't spoken to anyone all day, afraid of sharing her disappointment with someone else, even though her best friend had texted her hours ago asking how her submission went. The thought of facing her empty apartment, devoid of even the comforting presence of art supplies, made her feel hollow and alone.<|eot_id|>",

Fuck it, maybe she'll try again next year. But why bother? They'll probably reject her then too. Why waste my time trying to prove myself? I'm never going to make it out of this fucking hole. This is it, my last chance, and I blew it. I should've just stayed in school, gotten a real job, and avoided all this shit. Now I'm just sitting here, surrounded by unfinished canvases and broken dreams, wondering what could have been. If only I'd taken that job offer, if only I'd kept pushing forward. But no, I had to go and ruin everything. What if I'd just gone ahead and applied anyway? Maybe I wouldn't be stuck in this godforsaken town right now, living off scraps and struggling to make ends meet. But no, I had to go and fuck up again.

The smell of disinfectant and the hum of equipment were familiar comforts, but her mind kept wandering back to the email she'd received from the university last week.\n\nA tenure review committee had been assembled, and her performance was being evaluated. She couldn't shake the feeling that this was it – the final hurdle before they made their decision about whether to offer her a permanent position. The weight of uncertainty settled heavy in her chest, making her breath catch as she struggled to recall the exact date of the meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning.\n\nHer hands trembled slightly as she reached for a pipette, the sensation sending a jolt of anxiety through her entire body.

But when I looked around, all I saw were people trying to keep up with her pace. They were working twice as hard just to stay within reach, and yet they still felt like they were falling behind. Even Dr. Thompson seemed impressed by her work, though he tried to downplay his praise with a casual “she’s got a lot of potential.” That much talent is rare, after all. But why did it feel like everyone else was failing while she excelled? Wasn’t she supposed to be the one pushing us forward, not pulling us further into the gap? And what about me? I’d worked tirelessly alongside her, pouring over data and running simulations until we both collapsed from exhaustion. Yet when I glanced at the numbers, mine were always lagging behind hers. I felt like an apprentice trying to learn from a master, but even then, there was no guarantee of success. Why did it seem like every step forward for her meant another step backward for me? It wasn’t fair. We were all in this together, but somehow it felt like I was drowning in her wake, struggling to keep up while she glided effortlessly ahead. I couldn’t help but wonder how someone"

Her hands trembled slightly as she dipped into a vibrant shade of blue, the color clashing with the dull grey mood that had settled over her studio. The phone rang, shrill and insistent.\n\nFor a moment, she hesitated, letting the ringing continue. It was been six months since her husband passed away, and some days still felt like an open wound. She knew the calls from his friends and acquaintances were well-intentioned, but they only served as a painful reminder of what she'd lost. \n\nThe ring stopped, replaced by the soft hum of voicemail. She let out a small sigh, frustration simmering beneath the surface. As she turned back to her painting, a faint memory of a conversation with her late husband flashed through her mind – a phrase he'd used to calm her when she got angry, a phrase that now grated on her nerves.\n\nHer hand tightened around the brush, the blue paint beginning to bleed onto the canvas in uneven strokes.<|eot_id|>",

A call from a mutual friend caught her off guard, a voice laced with empathy but also curiosity—“How are you doing?” For a moment, she considered lying, telling him everything was fine when deep down it wasn’t. But then she thought about how he’d always said, “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.” He never told her to just move on; he taught her how to face life’s challenges head-on. Maybe this call wasn’t about moving forward, but about confronting the truth. What would happen if she opened herself up to the possibility that she might never fully heal? As she picked up the phone, a wave of uncertainty washed over her. She had so many questions: Would she ever find happiness again? Could she rebuild her life without him? How would she handle the memories that still lingered? And what if she decided she couldn't handle it all? What if the grief became too much to bear, and she gave up trying? But for now, she took a deep breath and answered the call, ready to face whatever came next, even if it meant facing the unknown head-on."

You've been dealing with so much lately.\" Her tone shifted, turning accusatory. “But what about all those things you’ve been putting off? The bills, the laundry, the cooking? When are you going to take care of yourself?” The room fell silent. He could feel the anger building inside him. It had been months since she’d last called, but she seemed just as concerned about him now as she had then. Her words were laced with an underlying message - one he knew well. “Do you think I don’t know what I’m doing?” he asked, his voice low and even. “You never let me finish a sentence around you.” Her response was immediate. “Of course not. You’re too busy staring at your phone to listen.” A chill ran down his spine. This was exactly how she always reacted when he tried to defend himself. She would turn his words back against him, using them to fuel her own anger. He couldn’t help but wonder if this was really how she saw him - lazy and self-absorbed.

They always saw him as someone who didn't belong. And now, as he looked out into the grey sky, he couldn't help but wonder—what if? At least he knew how things might have turned out. At least he understood that nothing ever changes. That every door you walk through leads to the same result: rejection. You can't change the past; you can't escape your fate. Nothing ever changes.
