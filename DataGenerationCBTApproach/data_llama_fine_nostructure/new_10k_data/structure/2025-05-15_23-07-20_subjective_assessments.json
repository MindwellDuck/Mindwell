Another day, another dollar – or rather, another day, another chance to make a difference.\n\nAs he made his way to the ward, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. His girlfriend, Rachel, had been acting strange all morning. She'd texted him an hour ago, saying she needed some space and that he would understand when he got home.\n\nHe shrugged it off as mere drama, but the seed of doubt had already taken root. What if she wasn't just stressed about work? What if there was someone else?\n\nHe arrived at the first room on the list and began making his rounds. The patients were all stable, and the vitals looked good. But as he turned to leave, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror attached to the wall.\n\nFor a split second, their eyes met – the nurse's, not one of the patients'. A fleeting glance, but enough to send a shiver down his spine. He felt a jolt of annoyance at himself for even noticing it, but the image lingered.\n\nThe rest of the day passed in a blur. He went through the motions, answering questions, administering medication, and checking charts. But every now and then, his mind wandered back to Rachel and that cryptic message.\n\nWhat did she mean by'space'? Was she trying to tell him something? And what was he supposed to do about it?\n\nAs he finished up his rounds and headed out of the hospital, he couldn't help but wonder if he was being paranoid. But the nagging voice in his head refused to quiet down.\n\nIt wasn't until he pulled into the driveway and saw Rachel's car parked outside that he realized how anxious he'd become. He took a deep breath, grabbed his bag, and stepped out into the evening air.\n\nBut as he opened the door to get in, he noticed something – a small package on the passenger seat. No note, no indication of who it might have come from.\n\nA flutter in his chest, a spark of unease. He felt his heart rate pick up, and for a moment, he wondered if he was really ready to face whatever lay ahead.<|eot_id|>",

This wasn't the life he wanted for himself – or for anyone else. But every time he tried to leave the past behind, it came flooding back.\n\nThe door creaked open, and his student, Emma, walked in with a stack of papers. She looked up at him with those big brown eyes, and for a moment, he forgot about his pain. But then he remembered the words his ex-wife had whispered in his ear during their final argument: 'You're just a teacher, not a real man.'\n\nEmma handed him a worksheet, and he forced a smile, trying to shake off the feeling of worthlessness that had settled in his chest. But as he took the paper from her, he couldn't help but feel like he was drowning in his own failures.<|eot_id|>",

That kind of emotional baggage can really hold you back, especially if you’re dealing with students who are going through similar issues. * To be honest, I think he's taking his failure far too seriously. A lot of people don't realize how much emotional energy goes into teaching. You have to put yourself out there every day, deal with difficult situations, and manage your own stress levels. It takes a toll on you, both physically and mentally. If he keeps putting so much weight on what happened in the past, he'll never be able to move forward. * What I find really interesting here is how his emotions seem to be driving his thoughts and actions. When he sees the photo, he immediately starts thinking about all the ways he failed his marriage and how his ex-wife feels about him now. It's like his mind has created this narrative of himself as a failing husband, which makes sense given everything he's said recently. * **This is an emotional reasoner:** They tend to focus on their immediate feelings rather than objective facts.

Nope, too busy being a selfish, egotistical artist to even notice she was there.\n\nBut hey, at least you've got your precious art studio now, filled with half-finished canvases and paint-splattered easels. That's gotta count for something, right?\n\nI mean, seriously, Jack, you're 69 years old, and what do you have to show for it? A bunch of mediocre paintings and a lifetime supply of regret.\n\nYou know what would really make this day complete? If you could just go out there and sell one of your pieces for a decent price. Yeah, that'd be the cherry on top of this shit sundae.\n\nSo, off you go, Jack, go chase your dreams, and maybe – just maybe – you'll finally find some sense of fulfillment. But let's be real, it's probably gonna be a total waste of time.\"\n\n---\n\nJack stood in front of his latest masterpiece, a sprawling canvas of abstract shapes and colors that he was convinced would change the game. He stepped back, eyes closed, and let out a deep sigh.\n\n\"Ah, yeah, this is it,\" he muttered to himself. \"This is the one that's gonna make me rich.\"\n\nHe quickly snapped a photo of the piece and sent it to his agent, along with a triumphant text message that read: 'Just finished my new masterpiece! Can't wait to see what the art world thinks.'\n\nAs he waited for responses, Jack's mind began to wander to his late wife, Margaret. They used to sit in their studio, critiquing each other's work and offering words of encouragement. He remembered the way she used to smile when she saw something beautiful, the way her eyes lit up with excitement.\n\nA pang of guilt hit him hard in the chest, and Jack felt his eyes well up with tears. What was he doing, chasing after fame and fortune while his wife was gone? Shouldn't he be spending more time honoring her memory?\n\nHe shook his head, trying to clear the thoughts. It was just guilt, he told himself. Guilt wasn't going to pay the bills or fill the studio with buyers.\n\nWith renewed determination, Jack picked up his phone and started scrolling through social media, searching for anyone who might be interested in buying his next piece. As he scrolled, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was betraying Margaret's memory in some way, and the guilt gnawed away at him like a rat in his stomach.<|eot_id|>",

They don't. And even if they did, why would they want some old dude's shitty paintings? They wouldn't buy this shit anyway. The art world is full of pretentious bitches who only care about money. Margaret always said I was talented, but I know the truth. I'm a fucking disaster. Who cares about some boring, half-decent paintings? Not the galleries, not the collectors—no one gives a damn. If I can't sell my stuff here, where am I supposed to go? Some godforsaken garage sale? Please. I need to make millions from these pieces before I die. Otherwise, I might as well pack up and move to a cheap apartment. At least there, no one will judge me. Damn, I wish Margaret were here to see this. She'd say I'm crazy, but she always supported me. Still, I wonder how many times she wished she'd left me behind. Maybe she was tired of my bullshit, tired of watching me fail. I remember the first time we met; she thought I was the most handsome guy she'd ever seen. Now, I'm just a middle-aged loser with nothing to offer except a bunch of mediocre paintings. Maybe I should just take my paints and shove them down the toilet."
