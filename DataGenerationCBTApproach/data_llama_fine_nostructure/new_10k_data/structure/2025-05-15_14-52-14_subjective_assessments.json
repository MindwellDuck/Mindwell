However, when I received feedback on my work, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something wrong with me. My boss said I was doing great, but I kept thinking that I wasn't good enough. When I got home, I told my husband about it. He listened patiently, and then he shared his own experience. He reminded me that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and that it's okay if I'm not perfect. But deep down, I still felt disappointed. This week was supposed to be my best yet, but after receiving negative feedback, I lost confidence. I started questioning everything I did, even though I knew I was trying my best. It's like I've forgotten why I wanted to become a writer in the first place - I just want to create something amazing. But now, I feel like I'll never achieve that dream.

She wondered if things might have turned out differently if only she'd been more supportive, more understanding.\n\nAs she sat there, lost in thought, the TV announcer mentioned the sister's favorite charity, one that was close to their own heart.

And why does she always assume I'm trying to push her away by taking on more responsibilities? Doesn't she see how hard it is to keep up with two jobs? Does she really think I'm just doing it to spite her? Or maybe she thinks I’m trying to prove something to myself, like I need to show her that I can do it all. Maybe she’s worried I’ll leave because of how stressed I am, and she feels helpless since she has no idea how to help either. That’s why she keeps saying things like “we’re too busy” even though she knows I’ve been working double shifts for months. She probably feels guilty for letting things get so bad, but she doesn’t want to admit that she made some mistakes too. I bet she wishes I wouldn’t feel so overwhelmed, but I don’t think she realizes how much it affects me.

When he started asking her questions, his gaze didn’t waver from hers, and he listened attentively, his brow furrowed in interest. But what struck me most was how quickly his thoughts shifted from professional topics to personal ones. It was as if he was trying to read between the lines of her responses, searching for clues about her life beyond the office. His eyes kept drifting away from our conversation, and he barely looked up during the discussion, lost in his own little world. Even though we were talking about the same topic, I felt like I was just a spectator to his inner monologue, watching him try to decipher her every word. It was clear that he was preoccupied with something else, and I wondered if his wife might have left earlier than planned.

His entire career depended on landing that exclusive piece, and he refused to accept anything less than perfection. For years, he'd been stuck in this mindset, where every opportunity felt like a high-stakes gamble. Every meeting turned into a tense showdown, every deadline became a countdown to disaster. His colleagues often joked that he lived by one rule: Either you win or you die. In reality, they probably just found his competitive spirit exhausting. But deep down, he knew there was no room for compromise. If he didn't produce the best work possible, he might as well pack his bags and move back home. He couldn't afford to fail now, not when his reputation rested on his shoulders. One slip-up could mean the end of his career - and maybe even his life.
