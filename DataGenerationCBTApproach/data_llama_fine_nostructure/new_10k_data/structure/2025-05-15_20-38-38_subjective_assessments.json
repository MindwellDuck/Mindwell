Had she replaced her? Was she just another stop on his journey to rediscover himself? It didn't take long for the resentment to boil over.

And when she saw the way he looked at his daughter-in-law, his eyes sparkling with amusement, she felt like she was losing herself in an ocean of pain.

And that's what made it unbearable. She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself she was being irrational, but deep down, she knew she wasn't.
