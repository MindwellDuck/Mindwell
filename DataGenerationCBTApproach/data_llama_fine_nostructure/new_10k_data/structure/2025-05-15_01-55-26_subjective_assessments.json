All that mattered was the pain that lingered within her, refusing to subside. It was as if every drop of sadness she’d ever experienced had accumulated, forming a reservoir of sorrow so deep it threatened to consume everything else in its path. No amount of time could possibly ease that burden. It would remain there, silently waiting for its chance to strike again, like a shadow cast across the wall. Her gaze drifted from the cards to the photograph on her kitchen counter. A snapshot of her wedding day lay before her, capturing a fleeting moment in time. But what did it really represent? Just another reminder of all she had lost. That smile, those eyes—those were just illusions, mere fantasies created to deceive her. They held no truth, no substance. Everything about that day was a lie, a cruel mockery designed to taunt her. The happiness she once knew was nothing more than a distant memory, fading fast.

It manifests in situations where people are faced with ambiguous stimuli, leading them to categorize events into binary outcomes rather than acknowledging nuances. This tendency can manifest in various aspects of life, including personal relationships, professional dynamics, or even mundane interactions. In our hypothetical case, let’s say John is deeply invested in getting his work published, but he’s also drawn to Sarah, a colleague who has recently moved to the city. When Sarah starts talking to someone else, like Alex, John might experience a range of emotions—some positive, some negative. Instead of feeling neutral or curious, he tends to see things in stark black-and-white terms. Let’s break down how this plays out: * **Ambiguity**: The situation presents ambiguity. There’s no clear-cut outcome for John. * **Cognitive Distortion**: His mind begins to simplify the situation, reducing it to extremes (\"Sarah is either interested in me or she’s not\"). * **Emotional Response**: Instead of experiencing a mix of emotions, John feels a strong urge to act. If he doesn’t feel the need to do something, then maybe he needs to get closer to Sarah. But if he does feel the urge, then there must be something wrong with him, and he shouldn’t have these feelings. * **Behavioral Outcome**: As a result, John acts impulsively. He might interrupt conversations, make bold"
