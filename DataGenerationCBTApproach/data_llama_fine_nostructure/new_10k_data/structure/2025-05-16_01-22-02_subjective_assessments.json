He turned, expecting a nod or a comment about the dish, but instead she simply shook her head and said, 'I'm taking the kids to my sister's for dinner.'\n\nHe felt a flicker of disappointment, but pushed it down, focusing on the task at hand.

I can see the way she looks at me - like she knows what I'm thinking, like she has a window into my mind. It's like she can read my thoughts, but only when it suits her. When I try to talk to her, she just gives this weird look, like she's trying to figure out what I'm saying so she can respond appropriately. Like she's trying to solve some kind of puzzle where I'm the missing piece. But she never actually asks me what I want or needs; she just assumes she knows best. And if I say anything that might contradict that assumption, she gets defensive and tells me I'm being silly or overreacting. It's like she's playing this game of \"mind reading\" where she gets to decide how I feel and what I think, and she always wins. It's frustrating because sometimes I'll say something just to see if she'll pick up on it, but she rarely responds like I expected. If I ask her a question, she'll answer based on her own interpretation of what I meant, which is often completely off. And when we're together, she'll make these little comments that are really just veiled insults. I know she doesn't mean them, but they still hurt because they make me feel like she's somehow inside my head, knowing exactly what I’m thinking.

As he reached for the stack of papers, his hand brushed against the edge of the desk, sending it scraping loudly across the floor. The sudden noise startled him, and he jerked back, nearly knocking over a chair.\n\nA student nearby gasped, and others turned to look at him. For a moment, he froze, his heart racing, as he wondered if everyone was staring at him. A student quietly asked if everything was okay, but before he could respond, another student spoke up, asking about the assignment. The room erupted into chatter, and he felt himself becoming lost in the noise.\n\nHis eyes darted frantically around the room, searching for a quiet corner where he could collect himself. But there was none – they were all facing him, waiting for him to start again.

And when a student suggested he take a break, he just stared blankly into space, refusing to acknowledge what was happening. It was like he was trying to avoid reality, pretending he wasn’t causing any problems. When someone else tried to help, he dismissed them with a hasty “no,” making it seem like he didn’t need assistance anyway. It was pathetic how he stumbled backward, almost falling into the chair, and then stood there, frozen, as if waiting for someone else to fix it. The whole class must have thought he was some kind of idiot, which was exactly what he wanted people to think. By acting so dumb and struggling to keep his balance, he proved that he was indeed incapable of handling responsibility. Why bother helping him now? There’s no point in fixing something that wouldn’t last anyway. That student who asked if everything was alright probably knew better than anyone how much he needed to calm down, but she just kept going on and on, disrupting the entire class.

He thought about all the years of service, the cases solved, the lives saved – it wasn't enough anymore. The paperwork had piled up, and he'd been stuck in a dead-end desk job for months. \n\nHis mind wandered back to his partner, who'd retired five years ago. They'd worked together for over two decades, and now she was gone, leaving him feeling lost and without purpose. His phone buzzed with another unwanted email from the department, reminding him of his upcoming performance review.\n\nAs he gazed blankly into space, the calendar on the wall caught his eye. His birthday was coming up, and he couldn't remember the last time he celebrated it. He didn't have anyone to mark the occasion with, no family to call his own.

I've always pushed myself harder than he ever could, and look where that got me? Nowhere. At least I don't feel useless like this. I bet he's just waiting for retirement too, like everyone else. He can't handle the pressure anymore, probably because he's weak. Weak people get bored easily, and he must be one of them. Maybe he needs a kick in the pants, some real-world experience, you know? That's what I did when I started working in the field. It turned me around, and it'll turn him right back into shape too. If he really cared about helping people, he wouldn't let himself fall behind. What is he doing now, anyway? Just sitting at home, watching TV all day, instead of being out there making a difference. That's exactly how it goes down - once you're too old, you become nothing more than a burden. And that's exactly what he'll become if he keeps slacking off. It's not his fault, though.

I've been working day and night for months, pouring my heart into this art. Every late night, every stressful moment, every doubt that creeps in when I stare at the canvas blank.
