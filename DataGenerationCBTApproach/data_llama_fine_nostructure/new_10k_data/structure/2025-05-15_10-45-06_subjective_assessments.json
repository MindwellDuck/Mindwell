But instead, it was his wife, her voice laced with concern.\n\n\"Hey, I need to talk to you about something,\" she said, her words hesitant.\n\nHe listened, his mind already racing ahead to worst-case scenarios. They'd been married for five years, but lately, everything felt like a struggle. The long hours at work, the lack of personal time, the constant stress...it was all taking its toll.\n\nAs he listened to his wife's words, his grip on the receiver tightened, his knuckles whitening with anxiety.

Of course she didn't. She's 3 years old. She doesn't know how to break things. But then he starts getting really upset and tells me I'm not doing anything right as a mother, and I feel so frustrated. Why can't he just calm down?! Like, what's wrong with me? Is there something wrong with me? Am I a bad mom?! And then he gets angry at me again for not calling an ambulance, saying I'm a terrible wife who doesn't care about our kid. That's when I lose my temper too, and we end up fighting. It's so stupid. We're fine, nothing happened. It feels like every little thing becomes a huge problem, and we always seem to fight about it. I hate how stressed he gets over these tiny things. Can't he just chill? This is ridiculous. My husband is acting like he has nothing else going on in his life except for this incident. He's so dramatic, always making such a big deal out of small stuff. It's exhausting.

A pang of sadness washed over him, a fleeting sense of loss for the life he used to lead, the relationships he'd once nurtured. Now, his days were filled with solo lunches and solitary evenings, the only companionship coming from the glow of his screen. He let out a slow breath, the tension in his shoulders easing ever so slightly as he refocused on the task at hand. But the feeling of helplessness lingered, a nagging sense that he was losing control of his own life.<|eot_id|>",

My friends call and message me, but I'm too tired to reply right away, which means I'm already falling behind on our conversations. Sometimes I wonder if it's even worth keeping up. Every time I try to put down my laptop, I feel anxious about what I might miss. Even though I know I need to take breaks, I find myself scrolling through social media instead, comparing my life to others who seem to have it all together.
