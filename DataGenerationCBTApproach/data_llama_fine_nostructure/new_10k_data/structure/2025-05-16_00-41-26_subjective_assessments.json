But no, today I totally lost it.\n\nSo, we had this patient come in, and she was having some major issues with her meds. I mean, we'd already adjusted them like three times before, but she just couldn't seem to shake off this awful rash. And I swear, every time I looked at those poor skin cells under the microscope, my mind started racing.\n\nI kept thinking about Sarah - my partner, my rock. We've been together for over a decade, and I thought we were solid. But then I saw him today, talking to her, laughing with her... and I felt this pang of jealousy. Like, why was he there? What did they talk about?\n\nAnd it wasn't even a big thing! Just small talk, catching up. But somehow it felt so much bigger than that. It felt like he was replacing me or something. And I hate that feeling. I hate knowing I'm not the center of his universe anymore.\n\nAfter the patient left, I just snapped. I slammed my hand down on the counter, making everyone jump. They all looked at me like I'd lost it, which, honestly, I probably did. I stormed out of the room, leaving my team looking after the patient. I don't even remember how long I stood there, staring blankly into space, trying to process everything.\n\nIt's just... sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself in all of this. Like I'm just a cog in the machine, churning out diagnoses and prescriptions without any real connection to the people I'm helping. And when I see other doctors, working together seamlessly, I wonder if that's where I went wrong.\n\nSarah's always telling me to take care of myself, to prioritize my own well-being. But it's hard when you're stuck in this rut. When you feel like you're failing everyone around you. Especially when you start to doubt your own abilities.\n\nI guess what really gets me is that I'm not even sure what I want to do about it. Part of me wants to throw in the towel, walk away from it all. But another part of me feels like I owe it to Sarah, to our relationship, to keep going. To prove to myself that I can make a difference.\n\nWhatever it is, I know I need to figure it out soon. Before things get any worse.<|eot_id|>",

Newsflash, buddy: you're not welcome here.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but it was no use. My mind was racing with all the ways I could hurt him. Make him beg for mercy. Make him wish he never crossed me.\n\nShe opened the door, and I slipped inside, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of him. He was sitting on the couch, looking smug as always, like he owned the place. I spotted him and my blood started boiling.\n\n\"You think you can just walk away from this?\" I spat at her, my voice low and menacing. \"You think you can just leave me like I'm nothing?\"\n\nHer eyes darted between us, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of fear. But then she stepped forward, placing a hand on his arm.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey,\" she said, her voice weak. \"I didn't mean to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Hurt me?\" I laughed, the sound cold and mirthless. \"You have no idea what hurt feels like. You've been playing me like a fool for years, and now you get to just waltz back in here and act like everything's fine?\"\n\nHe looked up at me, a mixture of fear and defiance in his eyes. And in that moment, I knew I had him right where I wanted him.\n\n\"Get out,\" I growled, my voice barely above a whisper. \"Both of you. Get out before I lose my temper completely.\"<|eot_id|>",

Is that correct? And when you got there, you were angry with them both, but especially with the boyfriend? Right? So, what exactly did you want to happen during your visit? Did you want them to just talk things through together, or did you plan something else?"
