A successful startup had posted an opening for a lead software engineer, one that matched his skill set and salary expectations. The company was known for its fast-paced and dynamic environment, which appealed to him.\n\nAs he read through the job description, his mind wandered to how it would look if his current employer found out about this opportunity. He imagined the conversations he'd have with his manager, trying to explain why he was leaving. The thought of disappointing his colleagues and feeling unappreciated made him feel uneasy.\n\nHe quickly closed his browser and took a deep breath, telling himself it was just a coincidence.

He said that he couldn't stand the smell of the nearby industrial plant, and how much he hated seeing families struggling to make ends meet. He claimed that if we lived anywhere else, we could have been happy together. But now, when I think back to those days, I feel more anger than sadness. It seems ridiculous that he would say such things, especially since we were living in the home we built together, surrounded by friends and family. Our neighbors knew us well enough to invite themselves over for dinner whenever they wanted. They even helped us move into our new house after my parents passed away. Maybe I’m just too emotional about everything right now. My husband passed away six months ago, leaving me alone with two young children. I'm still trying to adjust to this new reality, but sometimes I wish I could go back in time and change some things. Like, why did we choose to stay here? Why didn’t we leave sooner? It feels like I’ll never forgive him for staying so long. I keep thinking about what could’ve been if we’d moved somewhere else. Maybe we would have found happiness then. But life has a way of turning out differently, doesn’t it? I guess I just need to accept that things happen the way they do. We can’t control everything, after all.

He's been painting this same piece for weeks, and it still looks unfinished. He's probably just jealous because she moved on with her life while he stayed stuck in the past. I swear, every time we hang out, he gets all broody, talking about how he misses her and how she doesn't care anymore. It makes me roll my eyes – she barely even remembers him! And yet, he keeps bringing it up, making a big deal out of nothing. Honestly, it would be better if he just painted something else instead of dwelling on what could've been. I don't know why he can't let go already. Maybe I'm just tired of hearing him whine about how he's “still in love” with her. Come on, dude, you're 40 years old! Get over it.

It makes sense that he hasn’t written much since she died. After all, life is hard enough without losing the love of your life. What would happen if he stopped sending letters altogether? Maybe he’s just afraid of how he’ll feel after a while. Like when you stop wearing something comfortable because you think it looks silly, but really, it reminds you of happy moments. This chair reminds me of her too. If he deletes all his emails, he'll lose that connection too. And what about the other people who care about him? They might wonder why he's not responding, making them worry. So maybe keeping things around keeps him connected to her in some way. Still, it feels overwhelming.
