His wife had been encouraging him to take up photography as a hobby, but he'd never found the time. Today, as he rummaged through his art supplies, he stumbled upon an old sketchbook filled with his childhood drawings – vibrant, detailed, and full of life.\n\nA pang of guilt washed over him as he flipped through the pages, remembering all the times his parents had praised his creativity and encouraged him to pursue it. He hadn't drawn in years, and now his own family seemed to be moving forward without him. The thought sent a familiar knot twisting in his stomach. As he closed the sketchbook, his eyes drifted to the partially painted landscape on the wall, incomplete and still waiting for his touch.<|eot_id|>",

And honestly, it's really annoying because every time we try to talk about something positive, he ends up bringing up some \"what if\" scenario. Like, what if he doesn't get the shot he wants? What if he messes up the editing? Or even just what if he decides not to take photos anymore? It feels like no matter how many times I reassure him that it’s okay to make mistakes and that things will work out, he keeps going back to these worst-case scenarios. It makes me feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, always worried that he'll spiral into one of those thoughts again. Even when we're having fun together, exploring new places and taking pictures, he starts thinking about all the things that could go wrong. It's exhausting. Sometimes I wonder how he manages to handle it all. Does he ever worry about what if he quits photography altogether?"

It started with tiny things: a missed deadline here, a miscommunication there. But soon, those little blunders grew into full-blown disasters that left her breathless and frustrated. No matter how hard she tried, nothing seemed to go right anymore. Every time someone else succeeded, it just made her feel like a failure. And when others failed, it only fueled her anger. She couldn’t help but wonder if everyone else was just playing a game of luck while she was stuck with the bad cards. The world seemed to be stacked against her, and every day felt like a constant battle. The people who succeeded didn't understand what she went through. They thought it was easy, that anyone could achieve their goals with enough drive. But for her, every step forward felt like a struggle. Even small accomplishments weighed heavily on her shoulders, making her feel like she wasn't good enough. She began to doubt herself, wondering if she was cut out for anything more than minimum wage jobs. Every job interview ended in disappointment, each rejection letter reinforcing her feelings of inadequacy. It was as if the universe was conspiring against her, forcing her to face harsh realities one by one.

But did that mean we shouldn’t have gone back home? Shouldn’t we have saved up more before making such a big decision? Nowhere in life is this ever supposed to happen. I’ve always told myself, \"You can't plan your happiness. If you try, you'll never be satisfied.\" But here I am, trying to figure out if we should've planned better.
