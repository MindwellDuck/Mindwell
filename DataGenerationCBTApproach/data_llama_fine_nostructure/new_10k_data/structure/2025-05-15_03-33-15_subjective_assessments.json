He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he headed out the door, his hand instinctively resting on the grip of his gun.\n\nThe rain-soaked streets seemed to stretch on forever as he drove to the scene, his thoughts racing with worst-case scenarios. What if this was another copycat? What if someone was trying to provoke him? The more he thought about it, the tighter his jaw got, and the harder his heart pounded. By the time he arrived at the convenience store, his breath came out in short gasps, and his hands were slick with sweat.<|eot_id|>",

A routine call, a chance to prove himself, but beneath the surface, I could feel the weight of my past bearing down. The memories of that fateful day still lingered, haunting me like a ghost. I had been a cop for ten years, but nothing could have prepared me for what was about to unfold. As I stepped into the convenience store, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was walking into a trap—a trap set by the very demons I thought I’d left behind. My mind was a whirlwind of questions: Could this be another copycat? Was I being set up? The doubts swirled around me like a tornado, fueled by every worst-case scenario I’d ever imagined. With each passing moment, my grip on reality tightened, and I felt myself slipping further into the abyss. It wasn't just the suspect; it was the entire situation that threatened to consume me whole. The officer who had called the report had warned us about possible copycats, but instead of calming me down, those words only added fuel to the fire. I began to wonder if this was all some twisted game, designed to push me to my limits. Every step forward felt like a betrayal, as if I was willingly diving deeper into the depths of my own paranoia. I tried to tell myself it was just nerves, but deep down, I knew better. This wasn't just about responding"

The doctor's mind started racing with questions: What did they talk about? Did Karen know something about her? Was this some kind of test?\n\nThe doctor took a sip of her lukewarm tea, trying to calm herself down, but Karen caught her eye and raised an eyebrow, as if daring her to ask more questions.

Now I’ve wasted even more time waiting in line for my lunch, and I still don’t know what she wants. Is she trying to make me feel bad? Like, why would she act like this towards me specifically?

You can tell they’re just waiting for something to happen so they can jump on it and turn it against someone else. And now, this is happening again. My daughter's getting fucked over by these two, and I can't stand it. But you know who's at fault? Not them, of course. It’s everyone else. Everyone’s always blaming them for everything. Like, I don’t even want to hear it anymore. It’s such a waste of time. Why would anyone give them attention when they’re just causing problems? It’s crazy how easily people fall for it.
