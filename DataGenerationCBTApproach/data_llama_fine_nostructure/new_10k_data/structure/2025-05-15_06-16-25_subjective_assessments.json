Maybe it was work? Or maybe I had said something that upset her? A waitress came over to refill our coffee cups, and when she asked if my day was going well, I just smiled awkwardly. I couldn't shake the feeling that she saw right through me, that she knew exactly what I was thinking. Margaret barely acknowledged the waitress, just muttered a quick \"thank you.\" Then she went back to reading her paper, her expression growing more intense by the minute.

As she gazed out the window, the cityscape blurred around her, a stark contrast to the emptiness inside. The world outside seemed to move forward with ease, while she felt stuck, unable to escape the cycle of disappointment. Every day felt like Groundhog Day, with the same pattern repeating itself.
