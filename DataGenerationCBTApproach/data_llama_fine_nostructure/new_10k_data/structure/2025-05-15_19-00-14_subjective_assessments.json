The scent of blooming flowers transported her back to their wedding day, when they'd exchanged vows beneath the same trellis. As she worked, memories flooded her mind – his smile, his laughter, the way he used to help her with her research. She recalled the argument they'd had months prior to his passing, about funding for her project. He'd wanted to support it, but the university had cut back on grants.\n\nHer hands faltered, and the pruners slipped from her grasp. She felt a pang in her chest as she stared at the scattered leaves and snapped stems. A nearby bird chirped, its song a harsh contrast to the silence that now filled her garden. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feelings that threatened to overwhelm her. But the weight of regret lingered, tied to the memory of their failed marriage and the promise she'd made to him – to continue his work, no matter what.<|eot_id|>",

Why couldn't I be doing something more valuable and well-paying like her? As I sat at my desk, staring blankly at my computer screen, all I could think about was how my friend was living the life I could only dream of. My boss kept praising her work, saying how it set new standards for excellence. Meanwhile, I struggled to meet basic expectations, my mistakes piling up like a mountain of shame. Every time we spoke, she'd brag about her latest achievement, claiming it was the result of her own hard work and natural ability. Did she really believe it was that simple? Wasn't it true that some people are born with talents that make them stand out? How could I possibly compete against someone gifted like her?

The morning sunlight streaming through the studio window highlighted the scattered remnants of past projects – sketches, broken brushes, and discarded ideas. His mind wandered back to his first exhibition, twenty years ago, when his art had resonated with strangers. Now, galleries passed him by, and local collectors barely noticed his name.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted up as he absent-mindedly dipped his brush into a nearly empty jar. His gaze drifted toward a framed photograph on his workbench – a snapshot from that long-forgotten show. A young couple, smiling and holding hands beside one of his pieces, flashed before his eyes.

All those people who once appreciated him are just forgotten memories. And yet, he still holds onto those old photographs, pretending they're proof of what could've been. He can't let go of the past; it's too much to handle. Every reminder makes me wonder how someone so talented ended up like this. I'm starting to feel sorry for him, but then again, maybe he's just better off. Maybe if he focused more on making money than creating something meaningful, he'd be happier now. No, that's impossible. He's either a visionary or a waste of space. There's no middle ground. He must have made some mistake along the way. This isn't fair—everyone deserves to leave a lasting legacy, right? But he did nothing to deserve such a fate. Something inside him just gives up. He's either a dreamer or a fool. It's pointless to try to change him now. He'll never find happiness. I guess I'll just accept that life is unfair sometimes."
