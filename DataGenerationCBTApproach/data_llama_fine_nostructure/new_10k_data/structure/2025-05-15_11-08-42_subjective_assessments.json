She was trying to escape the past, just like he was trying to escape his present. It was a strange connection to make, but somehow, they understood each other without saying a word. The woman’s eyes locked onto his, and for a brief moment, they were two broken souls who found solace in each other’s gaze. Then, she disappeared into the crowd, leaving him to wonder if it was all just a product of his imagination. But deep down, he knew what happened. It was real.
