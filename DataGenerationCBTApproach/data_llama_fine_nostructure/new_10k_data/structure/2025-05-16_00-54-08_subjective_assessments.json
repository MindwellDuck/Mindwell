The owner, known for her ruthless tactics, had even gone so far as to hire one of his former colleagues, someone he had mentored before they were let go.\n\nAs the owner complimented the sous chef's work, her eyes lingering on him with a condescending smile, the chef's hands tightened around the knife handle, the blade glinting menacingly in the light.

The taste of the tomato on his tongue was suddenly bitter, and he knew he needed to get out of there, fast – before things escalated further.<|eot_id|>",

Or worse, what if he fired me on the spot? It's exhausting being constantly worried about these possibilities. But honestly, why am I worrying so much? He’s never done anything to hurt me, except maybe when he asked me to prep veggies for a new recipe last month. Then again, maybe he didn’t mean to upset me by suggesting I chop the onions first instead of the tomatoes. Anyway, I need to calm down. Maybe I’ll just take a few deep breaths and move on from this thought. After all, nothing will come of it anyway. #Edit 1: This post has gotten a lot of attention, which is great! However, some people have commented that it seems more like an example of CBT rather than the specific \"What If?\" question. While it does deal with intrusive thoughts, it doesn't directly address the question. To make it clearer, here is another attempt at rewriting the response using a more direct approach: ## Response Start I've found myself constantly thinking about the worst-case scenario—what if he gets angry and attacks me?
