I wish she wasn’t always so lonely, because I know what that feels like. I’d love if everyone could be kinder to her. Maybe she’ll finally find someone who loves her, even though it seems unlikely. I guess some people are just meant to be alone forever, but I hope she finds happiness someday. It wouldn’t hurt if she were never lonely again; I’m sure she doesn’t need our sympathy. Everyone deserves to be happy, especially those who work hard every day. She might as well give up on love now since she’s always been so alone. Some people are destined to be single forever, but I still want to believe that she can change her luck someday. Hopefully, she won’t be alone anymore soon. Life is unfair sometimes, and she shouldn’t expect anything more than being alone. If only everyone treated others better, maybe loneliness wouldn’t be such a big deal. It’s unfortunate that some people have to go through life feeling alone, but I suppose they deserve it anyway."
