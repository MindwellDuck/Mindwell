The colors that had once danced across the palette now seemed dull and lifeless, like the memories of her laughter he couldn't shake.\n\nThe door creaked open behind him, and his granddaughter walked into the room, chatting about her school play. He forced a weak smile, trying to hide the pain that twisted his chest. She noticed the look and asked if everything was okay.\n\n\"It's just...I'm still getting used to this new silence,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nShe looked puzzled, not understanding the depth of his grief. \"Grandpa, you've been painting again lately. That means you're happy, right?\"\n\nHis eyes welled up with tears as he felt a surge of hatred towards the world that took her away from him. Why did it have to be so hard to let go? Why did they all get to move on while he was still stuck in this hell?\n\nThe color on his palette suddenly swirled, and he knew exactly what shade he wanted – a deep, foreboding crimson. With newfound determination, he began to paint, letting the strokes of his brush convey the turmoil brewing inside him.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe he's too busy? But then I thought about how he's always super busy, so maybe he doesn't even care about me anymore. After he left, I saw the way he smiled when he talked to his friends. They laughed together, sharing jokes and stories, while he was just sitting there quietly. I wondered why he'd rather talk to them than spend time with me. Did he forget we were family? It feels like he's moving on with his life, and I’m just still here, feeling sad. But why is he doing that? Is it because he’s forgotten about me? Or does he just not want to think about us anymore? I don’t understand why he can’t seem to connect with me like he used to. # EDIT - Thank you for the gold! I'll try to respond better to these kinds of questions. # EDIT2 - I'm glad this resonated with so many people!

Just got a big meeting tomorrow and I needed a little pick-me-up.'\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, her anger simmering just below the surface. She knew he'd been stressed lately, but this was ridiculous – they were supposed to be cooking together tonight, as a team, not him alone dominating the kitchen.

They had discussed it earlier, and he had promised to keep the house smoke-free until then. Now, here he was, sitting in the very place where she had spent hours preparing their meal, surrounded by the aromas of freshly baked bread and roasting vegetables. It wasn't just the smell that bothered her; it was the fact that he seemed completely oblivious to her efforts. He hadn't even offered to help with dinner, let alone acknowledged how hard she worked to make everything perfect. To make matters worse, as she watched him take another drag from his cigarette, she couldn't help but think about all the times he'd broken his promises and left her to deal with the consequences. Every time he came home smelling like smoke, she felt like she was fighting a losing battle against his carelessness.

She was running late for her shift change, already behind schedule due to the morning's staffing crisis.\n\nAt the first station, she found a patient's chart in disarray, pages scattered across the counter as the morning nurse had apparently abandoned it in haste. The patient, a frail elderly woman, lay motionless in bed, her oxygen levels hovering precariously close to alarm.\n\nThe new nurse, a bright-eyed young thing with a pierced nose, barely acknowledged her presence before launching into a listless explanation of the patient's medication regimen, barely pausing to glance up from her phone. \n\nThe nurse's eyes narrowed as she watched the young nurse fumble with the IV pole, nearly dropping the fragile tubing. A familiar surge of frustration welled up inside her – this was exactly why she'd taken a job in healthcare, to make a difference, not to babysit and redo everyone else's work.<|eot_id|>",

It was one or the other - there was no middle ground. The way she carelessly tossed aside the patient's chart, leaving vital information scattered everywhere, was a clear sign of laziness or outright incompetence. The fact that she was glued to her phone, barely paying attention to the task at hand, was just more evidence of her lack of dedication to her job. In contrast, when I took my own job in healthcare, I knew every detail of each patient's treatment plan by heart. My colleagues respected me for being diligent and thorough, and I never felt the need to check my notes twice because I trusted myself to remember everything perfectly. This new nurse was either a total failure or someone who didn't respect the importance of their role. There was no room for ambiguity; she was either a disaster waiting to happen or a careless slacker. As she continued to watch the young nurse struggle, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was fundamentally wrong. Either this person was going to cause harm to vulnerable patients or they were just another selfish individual who didn't deserve to be in such a critical field. The nurse's very existence seemed to embody these opposing extremes, making it impossible to see her as anything in between."

But every time she opened her laptop, the feeling lingered, making her question whether she’d ever truly earned her spot among these accomplished writers. Maybe she was just a pretender, pretending to belong when deep down, she knew she never would. She scrolled through the comments, reading how others were inspired by the same book. They praised its honesty, its ability to make them see themselves in a new light. Meanwhile, she struggled to write anything worthwhile, always wondering if what she shared was truly valuable or just another iteration of something already said better elsewhere. The contrast was jarring, leaving her feeling like she was living in a world where everything else seemed to click into place except her own life.
