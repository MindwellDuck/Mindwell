It wasn't just the way she moved with confidence; it was how she looked at him - as if she knew something about him that no one else did. She seemed to be trying to read his mind, to understand why he couldn't quite put his finger on what bothered him. It wasn't just the words she spoke, either. Her tone was so gentle, yet it carried an undercurrent of curiosity that made him feel like she could see right through him. Like she knew that beneath the surface, there was a world of emotions and thoughts swirling inside him, and she was determined to unravel them. And then there was the way she nodded at him when she passed by. It was almost... inviting? As if she was saying, \"I know you're struggling to connect with me, but I'm here for you.\" Or maybe it was just his imagination playing tricks on him. Maybe she didn't mean anything by it. But somehow, in that moment, it felt like she understood him better than anyone else. What really got to him, though, was when she started asking questions about his patient. Not just random questions, but ones that seemed genuinely interested in understanding the situation. And when he hesitated to answer, she wouldn't let it drop. She kept pushing, probing for details, as if she wanted to uncover some hidden truth. It was both fascinating and unnerving."

Perhaps she felt overwhelmed by the memories associated with that moment, which could explain her distraction. However, I couldn't help but notice how intensely she clung to these mementos. It almost seemed like she was trying to hold onto the past, rather than embracing the present. This might be due to the fact that she wasn't yet ready to let go of what was left behind – an emotional barrier that's typical in such situations. Still, I wondered why she didn't seem to have moved forward. Had she found ways to cope with her grief? Was there anything else bothering her, or was she simply stuck in the past?
