Why are you making such a big deal out of this? Stop overthinking everything. You need to learn to let go and move on. Just stop being so sensitive. Maybe you should take some time off to think about things instead of rushing headfirst into situations. That would help clear your mind. You're just too attached to those memories, which isn't healthy. If you could just put them behind you, maybe things would settle down.

What if he'd tried harder to make it work?\n\nThe journalist in him kicked in, and he began mentally compiling the possible scenarios, weighing the pros and cons of every decision they'd made during their marriage. His eyes drifted down to the small notebook clutched in his hand, filled with articles he'd written about failed relationships and broken families.\n\nA faint smile twisted his lips as he recalled one particularly scathing review he'd penned for a local restaurant, which had ended up being a minor blunder. But in this moment, he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than just facts and figures - that maybe, just maybe, he'd been too quick to judge others when he didn't know what it meant to truly love someone.\n\nThe realization left him feeling unsettled, and he turned to leave, the sound of his own footsteps echoing through the empty hallway.<|eot_id|>",
