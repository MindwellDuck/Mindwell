His thoughts drifted back to their divorce, the way it had fallen apart due to his own mistakes, and the countless times he'd promised to do better.\n\nAs he stood there, lost in thought, his eyes landed on a framed photo on the counter – a picture of him, his ex-wife, and their daughter, taken on a family vacation years ago.

But if anything went wrong—like if his boss didn’t approve the transfer or if he messed up during the interview—it would all be over. They would never speak to each other again, and he’d be left alone once more. He wondered how many people were in similar situations, stuck between hope and desperation. It seemed like everyone around him had it easier, having found someone who loved them unconditionally. Why did things always have to be so complicated? Wasn't love supposed to make life easy? In the end, he just decided to go with the flow, hoping for the best even though he knew it wouldn’t last. He told himself that whatever happened, he’d deal with it head-on, no matter what. But deep down, he knew that he wasn’t ready to face the reality of being single again.&#x200B; This post is based on a sample essay question from the book \"Cognitive Distortions\" by David Burns.

He felt like he was stuck in some never-ending cycle of pain and regret.\n\nJust then, a customer approached the counter, asking about a specific brand of clothing.

It wasn't like anything really happened - just a reminder that life moves forward no matter what. But somehow it still felt like a punch to the gut. And now, here he was, sitting in silence, trying to distract himself with TV shows, but they all seemed dull and uninteresting. It was as if everything around him was fading into the background, except for the memory of her saying she's moved on, which kept echoing in his mind like a mantra. It didn't help that the apartment was quiet too - I mean, you can hear every little thing when you live in an old building like ours. Like the creaks and groans of the floorboards underfoot, or the sound of the pipes above us. It's like my own thoughts are making me feel isolated.
