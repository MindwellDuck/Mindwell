Inside, she saw a series of sketches from their time together – portraits of them as a couple, their children, and even some landscapes they had explored together. The memories came flooding back, and for a moment, she felt like she was stepping into their past.\n\nThe fear crept up her spine as she realized she'd been avoiding cleaning out the studio, fearing what she might find.

His own father had struggled with medical expenses when he was younger, and the weight of uncertainty still lingered. Without thinking, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small envelope containing some cash, which he handed to the man.\n\n\"Just take care of yourself, okay?\" he said softly. \"We'll figure something out.\"\n\nAs the man walked away, looking slightly more relieved, our retail worker felt a wave of stress wash over him.
