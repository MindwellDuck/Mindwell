I'm going to pay with my credit card, but I'm still getting change.\" She slammed her card down on the counter, making the cashier jump.\n\nThe store's music system started playing, and the woman's anger seemed to spike. She began yelling at the cashier, claiming he was being intentionally rude. The other customers started to stare, and the cashier's expression changed from boredom to annoyance.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She answered it, listened for a moment, and then slammed it down, her face red with rage. \"I don't want your stupid coupon offer,\" she spat at the cashier. \"I just want my money back.\"\n\nThe cashier rolled his eyes and handed her the change.

That’s not all—she had her hand on Alex’s arm, and when he got up to get a drink, she touched his arm too. What the fuck is going on? I tried to act cool and walk away, but I could hear their conversation. They were talking about a project they worked on together, and Alex was helping her understand things she didn’t quite get. At first, I thought maybe she was just looking for advice, but then I heard Alex suggest something that made her laugh so hard she snorted her coffee out her nose. I was so annoyed. Why does he have to make everything seem so easy for her? And why does he even care? Is he just doing it because he wants to mess with me? It feels like he’s playing games with her, making her laugh just to get under my skin. I hate how comfortable he looks with her. When Alex suggested something, Emily nodded enthusiastically,"

She remembered the countless afternoons spent helping her child with homework, listening to her concerns, and celebrating her small victories. The silence in this room was deafening, a stark reminder of what she no longer had – the family, the routine, and the sense of belonging.\n\nHer eyes landed on a faded photograph on her desk, a picture of herself and her ex-husband, taken during their wedding day. A lump formed in her throat as she recalled the promises they'd made to each other, the dreams they'd shared, and the love that had slowly dwindled over time.\n\nThe bell above the classroom door jingled, signaling the arrival of students for their first period class.
