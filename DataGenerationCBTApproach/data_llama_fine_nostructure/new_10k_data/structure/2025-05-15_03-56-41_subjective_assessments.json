The patient's chart caught his eye - another young adult, barely out of their teenage years, with a diagnosis that would change their life forever.\n\nThe doctor's eyes lingered on the name, \"Alex,\" and the note from Alex's mother, begging him to do everything in his power to save her son. A faint memory of his own childhood, of promises made by parents who couldn't keep them, stirred within him.\n\nAs he began the rounds, he noticed the way the nurse looked at him, with a mixture of pity and respect. He felt a surge of resentment towards her too, for being so far removed from the pain he knew all too well.\n\nAt the next station, a resident asked for his input on the treatment plan, and he found himself nitpicking every detail, as if trying to prove a point to someone who didn't understand what it meant to truly lose someone. The resident's questions were met with curt responses, and the air grew thick with tension.\n\nA low hum of frustration built inside him, until he finally slammed his pen down on the counter, making everyone turn. \"Just do what I say,\" he growled, before turning back to the charts, his eyes scanning the pages with newfound intensity.<|eot_id|>",

They said they just wanted to make sure he was doing okay, but really, they must have thought he'd be the one struggling. After all, he was the one who always fell ill during school. It wasn't fair; my brother was always getting sick too. Why did people think I was special? When I went to visit my friend Alex, he told me about how his mom kept saying she wanted him to go to college, get a good job, and start a family. But he couldn’t help thinking that my parents were the ones who deserved that. My dad worked hard to provide for us, while hers seemed to be more focused on herself. Maybe that’s why she hadn’t stopped working after my brother got sick. She was probably worried about losing money rather than worrying about her child’s health. I mean, my brother’s illness was no joke, but he still managed to finish high school. What would Alex even study? How could he hope to succeed? During my rounds, I noticed the nurses treating patients with kindness, which made me feel inadequate. When I saw a resident asking for my opinion, I responded curtly, hoping to show that I was capable of making tough decisions.

Without hesitation, Rachel swooped in, effortlessly taking control and directing the nurse to complete the task. The nurse felt a pang of frustration as she realized she'd been tasked with similar duties hours ago, only to be overlooked by the team leader.\n\nJust then, the hospital administrator walked by, nodding in approval at Rachel's leadership skills. \"Great job, Rachel,\" he said, patting her on the back. \"You're really making a difference around here.\" The nurse's eyes narrowed slightly as she listened, feeling a twinge of resentment towards Rachel's sudden favoritism.<|eot_id|>",

And now look where we are – standing in front of an open door, watching the body being wheeled out, knowing that our actions led to this moment. Why did he have to go and get involved in something he clearly had no idea about? What made him think he could handle the pressure? He always said he wanted to make a difference, but honestly, he was such a selfish asshole. We worked together for five years, and every single day, he fucked everything up.

They were creating beautiful pieces, while she struggled to make even a single stroke look decent. That realization made her feel even worse. She should be able to keep up, shouldn’t she?
