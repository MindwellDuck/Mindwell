But what if something happened to him? What if he got stuck in traffic or forgot his lunch? The thought sent a shiver down her spine.

What if they decided to cut ties because of her past mistakes? What if they never forgave her for what she did? And then there was the job offer she had been waiting for—something that would finally give her the security she needed. But what if it fell through? What if the company decided they couldn't trust her after all? What if they went back on their word? It was starting to feel like everything was falling apart. She looked around her apartment, which used to be full of life and laughter, now seemed empty and cold. She wondered if maybe she was better off without them all. Maybe she should just leave it all behind and start over somewhere new. After all, what was the point of holding on when everything could fall apart again? She tried to push these thoughts away, but they kept coming back. Every day seemed to bring a new wave of uncertainty. She felt like she was drowning in a sea of what-ifs, unable to escape. And no matter how hard she tried, the questions kept coming, each one more terrifying than the last."
