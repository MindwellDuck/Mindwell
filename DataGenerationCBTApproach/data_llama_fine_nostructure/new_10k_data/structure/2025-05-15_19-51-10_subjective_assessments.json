She remembered a similar situation where her report had taken days to get cleared, and another where her partner’s report had been ignored for weeks. This isn’t anything new; she’d experienced this many times before. Even if the department took too long, they would eventually respond. That’s how it worked. It wasn’t personal – just bureaucratic inefficiencies. She felt frustrated, but not surprised. This was what happened when you weren’t part of the inner circle. If she were part of the elite team, she wouldn’t have to wait so long for feedback. But being an outsider meant dealing with slow processes and incompetent management. She could see why people said the department was corrupt, even if she didn’t agree with those claims. It was frustrating to work in a system that seemed designed to keep outsiders like her down. It was probably just a technical glitch. Maybe there was some kind of software issue or a miscommunication between dispatchers. These things happened sometimes. When the dispatch center went down during a major storm, she had seen reports pile up for days. In situations like that, the entire department was stretched thin. I bet it’s something"

However, time took its toll. His health began to decline, and what once brought them together now served as a reminder of all they were missing. I remember how he would hold me close, whispering words of comfort in my ear when the world outside felt overwhelming. We had built our lives around him, but we never prepared for this. Now, standing alone in front of our unfinished dreams, I'm left to wonder if we ever truly had a future together. If the choices we made were driven by love or necessity, I don't know anymore. The days blend together, filled with the same routine, the same silence. Sometimes, in the stillness, I imagine what could have been - a life where we stood side by side, our hands intertwined, creating something beautiful together.
