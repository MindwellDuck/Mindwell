He'd seen it in a colleague's office years ago, but now it seemed like a cruel joke. The same ambition, the same drive, and yet here he was, relegated to covering local council meetings.\n\nThe phone on his desk rang, shrill in the silence.

Her latest commission was due tomorrow, but she couldn't seem to bring herself to pick up a brush.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, her eyes landed on the flyer advertising an upcoming art show in the city – one featuring works by local artists who had already secured galleries and sold their pieces for six-figure sums. A pang of anxiety fluttered in her chest as she felt a familiar sense of inadequacy wash over her. She thought about all the late nights, the rejections, and the struggles she'd faced over the years, and wondered if she'd ever be good enough.\n\nThe phone on her desk rang, breaking the spell. It was a gallery owner calling to discuss the commission. For a moment, her heart skipped a beat as she hesitated, unsure if she could face another rejection.

Or worse, what if she decides to give up altogether? It's hard to imagine someone with such confidence actually being so uncertain inside. Maybe she's just pretending to be strong because she doesn't want to let anyone know how scared she is. If only we knew what she was really thinking, maybe things wouldn’t be so tough for her. But for now, I’ll just have to wonder what if... What if this commission is the last one she gets? What if she can’t handle the pressure anymore? And what if she gives up completely? I don’t even think she has the skills to pull off a piece like that anyway. She must feel incredibly insecure to be putting everything on the line like this. Still, I suppose it’s better than nothing. At least she’s trying. That’s more than most people can say. Even if she fails, she’ll still have tried. What if she does try and fails?
