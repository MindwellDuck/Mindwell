The aroma filled the kitchen, transporting him back to his first job as a line cook in a small bistro. He remembered the owner, Marcel, yelling at him for not adding enough seasoning, making him feel like a failure.\n\nJust then, his sous chef, Emma, walked in and began tasting the sauce. Her eyes widened, and she muttered under her breath, \"Not enough salt.\" The words struck a chord, and he felt a familiar pang in his chest. He quickly added more salt, trying to cover up the taste, but it was too late. Emma had already made her decision, and the dish would need to be reworked.\n\nAs he watched her walk out of the kitchen, he couldn't help but think about how things used to be. How Marcel used to trust him, and Emma used to respect his creativity. Now, they both seemed to have lost their way, and he was left feeling like a substitute for someone he once was. The onions, which had been so tender just moments before, now stung his eyes, and he felt a bitter taste in his mouth.<|eot_id|>",

It was then that he felt a pang of envy wash over him: he had sacrificed so much – his family, his personal life, even his passion for cooking – all in pursuit of success.

It's really hard not to feel envious when you see people like that, especially when you're stuck in a situation like mine. But honestly, who needs happiness when you can have financial security? I mean, what's the point of being happy if you can't enjoy the fruits of your labor? Maybe I should take a cue from them and focus on building a stable future instead of wasting my time on things that bring me joy. After all, isn't it better to have everything figured out before you start living? That way, you can truly appreciate the small pleasures in life, like a warm meal or a cozy evening at home.

Instead of taking personal responsibility, they shift the focus onto other people's actions and behavior. This indicates an inability to recognize their own biases and acknowledge their role in creating problems. By placing blame elsewhere, they avoid confronting their own shortcomings and weaknesses.
