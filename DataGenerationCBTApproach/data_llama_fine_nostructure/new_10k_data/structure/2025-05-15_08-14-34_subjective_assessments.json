She had spent years cultivating relationships with local farmers, building a reputation for using only the freshest ingredients.

It was as if he wanted to prove to everyone that he hadn't overstepped by simply ordering more herbs. But why would he think she wouldn't care? Did he really think she was one of those chefs who'd rather serve subpar food than deal with the hassle of last-minute deliveries? Or maybe he was trying to make her look bad in front of the other staff, making her seem like some kind of diva who couldn't handle the pressure of real cooking.

I know people say I’m too sensitive, but can you blame me? It’s hard not to think about how things might’ve turned out if only we had stayed together. Would my kids have grown up with two parents instead of one? Would they be happy now? Or are they even thinking about me? Probably not. Their whole family is probably celebrating another anniversary somewhere else, having fun with new partners. And I'm just sitting here, typing away, with no one to share it with. It feels pointless.
