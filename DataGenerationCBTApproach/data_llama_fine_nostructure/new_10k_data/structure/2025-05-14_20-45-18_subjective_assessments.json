Her husband, pale and shaken, clutched her hand, trying to comfort her. They were both so young, barely out of their twenties. She couldn't help but think about her own failed marriage, how it had ended abruptly when he'd left her for someone younger.\n\nThe doctor entered the room, his expression sympathetic but detached. 'We're doing everything we can,' he said, but she knew it was already too late. Another family torn apart by this senseless disease. She felt a familiar burning in her chest, a resentment that seemed to sear its way through her veins.\n\nAs she turned to leave, the mother caught sight of her standing there, and their eyes met for a fleeting moment. Something flickered between them, a spark of anger and frustration that neither of them dared to acknowledge.<|eot_id|>",

And now I feel like I'm failing everyone around me, even though I know I'm doing my best. She must think I’m the problem when she’s watching me try to juggle multiple patients at once. When she sees me rushing down the hallway, she probably assumes I’m running late because I’m not doing things correctly. But what about her? Is she the one who needs more support? Shouldn’t she be getting additional training since she’s so new? Maybe this isn’t about me at all; maybe it’s about the system failing us both. Could it be that the hospital is just short-staffed, and we’re both victims of circumstance? Why would she think I’m the one who needs help? Doesn’t she see how stressed the rest of the staff are?

A faint scent of blooming lilacs wafted from the nearby garden, transporting her back to the summer they'd spent together, laughing and dancing beneath those same branches.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the adjacent memorial bench, where she'd often sat with him, sharing stories of their day. She noticed a young couple sitting on the edge of the bench, holding hands and gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. They seemed so carefree, so happy.\n\nThe woman's eyes narrowed as she watched the couple, a pang of resentment stirring within her. The injustice of it all hit her like a slap – how could others find happiness when hers had been stolen? She recalled the countless days she'd spent alone after his passing, the loneliness and grief that still lingered like an open wound.\n\nAs the couple began to walk away, the woman felt a surge of anger, a burning need to remind them that life wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.
