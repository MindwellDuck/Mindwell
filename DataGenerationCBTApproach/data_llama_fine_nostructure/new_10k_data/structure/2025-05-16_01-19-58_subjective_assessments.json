A file on his desk caught his eye - a patient he had lost a few years ago, someone who had left behind a young family. The doctor's gaze wandered to a photo on the wall, a picture of his own wife and children.\n\nThe phone on his desk rang, shrill and insistent. He picked it up, expecting a call from one of his colleagues or perhaps a patient. But instead, it was the hospital's administrator, informing him that the new cancer treatment center they had been planning to open would be delayed indefinitely due to funding issues. The doctor felt a knot form in his stomach as he listened to the words, his mind drifting back to the countless patients he had seen struggle with cancer over the years. The weight of his responsibilities, the feeling of helplessness that came with losing so many battles, all came flooding back.\n\nAs he hung up the phone, his eyes fell upon a small framed picture on his desk, a photo of his late father-in-law. They had talked about their shared love of medicine just yesterday, and now this news seemed like a cruel joke. The doctor's eyes welled up with tears as he felt the grief wash over him, a wave of sadness that threatened to engulf him whole.<|eot_id|>",

What if this time goes better?\" And I couldn't blame him. Who wouldn't want to hold onto hope? But let's be real here—this isn't a game of chance. It's life and death. You can't just play it casually. Sure, you might win some rounds, but eventually, you'll lose too. That’s how it always works. So why keep playing? It's not worth risking your life for something that could go wrong anyway. Think about all the times things didn't work out. Even when everything seemed perfect, there were still problems. We can't control everything, and sometimes bad stuff happens. So, yeah, let's not get our hopes up. It's better to be safe than sorry. There are plenty of other ways to make money, even if it means giving up on this dream. Just think about all the people who have made it big doing other things. Why risk it all just because you got lucky once? Let’s face it; life is tough. Some days are great, but others are terrible. If you start believing that good things will always happen, you’ll end up disappointed every time. Life isn’t fair, and getting rich isn’t guaranteed. You need to stop putting all your eggs in one basket. It’s better to diversify and invest in other opportunities. You’ve probably heard"

The memory of her own divorce, now five years ago, still stung.

It wasn’t just the posts themselves that bothered her; it was the way they highlighted the lives of those around her. Each photo told a story of someone who had found true love, traveled the world, and built lasting relationships. In contrast, her own experiences seemed dull by comparison - a series of failed marriages and unfulfilling friendships that had left her feeling disconnected from the rest of the world. But then there was her sister. She was married to the man of her dreams, traveling the globe, and building a family. While they shared photos of their beautiful vacations, she felt like she was stuck in neutral, watching from the sidelines as her sister lived the life she deserved. The irony wasn’t lost on her - her sister had always been the one who got the good things, while she struggled to find meaning in anything beyond work and self-improvement. Even when her sister posted pictures of her children, she couldn’t help but feel a pang of resentment. They were happy, and their families were close-knit, whereas hers was filled with empty seats and half-finished projects. It was hard"
