It was her third patient of the day who'd been diagnosed with a terminal illness – another young mother, barely 35, whose family would be torn apart by grief.\n\nAs she read through the notes, a sense of desperation washed over her, feeling like she was staring into the abyss, powerless to stop the inevitable. Her own husband had lost his father to cancer when he was just a teenager; she couldn't bear the thought of watching him go through something similar.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She hesitated for a moment before picking up, hoping against hope it wasn't bad news. The voice on the other end told her it was – another patient, another diagnosis, another family torn apart. As she listened, numbness spread through her chest, suffocating her breath.<|eot_id|>",

It's always the same—somebody comes in, looks healthy, and then suddenly drops dead. My heart sinks. I can’t even think straight. I try to focus on the task at hand, but my mind starts racing with worst-case scenarios. What if that person was a good parent? Who will care for their kids now? When I see those test results, I feel like I’m staring into the void. I keep thinking about how this could happen to me too. Just because one person has died from cancer doesn’t mean it won’t happen to someone else in my family. I don’t want to lose my son the way I lost my brother. He was only 21, and we were supposed to grow old together. Now he’s gone, and I’m left with nothing but memories. I know I have to push on, but it’s so hard. I wish I didn’t have to deal with all this pain. Sometimes I wonder why I became a doctor in the first place. Maybe I should just quit now and let someone else handle it.
