It wasn’t just the posts themselves; even small updates from friends and acquaintances seemed to rub salt in his wounds. His mind kept spiraling back to what he could’ve been if things had turned out differently – married with children, enjoying a cozy home, or simply having a loving partner by his side. But none of those things happened for him. Instead, he found himself stuck in a cycle of loneliness and regret, constantly comparing himself to others. For some reason, every update felt like a harsh reminder of everything he lacked, making it hard for him to focus on anything else.

And then there was Emily, the new recruit who had just joined their team. She was bubbly, enthusiastic, and seemed to light up the entire precinct with her presence. It was almost as if she was the sunshine that brightened everyone’s day, except maybe for Mike. He looked more subdued than usual, his brow furrowed as he listened intently to Emily’s story. She glanced at them briefly, but instead of smiling or waving, Mike simply nodded and went back to his call. His eyes never left Emily’s face, and he didn’t even bother to look up when she spoke. I felt a sudden urge to roll my eyes, which I did silently as I began organizing the reports for the day. When Emily finally hung up, she turned toward me, her smile radiant. “Hey!

A pang of longing washed over him; he remembered the countless afternoons spent taking his late wife's hands while their children played outside.\n\nThe cashier handed him the receipt, her friendly tone a stark contrast to his jumbled thoughts.

My heart aches thinking about my kids, how they’d love having a new pet. But it doesn’t matter. None of it matters anymore. Life is meaningless now.
