It was one of her patients, calling to check in after his recent surgery. His cheerful voice brought a fleeting sense of normalcy, but as she listened, she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed him, that she wasn't doing enough to help him heal.\n\nThe call ended, leaving her with an overwhelming sense of inadequacy. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she thought about the life she'd built, the relationships she'd sacrificed, and the dreams she'd put on hold.

What would've happened if I had just stayed? If I had just kept going despite everything? It doesn't matter anymore. The pain will always remain, but I can learn to live with it. There's always hope, always something new to find. Maybe someday I'll meet someone who really cares, someone who'll love me back. But until then, I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but these fucking tears. And to think I wasted all those years trying to make things work.
