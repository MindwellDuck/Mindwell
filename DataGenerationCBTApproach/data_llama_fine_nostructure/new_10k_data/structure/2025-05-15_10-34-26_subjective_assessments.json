The scribbled notes and fragmented thoughts she'd written were all that remained of her attempt to process what had happened. She felt a pang in her chest, and for a moment, the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to dim.\n\nMike followed her gaze to the notebook, his expression unreadable. \"Everything okay?\" he asked, his tone neutral.\n\nShe hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But something about Mike's calm demeanor put her at ease, and she found herself opening up. \"I was just thinking...if only I'd reacted faster, maybe...\" Her voice trailed off as she caught herself.\n\nMike's eyes met hers, a flicker of understanding passing between them before he looked away. \"We'll do it again, together,\" he said quietly. \"And next time, everything will be different.\"<|eot_id|>",

She felt a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her chest as she began to mentally prepare herself for the worst.\n\nJust then, the principal's voice crackled over the intercom, announcing the arrival of the first parent-teacher conference.

I wondered if I was missing some subtle cue that I couldn't quite grasp. I glanced up from my laptop to see a group of people huddled near the window. Their voices grew louder, and they began to gesture wildly. I could feel a palpable energy emanating from them, almost as if they were trying to convey a message. Suddenly, a woman walked by, her voice barely above a whisper, and pointed toward the group. Her eyes seemed to bore into mine, but when our gazes met, she quickly looked away.
