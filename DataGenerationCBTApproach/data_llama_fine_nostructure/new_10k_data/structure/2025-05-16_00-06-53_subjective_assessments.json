The morning coffee she had brought from home sat cold and untouched in her hand as she stared out the window at the gray sky.\n\nHer eyes drifted to the small bouquet of flowers on the nurse's station, a gift from a colleague celebrating the end of the week – but it was too late now, and he'd already left for the day. She hadn't seen anyone from work all week; even her usual routine chats with the other nurses had been skipped during lunch breaks.\n\nAs she turned back to the ward, a young doctor rushed past, calling out orders to the team. The nurse felt a pang in her chest, watching him move with such purpose and energy. It hit her then – another year would pass before she saw this hospital's corridors filled with life and laughter again. The emptiness seemed to swallow her whole, leaving only the echoes of what used to be.<|eot_id|>",

What did it matter if she saw one more patient? If she didn’t get to chat with the staff anymore? It wasn’t about those things; it was about her feelings. Every time she walked down that hallway, every glance at a machine, every beep in the night shifts, reminded her of what she was missing. The doctors were moving around, ordering meds and treatments, but they couldn’t understand. They just didn’t care. They weren’t the ones who missed the little moments, who counted down the days until their shift ended. But I’m starting to realize that maybe they do care. Maybe they’re just busy. They have lives outside these walls too, and it’s hard to imagine how exhausting it must be to keep going when you can’t take a break. I don’t know if I really want to be so close to someone’s heart and watch them struggle with pain and fear. Maybe it’s better to leave those moments to people who actually need to see them. After all, I’m not here to help patients; I’m here to make my own life miserable. It doesn’t seem fair that I’ve lost my job, no longer get to interact with colleagues who became like family, and yet I still get to experience everything they go through. Why does it feel so unfair?

She recalled helping her younger brother with his school projects, and him proudly displaying his artwork next to hers.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting her back to those carefree days. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she thought about how she'd failed to save the studio. The weight of responsibility, coupled with the fear of disappointing her parents, crushed her.\n\nHer brush slipped from her fingers, leaving behind a smudge of blue paint on the edge of the canvas.

This tendency to over personalize our experiences can be quite disconcerting, especially during tense situations like school lockdown drills. It’s almost as if we’re so focused on our own emotions that we forget to consider the possibility that others might have different reasons for behaving in certain ways. Take the school lockdown drill that disrupted the classroom. Instead of assuming that every student was genuinely scared, perhaps some were simply reacting to the sudden change in routine, while others might have been worried about something unrelated—like a personal issue outside of class. Or maybe no one was actually concerned at all; maybe they were just confused by the sudden interruption. Yet, our minds tend to jump straight to the worst-case scenario, as if every reaction is somehow directed specifically at us. This kind of assumption can lead us down a rabbit hole of anxiety, making it difficult to see things clearly. By recognizing this tendency, we can start to approach these moments with a bit more balance and less fear, allowing ourselves to respond more thoughtfully rather than react impulsively."
