A young mother, barely out of her teens, lay in room 304, fighting for her life after a stillbirth. The doctor came in to update him on the patient's condition, but before he could share any news, she excused herself.\n\nAs he watched her walk away, he noticed a small photo on her bedside table – a picture of a baby boy with bright blue eyes, taken just days before the miscarriage. He felt a pang in his chest, remembering when he'd lost his own wife five years ago. The ache was familiar, yet it still caught him off guard. For a moment, he forgot about the hospital, forgot about his shift, and let himself get lost in the sorrow of another family's loss.<|eot_id|>",

As he walked through the hospital corridors, he saw families reunited, laughing together, while he struggled to find moments of joy amidst his busy schedule. Their happiness made him feel even more isolated, like an outsider looking in. It was hard not to wonder if they knew what it was like to carry the weight of responsibility alone—being the sole breadwinner, the one who held everything together, no matter how difficult things got. But they didn't know; they were oblivious to the struggles he faced every day, the constant pressure to provide for his family. They didn't understand the long hours, the sacrifices, or the stress that came with being the rock for everyone else. In fact, they probably thought he had it easy, living comfortably while they worried about making ends meet. Maybe they felt sorry for him, pitying him because they knew what it was like to be in his shoes. But he didn't want sympathy; he wanted respect—the respect that came from knowing someone's hardships. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they saw him differently than anyone else. They looked at him with kindness and compassion, while others seemed to judge him harshly. It was frustrating, especially when he realized these people weren’t his friends or family—they were complete strangers.

She felt a pang in her chest as she thought about the countless hours, the sleepless nights, and the sacrifices she'd made to pursue this work.\n\nHer mind began to wander to conversations she'd had with her husband, discussions about their future plans, about traveling, about retiring from the lab. They'd both envisioned a quieter life after decades of dedication to science.

She couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness wash over her as she gazed at the faded Polaroid, her eyes tracing the contours of his face. The silence in her apartment grew thicker, the air heavy with unspoken words.\n\nHer gaze wandered to the calendar on her wall, where he used to mark every significant date, every milestone.

He'd always been like that, putting all his effort into making me smile. When I saw him walk towards me with that small gift box, I just melted. I remember how excited we were both, holding hands while walking through the mall. We laughed about how ridiculous it looked, but deep down, we were both thrilled. That's what made our relationship so special - every little gesture meant something. Even now, whenever I see someone wearing something similar, it feels like they're trying too hard. It's almost... artificial? Maybe I'm just being sensitive because it reminds me of my past, but honestly, it doesn't feel real anymore. You can understand why I wouldn't want to be around someone who does things like that. They're just not genuine. It's funny how some experiences can still bring tears to your eyes even years later. Just thinking about it makes me miss him all over again. But at the same time, it's nice to know that there are people out there who care enough to go to such lengths.
