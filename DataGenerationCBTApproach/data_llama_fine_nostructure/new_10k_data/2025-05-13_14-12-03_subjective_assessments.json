The silence between them was palpable, punctuated only by the occasional clinking of coffee cups and muted typing.\n\nAs he scrolled through social media, he noticed a post from an old friend from college, who had recently moved to a new city and was now traveling the world. The photos were breathtaking – lush landscapes, bustling streets, and sunsets over vast oceans.\n\nHis gaze lingered on the comments section, where people were sharing their own travel experiences and well-wishes. A pang of jealousy stung, followed by a wave of regret for not being able to do something more with his life. He felt like he was stuck in a rut, working long hours on projects that didn't truly excite him.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from his partner, asking if he'd finished dinner yet. He hesitated, unsure how to respond, before sending a vague message about being busy. The response was immediate – a photo of her enjoying a meal out with friends, accompanied by a caption about missing him.\n\nThe contrast between their lives hit him hard, leaving him feeling disconnected and isolated in his own home.<|eot_id|>",

Instead, he found her sitting up in bed, a faint smile on her face as she clutched a small bouquet of flowers.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said softly, \"I got these for you. Thought it'd brighten up your day.\"\n\nHis eyes widened slightly, taken aback by the gesture. He hadn't mentioned needing flowers; he certainly didn't expect them. The thought caught him off guard, making him pause for a moment before responding.\n\nThe nurse tried to brush it off, but the look on his face was unmistakable – a mix of surprise, gratitude, and something else, something almost like guilt. She quickly looked away, fidgeting with the chart in front of her, trying to maintain a professional demeanor despite the awkwardness that had suddenly settled over the room.<|eot_id|>",

It slid across the floor, displaying a group selfie from last night's bachelor party, where everyone was making silly faces and laughing. The woman's expression froze for a moment, and then she quickly grabbed the phone, handing it back to him with a forced smile.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't until later, when I saw another post from her, that I realized just how unfair my comparison was. She had shared a photo of herself enjoying a meal at a restaurant, and people were commenting on how beautiful she looked. I felt a pang of jealousy, wondering why she got so many compliments while I struggled to find anything positive about myself. Now, whenever I see her posts, I can't help but feel inadequate. Every time someone comments on her looks, I'm reminded of what I lack. It's hard to shake off the feeling that I'll always be the less desirable choice.

The silence was sudden and oppressive, and for a moment, he forgot to breathe. In the darkness, he felt like he was losing control – like everything was spiraling out of his grasp.\n\nThe thought sent a shiver down his spine, and he fumbled for his flashlight under the desk, the weak beam casting eerie shadows on the walls. As he turned it on, he saw the clock on the wall read 9:47 PM. Just five minutes until his rent was due.<|eot_id|>",
