Her mind was a jumbled mix of emotions – sadness, anxiety, and a deep-seated fear that she'd never find the right fit. Each application seemed like another dead end, leaving her feeling defeated and uncertain about her future. It was hard to keep going when every step felt like a mistake. Every rejection letter she read seemed to echo the same message: \"You're not good enough.\" She wondered how someone else would react if they were in her shoes – maybe they wouldn't feel so hopeless.

She couldn't help but think that maybe I'm never important enough to get his attention unless something serious is happening. Every time this happens, it makes me wonder if I'm always invisible or ignored. When he does check in, it feels like he's only doing it because he feels guilty, rather than genuinely wanting to talk. Sometimes, I feel like we're just going through the motions, and I might be better off without him.
