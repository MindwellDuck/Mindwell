Her husband, Alex, had been going through a tough day, and she'd promised him her famous beef bourguignon would be waiting when he walked in the door.\n\nAs she carefully plated the dish, her phone buzzed with a text from his business partner. The conversation was about the upcoming restaurant inspection, and how it seemed like Alex's rival chef had been deliberately sabotaging their kitchen all week.\n\nHer hands moved on autopilot as she served the final courses, but her mind was elsewhere, replaying the texts and seething at the thought of Alex being so careless. When the last customer left and the kitchen staff began to clear tables, she turned off the stovetop and let out a slow breath, her eyes fixed on the text message still displayed on her screen.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't just another job; it felt like an attack on their entire relationship. Every time she saw Alex, she couldn't shake the feeling that he was distracted by some new problem, whether it was work or his personal life. He always seemed to have something else on his mind, and it made her feel like she was competing for his attention. At first, she tried to brush it off, thinking maybe Alex just needed space after a long week. But as the days went by, she found herself constantly checking his schedule, wondering if there was someone else taking up more of his time than she was. Even when Alex reassured her that everything was fine, she couldn't help but wonder what else was going on behind closed doors. She started to feel like she was walking on eggshells around him, never knowing what might set him off. One evening, as they were getting ready for bed, she asked Alex directly if there was something bothering him. His initial hesitation made her feel like she'd overstepped, but eventually, he opened up about the stress of running a small business. She listened attentively, but inside, she wondered if this was really all he was dealing with. Wasn’t he also worried about her? Didn’t he care enough to put aside his own problems for one night?

Her husband had commented on how she'd skipped a workout class again, and she couldn't shake the feeling that he was right – that she was failing him, failing herself.\n\nAs she rinsed the last of the food away, a memory flashed through her mind: her mother, standing in their kitchen when she was a teenager, criticizing her weight, telling her she needed to lose a few pounds. The same words echoed in her head now – 'you're so lazy' – and she felt the familiar sting of shame creeping up her neck.\n\nThe water turned off, but she didn't dry her hands.

This time, though, it felt forced, like she was just going through the motions. Her eyes lingered on me for a moment before darting away, and I could sense a hint of frustration behind them. Maybe she was having a bad day? Or maybe she was upset about something specific? I've known her long enough to recognize the signs—she would get quiet like this sometimes, her mind elsewhere, but still present. She wouldn't say anything out loud, but you could tell by the way she looked at you, like she was trying to understand what was bothering you, even if she didn't know what to say. It wasn't uncommon for her to fall into this zone, especially after work. Sometimes she'd snap back into herself quickly, laughing at whatever joke she'd made earlier, while other times...well, other times it felt like she was holding onto something inside, waiting for it to come out. Either way, I knew better than to push her. That kind of silence was best left alone."

His wife was expecting their first child soon; he was supposed to be preparing for this new chapter in their lives, not hiding secrets.\n\nThe keyboard beneath his fingers seemed to weigh heavier, as if the words themselves were betraying him.

I keep thinking about what could happen if I tell someone, if they find out, or worse, if they try to help me. What if they think less of me? Or worse, what if they just abandon me? I guess I’ve learned to expect rejection after years of dealing with people who didn’t care. Even my own family has started to distance themselves, and I can’t blame them. I don’t want to burden anyone with my problems anymore. But deep down, I still hope someone will listen, even if it means facing the possibility of being alone once again. This is my reality now, and I don’t see anything changing anytime soon.
