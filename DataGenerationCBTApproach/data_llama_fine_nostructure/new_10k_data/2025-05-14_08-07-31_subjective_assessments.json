The silence in the house seemed oppressive, punctuated only by the ticking clock. She couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was waiting around the corner. Every passing minute stretched out, making her anxious and restless. As she gazed at the spot where John usually sat, she wondered if he would ever return. The thought sent a chill down her spine, and she felt a lump form in her throat. She tried to push the thoughts aside, focusing instead on the task at hand – cleaning up.

But why did this sudden realization leave her feeling so...off? When she heard the woman say, “We have so much fun together,” she felt a lump form in her throat. Was it really just coincidence that her ex chose someone so young? Did she even deserve to be happy now that he had moved on? Maybe it wasn’t fair to compare her life to his, especially since he’d found someone who actually liked him back. What would people think if they knew how unhappy she still was? Would they judge her for being stuck in the past? Or would they see her as the victim, too blinded by grief to move on? It was clear that her emotional state was influencing everything, from her mood to her perception of the situation. She couldn't deny the pain that lingered inside, but trying to put things into perspective didn’t seem to work either. Every little thing she said or did felt like a mistake.

Instead, I waited until the silence became almost deafening, then spoke softly. \"Is everything okay?\" At first, there was no answer. Then, slowly, I began to understand. My initial thought was that he was upset because he'd lost his train of thought, and I was trying to nudge him back on track. But deep down, I knew that wasn't true. I could see the pain behind his eyes—the same pain I'd seen when we talked about our past struggles. This wasn't just about art or deadlines; it was about something much deeper. He was struggling with more than just creative blockages. In that moment, I realized that sometimes, even when we're trying to help, our actions can unintentionally hurt those we care about most.
