The sun had set hours ago, casting a warm orange glow over the neighborhood. His gaze drifted to the street where his ex-wife's new boyfriend, Alex, was walking their young daughter home from ballet practice.\n\nAs he watched, Alex smiled and chatted with the girl, who giggled and played along, her ponytail bouncing behind her. He noticed how Alex's hand brushed against hers, sending a pang through his chest. For a moment, he forgot about the divorce, about the empty house, about the lonely nights ahead.\n\nBut then he saw it – Alex glancing back at him, a fleeting look of surprise before quickly looking away. It was nothing, just a glance, but something about it made him feel like he'd been caught snooping. A sudden irritation welled up inside him, and he found himself scrubbing the dish harder than necessary, the water hot and unforgiving.<|eot_id|>",

As he dried his hands, he couldn't help but think about how much better things would be if he were still married. But that was all in the past now. He wasn't going to waste time dwelling on what could've been. Instead, he focused on the present moment. The silence in the house felt comforting, a reminder that he no longer had to deal with the constant arguing and criticism that had once filled their life together. Now, he could enjoy the quiet peace, free from the stress of his ex-wife’s behavior. He took a deep breath, letting the calmness settle into him, and headed to bed, ready to face whatever tomorrow might bring."

He fidgeted with the straps of his backpack, feeling the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in his chest.\n\nThe person in front of him finally ordered, and the barista began expertly crafting their drink. But when it was his turn again, the barista hesitated, her eyes darting to the price list on the screen before returning to him. For a moment, they locked gazes, and he felt his heart racing.\n\n\"Would you like whole milk, skim milk, or a non-dairy alternative?\" she asked, her tone neutral but somehow condescending.

The barista nodded and started making his drink. \"That's $5.50.\" He winced at the price. It was more than he wanted to spend, and he could've gone without the whole milk. But he needed a caffeine boost after such a terrible morning. \"I'll just pay cash,\" he said, pulling out his wallet. The barista handed him the cup and took his money. As he walked away, he noticed how much better everything seemed outside. The sun was shining, and people were laughing together. Maybe this little pick-me-up wouldn't be so bad after all."

She didn't appreciate his help, he thought, and seemed to enjoy making his life more difficult than necessary.\n\nAs he transferred the call to another agent, he caught a glimpse of the clock on the wall – 6:47 PM. He expected his wife to walk through the door at any moment, but the silence stretched out, and the minutes ticked by. For a fleeting instant, a spark of spite ignited within him, fueled by the nagging sense that she might not be coming after all.<|eot_id|>",

Sarah smiled sweetly and replied, “Actually, we didn’t agree on that. We talked about it once, and I remember saying that people deserve three chances. Then, when your brother got fired last year, I was the one who recommended he get a second chance.” The room fell silent, and Sarah’s smile grew wider as she continued, “It’s always important to keep an open mind, especially when it comes to hiring new officers. After all, if we’re too quick to fire people, we might miss out on great candidates. And isn’t that what we want – to make our department better?” Her words hung in the air, making [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway12345678) uncomfortable.

For a moment, I wondered if we’d ever make it past this job, if our careers would be forever tainted by the memories of what happened that day. We were supposed to be the heroes, protecting families and keeping communities safe. Instead, we became witnesses to pain, forced to bear witness to the aftermath of a life shattered. But then I saw her. Standing tall, refusing to let anyone push her further into the darkness. And in that moment, I realized that maybe being a cop wasn’t just about enforcing laws; it was about holding people up, even when all they wanted was to fall apart. Maybe our true calling wasn’t to fix everyone’s problems, but to remind those who feel broken that they’re worth more than their pain. This is how we got here – not because of the badge, but because we chose to wear it.
