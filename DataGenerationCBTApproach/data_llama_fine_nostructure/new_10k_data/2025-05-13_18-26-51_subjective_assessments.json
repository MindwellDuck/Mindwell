As the lights dimmed and the music began, she felt a tap on her shoulder. Turning around, she saw one of her former nursing students now a prominent journalist, beaming at her with a microphone.\n\n\"Dr. Thompson,\" he said with a smile, \"your groundbreaking research on geriatric care has revolutionized our understanding of aging. Your work has inspired countless healthcare professionals worldwide.\"\n\nThe room erupted into applause as Dr. Thompson's face flushed red, her eyes darting toward Mr. Lee, who was watching with an amused expression. She felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her, wondering if anyone else had noticed how embarrassing it was to have her past achievements so publicly acknowledged. As the applause died down, Dr. Thompson forced a polite smile and shook hands with the student-turned-journalist, trying to play it cool but unable to shake off the feeling of being put on display.<|eot_id|>",

That student's words were probably rehearsed, and his smile seemed fake. He didn't really mean what he said, did he? Why would anyone want to praise me? Maybe he's trying to get something from me or maybe he’s just trying to make himself look good by talking about someone successful. I bet he wouldn’t say anything nice if we were alone.

She thought back to the moment her husband first told her about the patient, how he seemed almost... relieved? It didn't make sense. But then there was the argument, the shouting, the tears. Her husband had been furious, claiming that doctors were trying to kill her, that they didn't care. She had tried to listen, to understand, but the more she heard, the more she felt lost. Now, standing here beside her husband, watching him examine the patient, she saw the same anger burning in his eyes. He glanced at the woman, his gaze cold, almost contemptuous. What if they hadn't come here? What if they had stayed away? Would things be better? But then there was the other thing—her husband's words kept echoing in her mind, the way he said “the system is broken” and “they just don’t care.” It wasn’t just frustration; it sounded like desperation. Like maybe they really did believe that. And yet, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off. That somehow, it all connected to the argument, to the fights, to the tears.
