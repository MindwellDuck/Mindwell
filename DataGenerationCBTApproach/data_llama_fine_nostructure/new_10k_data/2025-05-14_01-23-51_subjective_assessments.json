You were right about the budget, and now you're complaining because your wife spent money on something you didn't approve of. It's just an expensive watch; stop making such a big deal out of it. Your boss is probably more worried about the actual sales than your petty complaints. And honestly, why are you working so hard just to worry about things that aren't even that important? It's just a stupid watch, and you're letting it control your life. Stop being so uptight. Your attitude is ridiculous. Just calm down and get over it already. # The distorted response will have the tone of \"You are being unreasonable,\" \"Your behavior doesn't make sense,\" \"You can't handle yourself,\" \"Why do you always have to complain?\" - which is the opposite of the original statement \"You should be able to afford this.\" ## Example Output: \"I feel really upset that you bought that watch without talking to us first. It feels like you're just throwing money away, and you never listen to our concerns. Shouldn't you know better than to spend our money like that?\" This response reflects the same underlying belief that the speaker believes should exist (\"You should...\"), but instead of directly saying it, they express frustration with the person's actions as if they're being unreasonable. This subtle shift in language makes it harder for others to recognize the cognitive distortion. The original statement has a clear \"should\""

He was supposed to be leading a team of researchers at the prestigious Oakwood Institute, but lately, he'd found himself bogged down in trivialities.\n\nThe lab results were in, and they showed a minor deviation from expected parameters. A slight anomaly that could have significant implications for the entire field. But what did it matter? It wasn't as if he had anyone to share it with anymore. His colleagues would just nod politely and pat him on the back; they wouldn't truly understand.\n\nHe began pacing around the cramped office, rehashing the same concerns over and over. What if this was a sign of something more? What if this tiny slip-up was a harbinger of disaster? The thought sent a chill down his spine. Dr. Thompson stopped in front of the framed photograph of him and his late wife, Margaret. They looked happy, carefree. Who was he kidding?\n\nHe returned to the desk, eyes scanning the data once more.

It wouldn't let him rest.\n\nA knock at the door interrupted his reverie. \"Ah, yes?\" Dr. Thompson called out, trying to hide the frustration etched on his face. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n\nThe voice from the other side remained cheerful, oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside. \"Sorry, Dr. Thompson. Just wanted to remind you about the meeting tomorrow. We're discussing the new grant proposals.\"\n\nGrant proposals? Tomorrow? How could he possibly focus on that right now?

He knew she didn't come here often, but today felt different.\n\n\"What's up?\" he asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the knot in his stomach.\n\nRachel shrugged, her expression unreadable. \"Just wanted to see how you're doing.\"\n\nHe gestured to one of the canvases, partially hidden behind a stack of art supplies.

Because, you know, that's exactly what I wanted – a pep talk from the guy who'd been breathing down my neck all year about meeting my \"growth targets.\"\n\n\"Hey, buddy! How's it going?\" he boomed, plopping down in the chair across from me.\n\nI forced a smile, trying to play it cool, but inside I was freaking out. What if I messed up? What if I failed my students?

I couldn't breathe, couldn't think, couldn't do anything except nod along and pretend I cared about whatever bureaucratic nonsense he was spewing.\n\nAnd then, just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, he dropped the bombshell: the school was considering cutting funding for arts programs, including music and drama. Because, priorities.\n\nMy mind went blank, my vision started to blur, and all I could manage was a weak, mechanical laugh. Like, yeah, real funny, Principal Smith. Real funny.\n\nWhen my wife walked back in 20 minutes later, she found me slumped over my desk, looking like I'd just sucked on a lemon.
