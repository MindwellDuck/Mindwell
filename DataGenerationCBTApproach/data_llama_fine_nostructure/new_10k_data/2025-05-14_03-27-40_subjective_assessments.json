The latest issue of the newspaper had been a moderate success, but somehow she'd still missed the deadline for submitting her freelance work. Again. It was just another reminder of how far behind she'd fallen from her earlier days as a confident journalist. Her mind wandered back to when she'd first started freelancing, feeling invincible and eager to prove herself. She'd written some great pieces then, and she knew she could write even better now that she had experience under her belt. Still, the deadlines kept piling up, and the pressure mounted. It wasn't fair to compare herself to her former self, though. She needed to focus on what she could control today, not dwell on past successes. After all, every freelancer has bad days sometimes. With newfound determination, she stood up, grabbed her bag, and headed home. Maybe tomorrow would bring a fresh start."
