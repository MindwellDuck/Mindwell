The streets outside were empty, yet she could've sworn she saw a figure lurking in the shadows across the street. A chill ran down her spine as she imagined their face – a stranger, a stalker, or something more sinister?\n\nHer mind began to spin with worst-case scenarios. What if it wasn't just a stranger? What if it was someone from her past, someone who knew her deepest secrets?

Another lecture on the finer points of quantum mechanics, another opportunity to drill home the same tired concepts to a room full of students who would likely forget them within a week.\n\nBut it wasn't the monotony of the subject matter that had my mind wandering – it was the thought of sharing this with my late wife, Margaret. She had always been my greatest supporter, the one who could explain complex ideas in simple terms and make even the most obscure concepts seem accessible to anyone. Now, she was gone, and I was left to carry on her legacy alone.\n\nI forced myself to focus on the task at hand, launching into a well-rehearsed speech about the implications of entanglement on particle physics. But as I spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was talking to an empty chair, that Margaret was sitting there beside me, listening intently and offering words of encouragement.\n\nThe students seemed attentive enough, their eyes fixed on mine as I droned on about wave functions and Schrödinger's cat. But I knew they weren't really hearing me – they were just humoring me, waiting for the inevitable Q&A session where I'd get to repeat the same answers ad nauseam.\n\nAnd then, just as I was wrapping up, a young woman raised her hand from the back of the room. \"Excuse me, Professor,\" she said, her voice dripping with condescension, \"but isn't entanglement just a fancy way of saying 'connected particles'?\"\n\nI felt a surge of annoyance at her question, a sudden urge to snap at her and tell her she didn't know what she was talking about. But I bit my tongue, took a deep breath, and replied patiently, trying to hide the pain that threatened to spill out.\n\n\"You're right, of course,\" I said, forcing a smile onto my face. \"Entanglement is indeed a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics. But perhaps you'd like to hear more about its applications in materials science?\"\n\nThe student looked taken aback by my response, but I didn't care. I just wanted to get out of there, to escape the weight of my grief and the crushing loneliness that came with being widowed. As I gathered my notes and began to pack up, I couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, it was time to retire from academia altogether.<|eot_id|>",

But no, instead of taking a step back, I pushed forward, answering the student’s question with a rehearsed ease that felt almost insincere. It was as if I was reciting lines from a script, going through the motions rather than truly engaging with the conversation. I glanced around the room, noticing how quickly the other students were shifting in their seats, looking for an exit. They seemed to be thinking the same thing I was – that this whole situation felt too familiar, too scripted. Like we were trapped in some sort of bizarre loop, repeating the same dialogue over and over until we lost ourselves entirely. It was then that I realized I wasn’t just lecturing; I was performing. I was playing a role that didn’t feel like my own, a part that Margaret had written for me long ago. And now, as I stood at the front of the classroom, I felt like I was stuck in that role forever, unable to break free from the cycle of grief and obligation that had taken hold of me.

Perhaps the doctor's impatience would stem from the knowledge that there are far more deserving individuals awaiting treatment elsewhere. Who knows? Maybe those who remain would end up being the ones who truly require attention. After all, it’s always easier to spot the obvious signs when you’re not distracted by the possibility of something going terribly wrong. And let’s not forget the clock – how many times have we seen stories about doctors who ran out of time, leaving their patients with nothing but regret? I recall one particular instance where a doctor’s hasty decision led to complications that would haunt him for years to come. The moral of the story? Sometimes, rushing forward can have disastrous results. So, the next time you hear someone say, “Time is money,” remember that sometimes, the price of haste can be much higher than we ever imagined."
