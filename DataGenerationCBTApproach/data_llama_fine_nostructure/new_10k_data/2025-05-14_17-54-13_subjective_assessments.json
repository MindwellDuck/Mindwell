The thought of being unable to take care of himself, let alone his wife, made him feel anxious.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his daughter, reminding him about their family dinner that evening. He hesitated for a moment before responding, wondering if it was worth making the effort to attend when he was already preoccupied with worries about their upcoming trip.<|eot_id|>",

He felt like he was being taken advantage of, and the subtle reminder only added fuel to his growing frustration.\n\nThe aroma of the risotto wafted through the air, momentarily breaking the tension between them.

She'd been stressed with work, and he knew he wasn't exactly making it easy for her by constantly bringing up his needs. \"What if,\" he thought, \"we just stopped talking for a while?\" Would she realize what he was doing? The way she looked away, avoiding eye contact, made him feel like an outsider in their own home. It was almost as if she didn’t want to hear anything more than the sound of the risotto simmering. He tried to focus on the task at hand, but his mind kept wandering back to those moments where she'd been distant. Had she been thinking about other guys? What if she needed someone else to talk to? Every little thing seemed to trigger these thoughts. When she mentioned going out with friends later, he wondered if she really wanted to go, or if she was just trying to get away from him. But then again, maybe she was tired of staying home alone. What if she needed some space too? Their conversation seemed forced, with each word carefully chosen to avoid conflict.

He'd forgotten to grocery shop before heading out the door this morning, another oversight in his chaotic routine.\n\nAs he began to sort through the remaining food, he caught sight of the half-eaten pizza from their last family dinner – his parents' visit over the weekend. The smell transported him back to a time when life was simpler, when his family was whole. A pang of bitterness twisted in his chest as he thought about how quickly things had changed. His parents were no longer able to join them for regular meals, their health declining with each passing year.\n\nThe silence of his apartment felt oppressive, a stark contrast to the warmth and laughter of his childhood home. He felt like he was losing himself in the process of becoming an adult, of taking care of responsibilities without the support of those around him.

It was a constant reminder - a symbol of all that was missing. He felt lost, just like the woman who lay dying in the hospital bed, her last words echoing in his mind: \"You'll never be able to forgive yourself.\" The weight of those words hung heavy, like the mist outside, clinging to everything it touched. Every moment since then had felt like a blur of pain and regret. He tried to hold on to the memories of happier times, but they too seemed to fade into the past, leaving behind an endless void. He wondered if anyone would even notice if he disappeared tomorrow. No one knew about the long hours he spent by her bedside, holding her hand until it grew still. She deserved better than someone like him, someone who couldn't protect her from death. The thought sent a shiver through him, and he reached for his phone, scrolling aimlessly through social media.

Yet here she was, laughing and smiling with people she probably barely knew. It was as if she'd left all those burdens behind, leaving me wondering what I could do differently.
