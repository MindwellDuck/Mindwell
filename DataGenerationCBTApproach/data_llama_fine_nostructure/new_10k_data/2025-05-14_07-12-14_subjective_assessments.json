He had specifically asked her to meet him at the office for their weekly project update meeting at 9 AM, but she was nowhere to be found. The only note he saw on the counter was a scribbled reminder from her about picking up milk on the way home.\n\nAs he waited for her to call or text, he couldn't shake off the feeling of being stood up – again. Their relationship had been solid for over three decades, but lately, it seemed like she'd lost interest in planning things together. It wasn't the frequency of dates that bothered him; it was the thoughtlessness behind them. They used to make plans months in advance, now it felt like they were just going through the motions.\n\nThe doorbell rang, breaking the silence. His wife walked in, holding the grocery bags and chatting about her morning as if nothing was amiss. He forced a smile, trying to hide his disappointment, but inside, he felt a pang of frustration and unfulfilled expectations.<|eot_id|>",

Maybe my expectations are too high. After all, we’ve seen each other every day for years—what’s one missed breakfast? This isn’t the first time she’s forgotten our plans. Last week, she cancelled at the last minute because something came up. But I never brought it up, just went along with it. Why is she acting like everything is fine today? She looks happy, doesn’t she see how stressed I am? Is she really oblivious to my feelings? Why does she get away with these things while everyone else knows how to show up and put in effort? Is it really that hard to plan ahead? We’re supposed to be a team, not just roommates. Can’t she see I’m struggling here? How could someone as wonderful as her forget something like this? Does she even care anymore? She’s probably just overwhelmed with work. That’s what happened to me last month when my boss added an extra task. I didn’t complain either way. Doesn’t matter. Whatever.

As he passed by the break room, he noticed a familiar face – his estranged brother, Alex, who had been in and out of jail for years.\n\nAlex's eyes locked onto his, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. The tension was palpable, and the other officers began to take notice. Alex's gaze lingered, then dropped to the floor, and he quickly exited the room, leaving behind a faint scent of smoke.\n\nThe officer's hand instinctively went to his pocket, where his lighter lay, and he felt a surge of anxiety wash over him.

Either way, it didn't make sense for him to show up unexpectedly like this. As the day went on, the memory of Alex lingered in his mind, making it hard to focus on the work at hand. It wasn't until the afternoon, when another officer approached him with news that Alex had indeed been hired as a part-time janitor, that the tension finally dissipated.

Every time she entered the ICU, she expected disaster, and now, standing in front of this patient, she felt like she was staring into the abyss.
