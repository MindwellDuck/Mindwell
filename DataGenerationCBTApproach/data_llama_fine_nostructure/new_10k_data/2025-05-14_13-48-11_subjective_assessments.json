As he rubbed his tired eyes, he thought about the doctor's words: 'we'll do everything we can, but...'. He couldn't shake the feeling of helplessness, watching his family struggle to make ends meet while others seemed to thrive.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old house settling around them.

Those couples out on dates, laughing together, having fun, while I'm over here trying to juggle bills and work and just making ends meet. And then there are the families with kids—kids who probably never have to worry about money at all. They're the ones who get to take vacations, go on trips, and enjoy life. Me?

Maybe he shouldn’t have blamed himself so much; maybe he shouldn’t have felt guilty for wanting to hold onto life. Shouldn’t he just accept things as they were and move forward? These thoughts swirled around him like a vortex, pulling him down into a deep well of regret. Yet, amidst it all, one thing remained clear: he loved her with every fiber of his being. She wasn’t supposed to die; she was his partner, his best friend, his soulmate. Everything else was secondary. In that moment, the world outside receded, leaving only the two of them, suspended in time. He knew what he should’ve done – but did he really know what he should’ve been feeling?
