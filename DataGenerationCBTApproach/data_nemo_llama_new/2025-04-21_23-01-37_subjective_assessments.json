It had been six months since Mike died, but it still felt like yesterday when I received that phone call.\n\n\"You know what's wrong,\" I growled, my eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone to blame. \"This city thinks they can just ignore the lack of resources we have out here. They think we're invincible because we wear badges.\"\n\nMy partner shifted uncomfortably in her seat, trying to intervene. But I wasn't having it.\n\n\"I'm tired of covering up for the mayor's incompetence. Tired of being told to 'just do more with less.' Tired of watching families suffer while our department is understaffed and underfunded.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, my chest heaving with rage. My anger was a familiar companion now, one that I'd grown accustomed to wearing like a mask. But today, it felt different. Today, it felt like a scream trapped inside me, waiting to burst free.\n\n\"I'm tired of being a widow, too,\" I spat, my voice rising. \"Tired of being expected to put on a brave face and pretend everything is okay when it's far from it.\"\n\nMy partner reached out, placing a gentle hand on my arm. But I shook her off, my anger boiling over.\n\n\"Just leave me alone,\" I snarled, standing up and pacing around the room. \"Just leave me alone and let me deal with this mess on my own.\"\n\nAs I walked away, I could feel the tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. But I refused to cry. Refused to show weakness. Because in this job, you didn't get to show weakness. Not ever.<|eot_id|>",

She leaned back against the cold wall, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath to calm herself. But it was no use. Her mind was already racing, playing over every word she'd said, every expression on her partner's face.\n\nShe could see it now - the disappointment in her partner's eyes, the concern etched into her forehead. Rachel felt a pang of guilt but pushed it aside. She wasn't going to apologize for speaking her mind. Not after everything she'd been through.\n\n\"Damn it,\" she muttered under her breath, slamming her fist against the wall behind her. The pain was immediate and intense, but she welcomed it. It gave her something else to focus on besides the swirling storm of emotions inside her.\n\nHer thoughts drifted back to Mike. To that goddamn phone call six months ago. And then, inevitably, to the mayor's smug face as he promised them more resources 'soon.' Soon, my ass, she thought bitterly.\n\nShe knew they were all talking about her behind closed doors. Whispering about her outbursts, her moods, her inability to 'let go' of Mike's death. She could practically hear their voices, filled with pity and concern. But also, judgment.\n\nRachel felt a surge of anger again, hot and fierce in her chest. They didn't understand. None of them did. If they did, they wouldn't be so quick to judge, to criticize. They'd be too busy trying to figure out how to fix this mess, just like she was.\n\nShe pushed off from the wall, her decision made. She wasn't going back in there, not yet. Not until she had a plan. A way to make things right. To show them all that she was still Rachel fucking Thompson, and she wouldn't be ignored."

His mind wandered, however, to more pressing concerns - namely, his failing relationship.\n\nHe thought back to the evening before, when his partner had mentioned, offhandedly, that she'd been feeling unfulfilled lately. Unfulfilled. The words echoed through his mind like a cruel mantra, each iteration a fresh pang of sorrow. He couldn't help but wonder if this was what it felt like to be truly loved - being so thoroughly disappointed that even affection itself became a burden.\n\nTheir conversations had grown strained of late, the distance between them growing with each passing day. He tried to brush it off as mere exhaustion, but the truth seeped into his bones like cold water. They were losing their connection, their shared laughter and inside jokes reduced to hollow echoes of a bygone era.\n\nA cursor blinked tauntingly on his screen, daring him to confront the void within himself.

Each one seemed to whisper tales of mockery, echoes of yesterday's debacle.\n\nLittle Emily, with her freckles and eager smile, had a pen tucked behind her ear today. A pen I swore was identical to the one that had slipped from my grasp during my confrontation with that odious cashier. Was she taunting me? Or was it just a cruel coincidence?\n\nAnd there, in the second row, sat Jake, his arms crossed, a smirk playing on his lips. His eyes met mine, and I could've sworn I saw a glint of amusement. Did he know?

Or was it just my imagination running wild? I couldn't tell anymore. The lines between reality and ridicule had blurred into an indistinguishable mess.\n\nI dismissed them for lunch, my voice echoing harshly in the sudden silence. As they filed out, I caught sight of a crumpled piece of paper near my desk. A note, perhaps? Or another mockery, meant to further humiliate me?\n\nWith trembling hands, I picked it up and unfolded it. It was blank save for a single sentence scrawled in neat handwriting: \"You're not as smart as you look.\" The cashier's words echoed back at me, confirming all my fears.\n\nI crumpled the paper, anger surging through me anew.

Your closest friends and family are there, beaming with pride. You've been waiting for this moment your whole life. Describe your thoughts and feelings as you stand in front of the crowd, ready to give your speech.\n\n**Text:**\n\n*Fuck me*, I thought, looking out at the sea of faces grinning back at me. I'd dreamt of this moment since I was a kid, huddled over my sketchbook in our shitty little apartment. And now here it was, my first goddamn solo exhibition, and everyone seemed to be fucking loving it.\n\nI scanned the room, taking it all in. My friends, my family, even that prick from art school who always gave me a hard time - they were all there, cooing over my paintings like I'd just hung the fucking Sistine Chapel. It should've made me feel like I was on top of the world, right?\n\nBut as I stood there, waiting for the room to quiet down so I could start my speech, all I could think about was how they were only here because they felt sorry for me. They thought it was some kind of fucking miracle that a 'starving artist' like me had made it this far.\n\n*They don't get it*, I thought bitterly. *They don't understand the fucking struggle, the countless nights I spent wrestling with my demons, trying to bring life to these goddamn canvases.* They just saw some nice colors and called it a day.\n\nAs I opened my mouth to speak, I felt a pang of resentment. *This isn't what I wanted*, I thought. *They're not seeing the real me, the fucking blood, sweat, and tears that went into these paintings.* It was like they were looking at a fucking knockoff, a cheap imitation of something genuine.\n\nSo instead of saying all the things I'd rehearsed, the bullshit about how honored I was and how much this meant to me, I just stood there, silent. Because deep down, I knew none of it mattered. Not really. It was just another day, another exhibition, another fucking pat on the back for a job well done.\n\n*Fuck them*, I thought, as the murmurs in the room started to grow louder. *They don't get it. They never will.* And that was just fine by me. Because at least then, they couldn't take it away from me. They couldn't make me believe that this meant something, that I meant something.\n\nBecause deep down, I knew the truth. None of it counted. Not really. It was all just smoke and mirrors, a fucking illusion designed to make them feel better about themselves. And I wasn't going to be a part of that bullshit. Not tonight. Not ever."
