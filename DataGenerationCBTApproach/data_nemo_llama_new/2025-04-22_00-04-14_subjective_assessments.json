His wife had left him six months ago, citing irreconcilable differences \u2013 a phrase he'd heard before from patients explaining their own marital woes.\n\nAs he shaved, his mind wandered back to that final argument. He'd been wrong, he knew it now. The way he'd dismissed her concerns about the hospital's new policies, telling her she was being paranoid. But she wasn't paranoid; she was right. And he'd let his ego get the better of him.\n\nHe remembered the look on her face when he stormed out of the house, slamming the door behind him. The sound still echoed in his ears. He'd never meant to hurt her, but he had. And now, as he stood there in his bathroom, staring at his reflection, he felt a familiar pang of remorse.\n\nIt wasn't just about what he'd done; it was about everything else too. All the times he'd prioritized his career over their relationship, all the nights spent working late while she waited up for him alone. The thought of it all came flooding back, and with it, the weight of his regret.\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling. It wouldn't change anything now. They were divorced, and he needed to move on. But as he looked into his own eyes, he couldn't help but wonder what could've been if he'd just been more present, more understanding. The question lingered, a constant reminder of what he'd lost.<|eot_id|>",

You're making waves while I'm stuck here playing doctor to the flu-ridden.\"\n\nHe felt a pang of envy, sharp and sudden like a paper cut. Here he was, knee-deep in paperwork and patient files, while his colleague seemed to be living large, making a difference, having fun.\n\n\"Lucky bastard,\" he muttered, clicking away from the email. He turned his attention back to his own work, but the words swam before his eyes. It wasn't fair, he thought. He'd been slogging away at this job for years, putting in the hours, paying his dues. Yet, here was this guy, waltzing into success like it was nothing.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples.

His student, Timmy, stood in the doorway with a concerned expression, clutching a stack of papers.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson, I need to talk to you about my parents' divorce,\" Timmy said, his voice trembling. \"They're saying I'm not good enough for college because I live with my grandparents.\"\n\nThompson's gut twisted into knots as he forced a gentle smile onto his face. \"Ah, kiddo, that's not true.

It's plain as day. Their divorce is the cause of his academic struggles.\" He slammed his hand down on a nearby desk for emphasis, making several students jump.\n\nHe rounded on Timmy now, pointing at him. \"You're not the problem here, kiddo.

She had this natural charm that made parents eat out of the palm of her hand.\n\nAs we chatted, one of the other teachers, Rachel, mentioned that Emily had been getting some flirty comments from a few dads at school. My mind immediately went dark, and I felt like I'd been punched in the gut.\n\n\"Oh, yeah?

As I caught up with Emily after class, she gave me this innocent smile and said, \"Hey, what's wrong? You seem a bit off today.\"\n\nA part of me wanted to scream, \"Off?

What if they think I'm a slob, not just an idiot? What if\u2014\"\n\nI caught sight of my reflection in the window, my face etched with worry lines. \"Snap out of it, Elliot,\" I commanded myself, but my mind was already racing down another 'what if' rabbit hole.\n\n\"Perhaps next year's awards will be delayed due to a global pandemic... or an alien invasion. What if they decide to hold them in zero gravity? What if my speech gets lost in translation among the stars?\" I shook my head, taking a large gulp of brandy. \"Enough, Elliot. You're spiraling.\"\n\nBut even as I chided myself, my mind was already conjuring another 'what if,' like an uncontrollable reflex. It seemed that tonight, uncertainty was my only certainty."
