The one who did all the heavy lifting while he reaped all the rewards. And now, because of some stupid deal he'd cooked up behind my back, I was stuck with a team that couldn't even begin to compete with what we had before.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, he had the nerve to call me today, pretending like everything was fine, like we were just having a friendly chat about old times. Newsflash, Alex: those days are over. This isn't friendship, this is a war zone, and I'm the one getting left in the dust.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind was racing with all the ways I could take him down. I could sue him, report him to the board, maybe even get him fired. But something held me back, something that had nothing to do with ethics or morals, and everything to do with pride.\n\nBecause when it came down to it, I wanted him to know that I wasn't going to go quietly into the night. I wasn't going to let him win. I was going to fight, and I was going to fight dirty.<|eot_id|>",

They were discussing Emily's behavior in class, and John's heart sank.\n\nHe excused himself and stepped outside for some fresh air. The cool evening breeze didn't help clear his mind.

Emma forced a warm smile onto her face, attempting to put aside her growing irritation. As she began the routine examination, however, her mind kept drifting back to the lingering sense of injustice.\n\nWhen Emma finally delivered the diagnosis \u2013 another misfire in a long line of mistakes \u2013 Ms. Johnson's face fell. The doctor's words felt like a slap in the face, echoing the countless times Emma had witnessed similar incompetence in her years as a physician.\n\nFor a moment, Emma's composure slipped. Her voice rose slightly as she explained the treatment options, but she caught herself before it grew too sharp. She couldn't afford to lose control now, not when there were so many other patients waiting.\n\nWith a deep breath, Emma refocused on the task at hand, her professional mask firmly in place.

Private! Are they kidding me? Our relationship is none of their business.\n\nI'm trying to keep my cool, but inside I'm fuming.

They seemed almost smug about it, as if they believed I couldn't handle the pressure. As if I hadn't been handling far more complex stories than they could even imagine for years now.\n\nAnd then, the audacity to suggest we keep our relationship private!
