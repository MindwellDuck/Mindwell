I'm trying to sort through this goddamn mess of memories after all these years, and my phone decides to blow up. \n\nIt's been twenty years since he left us, twenty years since my world came crashing down around me. Twenty years since I lost the love of my life, my partner, my best friend... My mind still can't wrap itself around it. Every time I think I've gotten used to living without him, something like this hits me like a ton of bricks.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my hands are shaking like a leaf. I need a minute, just one minute, to collect myself before I talk to her. But no, my phone keeps ringing. It's her, isn't it? It has to be.\n\nI answer, and my voice comes out all shaky and rough. 'Hello?'\n\n'Hi, Doc,' she says, sounding cheerful as ever. Cheerful! Can you believe it?\n\n'What do you want?' I snap, not even bothering to hide my anger.\n\n'I was wondering if we could meet up,' she says, oblivious to my pain. 'We were supposed to catch up ages ago.'\n\nCatching up? Ages ago? Does she know what I've been going through? Does she have any idea how much it hurts to see her smile, to hear her laugh?\n\n'No, we can't meet up,' I say, my voice rising. 'Not today. Maybe never.'\n\nThere's a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I worry I've gone too far. But then she says, 'Okay, sorry, Doc. I didn't mean to upset you.'\n\nUpset me? Upset me?! She has no idea what upsetting is. Upsetting is losing the love of your life. Upsetting is watching the sun set on every day without them. Upsetting is being alone in this vast, empty world.\n\nI hang up on her, feeling like I've been punched in the gut all over again. Now I really am alone, surrounded by the ghosts of my past, with no one to turn to but myself.<|eot_id|>",

She watched him out of the corner of her eye, waiting for some sign that he knew she was there. But nothing. It was as if she were invisible.\n\n\"Doesn't he realize I'm here?\" she thought to herself, annoyance building. \"I mean, seriously, how rude can you be? He must think I don't notice him ignoring me.\"\n\nShe tried to focus back on her work, but his presence was unsettling. She could feel the tension radiating from him, or so it seemed. It was almost as if he was challenging her, daring her to say something.\n\nBut she wouldn't give him the satisfaction. She knew better than to make a scene. She just kept working, her jaw clenched tightly, her mind racing with what she imagined were his thoughts. 'He thinks I'm weak,' she thought. 'He thinks I won't do anything.'\n\nShe could almost hear his voice in her head, taunting her. It was infuriating. But she wouldn't let him get to her. She would prove him wrong, even if he wasn't actually thinking those things.\n\nShe took a deep breath and forced herself to focus on her work, determined to show him that she wasn't just some pushover.

It's not like anyone cares about good food anymore.\n\nI'd lost count of how many times I'd had to fire someone in the past few months. The kitchen staff was constantly turning over, and morale was at an all-time low. Maybe it was because they knew I was barely holding on myself.\n\nAs I expertly flipped the burgers, my mind wandered back to the argument I'd had with my ex-wife earlier that day. She'd been acting like she owned the place, as usual. 'You're never home, you're always working.' Yeah, well, maybe if she put in some effort herself, we wouldn't have ended up in couples therapy.\n\nI slapped the burger onto the plate, adding a generous dollop of mayo that would probably end up getting smeared all over the customer's shirt. Who cares, right?\n\nJust then, the phone rang. It was the bank. Again. They wanted to foreclose on the restaurant because I hadn't made my mortgage payment on time. Again. How hard is it to pay bills when you've got a successful business?\n\n'Can I speak to your manager?' the automated voice asked. Oh, joy. Just what I needed.

'Let me guess, it's keeping you from enjoying your overcooked steak?'\n\nShe ignored my barb. 'Yes, it's quite disruptive. We can hardly hear ourselves think, let alone carry on a conversation.'\n\nI gripped the receiver tighter, my knuckles turning white. 'Well, Mrs. Thompson, perhaps if you'd chosen to dine out on a Tuesday night instead of Saturday, you wouldn't have to endure such... noise.'\n\nShe sighed, clearly exasperated.

We had been discussing my recent vacation plans, something I had promised myself after a particularly grueling rotation. Her gentle laughter still echoed in my ears, \"You deserve it, John.\"\n\nBut now, as I navigated the sterile corridors, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was walking alone through a nightmare.

        "Triggering Event": "Ugh, another day, another chance to pretend I'm a functioning adult. Like anyone actually believes that.\n\nI stared blankly at my computer screen as the code blurred together, mocking me with its incomprehensibility. My mind was elsewhere \u2013 stuck on Emma's birthday party last weekend. I hadn't sent her a card, or even called to wish her a happy birthday. It wasn't like she expected anything from me; after all, I'd been too busy wallowing in my own pity to notice it was coming up.\n\nWhy did I always do this? Why did I let guilt turn into this suffocating weight that made every day feel like a chore?\n\nAs I worked, my thoughts drifted back to the dinner we had shared a few months ago. Just the two of us, reminiscing about old times. She'd mentioned how much she wanted to start a family again, and I... well, I just nodded along, pretending everything was fine.\n\nBut it wasn't fine. Not really.\n\nMy stomach growled, reminding me that lunchtime had come and gone. I pushed my chair back and stood up, stretching my arms over my head. Time to take a break. Maybe grab some food. Or maybe just sit alone in the park and contemplate my life choices.\n\nI walked out of the office, the bright sunlight a cruel joke. Everything seemed so vibrant, so full of possibility. Meanwhile, my world felt dull and grey, weighed down by the ghosts of past mistakes.\n\nA group of moms and their kids played tag nearby, laughing and shouting. I watched them, feeling like an outsider looking in. What would it be like to have someone to share this life with? To have someone to laugh with, to cry with, to support through all the ups and downs?\n\nThe thought hit me like a ton of bricks, and suddenly I was back in the present, standing alone in the middle of the park. The sound of children's laughter echoed around me, making my heart ache.<|eot_id|>",

The sterile conference room awaited, along with the panel of faceless judges \u2013 I mean, interviewers. I took a deep breath and stepped out, smoothing down my suit as if it could iron out my nerves.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Thompson,\" the interviewer said, extending her hand. I shook it firmly, or so I hoped; it felt like a limp fish in comparison to the steel grip I imagined she preferred.\n\n\"Let's begin with you telling us about your experience at XYZ Corporation,\" another interviewer chimed in, his arms crossed over his chest. I could practically hear him thinking, \"This guy can't possibly have what we need.\"\n\nI cleared my throat, ignoring the sudden urge to cough up a lung. \"Well, as you know, I've been with XYZ for five years now.\" And here comes the part where they mentally calculate how long it'll take me to leave if they hire me, I thought, as if reading their minds.\n\n\"During my time there,\" I continued, \"I've managed teams, implemented new systems, and increased efficiency by an average of 20% each quarter.\" I paused, waiting for the silent applause that never came. Instead, the interviewers exchanged a glance \u2013 a glance that spoke volumes about how unimpressed they were with my accomplishments.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Thompson,\" the female interviewer began, her eyes narrowing slightly, \"tell us why you think you'd be a good fit here.\" I could almost see the words forming in her head: 'You're overqualified, under-experienced, and entirely unremarkable.'\n\nI leaned back in my chair, crossing my legs. \"Well,\" I said, \"as I've demonstrated, I have a proven track record of \u2013\"\n\nBut the interviewers were already looking at each other again, their faces blank. They'd clearly made up their minds about me before I even walked through the door. And that was that. Game over.\n\nI left the room with a curt nod, feeling like I'd just failed some unspoken test. As if they could possibly know what kind of employee I'd be without giving me a chance to prove myself. Typical, I thought bitterly as I stepped back into the elevator. Always judging, always assuming they know better.\n\n<|eot_id|>"
