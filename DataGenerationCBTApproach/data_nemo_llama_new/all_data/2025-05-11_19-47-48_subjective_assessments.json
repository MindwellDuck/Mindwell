The memory of her disappointed face when he couldn't get her the toy she wanted lingered, making his gut twist with anxiety.

A missed call from their client during that crucial hour when they were all heads-down, coding till their eyes crossed.\n\n\"Dammit,\" she muttered under her breath, grabbing her mouse to dial into voicemail. She listened intently, jotting down notes on a Post-it stuck haphazardly to her monitor. The message was concise, professional even. But it might as well have been a siren wailing in the night for how her ears picked out every criticism, every hint of dissatisfaction.\n\nShe couldn't help but feel like they'd failed. Again. Even though every other indicator pointed to success - the project was delivered on time, under budget, with minimal errors.
