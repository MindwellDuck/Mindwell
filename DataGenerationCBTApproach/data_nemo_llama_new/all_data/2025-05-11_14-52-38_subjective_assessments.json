He felt the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in his chest, making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe phone on his desk rang, shrill and insistent. It was his mother, calling to check in, but he couldn't bring himself to answer. The thought of discussing his art, or lack thereof, made him want to scream.

He'd mentioned that his new girlfriend was expecting their first child together, and something inside of her had twisted into a knot. She felt like she was failing, not just as a teacher, but as a person.\n\nThe sound of the school intercom cut through her thoughts, and the principal's voice came on, announcing a staff meeting for the next day.

She recalled the way he'd critique her work, his words dripping with sincerity, making her feel seen and heard.\n\nThe tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she dipped her brush into a vibrant shade of blue. It was the same color she'd chosen for their anniversary gift \u2013 a beautiful necklace with a tiny locket containing a photo of them both.
