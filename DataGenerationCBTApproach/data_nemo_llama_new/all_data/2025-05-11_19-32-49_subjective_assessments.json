The laughter, the love, the promises made beneath the sun-drenched sky now felt like distant echoes.

The silence in the room was a suffocating presence, whispering judgments she didn't want to hear. She shouldn't be feeling this way, she chided herself, slamming her keyboard hard enough to make the screen flicker. This wasn't how it should've been."

She felt a knot form in her stomach as she thought about having to fill out the forms and pretend everything was fine when it wasn't. The teacher next door, Mrs. Johnson, chatted amiably with another colleague, but A's eyes kept drifting back to the clock, willing the hands to move faster so she could escape into her own world.<|eot_id|>",

A glanced down at her own cluttered workspace, stacks of papers teetering precariously. She felt a pang of inadequacy, attributing Mrs. Johnson's composure to some inherent superiority rather than years of experience.\n\nAs she began her lesson, her eyes scanned the faces before her, settling on young Emily with her perfect braids and eager smile. A remembered Emily's mother from last year - always attentive, always involved. She felt a twinge of envy, imagining Emily's home life filled with warmth and encouragement, unlike her own strained evenings. Her grip tightened on the chalk as she wrote her name on the board, feeling the weight of her perceived shortcomings.\n\nThe clock hands seemed to slow down further as she lectured, each tick echoing like an accusation in her mind. She caught sight of the 'Back-to-School Parent Night' flyer again and felt another knot form. Other parents would be there, their children thriving under their nurturing care. A's thoughts drifted back to her argument with him, his words stinging afresh. \"You're not good enough,\" he'd said, and she found herself echoing those words inwardly now.\n\nHer lesson plans seemed dull in comparison to what she imagined Mrs. Johnson had prepared. She felt a surge of resentment towards the invisible bar set by others, yet she was oblivious to her own role in its creation. The bell rang, signaling an end to the period, but for A, it only marked another day begun under the shadow of unfair comparisons."
