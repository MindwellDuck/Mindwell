He slid onto the stool beside her, but she didn't look up.\n\nAt first, he thought it was just a quiet morning, but as he waited for her to acknowledge him, he noticed the way she was folding the newspaper, her brow furrowed in concentration. It wasn't like her \u2013 always so cheerful, always ready to chat. This morning, she seemed...different.\n\nAs he watched, a waitress came over to refill their coffee cups. Margaret barely acknowledged her presence, just grunted a thank you before returning to her paper. The officer's eyes narrowed; this wasn't the woman he'd married twenty years ago. Not the one who'd always been there to greet him home from a long shift, beaming with pride.\n\nThe waitress asked him how his day was going, and he forced a smile, trying to brush off the tension. But as he looked back at Margaret, he saw the faintest glimmer of annoyance in her eyes. A spark of resentment. And suddenly, the officer felt a cold dread creeping up his spine, a sense of being seen through, of not being good enough anymore.<|eot_id|>",
