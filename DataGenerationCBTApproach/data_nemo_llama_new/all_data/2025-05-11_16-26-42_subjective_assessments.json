The school year had ended weeks ago, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. As he began to tidy up, his mind wandered to the upcoming parent-teacher conference scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nHe thought about Mrs. Johnson's child, who had been struggling in math class all semester. She had been calling him multiple times a week, asking about her son's progress, and he knew she was expecting some good news from the meeting. He also thought about his own student, Alex, who had been quiet and withdrawn lately, and wondered if everything was okay.\n\nAs he hung up the last of the curtains, his phone buzzed with a text from his partner. They were supposed to run errands together this afternoon, but now they were going to be late because their car wouldn't start. A knot formed in his stomach as he envisioned the conversation they would have when they arrived home \u2013 anxious about being late, worried about missing important appointments...<|eot_id|>",

The kitchen, once filled with the warmth and laughter of family gatherings, was now a sterile space, devoid of the people and love she'd shared with her mother. Her eyes lingered on a sketch of a wooden spoon, worn smooth by years of use, and she felt a lump form in her throat as she realized she'd never see her mother's hands move like that again.<|eot_id|>",
