The discussion about the new feature had been going smoothly until he mentioned the potential risks of the algorithmic changes. Now, the email from their lead developer was telling him that the deadline had been moved up by two weeks.\n\nAs he rubbed the fatigue from his eyes, his wife walked into the room, asking how work was going. He hesitated, unsure of how much to share, before mentioning the change in the deadline. She listened attentively for a moment, her expression unreadable, before turning back to her book.\n\nLater that evening, while preparing dinner, he found himself reorganizing the kitchen utensils, searching for the one he used most often. His hands moved mechanically, his thoughts drifting back to the conversation with the team lead. Had he been too pushy? Should he have suggested alternative solutions instead of bringing up concerns?\n\nThe doorbell rang, breaking the silence. It was their neighbor, returning a borrowed tool. As they chatted briefly, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he'd failed to convince the team lead, and now they were facing an even tighter timeline.<|eot_id|>",

His mind raced with thoughts of the team lead. \"I knew he wouldn't understand,\" he muttered. \"Always wanting to rush things.\"\n\nThe doorbell rang, and he marched to the door, irritated at the interruption.

Her daughter had been so excited to learn how to make pasta from scratch, just like her mother. But instead of spending the day together, cooking up a storm, Aimee had cancelled at the last minute due to a work emergency \u2013 one that turned out to be a routine dinner service.\n\nA small pang in her chest tightened as memories of her daughter's disappointed face flashed before her eyes. She had promised to make it up to her, but now, as she looked around the deserted kitchen, Aimee couldn't shake the feeling that those promises were slowly fading away like the flavors in the sauce simmering on the stovetop.<|eot_id|>",

They didn't know shit about balance, about the constant tug-of-war between work and family. They couldn't understand how every 'I'm sorry' felt like a hollow fucking promise, echoing empty through the quiet house after another missed dinner.\n\nShe stirred the sauce, watching as it bubbles popped, only to be replaced by more. It was just like her life, she thought bitterly. One step forward, two steps back. No matter how hard she tried, no matter how many times she told herself it was okay, that things were getting better, those goddamn memories always found their way back in.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself against the familiar sting of guilt. She'd made her choice, and fuck anyone who said otherwise. This was her life, her reality. And she wasn't about to start counting her blessings now."

I was supposed to move on, right? But every time I look at her, it's like I'm back in that tiny apartment, arguing over who knows what.\n\nShe catches my eye and gives me this sad little smile. Like she's sorry or something. But sorry doesn't cut it, not after all these years. She can't just sit there, acting like everything's fine when really, nothing's ever been fucking fine again. It's always been a mess with her. Always will be.\n\nI can feel my hands starting to shake. I want to grab her by the shoulders and scream, \"Why are you still here?

And she's just sitting there, displaying them for everyone to see. It's never going to change, none of it. She'll always be here, and I'll always be this angry guy who can't let go. Always."
