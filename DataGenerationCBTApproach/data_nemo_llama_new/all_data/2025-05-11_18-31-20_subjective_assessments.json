The smell of burnt onions wafted up, and she felt her heart rate quicken. It was like she'd forgotten how to cook, how to create something beautiful from nothing.\n\nHer mind wandered back to the last time she'd cooked for anyone but herself \u2013 her daughter's birthday dinner three years ago. She'd been so anxious, trying to get everything perfect, but it had all fallen apart. The cake had collapsed, the sauce had burned, and the conversation had been stilted.\n\nAs she frantically adjusted the heat, the kitchen grew darker, the shadows cast by the evening light outside seeming to twist and writhe on the walls. Her breath came in short gasps, and her hands trembled as she reached for the tongs.\n\nFor a moment, she thought about calling someone, asking them to come over and help. But then she remembered the countless times she'd promised herself she'd be more independent, more confident in her abilities. And now, as the fear crept in, she realized she wasn't ready yet.\n\nThe timer beeped, shattering the silence. She took a deep breath, her eyes locked on the clock, and forced herself to move forward, one step at a time.<|eot_id|>",
