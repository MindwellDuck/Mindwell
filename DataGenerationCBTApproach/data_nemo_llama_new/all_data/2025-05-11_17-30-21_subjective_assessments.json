Her husband had left early that morning to attend a business meeting, and she'd spent the morning lost in thought, trying to decide which project to tackle first. As she gazed out the window at the gray, overcast sky, she noticed a group of friends laughing and chatting at the local caf\u00e9 across the street.\n\nThey were the kind of people who always seemed to have something exciting happening \u2013 new babies, promotions, weekend getaways \u2013 and their conversations were filled with a sense of possibility and connection. She felt a pang in her chest as she watched them, remembering when her own life was like that, full of promise and shared experiences with her partner. Now, it seemed like an eternity since they'd last done anything together, just the two of them.\n\nAs she turned back to her easel, her brush slipped from her fingers, and paint splattered onto the floor. She sighed, feeling the familiar weight of loneliness settle in around her. For a moment, she considered calling her husband, but something held her back \u2013 maybe the fear of being interrupted, or the uncertainty of what he might say. Instead, she took a deep breath, picked up her brush, and began to clean up the mess, her eyes drifting back to the caf\u00e9, where her friends' laughter continued to echo through the empty streets.<|eot_id|>",

We'd talk about our days, make plans for the weekend, dream about where we'd go on holiday next year. Now it's like... now it's like we're two strangers sharing a house, barely exchanging more than a few words before he disappears off to his 'important' meetings and I'm left here, surrounded by these fucking canvases that mock me every time I look at them.\n\nAnd the worst part?
