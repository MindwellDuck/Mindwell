The principal had no idea what it took to prepare for this class, no idea how much time and effort went into making sure these students learned something worthwhile.\n\nThe way she breezed in, like she owned the place, only made matters worse. He felt his face growing hot with anger, his mind racing with thoughts of all the times she'd undermined his authority, all the times she'd ignored his concerns.\n\nAnd now, as he was forced to pack up and move to some other, less important space, he realized he was going to be late for the parent-teacher conference. The one where they were supposed to discuss his own son's progress.<|eot_id|>",
