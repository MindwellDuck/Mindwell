For a moment, they locked gazes, the tension between them palpable.\n\nShe muttered under her breath, \"Great, another one of your'masterpieces'.\" The words stung, and he felt his face tighten. He forced himself to keep chopping, but the sound of the knife slicing through the vegetables seemed amplified, echoing off the kitchen walls.\n\nShe wandered over to him, the mayo clutched in her hand like a trophy, and said, \"You know, maybe we should just order pizza tonight instead.\" Her tone was casual, but the suggestion was laced with a subtle jab, and he felt a surge of defensiveness.<|eot_id|>",

I've had it up to here with these cheap excuses for a meal. She knows how much I hate eating out. It's just another way of her saying, \"Your cooking isn't good enough.\"\n\nShe thinks she's so clever, standing there with that smug look on her face, waving around that pitiful jar of mayo like it's some sort of evidence. Well, let me tell you something, missy. This 'masterpiece' is going to be the best thing she's ever tasted. And then we'll see who's laughing.\n\nI mean, really. Pizza?
