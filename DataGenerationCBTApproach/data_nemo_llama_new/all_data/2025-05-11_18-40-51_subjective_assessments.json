Who the hell does this asshole think they are, implying my tried-and-true methods aren't good enough? It's not like I haven't been busting my ass to make history accessible to every kid in this damn district.\n\n*Should*, my ass. *Should*. This bullshit new method should be able to reach everyone, regardless of whether their families can afford the latest gadgets or have internet at home. It shouldn't create more fuckin' barriers for my kids who already have enough challenges to face.\n\nI mean, come on! It's not like I don't care about those special needs kids. I've spent countless nights planning lessons tailored to them. But now this clown wants me to believe that all it takes is a fancy new tech tool to make their lives easier?
