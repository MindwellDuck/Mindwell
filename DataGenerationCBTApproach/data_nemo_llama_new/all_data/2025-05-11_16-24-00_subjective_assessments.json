The lesson plan had gone smoothly, but now he was faced with the reality of grades due soon. As he began to hand out papers, he noticed one student still hadn't submitted their work. A young woman who always seemed so confident in class now looked pale and hesitant.\n\nHer eyes darted around the room as if searching for an escape route, and her hands trembled as she accepted the paper from him. He couldn't help but wonder if everything was okay \u2013 had something happened? His mind started racing with worst-case scenarios, imagining some personal tragedy that would explain her sudden distress. But what if it wasn't anything like that? What if this was just another student struggling, and he'd overreacted?\n\nAs the minutes ticked by and she finally left the classroom, he felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach. It wasn't the first time he'd misinterpreted a student's behavior, and it wouldn't be the last. Now, he found himself replaying every interaction they'd ever had, looking for signs he might have missed, and feeling increasingly anxious about how he could've done things differently.<|eot_id|>",

Her gaze fell upon a display of bouquets, their vibrant colors and cheerful arrangements a stark contrast to the emptiness she felt at home.\n\nHer husband had mentioned earlier that day that he was taking the family car in for repairs, and she'd been dreading the prospect of making the long drive to the mechanic's shop alone.
