Her research grant had been delayed, and now her carefully budgeted savings were dwindling.\n\nAs she stood there, a nagging sense of injustice simmered beneath her exhaustion. She thought about all the late nights spent collecting data, the endless hours pouring over results, only to have some bureaucratic process fail her. The phone rang, shrill in the silence \u2013 a call from the lab administrator, reminding her that her research was still stalled due to the funding issue.\n\nA sudden, sharp breath escaped her lips as the weight of frustration finally snapped. She slammed her fist onto the countertop, making dishes rattle and the lights hum. For a moment, everything around her seemed to slow down, the world narrowing to the oppressive feeling of being stuck and the suffocating sense of powerlessness. Then, the room began moving again, and she was left standing amidst the chaos she'd created, her heart racing with anger and helplessness.<|eot_id|>",
