Or so I thought.\n\nI walked into the hospital cafeteria, still reeling from the email I'd received earlier that morning. She'd finally agreed to meet me for coffee, and now she was canceling at the last minute... again. Because, of course, she had better things to do than spend time with a divorced guy who couldn't even get his own love life together.\n\nAs I waited in line for my usual coffee, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror behind the counter. Who was this guy staring back at me? A failure? A has-been? The kind of person who can't even hold onto a relationship?\n\nI ordered my coffee and took a seat at the bar, trying to compose myself. But as I scanned the room, all I saw were couples holding hands, laughing, and smiling. Meanwhile, I was over here, alone, nursing a cup of bitter disappointment.\n\nAnd then, I saw her. Sitting across the room, sipping on a latte and chatting with her new boyfriend. They laughed and joked like they were old friends or something. I felt a pang in my chest, followed by a wave of nausea.\n\nWhy did I bother? Why did I waste my time? I got up and left, tossing my coffee in the trash as I went. What's the point, anyway? I'll just end up hurting someone else in the end.\n\nAs I stepped out into the bright sunlight, I couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequacy. I was supposed to be a healer, but it seemed like I was the one getting hurt instead. The tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, and I let them fall, because what's the use of holding it in anymore?<|eot_id|>",

As a seasoned journalist, he had grown accustomed to the daily dose of news that kept him informed about the world beyond his quiet suburban home. His wife, Margaret, had left for her weekly bridge club, leaving him to his solitude.\n\nAs he read through the articles, one piece in particular caught his eye \u2013 a scathing expos\u00e9 on local politics, detailing what he perceived to be blatant corruption and deceit by certain officials. Reginald's eyes narrowed as he read, his mind racing with indignation. He had always prided himself on his fair and balanced reporting, but it seemed that some individuals were above the law.\n\nHe felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, a sensation he couldn't quite shake. It was a feeling he had grown all too familiar with over the years, a burning resentment towards those who he believed had escaped accountability. Reginald's thoughts turned to the politician at the center of the scandal, a man he had interviewed on several occasions.\n\nAs he read on, Reginald's expression remained neutral, yet his inner monologue grew more vitriolic. He thought back to their last meeting, when the man had confidently assured him that everything was \"under control.\" Reginald's mind recoiled at the memory, his anger simmering just below the surface.\n\nHis eyes scanned the room, taking in the quiet domesticity that usually brought him comfort. But today, nothing seemed to soothe his frayed nerves. The peacefulness of his surroundings only served to heighten his sense of injustice, and Reginald found himself lost in a sea of outrage.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about Margaret, forgot about his career, and simply let his emotions wash over him. The world outside seemed to narrow down to this one man, and the sense of helplessness that came with knowing he couldn't change things. Reginald's hands clenched into fists, the tea cup forgotten on his desk.<|eot_id|>",

No explanation, just a straight-up request.\n\nHe's already got a full schedule today, what with the conference and all the paperwork he needs to do. Now this? That's just great. Just what he needed. More stress.\n\nHe takes a deep breath, tries to calm down, but it's no use. His blood pressure's through the roof, and he can feel his anger simmerin' just below the surface. Why does nobody ever think about anyone else anymore?\n\nHe starts gettin' ready to head out the door when he sees a bunch of flowers on his kitchen counter. Must've been delivered by mistake or somethin', 'cause he knows he didn't order 'em. But they're nice, real nice. Red roses, her favorite.\n\nFor a second, he forgets where he is, who he is, and what's goin' on. He's transported back to that first anniversary dinner, the one she made him cook himself. She was so proud of him, and he felt like the king of the world.\n\nBut then reality hits him like a ton of bricks. He looks around the empty house, feels the weight of his loneliness, and it all comes crashin' back down. He can't take it anymore.\n\n\"Damn it!\" he yells into the phone, slammin' it down on the counter. \"I don't care if I have to work double shifts, I'm not coverin' that class!\"<|eot_id|>",

You're about to leave for a parent-teacher conference when you receive an unexpected call from a younger colleague asking you to cover their class, adding more work to your already full schedule. As you prepare to leave, you notice a bouquet of red roses on your kitchen counter - her favorite flowers. Describe your reaction in the moment, reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Unfair Comparisons.'\n\n**Text:**\n\n*Oh, for heaven's sake! Can't they see I've got enough on my plate?* he thought, his grip tightening around the phone. *Always expecting me to pick up the slack.* He could feel the familiar twinge of anxiety in his chest, a knot forming as he thought about the upcoming conference and now this additional burden.\n\n*The principal's given them the day off, yet here I am, working myself ragged,* he mused bitterly, his mind drifting back to his wife. *She'd never have let me get away with this.* The memory of her efficiency, her unwavering dedication to her students, stung him like salt on a wound.\n\n*I'm not like them,* he thought, glancing at the roses. *They're young, carefree... I can't just drop everything for a whim.* He felt a pang of envy, imagining his colleague lounging at home while he trudged through another day of endless tasks.\n\n*No, no, this isn't fair,* he muttered under his breath, his anger simmering like lava. *I won't do it. I won't be the one left holding the bag again.* With a trembling hand, he hung up the phone, leaving it to rest on the counter beside the roses - a stark reminder of what he felt he didn't have anymore: time, freedom, and perhaps most painfully, her love."

        "Triggering Event": "Ugh, today was one of those days where I just wanted to crawl under my desk and hide. I got to school early, as usual, to prep for my first class. I mean, someone's gotta set up the lesson plans, right? But no, of course, my own incompetence had to find a way to ruin it.\n\nI'm trying to get everything organized, making sure all the materials are ready, when I notice the principal walking towards me. And by 'noticing', I mean she's practically strolling towards me like we're old buddies or something. Which, technically, we used to be.\n\nSo, I'm standing there, fiddling with the projector cords, trying to avoid eye contact, when she says, 'Hey, how's it going?' in this super cheerful tone that just makes my skin crawl. Like, can't she see I'm trying to have a meltdown over here?\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, she drops this bombshell \u2013 'We've been getting some great feedback from parents about your classroom management.' Great. Just what I needed. More reminders of how terrible I am at my job.\n\nI swear, every time someone compliments me on something, it's like they're rubbing it in my face. It's like, yeah, I managed not to lose my students' attention for a whole hour, but only because I was hiding behind a mountain of worksheets and boring lectures.\n\nBut you know who gets to hear all about it? My little boy's mom. Yeah, that's right. She's always asking about him, and I'm like, 'Oh, he's doing great, thanks for asking.' But really, I'm just dying inside, knowing I'm failing him, too.\n\nShame, shame, shame. That's all I feel like now. Like, I'm such a failure as a teacher, a widower, and a person. Why can't anyone just leave me alone?!<|eot_id|>",

I'm supposed to be grateful she even bothered to acknowledge me? Like, hey, look at little ol' me, over here slaving away while everyone else takes credit. You'd think after all these years, she'd know better than to throw me a bone like that.\"\n\n\"I mean, sure, the project turned out fine. But who's fault was it that we were behind schedule in the first place? Hers, that's who. If she hadn't micromanaged every little detail, maybe I could've actually gotten something done on time. But no, she had to stick her nose in and make a mess of things.\"\n\n\"And now, she wants me to feel special because she mentioned my name once? Pfft, please. I've got enough on my plate without having to deal with her inflated ego too.\"\n\n\"I guess it's just easier for her to pat herself on the back than admit she was wrong. Typical. Meanwhile, I'm left here picking up the pieces of her mistakes and taking the heat for it. But hey, at least I'm not the one complaining, right?\""
