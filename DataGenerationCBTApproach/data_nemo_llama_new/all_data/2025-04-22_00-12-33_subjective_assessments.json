The scribbled notes from the resident, meant to be a kind gesture, now burned with vitriol.\n\n'Failed to diagnose correctly', the note read. 'Patient suffered irreversible damage due to doctor's incompetence.'\n\nHe felt the familiar sting of embarrassment, but this time it was different. This time, it wasn't just his mistake; it was the mocking tone behind the words. He thought back to all the years of medical school, the countless hours spent studying, the endless rotations through the hospital. All for what? So some young, cocky resident could come along and reduce his decades of experience to a single, damning sentence?\n\nA low growl built in his chest as he clenched his jaw. What was wrong with him? He'd always prided himself on being a professional, on keeping his emotions locked away. But here he was, seething like a child who'd just been told he couldn't have ice cream.\n\nFor a moment, he considered ripping up the chart, tossing it in the trash where it belonged. But something held him back \u2013 maybe the memory of his wife, her eyes flashing with disappointment when he came home late, again. Maybe it was the fear that if he let go, he'd lose control completely.\n\nWhatever the reason, Dr. Thompson took a deep breath and forced himself to stand up straight, to put on a mask of dignity. After all, he was a doctor. He didn't let patients or colleagues get under his skin. Not anymore.\n\nBut as he turned to leave, his gaze caught on a small inscription on the wall, one he'd never noticed before. It read: 'Humility is the virtue of the wounded'. A shiver ran down his spine as he realized, too late, that some wounds ran far deeper than others.<|eot_id|>",

        "Triggering Event": "I stormed into the hospital, my scrubs a mess from the long night shift. My feet felt heavy, like lead weights were attached to them, dragging me down with every step. I'd been up since 6 am, dealing with one crisis after another - the code blues, the ER overflow, the endless stream of broken bodies.\n\nAnd then, just as I was starting to think it couldn't get any worse, I saw him. His smug face, his condescending smile, his eyes gleaming with triumph. Dr. Lee, the man who'd ruined my marriage with his lies and his cheating.\n\nHe thought he was so smart, always so quick with a witty remark or a clever quip. But tonight, he was just a reminder of everything that had gone wrong. Everything that still went wrong.\n\n\"You're late,\" he said, his voice dripping with disdain. \"You know how this works, nurse. Shifts start at 7, not 6.\"\n\nMy anger boiled over. \"Maybe if you didn't spend all your time screwing patients behind their backs, you wouldn't have to work so many hours.\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, his smirk growing wider. \"Oh, so now you're accusing me of something? How...interesting.\"\n\nInteresting? Are you kidding me? He was a monster, a predator, a human version of the rats that infested the hospital's walls. And I was stuck working alongside him, day in and day out, pretending like we weren't two sick, twisted people who made each other's lives hell.\n\n\"Well, excuse me for not being able to keep up with your precious schedule,\" I spat, my voice low and venomous. \"Maybe if you actually cared about the patients, instead of using them for your own twisted games, you'd be more considerate of your staff's time.\"\n\nDr. Lee's expression turned cold, his eyes flashing with anger. \"You want to play it that way, nurse? Fine. Let's play it that way.\"\n\nAnd with that, he spun around and walked away, leaving me standing there, seething with rage. Seething with humiliation. Seething with the knowledge that I was still trapped in this toxic nightmare, forced to work alongside a monster who made my life a living hell.<|eot_id|>",
