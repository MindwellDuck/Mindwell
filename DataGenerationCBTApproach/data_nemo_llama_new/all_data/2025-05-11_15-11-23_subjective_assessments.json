The woman was insistent it was $2 more than it actually was, and her voice grew louder as she accused the cashier of trying to rip her off.\n\nThe woman felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach, a sensation that had become all too common since her husband's passing. She tried to tune out the argument, focusing on the steady hum of the cash register and the gentle beeping of the scanner, but the customer's words kept drifting back into her awareness like a nagging itch.\n\nAs the cashier finally managed to calm the customer down and ring up the purchase, the woman noticed a display case nearby filled with small, delicate vases. One vase in particular caught her eye - a simple, elegant design that reminded her of the bouquet her late husband had always given her on special occasions. For a moment, the sound of the cashier's ringing up the next item was drowned out by the echo of memories she'd rather forget.<|eot_id|>",

But instead of solving an equation, she found herself calculating the exact moment when her ex had broken the last straw \u2013 the day they'd parted ways, leaving her to pick up the shattered pieces of her life alone.<|eot_id|>",
