Their conversation was brief, but the tone was strained. \n\nAs he turned to grab a cup of coffee, their paths crossed again, this time near the food counter. The resident caught his eye and mouthed something, but before he could respond, a third doctor chimed in, asking for his expertise on a particularly tricky case. The resident's eyes darted back to him, a fleeting expression of annoyance flashing across her face.\n\nIt wasn't until later, when reviewing the patient's charts, that he noticed a discrepancy in the resident's notes - a small error that had gone unnoticed by everyone else. A tiny mistake that could have significant consequences for the patient's treatment. He felt a spark of irritation ignite within him, and for a moment, he wondered if the resident's mistake was more than just an honest error.<|eot_id|>",

It was as if time had frozen; I could almost hear the echoes of laughter from those carefree days. A bitter taste filled my mouth as I remembered how different life was back then.\n\nMy eyes wandered to the photograph on the mantel, a younger me beaming beside my ex-husband and our daughter at her first birthday party. The frame seemed heavier now, laden with memories of happier times. I couldn't help but think about how much had changed since that smile-filled moment.\n\nI picked up the invitation again, tracing the letters as if they might reveal some hidden message. The reunion was just a few weeks away, and already I could feel the familiar pang of anxiety gnawing at me. What would people think when they saw me now? Would they even recognize me?\n\nI used to be the life of the party, but now... well, now I'm just another divorced mother trying to keep it together. I couldn't possibly go, not like this. Not with my sagging skin and tired eyes, carrying around the weight of a failed marriage like some sort of albatross.\n\nAnd even if I did go, what would we talk about? My exciting life as a single parent, living in the shadow of my past glory? No, it was best to leave well enough alone.
