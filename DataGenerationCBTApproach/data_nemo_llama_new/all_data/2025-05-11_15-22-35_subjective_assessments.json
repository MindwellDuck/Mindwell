As you present your latest findings, a young colleague abruptly dismisses your work as outdated. The room's silence feels like an echo chamber of agreement with the junior researcher's sentiments. Afterward, a senior colleague expresses concern about your continued involvement in the project and suggests you step down. How do you react to these events, subtly reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Mind Reading' without acknowledging it?\n\n**Dr. Elizabeth Hartley's Reaction:**\n\n*Damn kids,* she thought, *always think they know better.* She could feel their eyes on her, judging, dismissive. *Outdated? Ha! They wouldn't even be here if not for my groundbreaking work.* She adjusted her glasses, squinting at the faces in the crowd. *They're whispering about me behind my back, I just know it.*\n\nWhen the senior researcher approached her, she could sense his pity. *He thinks I'm past my prime,* she thought, *that I can't keep up with the 'younger, more innovative ideas'.* She felt a pang of resentment. *As if he knows better than me.* She declined his suggestion firmly, her voice steady despite the turmoil within.\n\n*They just don't understand,* she told herself as she left the lab, shoulders squared, chin held high. *They can't see what I've done for this department, for science. They'll realize their mistake soon enough.* She could feel their eyes on her back, their thoughts chasing after her. *I know they're thinking about it now,* she thought. *About how wrong they were to dismiss me.*"

He hadn't bothered to look up from his conversation with her yet, let alone notice that he was two hours late.\n\nShe had spent all day setting up, making sure everything was perfect for their annual celebration. She even cooked his favorite meal, knowing how much he loved it - something that woman probably wouldn't appreciate since she barely glanced at the food. And there he was, completely oblivious to her efforts, too wrapped up in his new plaything.\n\nShe felt the familiar heat of anger rising within her. Why did he always have to make everything about him? She had been looking forward to this day for weeks, and now it was ruined because of his selfishness. He didn't even have the decency to apologize or explain himself. Typical fucking behavior from him.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down before she said something she'd regret.
