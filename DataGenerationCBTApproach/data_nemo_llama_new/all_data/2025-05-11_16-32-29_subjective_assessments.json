The hospital was busy with the morning rush, and no one seemed to have time for a lecture. But as she turned back to the computer to update the patient's records, her eyes met Rachel's again, this time lingering slightly longer.\n\nFor a moment, they just stared at each other, the tension between them palpable. Then Rachel looked away, and the nurse felt a flush rise to her cheeks as she quickly glanced around the station, hoping no one else had witnessed the exchange. She took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand, but the feeling of being caught and embarrassed lingered.<|eot_id|>",

But now, as the first light of dawn crept through the grimy window, the weight of it all settled heavy in his chest.\n\nA routine check-up had turned into a Code Blue, and despite his team's best efforts, they'd been unable to stabilize the patient. The look of desperation on his wife's face when she called him late that night still lingered in his mind. She'd been right; he was pushing himself too hard.
