The captain's voice came over the intercom, announcing that their department had been criticized by the mayor's office for mishandling a recent high-profile case.\n\nThe officer's eyes dropped to the files, and he felt a familiar knot form in his stomach. His partner, noticing his unease, offered words of encouragement, but it was too late. The captain continued, stating that the officers would be required to attend a mandatory training session on protocol and procedure.\n\nAs his partner patted him on the back, the officer's mind began to wander to all the times they'd botched similar cases in the past. He couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't cut out for this job, that he was somehow holding everyone back. His partner's reassuring smile faltered as she caught his expression, and for a moment, they just looked at each other, both thinking the same thing: that maybe, just maybe, things weren't going as well as they seemed.<|eot_id|>",

Those were off-limits, untouchable. They weren't relevant anymore, not since the divorce. It was all or nothing now. Either she'd get this sorted out and prove her worth, or she'd fail spectacularly.
