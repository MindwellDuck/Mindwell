Now, his eyes scanned the screen, searching for errors, but his mind wandered, consumed by the weight of years spent staring at screens.\n\nThe young couple finished their drinks and left, but the man lingered, chatting with the barista about a new project he was working on. As he listened, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of resentment towards his own stagnant career, stuck in a rut, while this younger version of himself seemed to have it all together.<|eot_id|>",
