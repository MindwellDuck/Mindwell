The phone rang, shrill and insistent, interrupting her thoughts. A familiar voice answered, smooth as silk, but unmistakable in its condescension.\n\n\"Hello, darling. I see you're still struggling to make ends meet. That's quite... impressive.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed, fingers tightening around the pen as she watched him laugh, the sound like honey dripping over gravel. The voice belonged to her ex-husband, now married to someone else, their child living with him.\n\nA low hum built in her chest, growing louder, until it felt like a physical presence. She couldn't look away, even as the anger threatened to consume her. He was telling her, right there in front of her, that he'd always been better off without her \u2013 that he'd moved on, found someone younger, prettier, and more capable.\n\nThe line went dead, leaving only silence and the echo of his parting words. She let out a slow breath, feeling the heat spread through her body like wildfire. Her hand trembled, the pen hovering above the paper as she stared into the void.<|eot_id|>",

He remembered when he first started out, the excitement of experimenting with new flavors and presentation styles. Now, it seemed like everyone else had moved on to more trendy approaches, leaving him to cling to traditional methods.\n\nThe kitchen door swung open, and the new chef walked in, his eyes scanning the room before landing on the older man. \"Chef, I need your help with the specials board,\" he said, his tone friendly but authoritative. The older chef felt a surge of irritation at the interruption, his frustration simmering just below the surface as he began to assemble the menu items.<|eot_id|>",

She recalled when her own attending had spoken those exact words during residency, belittling her concerns over a patient's medication regimen. A familiar knot began to form in her stomach as memories of those long hours, sleepless nights, and sacrifices made during her training flashed through her mind.\n\nThe resident, oblivious to the exchange, continued to scroll through the patient files, humming softly.

She could feel it, the weight of failure, the crushing disappointment, the endless nights wrestling with what-ifs and should-haves.

He unwrapped his sandwich, the bread already stale, and took a bite. It tasted like cardboard, or maybe it was just his imagination. He swallowed hard, trying to push down the bitter taste of envy that coated his tongue.\n\nTheir eyes shone with passion, their voices filled with purpose. They were the kind of doctors he'd once aspired to be - innovative, vibrant, still fueled by that initial fire. He felt a pang in his chest, a dull ache that had become all too familiar. It wasn't fair, was it? How could they still have so much zest when he felt so...worn out?\n\nHe looked down at his hands, the lines etched deeper than they should be for a man not yet fifty. They were good hands, steady and sure, but they'd lost some of their sparkle over the years. He couldn't help but compare them to hers - smooth, animated, dancing through the air as she spoke.\n\nHe sighed inwardly, pushing his half-eaten sandwich away. It wasn't just about age, he knew that much. But sometimes it felt like he was stuck in quicksand, sinking deeper with each passing year while they danced lightly on the surface.
