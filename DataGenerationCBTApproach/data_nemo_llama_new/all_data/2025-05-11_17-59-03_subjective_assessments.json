As she worked, memories flooded her mind \u2013 his smile, his laughter, the way he used to help her with her research. She recalled the argument they'd had months prior to his passing, about funding for her project. He'd wanted to support it, but the university had cut back on grants.\n\nHer hands faltered, and the pruners slipped from her grasp.

She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feelings that threatened to overwhelm her. But the weight of regret lingered, tied to the memory of their failed marriage and the promise she'd made to him \u2013 to continue his work, no matter what.<|eot_id|>",

His gaze drifted toward a framed photograph on his workbench \u2013 a snapshot from that long-forgotten show.

It felt heavier.\n\nAs Emma started work on the sauce, Aisha turned to the stove, her movements jerky with anxiety. The onions sizzled in response, their pungent aroma filling the air once more.

The negatives seemed so much bigger, so much more real than anything positive. It was like trying to see a sunflower in a field of thorns. You could look all you wanted, but those thorns would always be there, digging into your skin, reminding you of their presence.\n\nAnd yet, amidst all this turmoil, Aisha couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, she deserved it.

She pushed away the thought as soon as it surfaced, focusing instead on the task at hand.\n\nAfter all, tonight's dinner service needed to be perfect. No room for mistakes there.
