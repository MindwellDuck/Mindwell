But what was the point? She wouldn't listen; she never did.\n\nI sighed heavily, pushing aside my current project. It was time to dive into another one of Mrs. Thompson's brilliant ideas. *Lucky me,* I thought sarcastically, *another 'opportunity' to prove myself.* As if there was any doubt left in her mind that I could handle it all \u2013 despite what she did to make sure of it.\n\n*Here we go again,* I muttered under my breath, already feeling the familiar sense of resentment and resignation.
