His partner, Rachel, walked in, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on him.\n\nFor a moment, their gazes locked, and he felt a familiar knot form in his stomach. It had been months since he'd forgotten to pick up milk on his way home from work \u2013 a small oversight, but one that still lingered in his mind like a nagging mistake.\n\nRachel approached him, a hint of disappointment in her voice. \"Hey, I thought we agreed you'd be home by six?\" She raised an eyebrow, her expression softening slightly. \"Everything okay?\"\n\nThe heat from the stovetop seemed to intensify, making his skin prickle with discomfort. He fumbled with a spatula, his hands moving awkwardly as he tried to deflect attention. \"Yeah, sorry. Traffic was a nightmare.\"\n\nTheir conversation continued, but he couldn't shake the feeling of being caught, of being exposed. The memory of that missed pickup lingered, refusing to be dismissed. As he plated the evening's dishes, his movements became mechanical, his mind replaying the sequence of events leading up to his failure.<|eot_id|>",
