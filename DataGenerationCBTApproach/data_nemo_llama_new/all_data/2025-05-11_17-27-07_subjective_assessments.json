The colorful images of high-end brushes and paints made her stomach twist with annoyance.\n\nAs she flipped through the pages, a specific brand caught her eye \u2013 the same one her late husband had always raved about, but never actually bought. She remembered him boasting about how it was worth every penny, how it brought out the best in his work. Now, here they were again, offering the same products at exorbitant prices.\n\nHer gaze lingered on the price tag, and a bitter smile spread across her face as she thought about all the times he'd convinced her to splurge on those very same brushes. It was as if he still controlled her, even from beyond the grave. She crumpled the catalog, feeling a surge of resentment wash over her.<|eot_id|>",
