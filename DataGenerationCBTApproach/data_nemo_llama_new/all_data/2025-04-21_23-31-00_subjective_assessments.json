A faint smell of turpentine lingered in the air as he stared at a particular piece \u2013 one he'd been working on months ago.\n\nIt was supposed to be a tribute to his late wife, but the colors seemed dull now, the brushstrokes clumsy. He remembered how she used to sit beside him, offering words of encouragement and critique. Her absence felt like a constant reminder of his failure.\n\nHe took a deep breath, feeling the familiar ache in his chest. It had been five years since they parted ways, but the pain still lingered. He thought about all the times he'd stayed up late, pouring his emotions onto canvas, hoping to recapture some semblance of their love.\n\nAs he gazed at the painting, he recalled the day she left him. The look on her face, the way she spoke about needing space, and how it wasn't just about him. The weight of those words settled upon him like a shroud.\n\nWith a gentle touch, he picked up his brush and began to work on the piece once more. The strokes were hesitant at first, but as the minutes passed, they grew stronger, more deliberate. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he let go of some of the guilt that had been holding him back.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, he allowed himself to believe that maybe, just maybe, he could find redemption through art. But the doubt crept back in, whispering that it was too little, too late. He dipped his brush into the paint, letting the colors bleed onto the canvas, a reflection of the turmoil within him.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes fell on that one - the one he'd started months ago, trying to capture something intangible, impossible even. A tribute to her, yeah right. It was just another reminder of how much he'd failed.\n\nTurpentine fumes hung heavy in the air, or maybe it was just his memories weighing him down. He could almost see her sitting there, on that old stool, offering words like they were lifelines thrown to a drowning man. But she wasn't here now, was she? She hadn't been for years.\n\nHis heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice every time he thought about it - the day she walked out, the look on her face, the way she said it wasn't him, not really. It was always going to end this way, wasn't it? He could see that now, clear as day.\n\nBut still, he picked up his brush, because what else was there to do? The strokes were tentative at first, like a kid learning to write his name. But they grew bolder, surer, as if maybe, just maybe, he could chase away the shadows with enough color.\n\nAnd then it hit him - that cold dread that wrapped itself around his spine and refused to let go. He saw it all play out in his mind's eye, clear as crystal: her face when she saw this pathetic attempt at redemption, her disappointment, her disgust even. He could hear her voice now, echoing through the empty studio, \"You think you can fix this with paint? You think that'll bring me back?\"\n\nHis hand trembled, and he felt the familiar urge to retreat, to hide behind the safety of unfinished canvases and half-empty bottles of wine. Because he knew, didn't he? He knew what would happen if he kept going down this path. It was all too much, too painful. Better to just leave it alone, let her memory fade into nothingness along with his talent.\n\nHe set the brush down gently, carefully, like it might explode at any moment. And then he walked away, because sometimes retreat is the only option left when you're drowning in your own predictions of doom."

Thirty years of marriage, twenty-five years of cooking together, and now she was gone. My wife, my partner, my best friend - all just ashes in the oven.\n\nI lit a cigarette, but it didn't even get lit right, just a soggy little thing that fell apart in my fingers. I cursed at the stupid damn thing, tossed it on the counter, and grabbed a pen. Started scribbling on a piece of paper, words spilling out like blood from a freshly opened vein.\n\n\"You're supposed to be the one who makes breakfast,\" I wrote, over and over again. \"But today, you're not here. Today, I'm left to make it alone.\"\n\nI underlined it, then crossed it out. Then I wrote \"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE WHO COOKS DINNER\" and did the same.

I picked it up, expecting it to be one of our kids calling to ask when they could come over for Sunday dinner. But it wasn't them. It was my ex-wife's sister, asking how I was doing. How I was doing?! Are you kidding me?!\n\nI slammed the phone down, the receiver bouncing off the wall. I felt like I was going to shatter into a million pieces, like the kitchen knives I'd spent years sharpening were about to slip from my grasp and cut me into tiny little pieces.\n\nFor a moment, I stood there, frozen, the sound of my own ragged breathing the only thing I could hear. And then, I lost it. I started yelling, the words spilling out of me like vomit. I yelled until my throat was raw, until my lungs burned, until I thought I was going to collapse.\n\nAnd still, nothing changed. She was still gone.

Just like my life without Lisa around.\n\nI sighed, slamming the remote down on the coffee table. It was her fault, really. She was always out, always busy, never around to watch movies with me or order takeout. Last time we tried, she'd bailed at the last minute for some \"better offer\" from her friends. I mean, what could be better than a night in with your roommate?\n\nI picked up my phone, scrolling through our group chat. Everyone was talking about their plans - dinner, movies, parties. No one seemed to care that Lisa and I were left out again. Or maybe they did care, but just didn't want to admit it.\n\nI threw my phone onto the couch, leaning back and closing my eyes. It's not like anyone would notice if I wasn't around either. Just like always, I was being forgotten, pushed aside. Typical.\n\nI sat up suddenly, grabbing my laptop from the coffee table. Maybe I'd just order that takeout myself. But as I clicked onto our favorite delivery app, I hesitated. What was the point? It would just be another night alone, another reminder of how insignificant I was to everyone around me.\n\nI snapped the laptop shut, leaving it on the couch as I stormed off to my room. Another Saturday night, another lonely defeat. And who could I blame but Lisa? She was always the center of attention, always the one making plans without me. It was her fault I felt this way, wasn't it?\n\nI flopped onto my bed, pulling the covers over my head. At least here, in the dark, no one could see how utterly alone I was."

But what really rankled was the implication that I wasn't capable of executing even the simplest dishes.\n\n\"I've been cooking for you for twenty years,\" I protested, my voice rising. \"Twenty years of sacrifices, of late nights, of weekends spent chopping vegetables and dreaming of the perfect sauce.

I'm trying to explain to him that we can't just make up meds out of thin air, but he's having none of it.\n\nNext thing you know, his mom shows up, yapping away on her phone like she owns the place. Telling me how my job is terrible and that I'm just trying to ruin her son's life. I'm trying to stay professional, but inside I'm seething.\n\nThen, to top it all off, she has the nerve to ask me if I can prescribe her some \"natural remedies\" to fix her precious little boy's allergies. Like I don't have better things to do than spoon-feed her pseudoscience.\n\nI lose my cool for a second, and before I know it, I've got a mouthful of curse words flying around the room. The kid's mom looks taken aback, but I don't care \u2013 I'm tired of people treating me like dirt and getting away with it.\n\nFinally, I take a deep breath and calm down long enough to write up a proper diagnosis and prescription for the kid. As he's leaving, he gives me this smug little smile like he knows he won't actually have to follow the treatment plan. Well, let's see about that, kid.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm working for a bunch of entitled, self-absorbed... Ugh, never mind. Just another day at the office, right?<|eot_id|>",

Instead, I'm over here feeling like a powder keg ready to blow at the slightest spark.\""
