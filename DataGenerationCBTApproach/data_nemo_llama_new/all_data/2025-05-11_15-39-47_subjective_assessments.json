Her husband had called earlier, revealing he'd been offered a job in another city, requiring them to relocate within the next six months. The thought of leaving behind their small apartment, friends, and the hospital she loved was suffocating. She felt like she was losing herself in the process, and the weight of it all was crushing.\n\nAs she began to organize the charts, her eyes landed on a photo of her and her husband from their wedding day, taken just a few weeks after she started working as a doctor. They were beaming with happiness, holding hands, and smiling at each other. A pang of sorrow hit her, and she couldn't help but wonder what their life would look like now if things hadn't changed.\n\nHer gaze drifted away from the photo, and her eyes welled up with tears as she continued to sort through the charts, the numbers and diagnoses blurring together as her mind wandered to the unknown future ahead.<|eot_id|>",

She had worked multiple jobs to support herself, but it was never enough. The memory of her ex-husband's careless spending, which left her struggling to pay bills, burned within her like a slow-burning fire.\n\nThe woman continued, oblivious to the worker's growing unease. \"I swear, some people have no concept of financial responsibility.\" Her tone turned snobbish, implying that anyone who couldn't afford luxury goods was somehow inferior.\n\nThe worker's hands tightened around the shopping bag, her knuckles white with suppressed anger. She forced a polite smile onto her face, all while wondering how this stranger could so callously dismiss the struggles of others. As the woman walked away, the worker felt a familiar itch of irritation spreading through her chest \u2013 a sensation she'd grown all too accustomed to since leaving her marriage.<|eot_id|>",
