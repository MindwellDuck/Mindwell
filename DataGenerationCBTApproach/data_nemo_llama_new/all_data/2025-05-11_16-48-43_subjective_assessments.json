Her mind kept drifting back to the argument she had with her husband last night \u2013 about money, about their future, about whether they'd ever be able to retire from this chaotic restaurant.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill and insistent, snapping her out of her trance. It was the bank, calling to inform her that their credit card had been declined due to insufficient funds. Again. She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach as she listened to the automated message, replaying the words like a cruel mantra: 'Please call us back during business hours.'\n\nHer eyes wandered to the worn wooden spoon leaning against the side of the sink, a tool that had helped her create countless meals for their family over the years. Now it seemed like a reminder of all the struggles still ahead, of the sacrifices they might have to make if things got any worse.<|eot_id|>",

It's been five years since that sunny day when we all believed in miracles, when hope was tangible in every word and gesture exchanged between us. Yet, here I am, left with nothing but a creased image and a worn-out folder to remind me of our failure.\n\nI scan the faces in the picture \u2013 John's parents, their smiles wide and eyes shining with unshed tears of joy, my former self standing proudly beside them, believing we had won the battle. It feels like a bitter joke now. Where did all that hope go? Why didn't it translate into reality?\n\nI can't help but think about how much more I could have done for John. The countless hours spent discussing treatment options with his parents seem trivial now compared to the stark reality of his death. I should have pushed harder for that clinical trial, been more persistent in my recommendations. But then again, what's the use of dwelling on such thoughts? It won't bring him back.\n\nAs I close the folder, I can't shake off this nagging feeling of responsibility. Yes, it was cancer \u2013 but couldn't we have done something differently?
