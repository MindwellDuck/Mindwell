It wasn't just any knock, no, it was Emma checking up on her, judging her. She knew it, like a stab in the back.\n\n\"Why now?\" she hissed at the door, \"When I'm like this?\" The emptiness of the canvas seemed to mock her, whispering Emma's thoughts aloud. \"She must think I'm pathetic,\" she thought, the words burning like acid on her tongue.\n\nEmma knocked again, louder this time, insistent. She was waiting for an explanation, wasn't she? Proof that her grandmother was still worth something. The trembling in her hands spread to her shoulders, her breath coming in short bursts now.\n\n\"What if I can't?\" she whispered to the canvas, to Emma, to everyone who'd ever doubted her. \"What if I really have lost it?\"\n\nShe wanted to open the door, but she couldn't move. It was all too raw, too real. She felt exposed, laid bare under Emma's unseen gaze. The knocking stopped, and silence filled the room like a heavy weight.\n\n\"She'll tell everyone,\" she thought, eyes welling up. \"She'll say I'm a failure.\" And wasn't that what she'd been thinking all along? That she was worthless now, just like he said?\n\nThe brush slipped from her fingers, landing on the floor with a soft thud. She didn't bend to pick it up. Instead, she sank down beside it, hugging her knees to her chest. It wasn't just about the painting anymore.
