He said he did, but I guess I missed it amidst all my worrying.*\n\n*He tried to kiss me hello, but I turned away. Not because I'm still mad or anything, just... I don't know.

She remembered the way he used to hold her hand, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled, and the way his voice sounded when he whispered sweet nothings in her ear.\n\nThe kitchen was quiet around her, except for the soft ticking of the clock on the wall. She hadn't cooked dinner yet; it wasn't like her anymore. Her husband had passed away six months ago, leaving a gaping hole in her life. Some days felt like an eternity since she'd last held him close.\n\nHer eyes wandered back to the photo, and she noticed something she hadn't seen before \u2013 a faint smudge on the corner of the frame.
