The kitchen had been quiet all morning, except for the occasional clang of pots and pans from the line cooks prepping for the lunch rush.\n\nAs he slid the pastry onto a wire rack to cool, the phone rang. He let it go to voicemail, assuming it was probably another inquiry about catering for a private event or a question about the menu. But when he picked up to check, he heard his wife's voice on the other end, her tone tight and worried.\n\n\"Hey, I'm running late. Traffic is a nightmare. And I just got into a fight with my sister over something stupid.\"\n\nThe words caught him off guard, and for a moment, his focus wavered. He felt a familiar knot tighten in his stomach as he thought about how this could affect their dinner plans tonight. They were supposed to try out a new recipe together, and now...<|eot_id|>",

He wasn't the one standing there like a human water feature.\n\n*This is why I hate these meetings,* she huffed inwardly, *one tiny slip and suddenly it's all about the stain, not the story.*\n\nShe forced a laugh, \"Oh, isn't this just perfect?\" She could feel her cheeks burning. *Of course they'd notice that too.* This was exactly how her life went - one embarrassing moment after another.\n\n*They probably think I'm some amateur who can't even handle a glass of water,* she stewed silently as she continued her presentation, *Well, screw them.

Its coffee stains, once mere blemishes on her dedication, now seemed like crimson flags waving in a stark landscape of failure. His mind refused to acknowledge the late nights they'd spent pouring over theories together, instead fixating on the deadline that had slipped by, unnoticed until it was too late.\n\nHis thoughts were a tangled web, each thread pulling taut with guilt and anxiety, yet all leading back to that one glaring mistake. The room seemed to shrink around him, the air growing thinner as his chest tightened in a vice-like grip. He couldn't see beyond the error, couldn't fathom how he could have let this happen.\n\nAnother soft knock at the door barely registered amidst the cacophony of his thoughts. Emily was out there, waiting for answers he didn't know how to give. Her problems, her struggles, they were all swallowed by the black hole of his fixation. He knew he should care, should reach out, but all he could do was stare at that one damning piece of data, unable to see anything else.\n\nThe room grew darker as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows that seemed to mock him with their fluidity and freedom. Henry remained rooted in his chair, a statue carved from guilt and desperation, blind to everything but the tiny imperfection that had somehow grown large enough to consume his world."
