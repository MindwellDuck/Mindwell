The way he spoke about her, with such reverence and love, made her stomach twist with a familiar ache.\n\nHer hands moved on autopilot, the knife slicing through the vegetables with precision. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing him, that no matter what she cooked, it wouldn't fill the void left by his mother's passing. A single tear rolled down her cheek, unnoticed by her husband as he took his first bite, his expression a mask of gratitude and appreciation.\n\nThe silence between them grew thicker, like a fog rolling in off the ocean, until finally, he reached across the table and took her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers in a gentle caress. \"I know,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator. \"I know you're trying.\"<|eot_id|>",

It was his sister, checking in to see how his week had gone. He hesitated, unsure if he wanted to talk about it, but something about her gentle tone put him at ease. As they chatted, he found himself opening up about the emptiness of his classroom on Fridays, and the feeling of being completely alone in his new life.\n\nHis sister listened attentively, offering words of comfort, but as they said their goodbyes, he couldn't shake off the crushing sense of loneliness that had settled in.
