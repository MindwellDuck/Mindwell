The store's fluorescent lights seemed to hum in sync with his growing unease.\n\nHis coworker, Sarah, approached him with a concerned expression. \"Hey, are you okay?

They were... well, they were as attentive as ever. *Sigh* If only I could bottle that enthusiasm and sell it back to them in twenty years' time.\n\nAll things considered, today was just another day at the office.
