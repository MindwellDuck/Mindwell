His wife had been encouraging him to take up photography as a hobby, but he'd never found the time. Today, as he rummaged through his art supplies, he stumbled upon an old sketchbook filled with his childhood drawings \u2013 vibrant, detailed, and full of life.\n\nA pang of guilt washed over him as he flipped through the pages, remembering all the times his parents had praised his creativity and encouraged him to pursue it. He hadn't drawn in years, and now his own family seemed to be moving forward without him. The thought sent a familiar knot twisting in his stomach. As he closed the sketchbook, his eyes drifted to the partially painted landscape on the wall, incomplete and still waiting for his touch.<|eot_id|>",
