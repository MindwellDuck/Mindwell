He thought about the countless meetings, the endless emails, the constant need to justify every step of his work. And now, when he finally had some free time, there were still these mundane, nagging tasks waiting for him.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed to amplify the sound of his own breathing, and for a moment, everything else faded away.
