The sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust motes dancing around the faded Polaroids. His eyes landed on a picture of him and his late wife, taken during their anniversary trip to Paris. They were smiling, arms wrapped around each other, and laughing.\n\nAs he gazed at the photo, he couldn't help but think about how many more years they would have spent together if she hadn't passed away. He remembered the argument they had the night before her surgery \u2013 he'd been so caught up in his work, and she'd felt like he wasn't there for her. Now, it all seemed so trivial.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the quiet morning. It was one of his colleagues from the company, asking him to meet with a new project manager. As he listened to the details, a pang of guilt hit him. He was being considered for a leadership role, something his late wife had always wanted for him. A mix of emotions swirled inside him: excitement, nervousness, and regret. What if he'd been able to spend more time with her, support her dreams? The thought sent a wave of remorse washing over him.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes darted back to the Paris photo, his wife's smile seeming to mock him now. \"Yeah, yeah, I know, honey. You'd be thrilled for me.\" He scoffed, leaning back in his chair. \"But you're not here, are you? And look where that got us - you gone, and me stuck in this... this...\" His hands gestured wildly around the kitchen, as if the very walls were conspiring against him.\n\nHe stood abruptly, the chair screeching loudly behind him. \"I don't have time for this,\" he grumbled, snatching up the photo and tucking it into his briefcase. \"They probably want me to interview that stuck-up new manager anyway. Just another know-it-all who thinks they can do better than me.\" He grabbed his coat, the fabric rustling like dry leaves. \"Well, let's see how well they manage without my expertise when I don't show up tomorrow,\" he huffed, slamming the front door behind him.\n\nAs he stormed down the street, his heart pounded with every step, echoing the inner monologue that screamed, \"It's all their fault. They're ruining everything!\" Despite the chill in the air, sweat beaded on his forehead. He didn't notice the admiring glances from passersby, or the way his colleagues always sought his guidance. To him, it was just another day of proof that everyone was out to get him."

The post was dated two weeks before their last meeting, which had been about wrapping up the project on time. A faint pang of guilt settled in the pit of his stomach as he realized he hadn't responded to the follow-up email since then.\n\nThe silence from his colleagues had grown thicker, a palpable reminder that they'd all moved on with their lives while he was stuck in this rut. His phone buzzed with a text from an old friend, inviting him to grab drinks after work \u2013 a gesture that felt like a gentle prod into a world he no longer knew how to navigate.\n\nIn the background, the hum of the office air conditioning and muffled chatter from coworkers created a sense of detachment, making it hard for him to distinguish between his own thoughts and the din around him.
