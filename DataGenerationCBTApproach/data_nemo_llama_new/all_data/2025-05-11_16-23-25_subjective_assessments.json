It had been six months since the call went out, but some days still felt like yesterday. As she made her way to her desk, she noticed a stack of files with a name she hadn't seen in years - Jenkins. The same department he worked in. Her hand instinctively reached for the pen on her desk, and she began to tidy up the papers, her mind replaying the words from the captain's briefing that morning.\n\n\"Killed in the line of duty,\" the captain had said, his voice firm but laced with a hint of sadness. She remembered how it sounded then, but now it echoed in her ears like a mantra. As she smoothed out a wrinkle on the file, her fingers brushed against a faded photograph of herself and him, taken during their last leave together. For a moment, she forgot where she was, lost in the memories they'd shared. The silence around her grew thicker, heavy with unspoken thoughts, until she looked up to see her partner watching her, concern etched on his face.<|eot_id|>",

Jenkins would've understood, we had that connection, man to man, no words needed.\n\nI swear I could hear him thinking, \"Still dwelling on it, huh?\" like he's some fuckin' mind reader. But he ain't got a clue. He doesn't feel the weight of those memories, not like I do. I don't need his goddamn pity or his judgment either.\n\nHe should know better than to underestimate me.
