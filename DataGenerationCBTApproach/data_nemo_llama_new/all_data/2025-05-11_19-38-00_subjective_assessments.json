As she realized her mistake, several younger players at the table began to snicker softly among themselves. One of them, a young professional, caught her eye and smiled condescendingly before turning back to his cards.\n\nAs the game continued, she found herself making mistake after mistake, each one more egregious than the last.

And don't even get me started on what happens when I can't afford groceries anymore. It's not like I can just snap my fingers and make dinner appear.\n\nI swear, if one more of these letters lands on my counter, I'm going to lose it. They act like they're doing me a favor by sending them, but really, it's just a daily dose of stress. And for what?
