His wife, sitting at the bar, watched him work, her eyes fixed on the presentation.\n\nAs he slid the plate onto the counter, she pushed back from the bar and stood up, her movements economical and controlled. He turned, expecting a nod or a comment about the dish, but instead she simply shook her head and said, 'I'm taking the kids to my sister's for dinner.'\n\nHe felt a flicker of disappointment, but pushed it down, focusing on the task at hand. She had been distant all day, preoccupied with something he couldn't quite put his finger on. Now, as he watched her turn to leave, he realized she wasn't even going to be home for dessert.\n\nThe kitchen seemed to grow quieter still, the only sound his own heavy breathing as he tried to process what was happening.<|eot_id|>",

He watched, plate poised mid-air, expecting her to comment on the arrangement of colours, the symmetry of the garnish. Instead, she announced, \"I'm taking the children to my sister's for dinner tonight.\" His brow furrowed involuntarily, a silent question mark hanging in the air. Didn't she like his cooking anymore? Or was this yet another sign that she found his culinary pursuits beneath her, now that she had taken up that cooking class? He felt a prickle of irritation, certain he could discern disdain in her tone. She didn't even wait for him to respond before turning on her heel and leaving, the echo of her words lingering like an unpleasant aftertaste. He couldn't shake off the feeling that she was deliberately avoiding his cooking tonight, a silent rebuke he couldn't quite decipher."

He thought about all the years of service, the cases solved, the lives saved \u2013 it wasn't enough anymore. The paperwork had piled up, and he'd been stuck in a dead-end desk job for months. \n\nHis mind wandered back to his partner, who'd retired five years ago. They'd worked together for over two decades, and now she was gone, leaving him feeling lost and without purpose. His phone buzzed with another unwanted email from the department, reminding him of his upcoming performance review.\n\nAs he gazed blankly into space, the calendar on the wall caught his eye. His birthday was coming up, and he couldn't remember the last time he celebrated it. He didn't have anyone to mark the occasion with, no family to call his own.

She probably thinks I'm lazy, that I've lost my edge since Maria retired. She doesn't understand that it's not like that at all.\n\nAnd his colleagues, they must be thinking the same thing too. They avoid him now, he could tell. He'd catch them whispering when he passed by their desks. They probably think I'm a washed-up has-been, ready to be thrown out with yesterday's trash. They don't know how hard it is without Maria, how lost he feels without her steady presence.\n\nHis mind raced as he tried to focus on the report in front of him, but it was useless. The words blurred into each other, mocking him. He could almost hear their jeers - \"Look at you now, Detective. All alone and forgotten.\" He slammed his fist on the table, startling himself. Get a grip, he told himself sternly. They don't know what you're going through, none of them do.\n\nHis phone buzzed again with another email from his boss. His heart pounded as he opened it, expecting the worst. But it was just a reminder for their meeting tomorrow about his performance review. She probably wants to discuss my 'improvement plan', he thought bitterly. He could feel her disapproval radiating off the screen, even though she'd only typed three words: \"Meeting room, 10 AM\". She doesn't get it, none of them do. They don't understand how hard I'm trying."
