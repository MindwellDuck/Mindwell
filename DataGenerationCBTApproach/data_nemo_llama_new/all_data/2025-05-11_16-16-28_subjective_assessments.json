The doctor forced a smile, trying to appear confident, but his eyes betrayed him. He fumbled over his words, struggling to think of a suitable response. For a moment, he wondered if anyone would even notice if he just told the truth \u2013 that his marriage had ended, and he was still reeling from the aftermath.\n\nThe patient left, and the doctor was left alone with his thoughts once again. He rubbed his tired eyes, feeling the weight of his responsibilities as a single father bearing down on him. The loneliness crept in, like a slow-moving fog, seeping into every pore of his being. He knew he needed to push through, but it was hard to find the strength when all he wanted to do was retreat into himself.<|eot_id|>",
