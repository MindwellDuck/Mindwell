His phone buzzed with a text from his girlfriend, asking when he'd be home for dinner. He hadn't replied yet.\n\nAs he scrolled through the report, he noticed a photo of a young couple huddled together under a cardboard shelter, their eyes vacant and hopeless. The caption mentioned they had been living on the streets for months, despite having multiple family members who knew about their situation.\n\nThe image stuck with him long after he closed the laptop. He found himself thinking about his own relationship, wondering if they were truly connected or just going through the motions. The city's struggles seemed to mirror his own feelings of disconnection and emptiness.\n\nAs he packed up his things to leave, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was just scratching the surface of the real issues, like the ones those two people in the photo faced every day. He wondered if anyone really cared, or if it was all just noise.<|eot_id|>",

Mike's chuckle echoed in her mind, a soundtrack to her embarrassment.\n\nHer hands tightened around her coffee cup, now cold and untouched. *I can't do this,* she thought, her stomach churning with dread. *Tomorrow, he'll bring it up again. Laugh about it. They all will.* She could see it now, clear as day: Mike's grin, the sniggers from the others, her own face burning redder than a stop sign.\n\n*I won't be able to stand it,* she thought, her pace quickening. *Every roll call, every shift, it'll be there. The laughter, the stares.* She could feel the panic rising, her breath hitching in her throat. *I can't face that. I can't.*\n\nShe rounded a corner, putting more distance between herself and the station. But the dread stayed, a shadow she couldn't shake off. She knew it was coming, could predict it with an eerie certainty. And just like every other time she'd felt this way, she knew she wouldn't be able to handle it when it did."

He could practically see himself, six months from now, still stuck in this same rut, his career circling the drain, his family resentful and distant.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he muttered again, rubbing his temples.
