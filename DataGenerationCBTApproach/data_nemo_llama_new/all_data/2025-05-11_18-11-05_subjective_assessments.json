No need to rush, after all. Inside was a single sheet of paper, typed in neat, precise lines.\n\n*Dear Neighbor,* it began, *I've noticed your trash cans are often left out on collection day. It's really not that difficult to put them away afterward.*\n\nHis heart sank as he read the words. He felt the heat rise in his cheeks, anger mixing with embarrassment. How could they think this of him? Didn't they know how hard he worked, how much he cared about keeping their little community clean and tidy?\n\nHe crumpled the letter in his fist, standing up so abruptly that his chair screeched against the floor. \"Who does she think she is?\" he muttered to himself, pacing around the kitchen like a caged animal.\n\nHis mind raced, filling in the blanks with ease. He knew exactly who it was - Mrs. Thompson from down the street, always so prim and proper, looking down her nose at everyone else's shortcomings. She probably sat there all day, watching his house through those lacy curtains of hers, waiting for him to slip up.\n\nHe could just imagine her now, smug smile on her face as she thought about how she'd finally caught him making a mistake. Well, he wouldn't give her the satisfaction. He would show them all that he was better than this. From now on, he'd make sure his trash cans were put away every single day, no matter what.\n\nAs he stormed out to the garage to retrieve the offending bins, he didn't notice the other letters tucked away inside the envelope - a stack of them, each one detailing some minor infraction or another, all from different people in the neighborhood."
