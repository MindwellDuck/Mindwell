The sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink \u2013 a daily reminder of nature's beauty that somehow felt hollow tonight.\n\nI watched as the city lights began to flicker on one by one, like tiny stars being born right before my eyes. It was supposed to be comforting, this routine, but not today. Today, everything felt... off.\n\nMy mind kept snapping back to Mrs. Thompson, her wrinkled hands trembling as she gripped mine, her eyes welling up with unshed tears. \"You're a good nurse,\" she'd whispered before they wheeled her away. I wanted to scream at them, to demand that they bring her back, but what was the point? It wasn't like they were going to reverse their decision just because some junior nurse made a scene.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the lingering sadness.

I couldn't help but think about all those other patients, all those faces I'd grown accustomed to seeing every shift \u2013 would they end up like Mrs. Thompson too?
