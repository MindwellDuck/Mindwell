He had been acting distant all day, and she couldn't shake the feeling that he might be seeing someone else.\n\nJust then, a server walked by and whispered something in her ear about Alex being there already, sipping on a drink at the bar.

I knew every inch of this piece, its strengths, its weaknesses. And while it was beautiful, it wasn't perfect. The grain here was too coarse, the finish there a shade too dark.\n\nI cleared my throat, pushing away from the bench. \"It's just another bookshelf, Martha,\" I said, my voice gruff. \"Nothing special.\"\n\nShe blinked, taken aback by my dismissive tone.
