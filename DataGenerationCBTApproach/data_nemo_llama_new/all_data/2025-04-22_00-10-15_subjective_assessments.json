I'm cooking up a storm today, just like I always did when we were together. \n\nHer favorite dish, the one she'd always beg me to make for her birthday, sits on the counter untouched. The recipe's still scribbled on the same old card, her handwriting all over it like a fingerprint. I can almost smell the bouquet garni she loved so much.\n\nI start chopping the onions, my hands moving on autopilot as my mind replays every argument we had about this exact dish. She said it was too spicy, I said it wasn't spicy enough. We went back and forth until...until...\n\nUntil she walked out of my life. Left me here with nothing but these two empty chairs at the table. And now, to make matters worse, her brother comes walking in, ordering his usual, never asking if I want anything. Thinks he can just waltz in here and expect me to fawn all over him because of what our family's lost.\n\nHe takes a seat at the counter, smirking at me as if he knows some secret. 'Hey, chef,' he says, his voice dripping with condescension. 'Still got your magic touch?' Magic touch? Does he know how hard I've been working, day and night, trying to keep this kitchen running?\n\nI slam the knife down onto the cutting board, making us both jump. 'What do you want?' I growl, trying to keep my cool. But inside, I'm seething. Seething like the soup I used to make for her, simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over.\n\n'Just thought I'd drop by and say hi,' he says, oblivious to the storm brewing inside me. Hi? To who? Not to me, that's for sure. Never has, never will. He gets up, leaving me with this lingering sense of resentment, like a bad sauce that refuses to clear.<|eot_id|>",

He dropped his keys on the counter and said, 'Morning.'\n\nSarah turned around, a smile plastered on her face. 'Good morning, handsome! I made pancakes.'\n\n'Pancakes?' he repeated, raising an eyebrow. 'Can't you see I'm still trying to wake up?'\n\nShe chuckled. 'You're always like this in the morning. Can't handle a little bit of sunshine and pancakes?'\n\nHe snorted. 'Sunshine? Are you kidding me? This place is always a mess. And what's with all these toys everywhere?'\n\nSarah's expression changed from amused to annoyed. 'Hey, our kid has toys. What did you expect?'\n\n'Toys everywhere? That's exactly what I expected. But do you ever clean up after him? It's like you just leave it all scattered around.'\n\nSarah's voice rose. 'That's not fair. I clean up after him every day.'\n\nHe crossed his arms. 'Every day? Really? Because it looks like it's been weeks since I've seen a clean floor.'\n\n'Fine,' she snapped. 'If you're so concerned about cleanliness, why don't you help out more?'\n\nHe threw up his hands. 'I do help out. I work long hours, remember? You're always on my case about something.'\n\nSarah's eyes flashed. 'Maybe if you spent more time at home taking care of our family instead of gallivanting off to work, things would be different.'\n\nHis anger boiled over. 'Excuse me? Gallivanting? You have no idea what I do or how hard I work.'\n\nThe air was thick with tension as they stood there, locked in a silent stare-down.

Today, it seemed, she hadn't even made an effort.\n\nHis gaze fell on the scattered toys, the remnants of yesterday's playtime still strewn across the floor. Either she cleaned up after their son, or she was a negligent mother. There was no in-between, no 'sometimes'. He felt his anger rise like bile in his throat.\n\nHe looked at Sarah, her face flushed with annoyance. She was either supportive and understanding, or selfish and unreasonable. Today, she was the latter. Her words stung like a whip, \"Gallivanting.\" It was either dedication to his job or abandoning his family. No middle ground.\n\nThe tension in the room was suffocating, a silent battle of extremes. He felt the familiar pang of unfairness, the world divided into black and white, with no room for gray. His hands clenched around the mug, knuckles turning white. \"Either,\" he thought bitterly, \"it's always either.\""

The victim's family had never forgiven her, and neither had she herself. She couldn't shake the feeling that if she could go back, she would've done things differently.\n\nJust then, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. Rachel sighed, picking up the receiver.

He didn't remember the ease with which they'd talked that night, like old friends catching up after years apart. No, all he could focus on was the crowd at this new bar downtown, the noise, the chaos.\n\n\"I'm not antisocial,\" he insisted, his voice taking on an edge of defensiveness. \"I just...

He didn't notice the way the streetlights cast long shadows over the empty streets, or how the snowflakes began to fall gently as he pulled up outside the bar.

He'd arrived early, something he never did. But instead of feeling relieved, he felt his anxiety spike. He clung to one detail - her tardiness - and let it overshadow everything else.
