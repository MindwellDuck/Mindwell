He felt it then, that familiar sensation of being pinned down by a label, one he'd worn before but never quite gotten used to.\n\nHe wasn't just angry now; he was something else entirely. Something darker, more consuming. He felt marked, branded by those words. They'd cut through the veil of his professionalism, exposing the raw nerve beneath. It was as if all his past critics had coalesced into one voice, shouting their condemnation at him from behind a blank screen.\n\nHis fingers hovered over the keys, unable to form coherent thoughts into sentences. He was no longer just writing an article; he was fighting off ghosts of criticisms past. Each keystroke felt like a battle cry, each paragraph a defense against that label that threatened to swallow him whole. \"Objectivity,\" his editor had said. But how could he be objective when he felt so personally attacked?\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm within. But it was no use; those words were etched into his mind now, a scarlet letter burned onto his psyche. He couldn't shake off the feeling that maybe, just maybe, they were right. Maybe he wasn't as objective as he thought. Maybe he was worse than 'them.'
