She wasn't some rookie hack, yet here she was, reduced to this. It was black and white now - she was either a credible journalist or a laughing stock. There was no in-between, not for someone like her who'd built her career on tough, unyielding truths.\n\nTears welled up again, but she blinked them back. She wouldn't cry over spilled ink. Either she could write something that would redeem her, or she couldn't. There was no trying, no learning curve here. It was all or nothing, and the weight of that was crushing. Her partner's words rang in her ears - \"I thought you were better than that\" - a stark judgment that left no room for nuance.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself. She wouldn't just write this story; she'd nail it. There could be no middle ground, no shades of gray. It was time to prove herself, once and for all."
