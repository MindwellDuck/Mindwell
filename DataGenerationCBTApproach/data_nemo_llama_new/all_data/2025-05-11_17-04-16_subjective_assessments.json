His wife had passed away six months ago, leaving him to manage their household finances alone. As he sorted through the envelopes, one letter caught his eye \u2013 a notice from the hospital where he worked, informing him that they would be furloughing staff due to lack of funds.\n\nThe doctor felt a knot form in his stomach as he thought about the patients who would suffer because of this decision. He couldn't shake the memory of his wife's frail body, lying in the same hospital bed just a few years prior. Now, it seemed like the very institution she'd trusted her life to was abandoning its own people.\n\nHe slumped against the counter, the weight of his responsibility crushing him. The sound of his own ragged breathing filled the silence, as he wondered how he would make ends meet, let alone keep his practice afloat.<|eot_id|>",

He'd been burying himself in work since she passed, but now even that was being snatched away from him. The hospital had always been his sanctuary, his lifeline - and now it felt like they were pulling the plug on him too.\n\nHe picked up one of the unpaid bills, scanning the figure with a grimace. It was just another reminder of her illness, another slap in the face from fate. Every number seemed to scream at him, accusing him of not doing enough when she needed him most. He'd been so focused on her care that he'd let everything else slide - and now they were paying the price.\n\nHe ran a hand through his thinning hair, sighing heavily. \"How am I supposed to keep this place afloat with one less salary?\" he asked the empty room. He couldn't remember the last time they'd had a proper meal at home, or when he'd actually slept through the night without waking up in a cold sweat, his mind racing with worries about money and patients.\n\nHe looked around the kitchen, taking in the faded wallpaper, the stained countertops, the dust bunnies gathering in the corners. It was like they were slowly being swallowed by decay, just as her body had been consumed by illness. He couldn't see any positives in this situation - only endless worry and struggle."
