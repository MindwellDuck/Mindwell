The faint scent of his cologne wafted from the armchair where he sat, but it brought no comfort. \n\nAs she watched him pause beside a faded picture of their children when they were young, his eyes misting over, she felt a pang in her chest. She remembered those carefree days, the laughter, and the countless hours spent playing with their kids. Now, her daughter was living thousands of miles away, and her son had passed away a decade ago.\n\nThe silence between them grew heavier, punctuated only by the soft ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway. Her husband set down the photograph, and his gaze drifted toward her, searching for a connection. But she couldn't meet his eyes, her heart heavy with regret and longing for something lost long ago.<|eot_id|>",
