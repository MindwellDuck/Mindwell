She hadn't expected him home this early; his late nights had become almost routine lately.\n\nPouring herself a glass of water, she felt her hands tremble slightly, betraying her unease. He caught her eye and smiled, but it was fleeting, already drifting back to his conversation. It's just small talk, she told herself, trying to convince her racing heart to slow down. But then he glanced at his phone, hiding it behind his back when he thought she wasn't looking. What could be so important that it needed hiding?\n\nThe scent of perfume wafted towards her, faint but unmistakable. It clung to him, a foreign presence on his sleeve where he'd touched someone else's hand earlier that morning. Not me, she thought, feeling a pang in her chest. Why wasn't it mine? She shook the thought away, focusing instead on the warmth in their daughter-in-law's smile as she turned towards her.

Their smiles were like a reproach, a stark contrast to his own weary countenance etched with lines of exhaustion and worry. It was as if they existed in one realm, untouched by the grim reality that had become his world.\n\nHe tried to push away the thought that haunted him like a relentless specter - \"If only I had been there for them.\" The binary nature of his thoughts refused to yield, locking him into an agonizing either/or scenario. Either he was a devoted son who could have saved his parents, or he was an abandoning one who had left them to their fate.\n\nThe anniversary loomed before him like a guillotine, threatening to sever the fragile threads of his composure. He felt the familiar knot tightening in his stomach, worry morphing into guilt and then spiraling back into worry again. There was no escape from this cyclical torment, no reprieve from the all-or-nothing thinking that had become his prison."
