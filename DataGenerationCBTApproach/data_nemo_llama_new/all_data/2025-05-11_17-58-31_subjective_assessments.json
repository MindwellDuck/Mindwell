A clear liquid spilled across the counter, mixing with the antiseptic solution and forming a murky puddle. The team's lead researcher turned to her, concern etched on his face.\n\n\"It's okay, let me help you,\" he said, but she shook him off, already imagining the presentation's demise.

They're really fucking shaking. I'm trying to set up our equipment, but it's like my fingers have a mind of their own. And my breath? It's all over the place, like I've just run a bloody marathon when I haven't even moved from this spot.\n\nI can't stop thinking about what ifs, diary. What if the serum doesn't work? What if we've been fooling ourselves all along? And then there are the side effects... Christ, what if it makes people worse instead of better? My stomach churns just thinking about it.\n\nAnd then, as if on cue, one of the fucking dishes slips from my grasp. It shatters on the floor, and our serum mixes with the antiseptic solution, turning into this murky puddle that looks like a bad omen. I can't help but think that this is a sign. A fucking sign that today's presentation will be an epic fail.\n\nI know, diary, I know. I'm overthinking again. But how do you not when there's so much at stake? It's not just about me or the team. This could change lives. And what if... what if we screw it up?\n\nMy heart's pounding now, diary. Like a fucking drum in my ears. I can't stand this feeling. I can't stand the thought of letting everyone down. But isn't that exactly what's going to happen? Isn't that why my hands are shaking and my breath is ragged?\n\nI just want today to be over. I want tomorrow to come, so I can stop predicting these fucking disasters in my head.\n\n---"
