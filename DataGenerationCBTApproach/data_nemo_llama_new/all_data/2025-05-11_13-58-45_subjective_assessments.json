I walked into the staff room today, coffee in hand, and there it was - Rachel's name plastered on the itinerary board as the 'Teacher of Choice' for our upcoming trip. Our trip! We've been planning this together for months. I've spent countless nights drafting schedules, coordinating logistics, even securing discounts with local vendors. Yet, here I am, invisible.\n\nI tried to contribute during our discussion, but it was like talking to a brick wall. Each suggestion from others was met with nods and praise, while mine were either ignored or dismissed. Rachel didn't even have the decency to look guilty when she announced her 'appointment' as trip leader. Her smile was too smug, her eyes too cold.\n\nI know I should be happy for her, but how can I? All I see are my sleepless nights, my endless efforts, disappearing into a black hole of indifference. I'm not jealous; I just want what's due to me. But even that seems too much to ask.\n\nI tried to keep my composure, but my grip on the coffee cup betrayed me. My knuckles were white, straining against the thin porcelain. It was like holding onto a lifeboat in a storm, trying desperately not to be swept away by the waves of injustice crashing around me.\n\nBut no one noticed. No one cared. And that's what hurts the most. I'm just another face in the crowd, another voice lost in the din. I deserve better, don't I? Or am I just fooling myself?\n\nI should get some rest now. Tomorrow's another day of being invisible. But who knows? Maybe tomorrow will be different. Maybe tomorrow, they'll see me.\n\nUntil then,\n\n[Your Name]"
