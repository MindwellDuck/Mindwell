It had been three days since the call came \u2013 a young officer, barely out of training, lost his life on duty. The quiet hum of the fluorescent lights above seemed to grow louder, echoing through her mind like the sound of her own heartbeat.\n\nAs she made her way to her desk, a photo caught her eye \u2013 a snapshot from her wedding day, taken by her late husband, back when their children were still young. She smiled faintly, remembering the joy and love they shared. But now, it felt bittersweet, a reminder of all she'd lost.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, her hand trembling slightly as she answered. \" Dispatch.\" Her voice was firm, but the words felt hollow, lacking the conviction they once had.\n\n\"Officer, we need you to respond to a domestic dispute at 345 Elm Street,\" the dispatcher said, her tone neutral. \n\nAs A walked out of the station house, the crisp morning air hit her like a slap in the face. The world outside seemed too bright, too loud, and too cruel. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead.<|eot_id|>",

The world was supposed to be quiet at this hour, respectful of her grief. Instead, it was noisy, disrespectful, indifferent.\n\nThe call had come in while she was still half-asleep, the dispatcher's voice intruding on her dreams like an unwelcome guest. \"Another domestic,\" he'd said, as if that made it any better. She should have been able to mourn her colleague in peace, not rushing out to deal with someone else's mess.\n\nShe took a sharp turn onto Elm Street, tires screeching against the damp asphalt. The house was supposed to look different, marked by some visible sign of the chaos within. But it just looked like any other house on the block, quiet and unassuming. It should have been ashamed, she thought bitterly.\n\nAs she got out of the car, her radio crackled to life, \"Officer A, status?\" The question was supposed to be routine, but it grated on her nerves. She should have already been inside, shouldn't she? Instead, she was standing here, wasting time.\n\nShe stormed up to the door, knocking harder than necessary. This was all wrong. It shouldn't be happening. Not today, not ever. But it was, and she was supposed to fix it. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what was inside. \"Police!\" she called out, her voice echoing through the empty house like a curse."

Meanwhile, his own work would be tucked away in some dark corner, gathering cobwebs like an unwanted guest.\n\n\"Probably just a bunch of overrated fluff,\" he grumbled, but even as the words left his mouth, he knew they rang hollow. He'd seen Thompson's latest pieces - the raw power, the emotional depth.
