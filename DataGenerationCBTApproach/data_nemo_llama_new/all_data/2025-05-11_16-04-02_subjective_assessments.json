He hadn't even thought about it until now, and suddenly felt a pang of guilt for not having given her the time she deserved before she passed away.\n\nHis gaze drifted to the empty chair beside him, where she used to sit during breakfast, sharing stories and laughter as they sipped their coffee together. The silence was oppressive, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd been neglecting his own life, too caught up in work to find meaning in the moments that truly mattered.\n\nThe sound of the office around him \u2013 keyboards clacking, printers humming \u2013 seemed muffled, distant, as if he were still trapped in a dream, unable to wake up and face the reality of his situation.<|eot_id|>",

They'd been arguing about their future, and in the heat of the moment, he'd said something that had cut deep.\n\nNow, standing amidst the chaos of her studio, surrounded by half-finished canvases and scattered paint tubes, she felt a familiar pang of guilt. She thought about how she'd promised herself she wouldn't get involved again, but the memories of him lingered, and she couldn't help but wonder if she was somehow responsible for his departure.\n\nThe phone on her desk rang, shrill in the silence. She hesitated before answering, her heart sinking as she heard his voice on the other end.
