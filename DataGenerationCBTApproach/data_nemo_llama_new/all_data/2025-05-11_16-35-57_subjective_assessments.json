His gaze drifted over the neat rows of photos on the cover - happy families, smiling kids, vacations that didn't involve him.\n\nHe pulled it out, flipping through pages filled with others' lives.

He slammed the album shut, shoving it back onto the shelf with more force than necessary.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" he muttered, turning back to his desk. \"You're all doing so much better without me.\" His voice dripped with sarcasm, but there was an undercurrent of bitter truth in his words. He shook his head, picking up the nearest bill. \"At least I've got this mess to keep me company,\" he grumbled, tackling the stack with renewed vigor - or perhaps it was desperation."

Her partner, John, had been sitting beside her moments before, offering words of comfort, but his voice was muffled by the television playing softly in the background.\n\nAs she gazed at the smiling faces of colleagues from years past, a pang struck her chest, reminiscent of a familiar ache. It had been six months since her sister passed away, and yet the pain still felt like an open wound. She remembered the countless hours they spent discussing their shared passion for journalism, the late-night conversations over cups of tea, and the laughter that echoed through their small apartment.\n\nHer eyes wandered to the empty space where her sister used to sit, now occupied by John's gentle hand resting on her own.

My fingers trace the edge of my keyboard, hesitating over each key as if they too are reluctant to bear witness to this task.\n\nThe photograph of us together at her graduation smiles up at me from atop the desk, her eyes sparkling with joy and ambition. It feels like a reproach now, an accusation that I haven't yet done justice to her memory. Each time I look at it, the ache in my chest grows more insistent, demanding to be acknowledged, craving release through tears or words - preferably both.\n\nI believe my emotions are telling me something clear and unmistakable: I am not ready for this. They scream at me from every corner of this room, whispering doubts into my ear like a chorus of spectral voices. \"You can't do this,\" they murmur. \"You'll never be able to capture her spirit on paper.\" And so, I find myself paralyzed, unable to begin, because how could anyone possibly expect me to put aside my grief and write about someone who was everything to me?\n\nYet, here I sit, surrounded by the ghosts of our shared past, trying desperately to convince myself that it's not an impossible feat.
