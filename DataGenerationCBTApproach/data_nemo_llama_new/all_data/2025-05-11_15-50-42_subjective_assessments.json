As she wrote on the board, her mind wandered back to a conversation she'd had with her partner the night before. He'd mentioned how proud he was of her work as a teacher, but also expressed concern about her long hours and dedication to the profession.\n\nAs she started the demonstration, she noticed a student struggling to keep up. Without thinking, she walked over to help, momentarily forgetting the lesson plan and the eyes watching from the back of the room. A pang of guilt hit her \u2013 wasn't she already overcommitting herself? Shouldn't she be prioritizing their relationship now?\n\nThe student's question interrupted her thoughts, and she snapped back to attention. She smiled and answered, but couldn't shake off the feeling that she was neglecting both her career and her loved one. The rest of the class seemed to pass in a blur as she replayed the conversation in her head, wondering what it would mean if she quit teaching to spend more time with him.<|eot_id|>",

It broke me to see him like this.\n\nWithout a second thought, I walked over to guide him through it. The class faded away as I focused solely on Thomas, whispering encouragement and hints until he grasped the concept. As I stepped back, I caught sight of old Mrs. Hartley at the back, her eyes narrowing. She must be thinking, 'Typical, prioritizing one student over the rest.' But she doesn't understand \u2013 I can't just ignore Thomas when he's clearly struggling.\n\nThe pang of guilt hit me again as I turned back to the board. Was Mrs. Hartley right?
