When the principal finally concluded, her husband offered a reassuring smile and a gentle touch on the arm, but she could sense his discomfort too, and it only made things worse.<|eot_id|>",

Rachel seemed nonchalant, almost amused by this development.\n\nThe conversation shifted to discussing the upcoming hospital gala, where Emily was scheduled to attend as a guest.

The colors were good, she thought. But perhaps he'd see it differently. Perhaps he'd find fault in her technique again.
