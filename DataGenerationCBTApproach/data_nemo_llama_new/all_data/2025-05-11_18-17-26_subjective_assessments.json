He couldn't help but think, *Of course she's happy now.* She had moved on so quickly, while he was still stuck here, in this empty apartment, surrounded by echoes of a life that no longer existed.\n\nHe sighed, crumpling the paper in his fist. He didn't need to read any further to know what her life was like now. He could see it all, as clear as day. She'd found someone who made her laugh more than he ever did, someone who listened to her dreams and actually helped make them come true.\n\nHe turned away from the table, his mind already made up. *She's happy without me,* he thought, *and I'm just... alone.*"

It was like a neon sign flashing in my face, blinding me to anything else. The way her lips curved up, so confident, so self-assured... it was as if she didn't have a care in the world, let alone the weight of our shared past. I couldn't understand how she could stand there, acting like nothing had happened, like she hadn't played a part in tearing apart everything I held dear back then. It was maddening, that smile. It consumed my vision, my thoughts, my very breath. Everything else - the chatter of students, the hum of cars, even the warmth of the sun on my skin - it all faded into insignificance. All I could do was stare at that smile, feeling the anger rise like bile in my throat. How dare she? How dare she stand there, smiling like that, when she knew what she'd done?"

Here we go again, I thought. Another whole meal ruined by my incompetence. The entire dinner will be a disaster because of me.
