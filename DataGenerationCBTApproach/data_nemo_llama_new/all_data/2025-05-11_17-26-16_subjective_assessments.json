As she waited in line, she noticed another nurse, Rachel, effortlessly chatting with a group of colleagues while simultaneously juggling her lunch and taking notes from a patient's chart.\n\nThe woman felt a twinge of irritation as she watched Rachel effortlessly switch between tasks, seemingly unaware of the chaos around her. When it was finally her turn to order, she stumbled over her words, spilling coffee all over the counter as she tried to hand over her payment. \n\nA young nurse, eager to help, jumped in to assist her, expertly cleaning up the spill while apologizing profusely. The woman couldn't help but notice the way everyone else seemed to know what they were doing, except for her \u2013 again. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of frustration, but as she turned to leave, she caught Rachel smiling and nodding at her, as if to say 'you're okay.' The woman's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, the sting of resentment lingering beneath her polite smile.<|eot_id|>",

As she poured herself another cup, her mind began to wander to the upcoming hospital meeting where she'd have to discuss the budget cuts affecting her department.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to her late husband, who had always been supportive of her work. She recalled how he'd often asked about her patients and listened intently when she shared stories about them. A pang of worry crept up as she wondered if she was doing enough to ensure their legacy lived on \u2013 not just in her practice, but also in her own well-being.\n\nAs she set the cup down, her gaze fell upon a photo of her husband, taken on their anniversary three years ago. It was an ordinary moment, yet it seemed like a lifetime ago. The memory sparked a flurry of anxious thoughts: What would he say if he were here now? Would he be proud of the decisions she'd made? Should she be taking on more debt to keep the practice afloat?<|eot_id|>",

She hadn't looked at it in months, but something about its faded edges and worn corners caught her attention now. A wave of memories washed over her \u2013 laughter, inside jokes, late-night conversations.\n\nThe paint-splattered smock draped across her chair seemed to mock her, a constant reminder of the creative energy she once drew upon. Now, it felt like a burden, a symbol of her stagnation.

It was all their fault \u2013 his abandonment, the canvas's silence, even the stupid air conditioner humming its judgmental tune. They were all conspiring against her, telling her she wasn't good enough anymore.\n\nHer hands trembled as she reached for the brush again. She knew what they wanted, what he wanted. He thought she was weak, that she couldn't handle it on her own. But she would show them. She wouldn't give in to this...this stagnation. She would paint something beautiful, something that would make him regret leaving.\n\nBut the canvas remained blank, mocking her. It knew too. It knew all about her failures, her fears, her loneliness. And it wasn't going to let her win. She felt a scream building inside her, threatening to explode. She couldn't take this anymore. She just wanted...she wanted him back. She wanted him to understand, to help her, to save her from this suffocating silence.\n\nShe dropped the brush with a clatter, turning away from the canvas in disgust.

But none of them were glowing successes. None of them said, \"Here's a student who thrived under your care.\" It was like I'd been pouring my heart into this job for nothing.\n\nAnd then there was yesterday's conversation with Victoria, my ex-husband's new wife. She had the nerve to suggest that he was still 'getting over' our loss. As if we could ever truly get over it. As if we hadn't both lost pieces of ourselves that day. I'd tried to hold us together then, and I was trying now \u2013 but what did it matter? Nothing seemed to change.\n\nI sighed, closing Jamie's file and stacking it neatly with the others.
