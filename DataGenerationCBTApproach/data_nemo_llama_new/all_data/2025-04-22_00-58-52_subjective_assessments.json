The words \"regret to inform you\" leaped out at me like an accusation. I didn't even need to read further; I knew instantly that they had rejected my application. My mind raced ahead, filling in the gaps with my own assumptions.\n\nI could see it now: them laughing around the table, dismissing my years of hard work with a wave of their hands. \"Too old,\" one of them might have said, echoing my ex-husband's cruel words. \"Not innovative enough,\" another would chime in.\n\nMy thoughts spiraled downward, painting vivid scenes of rejection and ridicule.

A sense of detachment washed over her as she observed their laughter and camaraderie.\n\nOne of them caught her eye - a young woman, probably in her early twenties, with a bright smile and a messy bun. She looked familiar, but the name eluded her. The woman's eyes sparkled as she held up a freshly pruned rose, admiring its beauty.\n\nFor a moment, something inside her shifted.

Her gaze lingered on the young woman, and for an instant, she felt a pang of...of what? Not sadness, exactly, but something akin to it.\n\nThe feeling dissipated as quickly as it appeared, leaving her with a hollow sensation in her chest.

He'd been checking it every five minutes since she'd mentioned her trip yesterday. \"Just want to wish you a happy holiday,\" he muttered under his breath, trying to convince himself that was the only reason he was obsessing over her inbox.\n\nHis coffee grew cold beside him as he scrolled through Rachel's old emails, looking for any clues about this mysterious 'couple'. He found nothing but work-related conversations and occasional jokes with other colleagues. But why did she have to keep mentioning how amazing her partner was? Didn't she realize how it made him feel?\n\nJohn sighed, rubbing his temples. He knew he shouldn't be so worked up over this. It wasn't like Rachel owed him anything. Yet, here he was, feeling sorry for himself because she had someone special in her life while he was still stuck here, alone.\n\nHis manager walked past, casting a curious glance at John's screen. \"Everything alright?\" he asked.\n\nJohn quickly minimized the window, feigning a smile. \"Yeah, just... waiting for Rachel to send me some files.\" His heart pounded in his chest as if he'd been caught doing something wrong. Which was ridiculous, right? It wasn't like he was actually invading her privacy or anything. He was just... concerned about her wellbeing.\n\nHe shook his head, turning back to his monitor. This was stupid. Rachel could do whatever she wanted with whomever she wanted. But still, that tiny voice in the back of his mind whispered, \"What if?\" And John found himself once again caught up in its web of uncertainty and doubt."

And what do I get in return? A paltry sum that barely covers their administrative costs!\"\n\nHis wife tried to calm him down, but he wasn't having it. \"No, no, no! This is ridiculous! I'm 64 years old, and I still can't afford to retire because of these exorbitant fees. It's like they think I'm made of money or something!\"\n\nHe paced back and forth across the kitchen, his anger escalating by the minute. His wife watched him, feeling helpless, as he continued to rant and rave about the injustice of it all.\n\nFinally, after several minutes of tirade, he stopped pacing and turned to her, his chest heaving with exertion. \"You know what? Forget the retrospective. Forget the fees. I don't even want to show my art anymore.\"<|eot_id|>",
