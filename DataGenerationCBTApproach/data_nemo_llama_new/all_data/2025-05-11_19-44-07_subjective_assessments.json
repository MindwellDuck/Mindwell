Every post, every picture, every story - it was as if the world had conspired to rub salt into my wounds. It's either you're blissfully happy, or you're wallowing in misery. There is no middle ground.\n\nI see them all, laughing, loving, living their lives without a care in the world. And here I am, stuck in this endless void of longing and loneliness. It's as if I've been cast into the depths of despair while everyone else dances on clouds of ecstasy.\n\nThey don't understand. They can't. How could they? To them, life is just one big romantic comedy. But for me, it's a tragedy. A never-ending, soul-crushing tragedy. It's either you're madly in love, or you're utterly alone. There's no room for anything else.\n\nI'm not asking for much. Just a moment of understanding, a glimmer of empathy. But no, they're too busy celebrating their perfect lives to notice mine is crumbling around me. It's either you're part of the party, or you're left out in the cold. And right now, I'm frozen solid.\n\nI won't pretend to be happy when my heart aches with every beat. I won't smile through the pain just because it's expected of me. This is my reality - an endless sea of black and white, with no shades of gray. It's either I drown in my sorrow, or I fight like hell to keep my head above water. But today, I'm tired of fighting.
