His latest exhibit has bombed, another rejection from a gallery that once showed promise. The phone hasn't stopped ringing since morning, but every call is just another reminder \u2013 another artist trying to sell his work, another critic dissecting his failures.\n\nAs he wipes his brush across the still-wet paint, the strokes feel clumsy, like he's trying to erase the mistakes rather than build upon them. He thinks about quitting, walking away from the art that's been his entire life. But what would he do then? The thought sends a familiar ache through his chest, one he's grown accustomed to over the years. He looks out the window, watching as people walk by, their faces blurred together in a never-ending stream. For a moment, he feels lost among them, invisible.<|eot_id|>",

But when he looked at it now, all he could see were the streaks where the paint had bled, the lines that weren't quite straight, the shadows that didn't quite fall right. He'd had compliments before, other artists and patrons alike telling him they saw something special in his work. But those were just words, weren't they? They didn't mean anything when faced with the cold reality of another rejection.\n\nHe picked up a brush, dipped it into some leftover paint on his palette. It was a deep, rich blue, almost black, like the nights he couldn't sleep for thinking about all the things he hadn't done right. His hand moved automatically, adding stroke after stroke to the canvas. It wasn't good enough, none of it was. He could hear their voices in his head, the critics and the gallery owners, telling him his work was derivative, unoriginal, not worth their time.\n\nBut then there were those moments, brief as a heartbeat, where he thought maybe they were wrong. Like when Mrs. Thompson from down the hall had stopped by to tell him she'd seen his painting hanging in her neighbor's house. Or when that kid, what was his name? Timmy? He'd told him it made him feel like he was flying over the city at sunset. Those moments felt... nice. But they were just moments, fleeting and insubstantial as smoke.\n\nHe looked back down at the canvas, at the swirl of blue and black he'd been building up. It wasn't enough, not nearly enough. He grabbed another brush, dipped it into some white paint this time. Maybe if he could just get it right, maybe then they would see. Maybe then he wouldn't feel so... invisible."
