Christ, I hate this feeling of being judged.\n\nI should've known better than to bring coins today. She probably thinks I'm some cheapskate, too.

Did they think I was going to hold up the store or something? They probably thought I was some crazy old timer too. Dammit, this is exactly why I hate going out alone. People always assume they know what you're thinking, but they don't know shit.\n\nI can feel her disappointment, like a weight on my shoulders. She probably thinks I'm lucky to even be alive, after all I've put her through with my forgetfulness. Well, fuck her too.
