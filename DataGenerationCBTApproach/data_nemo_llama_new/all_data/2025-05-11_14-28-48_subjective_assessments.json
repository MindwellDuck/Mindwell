A particularly high electricity bill caught her eye \u2013 nearly $300 more than usual, due to one of the old HVAC units finally failing. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she thought about the conversation she'd had with the insurance company earlier that week, implying they wouldn't cover any upgrades until the policy renewal next month. The added expenses, coupled with the slow pace of recovery, made her wonder if anyone was even listening to her pleas for help.<|eot_id|>",

She's been struggling to keep up with the financial burden since her husband passed away two years ago.\n\n**Text:**\n\n\"Another one,\" she muttered, flipping through the latest stack of bills. Her eyes landed on the electricity bill, almost $300 more than usual. \"Just wonderful,\" she sighed, rubbing her temples. She could picture the old HVAC unit now, wheezing its last breath before giving out completely.\n\nHer mind wandered to the Johnsons next door. They'd had their entire house redone last year - new floors, new kitchen, even a new roof. She remembered seeing their contractor's van parked outside for weeks. \"They've probably never had to worry about bills like these,\" she thought, her voice barely audible in the silent house.\n\nShe recalled the conversation with the insurance company earlier that week. Their pleasant voices echoing through the phone, assuring her they'd look into it, but nothing could be done until the policy renewed next month. It felt like everyone else was moving forward while she was stuck, treading water in a sea of bills and memories.\n\n\"I've been trying,\" she whispered, almost pleadingly to no one in particular. \"I really have.\" She looked at the framed picture of her late husband on the table - his smile wide, eyes crinkling with laughter. A pang of guilt hit her. He'd never complained about their finances when he was alive.\n\nHer thoughts drifted back to the Johnsons. Their son had just started college this year. They must be so proud, she thought, a bitter taste forming in her mouth. She remembered when her own son had started college - it seemed like a lifetime ago now.\n\nShe took a deep breath, her eyes scanning the bills again. \"It's not fair,\" she said softly, more to herself than anyone else. But who was she to complain? Others had it worse, didn't they? She squared her shoulders, steeling herself for another late night of calculations and calls. After all, everyone else seemed to be managing just fine without her."

The doctor's hands trembled slightly as he tried to reconcile the discrepancy in the orders from the ER.\n\nThe nurse beside him raised an eyebrow, concern etched on her face. 'Doctor, do you need some help?' she asked, but before he could respond, the hospital's intercom system crackled to life \u2013 'Code Blue, Ward 3.'

She scanned the page quickly, her eyes widening in anger. The nurse took a step back, sensing her irritation.\n\nSuddenly, the phone on the nurse's station rang, shrill in the quiet morning air. The nurse answered, listened for a moment, and then turned to Dr. before speaking into the receiver again.
