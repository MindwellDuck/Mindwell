They were standing by the coffee machine, but what caught his attention was the way Mark's eyes seemed to linger on Emma's hair as he handed her a cup of coffee. \n\nAs he waited for his own coffee, he couldn't shake off the feeling that Mark had done something more than just hand Emma a cup of coffee. He noticed how close they stood, their shoulders almost touching, and the way Emma playfully rolled her eyes at one of Mark's jokes.\n\nWhen it was finally his turn to grab a cup, he filled it with exactly two sugars, just like Emma liked it. As he turned to leave, he overheard Mark say, 'I'm glad you're enjoying your day so far.' The tone was friendly, but it sent a shiver down his spine.<|eot_id|>",

It was as if Mark had suddenly stepped out of line, crossed some invisible boundary that hadn't existed a moment ago. He wasn't just handing Emma her coffee anymore; he was invading their space, their shared joke now tainted by his presence. The two sugars he stirred into his own cup seemed inadequate, a weak protest against the sudden polarization of his world. Everything felt black and white now, with no room for shades of grey."

I didn't mean it like that, not towards him, not anymore. But the customer didn't know that. They wouldn't understand the weight of those words, the history they held.\n\nI added the thyme to the sauce, watching as it swirled and disappeared, just like our past had done. I was being ridiculous, I knew that. One dish, one customer, one throwaway comment shouldn't mean so much. But here I was, drawing lines in the sand where none existed, turning every ingredient into a symbol of something more.\n\nI plated the dish with care, each component arranged just so.
