The grant approval had been a long shot, but somehow he'd managed to pull it off.\n\n\"I guess it wasn't too hard when you're already well-connected,\" he muttered, his voice low and even.\n\nRachel looked up, a hint of confusion crossing her face before she smiled brightly. \"Oh, I didn't know we were competing against each other. What do you mean?\"\n\nHe shrugged, feeling a twinge of irritation. Nothing he said seemed to get through to her. She just kept on smiling, oblivious to the subtle jab he'd made.

Well done.\"\n\nHe managed a nod, eyes still on the mess in front of him. \"Thanks.\" His voice was quiet, almost lost amidst the clatter of Rachel's cup against the desk.\n\nRachel plopped onto her chair, pulling out her laptop. \"You know, it's not just about who you know,\" she said, looking over at him. \"It's about what you can do too.\"\n\nHe felt a prickle of annoyance. Easy for her to say, with her perfect hair and effortless charm. He sighed internally, pushing his glasses up his nose. \"Sure,\" he muttered.\n\nHis gaze fell on Rachel's neat workspace, then back to his own cluttered desk. He couldn't help but feel like he was lagging behind, no matter how hard he tried. It was always this way - Rachel shining bright, him left in her shadow.

She hadn't expected it to be today, not yet, but somehow life had moved forward without warning.\n\nNow, sitting at her desk, surrounded by the sterile glow of screens and the familiar comforts of her workspace, she felt a deep sense of emptiness wash over her.

They swam before her, a jumble of symbols that might as well have been written in another language for all the sense they made.\n\nThe office seemed unnaturally quiet today, the usual hum of life replaced by an oppressive silence. She could hear every click of the keyboard, every rustle of paper, and it grated on her nerves like nails down a chalkboard. Her colleague, Tom, had offered his condolences earlier, his voice barely above a whisper. But she'd just nodded, unable to trust herself to speak without breaking down.\n\nHer grandmother's words echoed in her mind, \"She's gone, dear.\" Two simple words that carried the weight of a thousand worlds. She felt adrift, untethered from reality, like she was floating in space, watching her life play out below her on some distant planet. Everything seemed so small, so insignificant now. Even this project, once her pride and joy, now just felt... pointless.\n\nShe rubbed at her eyes, trying to dispel the image of her mother's smile, that last photo they'd taken together. The one where they were laughing, not knowing it would be their last moment of happiness. Her heart ached, a hollow emptiness that gaped like an open wound. She felt like she was drowning in a sea of sorrow, and all she could see were the waves crashing around her, threatening to pull her under.\n\nThe deadline loomed over her, but she couldn't care less about it now. The code might as well have been written in fucking Greek for all the good it was doing her. She felt like she was stuck in quicksand, struggling to move forward while everything around her seemed to be moving in slow motion. She just wanted... she didn't know what she wanted anymore. To feel something other than this goddamn emptiness, maybe.\n\nShe sighed, leaning back in her chair, staring at the ceiling tiles until they blurred into a white haze. Her life felt like that now - a blur of noise and pain, with no clear path forward. She just had to keep moving, one step at a time, even if it felt like she was walking through mud.
