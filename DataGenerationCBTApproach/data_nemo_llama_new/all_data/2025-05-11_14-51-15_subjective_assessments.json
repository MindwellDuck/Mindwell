He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, one he thought he'd long since untangled.\n\nAs he started handing out the lesson plans, he noticed the new teacher standing by the door, observing the class with an air of superiority. Her eyes scanned the room, lingering on each student before moving on. A fleeting glance caught his eye, and he could have sworn she raised an eyebrow, implying he was somehow behind.\n\nSomething inside him snapped. The years of resentment, the feeling of being erased from his own life, all came flooding back. He watched as she effortlessly commanded the attention of his students, while he struggled to recall even the simplest lesson plan. His hands trembled as he tried to hand out the papers, his mind racing with memories of what he'd lost, what she'd taken from him.\n\nThe silence in the room grew thicker, heavy with unspoken tension. For a moment, no one moved, everyone waiting to see if he'd snap further, if the anger would consume him. Then, without a word, he turned and walked away, leaving the lesson unfinished, and the class staring after him in confusion.<|eot_id|>",

She was probably judging everything - the way I taught, the mess on my desk, hell, even the clothes I wore.\n\nI could see it in her eyes when she glanced at me, a slight raise of her eyebrow like she was surprised or, worse, disappointed. It was like she was saying, \"Is this really the best they could do?\" Well, screw you too, lady. This is my classroom, my life. I've been doing this for years, and you just waltz in here like you know better.\n\nI mean, did she have to look so... superior? Like she was better than me or something. It was like she could see right through me, into all the doubt and insecurity I'd been trying to hide since... well, since everything changed. But that wasn't her business, was it? She shouldn't be able to just waltz in here and judge me like this.\n\nI felt my hands start to shake as I handed out the last few papers. My mind was racing with all these thoughts, memories of what used to be, what could have been if she hadn't... But no, I wasn't going there again. Not today. Today was about proving myself, showing her that I wasn't some washed-up has-been who couldn't handle a little competition.\n\nBut then, the silence. The heavy, suffocating silence as everyone waited for me to snap further, to lose it completely. And I could feel it, the anger boiling up inside me like lava ready to erupt. But not today.
