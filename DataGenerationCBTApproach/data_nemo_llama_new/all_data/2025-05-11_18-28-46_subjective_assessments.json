They must have been arguing about something important. Something serious. I mean, why else would they be acting like that?*\n\n*But then, just as I was really getting into my observation, they both started laughing. Laughing! Like a couple of old friends sharing a joke. What the hell was that about? My stomach knotted up in frustration. How could they go from looking so angry to suddenly being all laughy-laughy like nothing was wrong?*\n\n*It's not fair, you know?
