The teacher forced a weak smile, trying to brush it off as exhaustion, but her eyes betrayed her true emotions \u2013 disgust with the world, with herself, with this endless cycle of grief and responsibility.<|eot_id|>",

I mean, seriously, does he think this is a fucking playground?\" His heart pounds in his chest, and he feels a sudden surge of anger boiling inside him. He knows it's not rational, but somehow, he can't help feeling like the whole neighborhood has turned against him since his diagnosis.\n\n**Response:**\n\"Jesus Christ, not tonight,\" he mutters under his breath, pushing back his chair with a screech. \"Like I don't have enough shit going on. Now I gotta deal with this racket too? Fuck me, right?\" He storms over to the window, yanking it open. \"Shut up, you goddamn animal!\" he shouts, his voice hoarse from shouting and stress. \"Can't anyone else keep their dog quiet?
