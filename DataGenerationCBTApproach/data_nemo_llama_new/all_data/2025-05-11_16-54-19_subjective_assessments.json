The resident's poise and authority drew admiring glances from passing colleagues, including one particularly handsome attending physician who lingered nearby, his gaze lingering on the blonde's profile.\n\nThe female doctor felt a pang of resentment as she watched the blonde's effortless dominance over the chaotic hospital floor.

Does she think she's going to perform surgery in the hallway or something?\n\nI watched as she paused to offer words of encouragement to some poor junior doctor drowning under paperwork. How sweet, I thought with a roll of my eyes. I could've done that too, you know. In fact, I probably have done that very thing countless times over my years here. But oh no, Miss Perfect Blonde has to swoop in and steal the spotlight.\n\nAnd let's not even get started on how she had the attending physicians eating out of her hand. I saw Dr. Hottie lingering nearby, his gaze locked onto her like she was the only thing worth looking at in this whole darn hospital. Please. Like he wouldn't have done the same if she were a hideous troll with warts instead of a goddess.\n\nI stepped into the elevator, my coffee sloshing dangerously close to the rim as I sulked.
