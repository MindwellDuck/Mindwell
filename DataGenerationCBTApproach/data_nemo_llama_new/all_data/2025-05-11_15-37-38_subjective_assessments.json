His partner, Rachel, had been helping out more frequently lately, and while it was nice to have some extra hands, it also meant she got to be the one to present their dishes to the customers.\n\nAs he plated up a perfectly seared scallop dish, he noticed Rachel was already taking orders from a table of four. He felt a twinge of annoyance at being left out, even if it was just for a few minutes. When the first order came in, he took it himself, but as he began to plate the food, he caught sight of Rachel laughing and chatting with the customer, her eyes sparkling with warmth.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the kitchen chaos around him and focused on the way Rachel seemed to effortlessly connect with this stranger. It was a feeling he'd grown accustomed to in their relationship \u2013 always being the center of attention, always the one who seemed to shine. And now, here he was, standing behind the scenes, cooking for others instead of being the one being served.<|eot_id|>",

A new grant had been awarded to a younger colleague, one who had worked under her guidance just a few years ago. The woman's name was now listed as the lead researcher on the project, and she had even received a generous increase in funding.\n\nAs she watched the young scientist pack up her things to leave for the day, she couldn't help but notice the way he smiled at his colleagues, the way they all seemed to fawn over him. It was almost... palpable. She felt a twinge of resentment, a spark of spite ignite within her.\n\nThe younger woman caught her eye, and for a moment, their gazes locked. But it was the younger woman who looked away first, a flicker of embarrassment crossing her face before she quickly returned to gathering her belongings. \n\nThe door closed behind her, and the older woman let out a quiet sigh.

He didn't acknowledge the man, lost in memories of Sunday dinners, when they'd sit together, laughing, and arguing over who made the better sauce.
