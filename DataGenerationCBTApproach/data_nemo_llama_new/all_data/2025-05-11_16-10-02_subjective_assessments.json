The data had been promising, but he'd insisted on pushing the boundaries further, as he always did. She'd tried to caution him, but he'd waved it off, saying he was close to something groundbreaking.\n\nThe memory of his words echoed in her ears: \"This is what we've been waiting for.\" Waiting for what? For who?\n\nA sudden chill ran down her spine as she recalled the phone call that followed, the tone in his voice laced with excitement, but also a hint of desperation. He'd mentioned a colleague, someone who'd been working on similar research... and how he'd met them in a coffee shop, laughing and joking like old friends.\n\nThe scientist's gaze snapped back to the present, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for answers. What would have happened if she'd said no? If she'd told him to slow down, to be cautious? Would he still be alive?<|eot_id|>",

No more 'let's push the boundaries' bullshit.\" She mimicked his voice, her eyebrows shooting up. \"'We're close to something big.'

The memories came flooding back \u2013 the promises they'd made, the dreams they'd shared, and the sacrifices they'd both made. But what if...what if she had taken things differently?

This wasn't the time for such nonsense.\n\nThe scent of that old perfume was overwhelming, transporting her back to a time when their love seemed invincible. But now it felt like a punch in the gut, a reminder of all they'd lost. She could almost hear the echo of their arguments, feel the weight of his disappointment. Her heart raced as she imagined him looking at her now, with those same creases around his eyes, but this time filled with regret instead of joy.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. This was ridiculous; she wasn't that person anymore. But the doubt lingered, gnawing at her like an insidious whisper. What if he was right? What if she had been wrong all along? She could feel the truth of it in her bones, in the heavy ache of her heart.\n\nShe squared her shoulders, steeling herself for another long shift. But the resolve felt hollow, tainted by the relentless voice inside her head that whispered, \"This is your reality. This is what you've chosen.\" She didn't question it; she just let it guide her actions, like a ship lost at sea, navigating by the stars of her own emotions."
