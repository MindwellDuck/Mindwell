Another long day, another long night ahead, and she couldn't shake the feeling of exhaustion that had been building since morning. As she mechanically began to sort through the charts, her mind wandered back to the patient who'd been admitted yesterday \u2013 a young mother struggling to make ends meet, forced to choose between rent and medication.\n\nThe doctor's eyes pricked as she thought about the desperation etched on the woman's face, the tears that had streamed down her cheeks as she begged for help. The weight of those pleading eyes settled heavy in her chest, making it hard to breathe.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away the seconds until her shift ended. She felt trapped, like she was drowning in a sea of suffering, unable to do anything but offer Band-Aid solutions to the deep wounds of others.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she turned away from the canvas, unable to bear the reminder of what she'd lost.

The way you'd paint pictures with words, making even the most ordinary tales seem magical?\n\nNow, every time I look at my daughter, all I can think is, \"She deserves better.\" Better than what we had, anyway. I've convinced myself that if only you'd been more present, more loving, things could have turned out differently for me.\n\nI see it in her eyes sometimes, the same sadness that used to haunt mine. It's just a glimpse, but it's enough to make my heart ache. She doesn't know about our past, not yet. But I worry that she'll inherit more than just my genes - maybe even some of your mistakes.\n\nI've started noticing things around her room, little signs that remind me of you. The way she folds her clothes, neat and precise; the bookshelf filled with classics you used to read to me. It's like ghosts from our past are whispering in my ears, taunting me with what could have been.\n\nI've made up my mind now, Mother. I'm going to bring her to meet you, soon. Maybe it's time we all faced our demons together. Maybe seeing you again will prove that I was wrong about everything, or maybe it'll confirm every fear I've ever had. But isn't it better to know for sure?\n\nPlease don't misunderstand me; I'm not trying to punish you. I just need answers. For her sake, if not mine.\n\nI hope you're ready,\n\nYour son,\nJames"
