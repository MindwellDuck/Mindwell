The fluorescent lights above hummed softly as he worked, casting an eerie glow over the rows of discarded clothing. It was quiet, except for the sound of his own footsteps echoing off the walls.\n\nAs he hung up a particularly worn-out parka, he caught a glimpse of himself in a small mirror attached to the wall. For a moment, he forgot where he was. His eyes drifted away from the reflection, and his gaze fell upon the old photo on the shelf behind him \u2013 a faded picture of two people standing side by side, smiling at the camera. He hadn't looked at it in months.\n\nHis hands stilled, clutching the coat hanger tightly as memories flooded back. The way she used to laugh, the smell of her perfume, and the sound of her voice when she said \"I love you\" all came rushing back. He felt a lump form in his throat, and his vision blurred for a split second before clearing again.\n\nThe silence in the room seemed to grow thicker, weighing heavily on him. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the familiar ache, but it only intensified with each passing moment.<|eot_id|>",

The cashier, a young woman with a kind smile, helped him gather the cards and handed him a few extra ones from the display. As they were about to part ways, the man handed her one of the cards, saying, \"This one reminded me of my wife.\" His voice cracked, and he quickly looked away, leaving the cashier to hand him a tissue.<|eot_id|>",
