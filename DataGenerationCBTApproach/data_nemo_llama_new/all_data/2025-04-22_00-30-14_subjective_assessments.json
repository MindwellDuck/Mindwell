It was her first day back at work since her husband's passing six months ago, and she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease.\n\nShe took a deep breath and pushed open the door, calling out her name. The nurse rushed in, a look of concern etched on her face.\n\n\"Sarah, I'm so sorry. We've been trying to reach you,\" she said, handing her a cup of coffee.\n\nSarah took the cup, her hands shaking slightly as she wrapped them around it. She had always prided herself on being strong, but today felt different.\n\nThe patient's chart caught her eye, and she felt a pang in her chest. A young mother, barely thirty-five years old, lay in bed, fighting for her life. Sarah's mind flashed back to her own memories of holding her newborn son in her arms, feeling an overwhelming sense of love and responsibility.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she turned away from the bedside, unable to bear the sight. The nurse followed her gaze, her expression softening.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\" she asked gently.\n\nSarah nodded, forcing a smile onto her face. But as she turned back to the patient, she saw something that made her heart skip a beat - a photo of a family on the nightstand, smiling and happy.\n\nA wave of fear washed over her, threatening to engulf her. Not because of the patient's condition, but because it reminded her of what she had lost. Her own family, once full of laughter and joy, now reduced to just her and her son's memory.\n\nThe nurse noticed the change in her expression and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"We'll get through this together, Sarah.\"\n\nBut Sarah knew that she wasn't alone in her fear. She was scared of facing another day without her husband by her side, of raising their child on her own, of living a life that was no longer hers to control. And as she looked at the patient's fragile form, she realized that she wasn't sure if she was ready to face whatever came next.<|eot_id|>",

She glanced nervously at the clock, then back at Dr. Thompson, who was scribbling something down in his notebook. *Why does he have to write so much?* she thought, feeling her anxiety spike.\n\nThe room was too quiet, too sterile. She could hear every ticking second of the clock, every rustle of paper as Dr. Thompson turned the page. Her eyes darted around, taking in the books on the shelf, the framed diplomas on the wall, anything to distract from the churning in her stomach.\n\n\"Sarah,\" Dr. Thompson began, looking up with a warm smile. \"How are you feeling today?\"\n\nShe took a deep breath, her mind racing. *Here we go again*, she thought. *Another fucking question I don't know how to answer.*\n\n\"I'm... I'm fine,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I mean, I'm here, aren't I? That's gotta count for something.\"\n\nDr. Thompson nodded, but his eyebrows furrowed slightly. Sarah felt her hackles rise. *What's that supposed to mean?* She wanted to demand, but bit her tongue.\n\n\"You've mentioned before that your husband's passing has been... challenging,\" he said carefully. \"How has it been since we last spoke?\"\n\nSarah's mind raced back through their previous sessions. *Did I say something wrong? Did I miss something?* She felt a familiar chill run down her spine, the same one she'd felt at the hospital.\n\n\"Uh, well...\" she started, her words tumbling out in a rush. \"I mean, it's been hard, you know? But I've been managing. Mostly.\"\n\nDr. Thompson waited patiently, his pen poised over his notebook. Sarah felt her cheeks flush with heat. *Why isn't he saying anything?* She thought, her anxiety building.\n\n\"And work?\" Dr. Thompson prompted gently after a moment. \"How's that been going?\"\n\nSarah's mind immediately flashed to the young mother in the hospital room, her eyes haunted by memories of her own past. She felt a pang of fear, but pushed it aside, focusing instead on the photo of the happy family.\n\n\"It's... it's okay,\" she said, her voice distant. \"I mean, I'm still there, right? Still doing my job.\"\n\nDr. Thompson nodded again, writing something down. Sarah felt a surge of frustration. *What is he writing about me?* She wondered, her thoughts spiraling.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to refocus on the conversation. But all she could see was that photo, all she could feel was that chill running down her spine. And suddenly, she wasn't sure if she was ready for this after all."

Because I wasn't worthy.\n\nKaren used to do all the household chores, take care of our kid, and still manage to look like a supermodel. Meanwhile, I was stuck cleaning up after her messes, trying to keep a roof over our heads.\n\nThe kid grew up and left, and now I'm left with nothing but these damn bills and my own two feet.

He stared blankly out the window, his mind replaying the scene at the mall yesterday.\n\n---\n\n**Text:**\n\nTom swirled his mug, watching the dark brew churn within. *This isn't how it was supposed to go*, he thought, rubbing his temples. He had pictured himself winning, the crowd cheering, Sarah by his side, proud and impressed. But instead, there was that woman, that stupid sign, and those pitying stares.\n\nHe took a sip of his coffee, grimacing at its bitterness. *It shouldn't have happened like this*, he thought again, more forcefully this time. He should've won. He had guessed right, damn it! He'd even told Sarah about it, joking that he was going to be famous for something other than his terrible cooking.\n\nTom slammed his mug down, sloshing coffee onto the table. *I shouldn't have been made a fool of like that*. He grabbed a paper towel and dabbed at the spill, his jaw clenched. *Sarah should've been there on time*. She knew how important this was to him. *She should've tried harder to get off work*.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, his gaze still fixed out the window. The sun peeked through the clouds, casting bright beams onto the wet grass below. But Tom barely noticed. He was too busy replaying the scene, wishing it away, willing it to be different. Because it shouldn't have happened like this. It just shouldn't have."

        "Triggering Event": "As he poured himself a cup of coffee, John couldn't help but notice the worn-out soles of his wife's shoes. Again. It was as if she had forgotten the countless times he'd reminded her to replace them, to get some new ones, anything but these scuffed up things.\n\nHe thought back to their last trip to the shoe store, where she'd gotten distracted by the display of brightly colored sandals and left him standing alone, waiting for what felt like an eternity. He remembered the way the sales associate had smiled at her, the way she'd giggled over something he hadn't even noticed.\n\nJohn sighed inwardly, feeling a familiar sense of frustration creeping up his neck. He loved his wife, truly he did, but sometimes it seemed like she forgot how hard he worked, how much he gave to their family, to their community. The long hours at the hospital, the endless paperwork, the constant worry about patients... it all added up, and sometimes it made him feel like he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAnd now, here he was, watching her walk out the door, those same worn-out shoes making a deliberate choice to remind him of all the little things that drove him crazy. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the irritation, but it lingered, a low-grade hum in the background of his mind.\n\n\"Good morning, dear,\" she said, as if reading his thoughts. \"I'm running a bit behind schedule. Don't wait up for me, okay?\"\n\nJohn forced a smile onto his face, feeling a twinge of resentment. Behind schedule? Was she kidding? She was always late, always forgetting, always leaving him to deal with the fallout. But he wouldn't say that. Not out loud.<|eot_id|>",

The brown liquid sloshed over the sides, but he didn't notice, his mind already racing.\n\n*She'll probably be hours late again,* he thought, gripping the counter until his knuckles turned white. *Probably forgot some stupid little detail at work, or worse, she's stopped off somewhere to chat with friends.* He could feel the frustration building in his chest like a pressure cooker, ready to blow.\n\n*Goddammit, I won't be able to stand it if she's late for the meeting tonight,* he thought, his stomach churning. *The board members will start asking questions, wondering why we can't keep things on track.* He could see their faces now, the disapproving looks, the whispers behind hands.\n\n*She doesn't understand what I go through,* he seethed silently. *She doesn't know how much is riding on this.* His grip tightened around the countertop until it started to ache. *If she screws this up... if she screws me over again...* He couldn't finish the thought, his mind already spiraling into a future filled with disappointment and despair.\n\n*Fuck,* he cursed softly, running a hand through his hair. *I can't keep doing this.* But even as he thought it, he knew he would. He'd wait for her, worry about her, and then they'd fight when she finally showed up. And the cycle would repeat, because that's what always happened. That was their future."
