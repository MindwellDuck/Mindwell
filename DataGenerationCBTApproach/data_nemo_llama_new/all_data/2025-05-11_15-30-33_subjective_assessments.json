He recalled the night she left, the silence between them deafening. The echoes of those moments still lingered, refusing to fade.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting him back to their countless late-night painting sessions.

A pang in his chest tightened as he realized he'd forgotten. Forgotten the day they spent together, the laughter, the tears... Forgotten the woman who had been his muse, his partner, his best friend.\n\nThe silence in the studio grew thicker, heavy with unspoken emotions. His fingers twitched, yearning to pick up a brush, to create something new, anything, to fill the void left by her departure.
