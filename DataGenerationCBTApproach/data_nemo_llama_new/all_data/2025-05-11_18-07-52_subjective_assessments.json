It was the last day of school before summer break, but he couldn't shake the feeling of dread that had been building all morning. As he began to pack up his belongings, his mind kept drifting back to the conversation he'd overheard earlier between two parents.\n\n\"...can you really just leave him behind?\" one of them had asked, their voice laced with desperation. The other parent's response was hushed, but the words still echoed in his ears: \"I don't know, I just feel like it's our only chance.\"\n\nThe teacher's eyes scanned the room, taking in the rows of empty desks, the scattered papers and books. He felt a lump form in his throat as he thought about his own child, sitting at home right now, waiting for him to come home from work. What if...what if something happened to him? What if he wasn't there when his kid needed him?\n\nAs he zipped up his bag, his hand trembled slightly, and he quickly hid it beneath the desk. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and for a moment, he was frozen, unsure of what to do next.<|eot_id|>",
