A text from her daughter, asking if she wanted to meet for lunch the following week. For a moment, A's heart skipped a beat, but then the disappointment washed over her like a cold wave. She would have to tell her daughter that she couldn't make it; another social engagement was one more thing to add to the list of things she couldn't do anymore.<|eot_id|>",
