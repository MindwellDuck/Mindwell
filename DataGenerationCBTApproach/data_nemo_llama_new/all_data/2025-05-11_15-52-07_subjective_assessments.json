His eyes wandered to the old photo on his break room wall \u2013 a picture of him and his late wife, taken on their anniversary. He hadn't looked at it all day.\n\nThe doorbell above the entrance jingled, signaling the arrival of a customer. A young woman, probably in her early twenties, walked in, scanning the aisles with a look of disdain. She approached the electronics section, where he was helping another customer. As she waited, she checked her phone, rolling her eyes at something on the screen.\n\nThe other customer finished his purchase and left. The young woman turned to him, her expression sour. \"I'm looking for a new TV,\" she said, her tone dripping with annoyance. \"Do you have any recommendations?\" Her gaze flicked to the older model TVs on clearance, and her smirk deepened. \"I bet those old things would be perfect for someone like me.\"\n\nSomething inside him shifted, like a key turning in a lock. For a moment, he felt nothing. Then, a coldness spread through his chest, and he replied, his voice even but laced with a hint of steel, \"Actually, I think you might find our top-of-the-line models more... fitting.\"<|eot_id|>",

His mind kept drifting back to the conversation he'd had with his former student's parents yesterday \u2013 the one where they'd thanked him profusely for helping their child overcome their struggles in class.\n\nAs he mechanically began to grade, the weight of those words settled heavy on his shoulders. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was all a lie \u2013 that he hadn't really made a difference, that he'd just been going through the motions. The thought sent a familiar pang of shame creeping up his neck.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from a parent whose child had also struggled in his class. They asked about his weekend plans, and for a moment, he hesitated before responding with a bland, \"I'm doing okay.\" But as he hit send, the message hung there, taunting him with its insincerity.<|eot_id|>",

The light was all golden and shit, but it felt more like a spotlight, singling me out. I could practically hear those words echoing in my head, \"Thank you so much for helping our child.\" But it's like, did they really mean it? Or were they just being polite?\n\nI picked up the first paper, this kid's handwriting all messy and uneven, like his thoughts were too big for his brain. I remembered him, little Johnny, always struggling to keep up. But then, bam! That conversation with his parents hit me again. They said he was doing better now, that it was all thanks to me. But what if they're wrong? What if I'm just fooling myself into thinking I made a difference?\n\nI started grading, but my mind was elsewhere. Every paper felt like a test, not of the kid's abilities, but of mine. Each checkmark, each red pen slash through an answer... it all screamed at me, \"You're failing them! You're letting them down!\" But then there were these other papers, filled with right answers, neat and tidy. They whispered to me, \"See? You're doing okay.\" It was like my brain couldn't decide what to focus on.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, my phone buzzed. Another parent, asking about my weekend plans. I hesitated, the words \"I'm doing okay\" hanging heavy in my throat before they finally slipped out. But as I hit send, it felt wrong. Like I was betraying something. Or someone. Maybe even myself.\n\nI looked back at the stack of papers, at all those kids who deserved better than some half-assed teacher who couldn't see past his own doubts. And that's when it hit me \u2013 maybe this is why I can't see the good in what I do. Because if I did, then I'd have to face up to the fact that I'm not as great a teacher as everyone seems to think. And that... that's just too scary to look at head-on.\n\nSo here I am, stuck in my little mental bubble, unable to see anything but this one lousy paper at a time."

He was supposed to be about the finances, but she knew what this was really about \u2013 the art, and how it would divide between them.\n\nThe painter felt a surge of frustration as she listened to his rehearsed words.

As if it were their meeting, not hers alone. Didn't he know this was her life's work? Her heart ached with the injustice of it all. Why did he have to insert himself into every aspect?\n\nShe looked around at the canvases, each one a testament to her dedication and skill. They were hers, weren't they? So why did she feel like she had to fight for them, against him? It was as if his every action was a direct challenge to her ownership.\n\nHer mind raced with images of tomorrow's meeting. She could see it now - him, smooth-talking the gallery owners, convincing them that her art belonged with him. The thought made her stomach churn. How dare he assume such audacity? This wasn't just about money; this was about legacy, about what she'd leave behind.\n\nShe picked up a paintbrush, dipping it into a tub of vibrant red, her anger manifesting in bold strokes across the canvas. She knew tomorrow would be another battle, another reminder that everything seemed to revolve around him. But she wouldn't give up without a fight. After all, this was about more than just business; it was about who she was as an artist, as a person. And he had no right to assume otherwise."
