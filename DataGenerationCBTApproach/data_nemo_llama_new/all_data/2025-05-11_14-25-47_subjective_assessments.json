As the lights dimmed and the music began, she felt a tap on her shoulder. Turning around, she saw one of her former nursing students now a prominent journalist, beaming at her with a microphone.\n\n\"Dr. Thompson,\" he said with a smile, \"your groundbreaking research on geriatric care has revolutionized our understanding of aging. Your work has inspired countless healthcare professionals worldwide.\"\n\nThe room erupted into applause as Dr. Thompson's face flushed red, her eyes darting toward Mr. Lee, who was watching with an amused expression. She felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her, wondering if anyone else had noticed how embarrassing it was to have her past achievements so publicly acknowledged. As the applause died down, Dr. Thompson forced a polite smile and shook hands with the student-turned-journalist, trying to play it cool but unable to shake off the feeling of being put on display.<|eot_id|>",

The divorce had been six months ago, but the wound still lingered. He thought he was over it, but as he gazed at the canvas, he couldn't shake the memory of her laughter echoing through the studio.\n\nHis mind wandered back to their last fight, the one where she stormed out, leaving him alone with his paintings and his tears. He recalled the words she spoke, the ones that cut deep: \"You're better off without me.\" Better off? Without her?\n\nThe artist's eyes drifted from the painting to the blank wall opposite, where he'd hung their favorite piece \u2013 a watercolor of their first date. He remembered the way she smiled when he presented it to her, the way it made them both laugh. Now, the painting seemed like a cruel reminder of what they'd lost.\n\nAs the silence in the room grew thicker, the artist's thoughts turned inward, and the pain crept back up, suffocating him. He took a step back, his hand instinctively reaching for the paint-splattered apron that now felt like a worn-out security blanket. His fingers closed around it, holding onto something familiar, anything to anchor himself against the crushing weight of his sorrow.<|eot_id|>",

They looked like someone had kicked their puppy. Again. I'd only seen them twice this week, and both times they were wallowing in self-pity. I swear, if they didn't snap out of it soon, I was going to suggest they start charging for the drama.\n\nI rolled my eyes, pushing my glasses up the bridge of my nose. \"Probably another failed relationship,\" I thought aloud, more to myself than anyone else. I mean, really, who could blame them? Alex always attracted the wrong type - the commitment-phobes, the cheaters, the liars. It was like they had a neon sign blinking 'Bad Boy Ahead' above their head.\n\nI took another sip of my coffee, the bitterness mirroring my mood. \"Maybe I should just leave them to it,\" I mused, tapping my fingers on the table. \"They'll probably just complain about how no one understands them anyway.\" I could already hear Alex's voice in my head, all woe-is-me and 'why does this always happen to me?'\n\nI sighed, pushing my chair back with a screech. \"Might as well get it over with,\" I grumbled, standing up and grabbing my coat. \"Lord knows they won't come looking for sympathy elsewhere.\" As if on cue, Alex looked up just then, their eyes meeting mine. They offered me a small smile, but it was clear the effort cost them. I shook my head, already bracing myself for another dose of their melodrama."
