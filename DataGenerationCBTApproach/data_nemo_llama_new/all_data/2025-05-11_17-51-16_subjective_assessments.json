Today, he was sorting through her art supplies, searching for a specific brand of watercolors she used.\n\nAs he rummaged through a box, his fingers stumbled upon a nearly empty palette. A faint scent of turmeric wafted up, transporting him back to their Sunday morning painting sessions together. She'd always added a dash of yellow to her latest creation, claiming it brought out the brightness in the world. He remembered how she'd tease him about being too serious, about needing more color in his life.\n\nHis eyes welled up as he gently closed the lid, feeling the weight of his grief settle around him like a shroud. For a moment, the silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft ticking of the clock on the wall. Then, he took a deep breath and began to organize the remaining paints, his hands moving mechanically as his mind wandered to all the projects they'd never finished together.<|eot_id|>",
