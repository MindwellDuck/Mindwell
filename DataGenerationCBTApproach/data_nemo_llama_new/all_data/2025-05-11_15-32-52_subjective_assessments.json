His wife had been gone for three years now, but some days still felt like yesterday. He remembered the way she used to stand beside him, helping with the dishes after breakfast. Now, it was just him.\n\nAs he rinsed the final plate, he noticed a faint scent of her perfume lingering in the air. It wasn't hers anymore, of course \u2013 she'd given it away years ago \u2013 but somehow, the smell brought back memories of their wedding day, when they'd first met. He recalled how proud he'd been, standing beside her in front of their friends and family.\n\nThe water turned cold, and he quickly turned off the faucet.

Not for anything he'd done wrong, exactly \u2013 more for being so utterly, completely in love with someone who was long gone.<|eot_id|>",

Her stomach churned at the imagined scene.\n\nThe canvas was a blur of angry strokes now, colors melding into an inky, chaotic mess. She felt herself spiraling, losing control, but wasn't that what he wanted? For her to lose herself in her art so he could have his orderly world?\n\nHer gaze flickered to the counter, where a small box sat innocently. A gift from Alex, probably some trinket meant to make up for another lost evening together. But beneath it was something else \u2013 a note, its words scrawled in haste: \"I'll be home soon.\"\n\nShe felt her heart clench at those four words.
