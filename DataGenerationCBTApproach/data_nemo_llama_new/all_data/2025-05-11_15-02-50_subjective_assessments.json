A patient had passed away earlier that morning \u2013 someone he'd treated for years, a young mother whose family still lingered, waiting anxiously for news.\n\nAs he watched, a group of interns gathered around the whiteboard, discussing the case. One of them mentioned the patient's two-year-old daughter, now without her mother. He felt a familiar ache, one he'd grown accustomed to since... everything changed. \n\nThe door swung open, and a nurse walked by, stopping briefly to exchange a sympathetic glance before hurrying off to another room. Her eyes met his for a fleeting moment, but it was enough to make him realize how long it had been since anyone had looked at him like that \u2013 genuinely cared about what was going on inside.<|eot_id|>",

It's as if the very air around me is thick with sadness, just like it was that day... No, don't think about that today.\n\nI see them out of the corner of my eye, the interns huddled around the whiteboard, their young faces animated with discussion. They're talking about her \u2013 Mrs. Hartley, the young mother who left behind a tiny daughter and a heartbroken family. I remember her laugh, so full of life. Now, there's only silence.\n\nMy coffee sits untouched on the counter, its warmth fading just like my hope. It feels foolish to drink it now, knowing she'll never again sip hers with that smile I came to love. Every time I take a sip, it's like I'm betraying her memory somehow.\n\nThe door swings open, and Nurse Linda rushes in, her eyes briefly meeting mine before darting away. There was something in her glance \u2013 pity? Understanding? Whatever it was, it made my heart ache even more. No one understands what we're going through, not really.\n\nI've been here for years, dedicated my life to this place, these people. But today, it feels like I'm suffocating under the weight of it all. Every face is a reminder of someone lost, every empty bed a story untold. And yet, I can't seem to find the strength to change anything.\n\nMaybe tomorrow will be better. Or maybe not. Either way, I'll still be here, drowning in my emotions, guided by their ebb and flow like some pathetic ship at sea."

He hadn't touched a brush since she left him, not out of choice, but because it simply wasn't done. Art was their shared passion, their love language. How could he possibly paint without her by his side? The very idea seemed... wrong.\n\nHe glanced at the photograph again, her smile radiant and full of life, contrasting sharply with the stark reality of the studio now. She should be here, he thought, her laughter filling the room as she dipped her brush into the vibrant blues that were once their favorite. He had always imagined they'd grow old together in this very room, creating masterpieces side by side until their fingers grew too stiff to hold a brush. That was how it should have been.\n\nBut life didn't care about his expectations. Life took her away, leaving him with an empty studio and an even emptier heart. He knew he should be able to paint again, that others had lost loved ones and continued creating. But they hadn't lost her. They didn't know the weight of her absence, the void she left behind. It wasn't fair, it shouldn't have happened this way. And until life saw fit to correct its mistake, he couldn't bring himself to pick up a brush again. That was how it should be."
