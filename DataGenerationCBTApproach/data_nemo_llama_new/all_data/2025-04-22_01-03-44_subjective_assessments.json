Not after everything that had happened recently... not after John's constant belittling comments about her abilities.\n\nWith shaking hands, Dr. Thompson began frantically typing away on her computer, desperately trying to salvage what was left of her presentation. But with each passing minute, her anxiety grew, until it felt like she was drowning in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nJust then, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was John. \"Honey, I'm running late,\" he said cheerfully, oblivious to the storm brewing inside her.\n\nDr. Thompson's jaw clenched, her anger boiling over. \"Not again,\" she spat into the phone, the words barely above a whisper. And in that moment, she knew she was done. Done with the presentation, done with John, and done with the entire charade.<|eot_id|>",

No wonder they call him 'Flaky John' behind his back.\" She leaned against the counter, arms folded tightly, her gaze fixed and unyielding. \"I'm done being the responsible one, always picking up his slack. It's all on me again - the presentation, the work, the failure if anything goes wrong. Typical.\""
