It was an accident, surely, but his heart leaped at the touch, like a guilty man caught red-handed. He busied himself with the recipe, pretending not to notice the warmth that lingered on his skin.\n\nThe doorbell rang, and she was off in a flash, her laughter echoing down the hallway like a melody he didn't recognize. Standing there, holding onto those potatoes like a lifeline, he couldn't shake the feeling that this interruption was somehow directed at him. As if her visitor had timed their arrival specifically to disrupt their shared rhythm.\n\nA man stood at the doorway, tall and handsome, his smile too broad for this hour of the day. He felt a prickle of annoyance as they chatted, their voices low and intimate. It was ridiculous, really. This wasn't his kitchen, wasn't his life. Yet here he was, feeling proprietorial, like a guard dog ready to defend its territory.\n\nHe turned back to the stove, focusing on the food, trying to ignore the unsettling thought that perhaps she'd invited this man over. Perhaps they had plans he wasn't aware of. The heat from the onions seemed suddenly oppressive, their scent now cloying rather than comforting. He stirred them harder, as if punctuating some unspoken argument. It was just a touch, after all. Just a doorbell. But it felt like more. Like everything."
