A few rows down, a young mother awkwardly tried to juggle a squirming toddler while holding a precariously balanced cart filled with expensive baby gear. The toddler suddenly let out a blood-curdling wail, causing the mother to drop the entire contents of the cart onto the floor.\n\nThe mother frantically apologized to the other shoppers, while trying to corral her screaming child towards the door. As she rushed past the checkout counter, her high heels got caught on the edge of the shelf, sending cans clattering to the ground. Her husband, who was standing patiently by her side, winced in embarrassment as he quickly rushed to help his wife gather their scattered belongings.\n\nTheir toddler, still wailing, managed to snag one of the cans of beans and run off after it, drawing snickers from the nearby shoppers. The embarrassed couple hastily paid for their groceries, then hastily made their way out of the store, leaving behind the chaos they had created.<|eot_id|>",

There's no middle ground here, right?\n\nThen, when I get to work, it's either the coffee's too hot or it's cold by the time I sit down. No Goldilocks zone for me today.\n\nSpeaking of work, you wouldn't believe what happened with Mrs. Thompson and her kid.
