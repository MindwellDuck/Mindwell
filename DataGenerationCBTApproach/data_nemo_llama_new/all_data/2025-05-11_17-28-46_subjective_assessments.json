His mind wandered to the obituary notice she had placed in the local paper \u2013 no mention of him or their years together.\n\nA delivery driver knocked on the door, holding out a package from the gourmet food store. A new shipment of truffle oil had arrived, one he knew his wife used to order. He snatched it from the driver's hand, feeling a surge of anger at the thought of someone else enjoying something she loved.\n\nAs he tore open the box, a faint label caught his eye \u2013 the company was now owned by her old rival, the chef who had ruined their restaurant business all those years ago. The words 'Congratulations on your recent anniversary' seemed like a cruel joke, written by someone who didn't know the first thing about love or loss.<|eot_id|>",

The rag in his hand was but a poor substitute for her once vibrant presence. He paused, inhaling deeply, as if hoping to capture some lingering trace of her perfume amidst the faded aroma of yesterday's sauce.\n\nThe doorbell chimed, intruding upon his reverie like an unwanted guest. A young delivery driver stood there, offering him a package with all the enthusiasm of one handing over a live grenade. It was the truffle oil she had always insisted on, the one thing that made their otherwise humble meals feel like feasts fit for kings. Or so she used to say.\n\nHe snatched the box from the boy's hand, his fingers tightening around it as if he could squeeze out some vestige of her warmth. As he tore open the packaging, a tiny slip of paper caught his eye - a label declaring the company's new ownership by none other than Chef Bordeaux, that pretentious charlatan who had once ruined their restaurant business with his culinary arrogance.\n\nMr. Thompson scoffed aloud, his breath fogging up the glass bottle now held at arm's length like an unpleasant surprise. \"Congratulations on your recent anniversary,\" it read, mocking him in its insincere script. How dare they celebrate something they knew nothing about? It was almost as if they took pleasure in rubbing salt into his wound, relishing his loss while they reveled in their newfound success.\n\nHe clutched the bottle tighter, feeling the cold glass bite into his palm. He would not let this trivial thing tarnish her memory any further. No, he would pour it down the drain where it belonged, a fitting end for something sullied by such ignominious hands. And then, perhaps, he could finally rid himself of the bitter taste that lingered in his mouth - not just from yesterday's sauce, but from every reminder of how unfair life could be."

But I knew better. It was a warning. A sign of things to come. I felt a familiar tension building in my shoulders, a precursor to the storm brewing inside me. I had seen this before, hadn't I? The new kid on the block, ready to steal my thunder.\n\nI took another sip of coffee, trying to focus on the warmth spreading through me instead of the cold dread creeping up my spine.
