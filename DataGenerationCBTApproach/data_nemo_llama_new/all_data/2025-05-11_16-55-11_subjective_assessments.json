The familiar sense of control had slipped away as she tried to recall where she'd left the note from her editor, but it was nowhere to be found. Her mind racing, she replayed the last time they'd spoken, his voice firm yet gentle, urging her to meet the deadline. Now, the clock ticked closer to midnight, and the silence from her editor's office seemed deafening.\n\nAs she frantically scanned her notes, her eyes landed on a recent review from a prominent publication \u2013 one that could make or break her career. She couldn't shake the feeling that this was the reason for the missing message; that her editor had been waiting for her approval before publishing. A cold sweat broke out on her forehead, her breathing quickened, and her hands began to shake as she contemplated the possibility of a major mistake.\n\nSuddenly, the phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. With shaking fingers, she picked up the receiver, only to find herself faced with an unfamiliar voice on the other end, asking for someone else entirely.<|eot_id|>",
