Then, his expression changed, and he quickly looked away, focusing on his laptop screen.\n\nA few minutes later, she found herself standing next to him, waiting for the same table by the window to become available.

We barely knew each other beyond those coding group meetings.\n\nI guess it was a bit weird how he rushed off like that, but who knows, maybe he had some super important work thing to attend to. Not everyone can afford to lounge around sipping coffee all day, you know? I should be grateful for the quiet time to focus on my own tasks.\n\nBesides, I've got enough going on here without worrying about some guy's mood swings. The new project just landed in my lap, and it's a doozy. But hey, challenge accepted! I won't let a little thing like Alex's strange behavior throw me off my game.\n\nSo yeah, just another day at the office. Nothing special, nothing to get excited about. Just how I like it."

Her son-in-law, who'd gotten into a fight with that kid in high school, had always told her he was trouble. Now, it seemed like trouble had finally caught up to him.\n\nSomething inside her shifted, like a dam breaking. She felt a cold rage spreading through her chest, making her breath come in short gasps. Why did this kid have to be so reckless? Why did he think he could just take advantage of innocent people? The anger swelled, threatening to spill over, until all she could see was the face of Jimmy Wilson, his eyes blazing with entitlement and disrespect.<|eot_id|>",
