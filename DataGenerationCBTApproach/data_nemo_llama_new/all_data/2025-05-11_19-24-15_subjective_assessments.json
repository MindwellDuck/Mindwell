A chill ran down his spine as he calculated the total expenses \u2013 enough to put his entire retirement savings at risk.

He felt like he was drowning in grief, suffocating under the pressure of responsibility.\n\nThe lab around him faded into silence, the only sound the quiet hum of the equipment and the soft sobbing that threatened to spill out of him.<|eot_id|>",

Her words were just a gentle nudge towards what they both already knew - she was tired, she was scared. He sighed, rubbing his temples as if he could massage away the thoughts that weren't hers, but felt like they were.\n\nThe numbers on the page seemed to blur into her worried face, her frown lines deepening with each failed trial. He could see it so clearly, her disappointment, her frustration. It was written all over her face, even when she smiled at him, telling him everything would be alright. But he knew better, he knew what she really thought.\n\nHe picked up his phone, her number already dialed. She answered on the second ring, her voice soft and weary. \"Hey,\" she said, as if she'd been expecting his call. He hesitated, then asked, \"Are you disappointed in me?\" There was a pause before she responded, her tone gentle but firm, \"What? No, why would you think that?\"\n\nHe could hear the confusion in her voice, but he knew better. She was just too kind to admit it. He hung up, his heart heavy with the weight of her unspoken disappointment."

It was like comparing a Matchstick to a fucking Forest Fire.\n\nHis phone buzzed again, his wife's worried face lighting up the screen.

He had seen signs - a dip in student enrollment, a few faculty members leaving, the rusty pipes that still hadn't been replaced despite repeated requests.
