It was a milestone \u2013 twenty-five years together. She couldn't remember the last time they'd planned anything special. The kids were grown and moved out, their schedules too hectic for them to make it work.\n\nShe thought about all the little things he used to do for her, the small gestures that made her feel loved and appreciated. Like bringing home her favorite flowers on Fridays. Or surprising her with dinner reservations at that new restaurant she'd been wanting to try. Now, those kinds of surprises felt like a distant memory.\n\nA gentle knock at the door broke her reverie. It was the mailman, holding a package with no return address. Inside, a handwritten note read: \"Happy Anniversary, my love. Can't wait to celebrate tonight.\" But there was no card, no gift \u2013 just the words, scribbled in familiar handwriting.<|eot_id|>",

Now, they were either too busy or too tired for each other, she thought. Either-or, always extremes with him lately. No middle ground."

She thought about all the times he'd taken credit for her ideas, all the late nights she'd spent working while he slept.\n\nThe water in the sink turned cold as she stopped drying her hands, her gaze dropping to the small notebook on the counter. It was filled with notes and equations, but one entry caught her eye: 'Project Eagle', written in her husband's handwriting before he passed away. A project they'd started together, but never finished.\n\nA faint smell of old books wafted through the air as she felt a familiar ache in her chest.
