The sound of sudsing water and clinking plates filled the silence, a stark contrast to the cacophony of memories playing in her mind.\n\nHer daughter had called earlier that morning, asking if she'd helped with the grocery shopping as promised. A faint twinge of anxiety had crept up her spine as she mentally replayed their conversation. She was certain she hadn't mentioned it; had she? The thought sent a pang through her chest, like a gentle squeezing of her heart.\n\nAs she rinsed the last plate, a fleeting image of her ex-husband flashed before her eyes \u2013 him smiling, holding their son's hand, and laughing together. The memory felt like a betrayal, a reminder of what she'd lost when they parted ways. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them away, not wanting to let them fall.\n\nThe warm water and soap suds now seemed to hold a bitter taste, like dust on her tongue. She dried her hands and stepped back from the sink, letting the quiet of the kitchen envelop her once more.<|eot_id|>",

Yet, the uncertainty gnawed at her, like a faint but persistent ache.\n\nShe glanced around the kitchen, her gaze landing on the half-full bottle of wine from last night. It seemed like only yesterday they were all here, laughing and chatting over glasses filled with red liquid that matched the color of their cheeks. Now it was just her, alone in this big house, with memories clinging to every corner like dust bunnies.\n\nA sudden thought struck her: maybe he'd said something to their daughter about the grocery shopping. Her ex-husband always had a way of inserting himself into situations, even when he wasn't there. She could almost hear his voice in her head, smooth and confident as ever, \"Of course, I helped with the groceries.\" It was just like him to take credit for something she'd done.\n\nHer hands tightened around the dish towel, knotting it unconsciously. She didn't need any more reminders of how he'd always managed to cast himself in a better light, even after they parted ways. The kitchen seemed colder now, despite the warm water still draining from the sink. She hugged herself, wrapping her arms around her middle as if to ward off a chill.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered firmly, shaking her head. \"No, he didn't.\" But the doubt lingered, like an unwanted guest refusing to leave."

His mind wandered back to his wife's visit three days ago, when she'd brought over her own groceries and helped him load them into the dishwasher. He'd barely acknowledged her efforts, too caught up in his thoughts of the upcoming pension review meeting.\n\nAs he gazed out the window, he noticed the neatly manicured lawn next door, where his ex-wife had always taken care of their garden. A wave of guilt washed over him \u2013 hadn't he promised to do more around the house? Hadn't he been supposed to take care of things?\n\nThe sound of his phone ringing broke the spell, shrill in the quiet morning. He hesitated before answering, wondering if anyone would even notice if he didn't respond. The voice on the other end was his partner from the station, asking about the new case files. As he listened, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing in every aspect of his life \u2013 work, family, even himself.<|eot_id|>",

No use making things worse.\n\nHe slumped back in his chair, eyes darting to the clock. 10:45 PM. Jesus Christ, who works at this hour?
