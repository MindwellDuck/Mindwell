But it was his ex-wife.\n\n\"Can we talk?\" she asked, her voice laced with an undercurrent of tension he knew all too well.\n\nAs he listened, his mind began to wander back to the countless arguments they'd had over the years, each one leaving a scar that still lingered today. His anxiety spiked as he wondered how this conversation would play out, what new cracks might be formed in their already fragile relationship.<|eot_id|>",

Clearly, she's avoiding me. Probably discussing my latest report with her little clique behind those polite smiles.\"\n\nI took a sip of my drink, the ice cubes clinking loudly in the sudden silence of my imagination. \"She thinks I'm a bore, doesn't she? Or perhaps she's heard about my 'unique' ideas from Tom. Yes, that must be it. They're all laughing at me, plotting ways to undermine my work.\"\n\nI felt my face grow warm, my grip tightening around the glass. \"Well, two can play at this game,\" I thought, squaring my shoulders. \"I'll show them.
