It's been months since the last call, and he can barely remember the last time he had a conversation that wasn't about paperwork or procedure. As he approaches the old oak tree where he used to take his kids to play when they were young, he notices a group of teenagers gathered around it, laughing and joking.\n\nFor a moment, he feels a pang of nostalgia wash over him - memories of lazy summer afternoons, of laughter and shouts from his own children now grown and moved out. He watches as one of them tosses a football high into the air, catching it with a grin. The officer's gaze lingers on the scene, feeling the familiar ache of loneliness settle in like a shroud.\n\nAs he turns to continue walking, he catches sight of himself in a store window reflection - a middle-aged man with lines etched into his face, eyes that seem tired and haunted. For an instant, their gazes meet, and the officer feels a jolt of disconnection, as if he's looking at someone else entirely.<|eot_id|>",
