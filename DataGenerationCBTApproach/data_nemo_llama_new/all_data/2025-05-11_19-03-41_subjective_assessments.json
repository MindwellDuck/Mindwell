Six months had passed since the divorce, yet today it felt as if time had frozen at that point when their lives cleaved apart. Her hand moved mechanically towards the coffee mug that used to rest beside him, now a hollow relic of a shared past.\n\nPouring her coffee, she barely noticed the bitter aroma filling the room. Instead, her gaze drifted towards the photograph on the wall - them laughing under the Mediterranean sun, a stark contrast to the quiet despair of her kitchen now. She hadn't cried since Mother passed away weeks ago, not even at the funeral. But this...this was different. This was grief's long-overdue catch-up, wasn't it? Or so she thought.\n\nYet, there it was again, that nagging voice in her head, \"This isn't real grief,\" it whispered, dismissive. \"You haven't earned it yet, not after all the laughs you shared with him before everything soured.\" She felt a pang of guilt for feeling this way, for daring to mourn something that still existed once upon a time.\n\nHer hands trembled as she gripped the countertop, knuckles turning white. \"It's just hormones,\" she told herself sternly, pushing away from the thought of genuine sorrow. \"You're not allowed to feel like this, not yet.\" She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the emotional storm threatening to break free.\n\nThis wasn't how it was supposed to go. She had plans, schedules even, for when she'd allow herself to grieve properly. But here she was, six months in, with no right whatsoever to feel this way, according to that cruel inner voice. She poured her coffee down the drain, leaving the mug where it lay, an abandoned casualty of war against her own heart.\n\n\"It's just a picture,\" she muttered, turning away from the smiling faces mocking her from the wall. \"It doesn't mean anything.\""
