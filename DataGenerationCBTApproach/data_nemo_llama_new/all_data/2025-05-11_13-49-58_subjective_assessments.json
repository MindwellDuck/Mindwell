The latest article about the environmental disaster that had claimed the life of his younger brother, who had been working on a similar story before his untimely death three years ago, flashed across his eyes. The grainy images of destroyed landscapes and charred bodies made him wince.\n\nAs he scrolled through the article, he noticed a comment from a former colleague, now deceased, praising his brother's determination and courage. A faint smile crept onto his face, but it was quickly replaced by a stinging sensation in his eyes. He blinked rapidly, trying to shake off the lump forming in his throat.\n\nA sudden gust of wind blew through the office, rustling the papers on his desk and sending the screen into darkness. In the brief moment of silence, he felt a wave of despair wash over him. His eyes welled up with tears as he whispered his brother's name, the words barely audible over the hum of the office equipment.<|eot_id|>",
