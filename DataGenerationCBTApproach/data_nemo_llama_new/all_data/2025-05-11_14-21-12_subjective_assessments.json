A particularly aggressive patient had become agitated, refusing to take his medication and shouting at the new nurse who was trying to calm him down.\n\nAs she observed the scene, a sense of powerlessness washed over her. She remembered when her husband used to help her manage their patients' medications, but he'd passed away five years ago. Now, she felt like she was alone, struggling to keep up with the workload.\n\nThe new nurse looked frazzled, and the hospital's noise levels were reaching a boiling point.

In this moment, our nurse felt like she was failing everyone \u2013 herself, the patient, and the entire team.\n\nHer eyes drifted to the empty chair beside her husband's, where she would have sat if he were still by her side.

The scene was escalating faster than she could blink. She knew this wasn't the first time they'd had a stubborn patient, but somehow, today felt different.\n\nShe noticed the new nurse's hands shaking slightly as she tried to reason with the patient. Maria's heart sank. \"Come on, kid,\" she whispered, willing the nurse to find her footing. But the kid just seemed more flustered by the second. Maria could feel her own patience wearing thin.\n\nMaria caught sight of the empty chair beside hers and felt a pang of longing for her husband. He'd been gone too damn long. She could've sworn she heard his voice in her head, saying, \"You can't handle this alone, Maria.\" She shook her head to clear it. No use dwelling on what wasn't there.\n\nShe glanced back at the scene unfolding before her and felt a surge of anger. The patient was still resisting, shouting at everyone like they were deaf. It was infuriating. She could almost hear him saying, \"No one understands me. They're all useless.\" Maria bristled, her hands balling into fists. \"Bullshit,\" she muttered, crossing her arms tightly.\n\nAs the chaos continued around her, Maria felt her resolve crumbling. She couldn't help but think, \"This is ridiculous. I can't do this anymore.\" Her eyes flicked to the empty chair again, and for a moment, she let herself believe that maybe, just maybe, she wasn't capable of handling it all alone.\n\nBut then she took a deep breath, her resolve strengthening. She couldn't keep dwelling on what was gone; she had a job to do. And dammit, she'd do it well, whether everyone else thought she could or not."
