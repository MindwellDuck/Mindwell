His wife had passed away six months ago, but he still found himself going through their wedding album, lost in memories of happier times.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, one picture caught his eye - a photo of them taken on their 50th anniversary, standing proudly in front of their newly renovated home. They had spent years renovating it together, and now it was empty, waiting for him to fill it with new memories.\n\nThe silence of their home weighed heavily on him today, and the realization hit him like a punch to the gut: he would never share another meal with her, never see her smile again, and never wake up next to her warm touch. The thought of living out the rest of his days in this quiet, hollow space was almost too much to bear.<|eot_id|>",

They were laughing, their heads tilted towards each other, sharing stories from the looks of it. He couldn't help but notice how perfectly they complemented each other, their laughter echoing through the otherwise silent coach.\n\nHis gaze drifted back to his own lap, where he held a worn-out album filled with photographs of him and his late wife. The silence between them was palpable now, even in these captured moments. Each laugh line around her eyes seemed like a stab of reminder of what he no longer had.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages, he couldn't help but feel a pang of envy at the couple across from him. Their joy was so evident, so raw, it made his heart ache all the more for what he'd lost. He could see their future sprawled out before them - filled with shared jokes, spontaneous adventures, and quiet nights in.\n\nHis own future seemed so starkly different - a lonely march through empty rooms and silent meals. The contrast was too much to bear today, each turn of the page bringing another wave of envy at what he didn't have, hadn't had for months now. It felt unfair somehow, like life had dealt him a poorer hand than it had them.\n\nBut he shook his head, dismissing such thoughts. He knew it wasn't fair to compare their joy to his sorrow. Theirs was a different kind of happiness, one that wasn't tempered by loss or tarnished by grief. Yet, despite knowing this intellectually, the feeling persisted, gnawing at him like an insidious whisper in the back of his mind. He was left with nothing but frustration and longing as he closed the album, tucking it away safely out of sight."

He felt a pang of guilt for thinking like that, but pushed it aside.\n\n\"Those were just memories,\" he told himself, \"not real life. Real life is this mess.\" He glanced around his cluttered office, the piles of unsorted paperwork, the empty coffee cups. \"Real life is being alone, struggling to make ends meet, and having a deadline looming over you like a guillotine.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to center himself. \"It's not that bad,\" he whispered, but his heart didn't believe it.
