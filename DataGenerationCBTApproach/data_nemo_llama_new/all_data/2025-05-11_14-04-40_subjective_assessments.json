Her partner, Rachel, had left for a meeting earlier that morning, leaving her alone in their small apartment. As she waited for Rachel's return, she found herself scrolling through social media, noticing a post from an old colleague.\n\nThe colleague's update caught her attention - a casual dinner invitation at a trendy new restaurant downtown. The post included a photo of the colleague with someone who looked vaguely familiar, but she couldn't quite place them. A nagging sense of unease crept over her as she wondered if this was more than just a coincidence.\n\nAs she continued to scroll, another update popped up - a friend of a friend had posted about a party happening tonight, and the colleague from the previous post had RSVP'd. Suddenly, the woman's mind began to spin with worst-case scenarios: Was her colleague trying to set her up? Was there something going on behind Rachel's back?\n\nHer fingers flew across the keyboard as she hastily composed a response to the original post, trying to downplay her interest while secretly seething with anxiety. She couldn't shake the feeling that Rachel was hiding something from her, that her entire world was about to come crashing down.<|eot_id|>",
