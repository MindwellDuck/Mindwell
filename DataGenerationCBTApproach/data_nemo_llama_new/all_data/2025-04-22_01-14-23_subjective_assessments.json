I was a scientist, for crying out loud \u2013 I was supposed to be curing diseases, not searching for a decent apartment.\n\nAs I scrolled, a particular listing caught my eye. It was from one of the top research institutions in the country, offering a six-figure salary and a chance to work on real projects. My heart skipped a beat as I clicked on it, feeling a surge of excitement mixed with a healthy dose of fear.\n\nWhy wasn't I good enough? Why did I always end up applying for jobs that were way out of my league? I thought back to all the rejections I'd received over the years, each one a tiny little dagger twisting in my gut.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to shake off the doubts. I had skills, I had experience, and I had a degree from a reputable university. But as I read through the job description, something stung me. They wanted someone with \"proven track record\" and \"leadership experience.\" Proven track record? What did they mean by that? Did they mean I wasn't proven?\n\nI felt my face heat up as I imagined myself walking into an interview, spewing out jargon and trying to sound confident when really I was just winging it. The thought made me want to crawl under a rock and hide.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with a text from my best friend, asking me how my job search was going. I hesitated for a moment before responding, typing out a hasty reply about being busy and not having time to talk. It wasn't fair to her; she deserved better than some half-hearted excuse.\n\nAs I hit send, I couldn't help but wonder if anyone would ever take me seriously. Would I ever be more than just a nobody, stuck in a dead-end job with no prospects? The thought sent a wave of anxiety crashing over me, and for a moment, I forgot to breathe.<|eot_id|>",

Or worse, what if they call but it's just to say they've filled the position already? They might not even bother telling me they'd already picked someone else.\n\nI've been down this road before, man. It's like walking through a minefield where I'm the only one who can't see the fucking mines. Each step is a goddamn question mark, and it's driving me nuts.\n\nI try to distract myself with some TV, but all those reality shows are just making my anxiety worse. Those people on there have lives, they've got problems too, but at least they're not sitting here like a fucking lump waiting for a call that might never come.\n\nI should've asked them when they'd be getting back to me. Maybe they needed more time or something. What if I messed up the interview somehow? Did I say something stupid without realizing it? Fuck, what if I didn't even get an interview at all?\n\nMy heart's pounding now, and my palms are sweating like crazy. This is ridiculous. It's just a fucking phone call. But what if... what if this is another dead end? What if they've already moved on and forgotten about me?"
