Again.\n\nHe imagined the silence that would follow, the unspoken words hanging heavier than the air between them. She'd sigh, disappointed but not surprised. He'd see it in her eyes, the silent accusation. Another year of him failing to remember what she meant to him.\n\nHis hands moved mechanically through his chores, stacking cans on shelves, sweeping floors, all while his mind spun out scenarios that made his stomach churn. He could already feel the cold shoulder, the silent treatment. He'd rather have her yell at him than this silent reproach he knew was coming.\n\nHe tried to shake off the thoughts, but they clung to him like a second skin. This was why he dreaded anniversaries, birthdays - any day that reminded them both of what he wasn't doing right. It was always the same, his stomach knotting with anxiety, his heart pounding with dread. He just knew it would be awful, unbearable even.\n\nBut then again, isn't that what he deserved? For forgetting, for failing her year after year? Maybe this was his punishment, living in a future he'd already predicted and couldn't bear to face."
