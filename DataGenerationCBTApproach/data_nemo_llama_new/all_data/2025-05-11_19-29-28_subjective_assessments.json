The familiar voice of the anchor discussing a recent string of burglaries in their neighborhood made him pause.\n\nA chill ran down his spine as he thought about the countless hours he'd spent patrolling those streets, the sense of security he once took pride in providing. Now, it seemed like no matter how many precautions they took, their home wasn't immune to the risk.\n\nHe felt a twinge of guilt for not being able to protect them, for not being able to chase away the feeling of vulnerability that had been creeping in lately.

The thought of his wife going to the concert alone nagged him. He knew she'd been looking forward to it for weeks, but he couldn't shake off the unease. His mind began its familiar drill:\n\n\"What if the metro's delayed? What if she gets lost in that crowded place at night? What if...?\"\n\nHe felt a tightening in his chest, anger simmering beneath the surface. \"Why does she always have to be so careless?\" he muttered under his breath, gripping his cup tighter.\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to push away the thoughts, but they persisted. His mind was a whirlwind of 'what ifs', each one darker than the last. He knew he should be happy for her, support her, but all he could feel was this dread that refused to budge.\n\nHis wife's call snapped him out of his reverie. \"Hey, love. I'm just grabbing lunch. You sure you don't want me to pick something up for you?\"\n\nHe hesitated, then forced a gruff reply, \"No, no. I'll manage. You just... be careful tonight.\" His voice was harsher than intended, but he couldn't help it. The 'what ifs' were still echoing in his head, loud and insistent."
