A young woman, no more than twenty-five, clutching a bouquet of flowers and wearing a dress stained with dirt. The officer next to him whispered something about her being a college student, but she didn't look like the carefree type. As he listened to her speak, her voice cracking between words, he couldn't shake off the memory of his own sister, who'd died in a car accident five years ago.\n\nThe officer felt a lump form in his throat as the woman spoke about her last moments, about the sound of screeching tires and crunching metal. He recalled the same scene, the same smell of burning rubber and asphalt. The familiar ache in his chest spread throughout his body, making it hard to focus on the conversation.\n\nAs the woman finished speaking, the officer forced himself to nod and scribble some notes, but his mind was already elsewhere. He couldn't help but wonder if there were any other families out there waiting for their justice, wondering if anyone would ever find closure.<|eot_id|>",

He could already feel the weight of her words, the burden of her story that was yet to be told. As she walked towards him, each step seemed like a march towards an inevitable disaster in his mind. He envisioned her voice breaking, her eyes filling with tears, and himself standing there helplessly, unable to bear the raw pain he knew would be unleashed.\n\nHe had seen this scene play out too many times before, the families of victims crumbling under the weight of their loss. And each time, it felt like his heart was being wrung out like a damp cloth. He could almost hear her say those words, \"Why? Why did this happen?\" And he would have no answer, just as he had none for his own sister's fate.\n\nAs they sat down in the interview room, he could feel the tension building inside him, his stomach knotting with anticipation of the impending storm. He knew what was coming, the floodgates opening, the dam breaking. And he wasn't sure if he could handle it again. But there was no other way; he had to listen, to acknowledge her pain, even as he feared it would consume him too."
