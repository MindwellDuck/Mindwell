The smell of his partner's cooking wafted through the air, making his stomach growl with anticipation. But as he approached the counter, he noticed she was already seated at the table, scrolling through her phone.\n\nNot even acknowledging him, she muttered something about needing a minute to herself before responding to a work email. He felt a familiar pang in his chest, but tried to brush it off as exhaustion. However, as he poured himself a glass of water, he caught a glimpse of the text conversation on her screen \u2013 a flirty exchange with someone from school, one of her favorite colleagues.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the conversation, taking in the playful banter and laughter. A slow-burning resentment began to simmer inside him, fueled by the knowledge that this wasn't the first time she'd slipped up like this. They had talked about being open and honest in their relationship, but moments like these made him wonder if he was reading too much into things. As he stood there, frozen, she finally looked up, sensing his presence, and smiled innocently, oblivious to the storm brewing beneath his surface.<|eot_id|>",

And then I see... oh, just another little chat with Mr. Funny Pants from work. Again.\n\nYou know what really gets me? It's not even so much about them flirting \u2013 although, yeah, that's annoying enough on its own. It's more like... what if this time it's different? What if she actually laughs at one of his jokes? What if he makes her feel special, like I never can anymore? What if, what if, what if...\n\nI swear, sometimes it feels like my brain is a freaking broken record, stuck on replay with all these worst-case scenarios.

Another former classmate was celebrating her tenth wedding anniversary, the post filled with gushing comments from friends and family. He felt his stomach twist into knots.\n\nHis mind raced, fixating on every detail of their perfect lives. The sleek studios, the admiring crowds, the loving families.
