One mentioned a week-long trip to Hawaii, complete with airfare and accommodations paid for by her husband's successful business. The other woman smiled wistfully, saying she was planning a similar trip with her partner, who had recently landed a promotion.\n\nThe teacher's eyes lingered on the women's smiling faces before shifting to the empty spaces around him, where his late wife would have sat if she were still by his side.

I could almost hear it whispering, \"You're behind, you're lacking.\"\n\nThe women's voices drifted over, talk of Hawaii trips and promotions. I felt that pang again, sharp as ever. Life hadn't been kind to me, not like it had been to them. Their smiles, their plans - they just proved how much I'd missed out on.\n\nI looked at the empty spots around me, where Lisa used to wait. If she were here, maybe life would've been different. Maybe I'd have a new car too, a trip to plan. But she wasn't, and neither was that life. It was just me and my old Civic, reminder of everything I didn't have.\n\nTheir luck felt like a slap in the face, a proof of how hard life had kicked me down.
