Her mother had passed away a few years ago, but the memory of those unhygienic living conditions still lingered \u2013 the dirt-stained floors, the lack of running water. It was like reliving that nightmare all over again.\n\nDr. Thompson's gaze drifted to her husband, who was waiting for her in the hospital cafeteria. He was oblivious to her distress, chattering away about his day as he sipped his coffee. She felt a surge of annoyance \u2013 didn't he understand what was at stake? Didn't he care that this family could be next?\n\nThe nurse approached, gently interrupting her thoughts. \"Dr. Thompson, you need to review the patient's test results.\" As she scanned the reports, Dr. Thompson's disgust turned to despair \u2013 the child's condition was deteriorating rapidly. She knew every minute counted, but her unease lingered, fueled by memories she thought she'd long buried.<|eot_id|>",
