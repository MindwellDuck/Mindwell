The vibrant colors seemed dull now, a stark reminder of the passion he'd once poured into his art. It had been six months since her passing \u2013 six months since his world had been shattered.\n\nAs he dipped his brush into a nearby jar of turpentine, his fingers brushed against the edge of a photograph he hadn't looked at in ages. A snapshot of them, taken on their last vacation together. He felt a pang in his chest as he gazed at the sun-kissed beach, the laughter, and the love they shared.\n\nIn a sudden, sharp movement, he knocked over the jar, sending turpentine splashing across the canvas. The smell of solvents and paint filled the air, mingling with the familiar scent of her perfume. For a moment, he froze, lost in the memories that flooded his mind.\n\nThe brush slipped from his hand, falling onto the floor with a soft clatter. As he stood there, the world around him began to fade away, leaving only the ache of what could never be again.<|eot_id|>",

This isn't like you.\" Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I didn't know that already.\n\nI glanced at my desk, strewn with half-finished projects and crumpled Post-it notes. It was a goddamn mess, just like everything else in my life. I couldn't seem to get anything right lately. Every task felt like wading through treacle, and the thought of actually completing something made me want to crawl under my desk and hide.\n\nI looked around at my coworkers, their desks neat and organized, their faces calm and focused. \"Show-offs,\" I grumbled. \"Must be nice to have your shit together.\" Not everyone could be a fucking superstar, you know?\n\nI turned back to my own desk, the weight of Sarah's words settling heavily on my shoulders. \"Slipping,\" she'd said.

She instinctively tightened her grip on the cold metal, her heart rate quickening. It wasn't until they stepped closer, hands raised in a calming gesture, that she realized it was just a rookie officer from the training unit, searching for her.\n\nBut the sudden movement had triggered a familiar knot in her stomach \u2013 the same sensation she got when responding to a high-stress call, the same rush of adrenaline that left her breathless.

He'd been her rock, her steady hand when everything else spun out of control. Now it was just her, and she hated every fucking minute of it.\n\nThe officer approached, hands raised in that stupid \"calm down\" gesture cops used on civilians. She wanted to snap at him, tell him he had no idea what she'd been through, what it felt like to have your world torn apart by a single goddamn mistake. But she didn't. She just stood there, heart still racing, and watched as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in shadow.\n\nShe was alive, wasn't she? That had to count for something.
