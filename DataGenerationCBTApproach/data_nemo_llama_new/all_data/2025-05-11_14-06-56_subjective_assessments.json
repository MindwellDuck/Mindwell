The colors seemed muted, the shapes awkward, and the composition off-kilter. He couldn't quite put his finger on what was wrong with it.\n\nAs he stepped back, his gaze drifted to the small easel holding a single, unfinished sketchbook page \u2013 a recent addition to his collection of sketches of their wedding day. It had been six months since her passing, but the pain still felt like a fresh wound.\n\nA faint memory crept into his mind \u2013 the way she used to smile when he'd show her his art, the way her eyes would light up with excitement as he explained his vision. But now, all he could see were the tears she'd shed after looking at his mistakes.\n\nThe air in the room grew thick, heavy with unspoken fears. What if he wasn't good enough? What if he failed to create something worthy of her memory? His breath quickened, and his hands trembled as he reached for the paintbrushes, unsure if he was ready to face the blank canvas again.<|eot_id|>",
