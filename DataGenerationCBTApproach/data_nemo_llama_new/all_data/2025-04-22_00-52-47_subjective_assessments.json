The familiar glow of the police station's fluorescent lights seemed to dim as Emily's gaze drifted across the crowd, her eyes locking onto the sleek black tuxedo-clad figure standing by the refreshments.\n\nIt had been two years since Alex's infidelity had left its scars, but the wound still throbbed beneath her polished exterior. Tonight, however, was supposed to be about celebrating the department's achievements \u2013 not dwelling on past betrayals. Yet, the weight of those unspoken words felt like a physical presence beside her, threatening to upend the carefully constructed facade.\n\nEmily's eyes narrowed as she watched Alex effortlessly charm their colleagues, his smile a reminder that some wounds would never fully heal. She forced a polite smile onto her own face, playing along with the pretence of camaraderie. But inside, a spark of spite kindled within her, fueled by the injustice of it all. Why did he get to move on so easily, while she was still nursing this festering sore?\n\nHer fingers tightened around the microphone handle as Captain Jenkins continued to extol the virtues of their team. Emily's mind began to wander, conjuring up a mental montage of every public display of affection between Alex and the woman who'd left him. Her imagination ran wild, conjuring up scenarios where she exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 small, calculated acts designed to remind him of her presence, if not her forgiveness.\n\nFor now, though, she kept her emotions locked away, maintaining a composed fa\u00e7ade as the night wore on. But beneath the surface, a low-burning fire smoldered, waiting to erupt into flames.<|eot_id|>",

Always laughing, always touching his arm...

Her mind was still reeling from the argument with her husband, Mike.\n\nIt had started over something stupid - him leaving his socks on the floor again - but it had quickly escalated into a full-blown fight about who was more responsible around the house. She felt like she was constantly nagging him, like she was never good enough.\n\nAs she rinsed the final dish and put it away, she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd just let their relationship slip further and further down the drain. She thought about all the times she'd stayed up late grading papers or working on lesson plans, putting Mike's needs second to her own.\n\nAnd what did he do? He sat on the couch, watching TV, completely oblivious to her exhaustion and stress. It was like he didn't even notice she was struggling.\n\nShe felt a lump form in her throat as she dried her hands on the towel. Why did it always have to come to this? Why couldn't they just communicate like normal people?\n\nMike walked into the kitchen, a look of calm contentment on his face. \"Hey, hon, can you grab me a beer from the fridge?\"\n\nHer heart sank.

Every car that cut too close, every driver who seemed to dawdle, it all felt like a personal affront.\n\nWhen my phone rang, I knew instinctively it was Mother. \"Mother,\" I answered, my tone already laced with tension. \"What is it this time?\" My words were harsh, but my emotions dictated they must be so.

        "Triggering Event": "Ugh, why did she have to do that? \n\nI was standing in front of my classroom, trying to write on the board, but Sarah kept interrupting me. I swear, she thinks she's so perfect with her blonde hair and her perfect little smile. But today, it was different. Today, she decided to take her snide comments to the next level.\n\n\"Hey, Mrs. Johnson,\" she says, strolling into the room like she owns the place. \"What's with all the scribbles? Can't you even manage to grade papers properly?\"\n\nThe rest of the class starts snickering, and I feel my face heat up with embarrassment. How dare she? Doesn't she know who I am? I'm the one who teaches these kids, who guides them through their toughest times.\n\nBut then, things took a turn for the worse. Our school principal walks in, and Sarah drops the bombshell. \"Oh, Principal Smith, I just wanted to let you know that Mrs. Johnson here has been having some... creative difficulties with grading.\"\n\nThe whole class falls silent, and I can feel my eyes welling up with tears. Creative difficulties? Is she kidding me? Does she think I'm some kind of joke?\n\nPrincipal Smith gives me this patronizing smile and pats me on the back. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Johnson. We're sure it's just a minor setback.\"\n\nMinor setback? Are you out of your mind? This isn't a minor setback \u2013 this is a public humiliation. And to make matters worse, Principal Smith decides to address the entire class, making a big deal out of my mistake.\n\nAs I stand there, feeling like a total failure, I realize that maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 Sarah wasn't the only one who's been mocking me behind my back. Maybe everyone in this school thinks I'm a complete incompetent.\n\nAnd that's when it hits me \u2013 the crushing weight of their disdain. They all think I'm a joke, that I'm not good enough to teach these kids. It's like they're saying, right to my face, that I don't deserve to be here.\n\nI force myself to keep teaching, but it's hard to focus when you feel like everyone's laughing at you. By the time the bell rings, I'm exhausted, humiliated, and wondering if I'll ever be able to show my face in this school again.<|eot_id|>",

I'm stuck walking home in the goddamn rain, every single day, forever.\n\nI just want it to stop \u2013 the rain, the criticism, the feeling that my life is nothing but a never-ending shitstorm.
