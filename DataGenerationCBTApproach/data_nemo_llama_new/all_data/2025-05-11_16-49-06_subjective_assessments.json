The morning briefing had been a blur of bureaucracy and paperwork, but it was the file on her desk that had really caught her attention - another case of domestic violence, just like her own.\n\nAs she scanned the report, her eyes landed on the photo of the victim, a young woman with tears streaming down her face. Something inside her shifted, like a stone tumbling down a hill. She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach, one she'd thought was long gone.\n\nThe officer next to her cleared his throat, trying to break the silence. \"Ma'am, we need to get moving on this.\" But she couldn't tear her gaze away from the picture. It was like she was staring into her own past, reliving every moment of her own divorce, every screaming match, every shattered promise.\n\nHer hand tightened around the cup, the ceramic cold against her skin. For a moment, she forgot about the rain, forgot about the office, forgot about everything except the hatred that had been simmering beneath her surface for years.<|eot_id|>",

The staff began their final preparations for closing down, but she lingered, her eyes scanning the empty chairs and tables. A customer had complained about the sauce on his dish earlier, claiming it was overseasoned. She'd apologized profusely, promising to retrain her team on presentation.\n\nNow, as she reviewed the evening's sales and inventory reports, she noticed a discrepancy \u2013 one of the specialty ingredients used in the signature dessert had been ordered in twice. Once during lunch service, and again after dinner. It wasn't something they typically stocked; she could've sworn they were out of it. Her mind replayed every interaction with the kitchen staff, wondering if someone might have accidentally ordered it twice by mistake. But the more she thought about it, the more she became convinced that it was intentional \u2013 that someone was trying to sabotage her restaurant.\n\nAs she pondered the possibility, the lights in the dining room flickered once, then steadied. The air conditioning unit hummed back to life, its familiar rumble a stark contrast to the growing unease in her chest. She took a deep breath, telling herself it was probably just a power outage caused by the storm outside, but the seed of doubt had been planted, refusing to be dismissed.<|eot_id|>",

Double ordering some fancy ingredient? That's just great! Must be a newbie trying to make us look bad. I swear, if it wasn't for these idiots, we'd have the best restaurant in town!\"\n\nShe paused, her eyes darting towards the ceiling as she listened to the hum of the air conditioning. \"And don't even get me started on that dodgy wiring.

He glanced up from the clipboard, expecting a simple request.\n\nBut as he scanned the list, his eyes landed on the patient's name \u2013 John, a young man who had been admitted with a severe allergic reaction. The doctor's voice was calm and reassuring, but the words still stung: \"We're doing everything we can, but there's a chance...\". The doctor had delivered similar news before, only to watch patients recover against all odds. But it never got any easier.\n\nThe nurse seemed to sense his tension and cleared her throat, asking again if he needed anything.

He knew better than most how uncertain things were, but still... the 'what ifs' kept coming, each one darker than the last.\n\n\"Dammit,\" he cursed again, slamming his fist against the elevator button.
