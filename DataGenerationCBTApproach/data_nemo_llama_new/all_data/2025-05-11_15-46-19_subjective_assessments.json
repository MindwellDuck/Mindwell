The woman's eyes rolled involuntarily, a habitual gesture she'd learned to conceal behind a bright smile years ago.\n\nJust then, a call came in from room 304 \u2013 the patient who'd been waiting for her new medication since morning. The woman rushed to administer it, but upon arrival, found the patient's chart had been misplaced, and the doctor was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"Guess I'll have to wait another 20 minutes,\" she muttered under her breath, trying to hide the frustration etched across her face. A patient nearby caught her eye, struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of the morning's activities.

All I could see were the endless charts piling up, each one screaming for attention.\n\nRoom 304. That's all that mattered. The rest of the ward could burn to ashes for all I cared. I'd been running around like a headless chicken all morning, and it was barely past noon. Where the hell was Dr. Thompson? And why did every other nurse seem to be on break today?\n\nI finally reached room 304, out of breath and ready to tear someone's head off. But no one was there \u2013 not even the patient's chart. *Are you fucking kidding me?* I could feel my blood pressure rising like a goddamn thermometer in a heatwave.\n\n\"Where the hell is it?\" I muttered, rifling through drawers and cabinets like a madwoman. The room was a goddamn mess \u2013 charts strewn about, pills scattered on the floor. It was like a damn hurricane had blown through here.\n\nI could hear Karen's voice in my head, \"Maybe they moved it to the supply closet?\" But I didn't have time for maybes or might-haves. Not today. Today was just another shitstorm in a long line of them.\n\nAnd then, as if on cue, Mrs. Jenkins from room 312 shuffled by, looking lost and confused. *Great, now we're neglecting the other patients too.* I could feel that familiar knot forming in my stomach \u2013 the one that told me everything was spiraling out of control, again.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. *Just find the chart, administer the meds, and get the hell out,* I told myself. Easy peasy, right? Wrong. Because just as I found the damn chart tucked behind some fucking textbooks, another nurse rushed in, panicked.\n\n\"Have you seen Mr. Lee's chart?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI stared at her, incredulous. \"You've got to be shitting me,\" I said, my voice flat and devoid of emotion. This was just perfect. Just fucking perfect."

She felt a pang in her chest, a dull ache that seemed to spread through her entire body.\n\nHer eyes landed on the old family recipe book lying open on the counter. Her mother had written notes in the margins, tiny drawings of vegetables and flowers surrounding each recipe. It was a book she'd treasured since childhood, but hadn't opened in years.\n\nA faint memory stirred, of her mother teaching her how to make the perfect bouillabaisse, of the smell of saffron and garlic filling the kitchen.
