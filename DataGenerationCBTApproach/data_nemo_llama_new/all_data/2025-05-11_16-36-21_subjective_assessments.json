It was one he hadn't seen in years, filled with pictures from their wedding day and early years together. She reached for it, her hand closing around its worn cover as if hesitant to let go.\n\nThe store's morning music played softly in the background, but the silence between them grew thicker than usual. He watched as she turned the pages, stopping occasionally to run her finger over a familiar face or caption. His own hands stilled, the polish forgotten as he waited for her words. But none came.

But as he read through the notes, something nagged at him. The parents' descriptions of their daughter's disappearance seemed hasty, almost... rehearsed.\n\nHe rubbed his tired eyes, feeling a familiar sense of frustration wash over him. Why did these families always seem so willing to cooperate? Didn't they know that sometimes the truth was hidden beneath the surface?\n\nA gentle knock at the door broke the silence.

I try to focus on their conversation, the normality of it all, but my mind keeps wandering to the future - empty nights, lonely holidays, my children growing up without a father figure.\n\nI imagine them struggling with their homework, asking questions I can't answer because I'm not their dad. I see them crying themselves to sleep at night, longing for something they can't have. And me? I'll be here, helpless and inadequate, failing them just like I failed my marriage.\n\nMy hands shake as I finish cutting the vegetables. I take a deep breath, trying to push away these thoughts.
