It had been years since her divorce, but the memories of being helpless as her husband navigated the medical system still lingered.

He knew best; after all, he was the one fighting this battle.\n\nHe felt a pang of irritation as he imagined her discussing his case with that young doctor, some upstart who probably hadn't even finished his residency yet. They were likely laughing at him right now, dismissing his concerns, thinking they knew better than him. He could almost hear their whispers, \"He's just an old man, panicking.\"\n\nHis grip tightened around the pen in his hand, knuckles turning white. How dare they presume to know what he was feeling? They hadn't lost sleep over this, hadn't felt the cold sweat of fear at night. No one could understand him, least of all them.\n\nHe stood up abruptly, knocking over his chair with a loud thud.

The memories came flooding back, and for a moment, it felt like she was reliving that fateful night all over again.\n\nThe water continued to flow, but her thoughts were elsewhere, stuck in a cycle of what-ifs and maybes.

She could feel it in every fiber of her being, like a physical weight pressing down on her chest.\n\nShe couldn't fucking shake it off. It was like trying to ignore a goddamn fire alarm going off in your ear. Every time she tried to focus on something else, her mind would snap back to that conversation, to that damn pause before Dr. Patel said, \"We did everything we could.\"\n\nShe wanted to scream, to punch something, anything to make this feeling go away. But she knew she couldn't. She had to keep it together, had to keep pushing forward. Because that's what good doctors do, right? They don't dwell on the past, they don't let their emotions control them.\n\nBut fuck, it was hard. It felt like her emotions were a goddamn storm surge, threatening to wash away everything she'd built, everything she believed in. And all because of one damn patient, one damn conversation that had set off this goddamn emotional tidal wave inside her.\n\nShe turned off the tap, her hands still shaking slightly. She was pissed, yeah, but more than that, she was scared. Scared that she wasn't as good a doctor as she thought she was. Scared that next time, it wouldn't just be guilt she felt. It could be something worse. Like failure. Or worse still, regret.\n\nBut she couldn't think about that now. She had patients to see, lives to save. So, she took a deep breath, wiped her hands on her scrub top, and stepped back into the world, leaving her emotional storm behind in the sink full of drained suds."
