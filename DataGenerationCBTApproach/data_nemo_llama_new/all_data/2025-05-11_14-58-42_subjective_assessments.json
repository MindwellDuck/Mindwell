The funding agency was notoriously strict, and any minor discrepancy could mean rejection. He rubbed the tired eyes, feeling the weight of responsibility settle heavier on his shoulders.\n\nJust then, the phone rang, shrill in the quiet laboratory. It was the department head, asking if he'd received the latest batch of samples from the supplier. The answer, no, made A's stomach twist into knots. How had he forgotten? The delay would surely raise red flags with the funding committee.<|eot_id|>",

The words still echoed in his mind: 'You're going to let everything fall apart like this.'\n\nAs he gazed down at the overgrown lawn, the weight of those years past began to settle upon him. He recalled the countless calls he'd made to his own children about responsibility, about keeping their lives together. Now, here he was, standing alone before the very place where it all started.\n\nA faint scent of fresh-cut grass wafted through the air, transporting him back to summers spent helping his father. But it wasn't the smell of happy memories; it was the bitter taste of regret. What had he taught his own kids? Had he passed on the lessons he'd learned from his father?\n\nThe old man's eyes wandered to the spot where his family once gathered, laughter and shouts filling the air. Silence now filled the space, a stark contrast to what he'd known.

The place looked like a dump. The lawn was an unkempt mess, weeds choking out what little grass there was. He couldn't remember the last time anyone had bothered to cut it.\n\nHis gaze shifted to the tree. It was pathetic, really. A stark reminder of how things had changed. Or rather, how he'd let them change. His father would have never let the yard go like this. He could almost hear the old man's voice in his head, \"You're going to let everything fall apart like this.\"\n\nHe snorted, shaking his head. \"As if I needed another reminder,\" he grumbled. As if it was his responsibility to keep this place together. As if anything that happened here was down to him.\n\nHe turned on his heel, ready to leave, but then paused. His eyes fell on the front door. It was closed, but something about it seemed... wrong. It took him a moment to realize what it was - there wasn't even a single scratch or dent on it. No sign of forced entry, no indication that anyone had tried to break in.\n\nHe frowned, his brow furrowing as he crossed his arms. \"Well, isn't that convenient,\" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"The one time I leave the door open, nothing happens. But now, when it's closed tight and there's no sign of trouble, I'm supposed to believe someone else could be responsible for this?\"\n\nHe let out a huff of annoyed laughter, shaking his head again before stalking off down the street, leaving the house behind him.
