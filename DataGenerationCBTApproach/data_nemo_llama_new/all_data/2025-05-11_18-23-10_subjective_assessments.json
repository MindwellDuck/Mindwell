As he began restocking shelves, he noticed a young couple browsing through the electronics section. The woman, probably in her mid-twenties, couldn't help but giggle at something the man was saying. They were holding hands, and their affectionate touch sent a pang through him.\n\nAs he continued his work, he caught glimpses of the couple throughout the store \u2013 laughing together, playfully teasing each other, and sharing a bag of chips from the break room. A coworker asked him if he had seen their new car outside, and he mentioned it was a sleek sports model. He felt a twinge of resentment, wondering how they'd afford such luxury while he struggled to make ends meet.\n\nLater, during his lunch break, he ran into the couple at the deli counter. They ordered sandwiches and started chatting with the cashier, who knew them by name. The woman complimented the cashier on her own jewelry, and he couldn't help but notice the expensive-looking watch on her wrist. For a moment, he felt like he was stuck in a rut, watching others build lives and accumulate possessions that seemed out of reach.<|eot_id|>",

Of course she knew them by name; they were practically regulars here. I rolled my eyes, \"I guess when you've got money to burn, everyone wants to be your friend.\"\n\nAs I sat down for lunch, I unwrapped my sad little sandwich, the one that was on sale and tasted like disappointment. They ordered two of everything, chatting away like they didn't have a care in the world. Their watch glittered under the harsh store lights, a constant reminder of what I didn't have.\n\nI sighed, looking down at my cheap watch, its face scratched from years of use. \"Some people have all the luck,\" I said to myself, a bitter taste lingering on my tongue. It wasn't fair, was it? Some folks got everything they wanted, while others... well, we just got by."

It was his wife's favorite table, where they used to sit and catch up over breakfast before her passing three years ago.

As he waited for his tray, he noticed she had scribbled something on the napkin \u2013 a simple 'thank you' to the staff. The gesture seemed so innocent, yet it struck a chord within him, making him wonder if anyone still remembered the little things about her, too.<|eot_id|>",
