A pang of shame washed over her as she remembered the string of rejections that followed \u2013 the ones from her own husband, now ex.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into paint, it landed awkwardly on the canvas, smudging an already imperfect line. The sound echoed through the studio, making her wince. She sighed, feeling the weight of years spent trying to recapture a creative spark that seemed forever lost.
