When her husband casually mentioned he had heard great things about it too, she felt a pang of insecurity, wondering why he hadn't suggested going there themselves.<|eot_id|>",

The pills spilled all over the floor, and the doctor who had been treated for the same illness a few days ago was now back on the table, undergoing a procedure to correct a mistake made during surgery.\n\nThe doctor's eyes locked onto the new patient, and for a moment, he felt a rush of anger towards the incompetent colleague who had caused this chaos.

She's only been here for a month and already she's got more praise than I've had in my ten years.\n\nI felt the familiar pang of envy, but this time it was laced with something else. Shame, maybe? I shouldn't feel this way; I know I'm good at what I do. But every time I see her, I can't help but think about all the things I haven't done, all the patients I've missed helping because I was too tired or too overwhelmed.\n\nIt's not fair, is it? She gets to come in fresh, learn on the job without the weight of years of experience and endless mistakes. And here I am, stuck in my rut, wondering if I'll ever be as good as she is now. It's like running a race where everyone else starts at the finish line, and I'm still at the starting gun.\n\nBut who would understand that? No one sees the hours I put in, the patients I've held hands with when theirs were empty. They only see the new blood, eager and efficient. And me? Just another old dog trying to learn new tricks."
