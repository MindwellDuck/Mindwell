The weight of her team's reliance on this proposal felt crushing.\n\nAs she read the final sentence, a junior scientist walked by, interrupting her train of thought. 'Dr. Patel, we need to discuss the experimental design.' Her eyes lingered on the young researcher's eager face, and a pang of guilt washed over her. She couldn't afford to fail now; not when so many people were counting on her.\n\nThe phone on her desk rang, shrill in the silence. She hesitated, then picked it up, only to be met with the automated voice of a call center. A recorded message about delayed shipments and cancellations of essential equipment filled the line, leaving her feeling disconnected from the world around her. The words blurred together as she tried to process the news.<|eot_id|>",

It's not my fault they don't do their own research. They expect too much from us, always wanting immediate answers and solutions.\n\nAnd what was that look for when she handed over her card?
