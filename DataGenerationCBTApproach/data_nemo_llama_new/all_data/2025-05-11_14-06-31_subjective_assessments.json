The conversation sparked a glimmer of hope \u2013 maybe this would be the break they both needed. But as the coworker walked away, the weight of their financial struggles settled back onto her shoulders. They still couldn't afford rent, and the bank had threatened foreclosure again.\n\nThe fluorescent lights above flickered, casting an eerie glow over the empty store. As she locked up at the end of her shift, the darkness outside seemed to swallow her whole, leaving her feeling lost and alone once more.<|eot_id|>",

She avoided looking at it, but her mind still whispered comparisons. *They're probably doing just fine without him*, she thought bitterly. *Probably celebrating his replacement.*\n\nShe passed by houses with warm lights spilling out from every window, families gathered around dinner tables, laughter echoing through open doors. Her own home was dark, silent, empty. *Why does everyone else seem to have it together?* She gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white in the dim glow of the dashboard.\n\nAs she turned into her driveway, she sighed, shoulders slumped.

The patient had been discharged hours ago, but he lingered, lost in thought. As he began to tidy up, his gaze fell upon the small framed photo on the nightstand \u2013 a picture of him and his late wife, taken during their anniversary celebration years ago.\n\nA faint scent of perfume wafted through the air, transporting him back to the countless times she'd scented her perfume before leaving for work. He felt a pang in his chest as memories flooded his mind \u2013 the way she used to hold his hand while walking down the hallway, the laughter they shared during rounds, and the quiet moments spent together after a long shift.\n\nAs he approached the sink to wash his hands, he noticed a young nurse, fresh-faced and confident, enter the room to clean it. Her bright smile and crisp uniform made him feel like a relic from another era. For a fleeting moment, he wondered if he was still relevant, if his experience and skills were still valued in this rapidly changing healthcare landscape.\n\nThe sound of the door closing behind the new nurse broke the spell, but the doubt lingered, echoing through the emptiness of the room like an unspoken question.<|eot_id|>",

It used to be a place of solace for him and Emily, where they'd share stolen glances and quiet laughter during their breaks. But now, it was just another fucking stage for this kid to show off her perfect little uniform.\n\nHe caught himself grinding his teeth, feeling that familiar heat rising in his chest. *Fuck*, he thought, *it's not like she's doing it on purpose*. But as he watched her toss the used gowns into the hamper with a flourish, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of resentment. *She shouldn't be here*, he thought, *messing up our rhythm*. He knew it was irrational, but he couldn't shake the feeling that she was somehow responsible for the emptiness gnawing at him.\n\nHe sighed, turning away from the sight and facing the sink instead.

As he approached, she barely looked up, her eyes fixed on her phone.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said softly, trying to get her attention.\n\nShe nodded vaguely, still scrolling through her screen. He felt a pang of frustration and disappointment. This wasn't the first time this week she'd been distant, too caught up in her own world to notice his efforts to connect.\n\nAs he sat down across from her, he tried again, asking about her day. She responded with monosyllabic answers, her gaze drifting back to her phone whenever he spoke more than a few words. The silence between them grew thicker, until it felt like a physical presence around them.\n\nIn the background, the sounds of the cafeteria \u2013 chatter, clinking dishes, and the occasional beep of a printer \u2013 receded, leaving only the quiet hum of their conversation, or lack thereof.<|eot_id|>",

The brown liquid swirled around the cup, much like the storm clouds gathering in his mind. He saw no point in asking about her day now; it was clear she didn't care to share, not when she had her digital world to keep her company.\n\nHe noticed how clean and shiny the tables were today, but of course, Sarah wouldn't appreciate it. She'd only see the crumb left behind by someone else's meal, or the faint stain on the wall where someone had spilled their drink last week. That was just like her, always focusing on the negatives, even when there was so much good around them.\n\nAs for his own efforts to connect, well, they seemed as insignificant as a single candle flame in a hurricane. He could feel his irritation growing, but he pushed it down, along with the small voice inside him that whispered, \"Maybe she's just having a bad day.\" No, he wouldn't make excuses for her this time. Not when she was so clearly choosing her phone over him.\n\nHe took a sip of his coffee, finding it bitter and unsatisfying, much like their relationship felt these days. He wondered if Sarah even tasted the sweetness in her own cup, or if she was too lost in her digital world to notice. It seemed unlikely; after all, she always found something to complain about, didn't she?\n\nThe silence between them stretched on, thick and oppressive, as the rest of the cafeteria buzzed around them. He felt a pang of longing for those early days when their conversations flowed like a river, when her laugh was the sweetest sound he knew, and when her gaze held nothing but warmth and love.\n\nBut that was then, he thought bitterly. This is now. And now, he was just an afterthought, a silent observer in his own life. He sighed, the sound lost amidst the clatter of dishes and the hum of conversation around them, as he continued to watch Sarah's fingers dancing on her phone screen."
