She'd lost count of how many times she'd told herself this since his passing \u2013 it had become her new mantra, a dark companion to every task at hand.\n\nEach empty storefront window reflected back her own emptiness, or so she felt. \"Useless,\" she hissed under her breath, more at herself than anyone else. It was easier to blame the void within than acknowledge its source. She was 'the widow,' 'the struggling single mother,' 'the woman barely scraping by.' Labels piled up like the t-shirts before her, heavy and suffocating.\n\nYet, amidst this silent storm of self-imposed tags, she didn't notice their presence as cognitive distortions. They were simply truths to her, etched into every crease and wrinkle she smoothed out on the clothing, each one a testament to her perceived inadequacy. She was blind to the fact that these labels weren't facts but fears masquerading as reality."

I suppose he does it just to spite me, to make sure I can't get my beauty sleep before work on Monday.\n\nAnd where's his wife in all this? She must be enjoying herself inside their pristine house, while I'm stuck here, being tormented by the constant drone. Doesn't she care about her husband disturbing our peaceful neighborhood?

We can't afford to miss anything.\" His words, once comforting, now felt like a heavy mantle of responsibility she couldn't shrug off.\n\nHer emotions churned within her, a storm brewing that threatened to engulf everything. She felt it then, that familiar urge to retreat, to hide away from the world until this too had passed. But wasn't that what she'd done for the past three years? And where had it led her?\n\nShe looked around at the lab, once their shared sanctuary, now a silent testament to his absence. Her eyes welled up with tears, but she blinked them back resolutely. She couldn't let emotion cloud her judgment. Not again.\n\nYet even as she thought this, she knew she was already knee-deep in that familiar mire.
