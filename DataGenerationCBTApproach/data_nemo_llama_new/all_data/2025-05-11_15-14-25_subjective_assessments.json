The weight of that mistake settled heavy in his chest.\n\nAs he gazed at the smiling faces around him, memories of his own failed attempts at building relationships flooded his thoughts. He recalled the dinner parties where he'd awkwardly tried to connect with his colleagues' spouses, only to be met with polite smiles and distant conversations.\n\nHis eyes drifted to the empty chair beside him, a constant reminder of the life he'd never built.

Now, it all felt like a cruel joke.\n\nHis anger boiled over as he slammed down the phone, the glass shattering against the countertop.
