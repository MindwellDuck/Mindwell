The woman behind her in line began to shift uncomfortably, glancing over her shoulder, but no one else seemed to notice the growing frustration building inside her.\n\nAs the cashier finally managed to print out the return slip, it slipped from her fingers, landing crumpled on the floor. The woman next in line started to hurry ahead, pushing past her without apologizing. A sudden loud noise from the back of the store made everyone jump, and when it was revealed to be nothing more than a loose shelf, the woman felt a hand brush against hers, holding up her receipt for inspection. She snatched it back, feeling a surge of anger and humiliation at being treated like a careless shopper.<|eot_id|>",

The morning light streaming through the window highlighted the faint creases around his eyes, etched from countless hours spent researching and writing. His mind wandered back to their anniversary plans they had made months in advance \u2013 a romantic weekend getaway to the lake house he used to own.\n\nAs he gazed at the photo, he noticed a piece of paper slipped between the edges of the frame and the glass. He pulled it out, revealing a handwritten note he must have written to her before she left for that trip, but never got the chance to give to her. It was a simple apology for past arguments, and a promise to love her more than anything else in life. He remembered now that he had been so caught up in work, he forgot to include it in his packing.\n\nThe realization hit him like a cold wave: another year had passed, and they still hadn't celebrated their anniversary as planned. A pang of regret shot through him, accompanied by the familiar ache of 'what ifs' and 'if onlys'.<|eot_id|>",

I mean, what kind of emergency could possibly be more important than our anniversary?\n\nI've been sitting here for god knows how long now, watching the clock tick closer to our reservation time, and all because they couldn't bother to organize their schedule better. They always say they'll make it up to me, but this is getting ridiculous.\n\nIt's not like I don't have my own work to deal with too. I've been busting my ass at the office all week, making sure everything was covered so we could actually enjoy some time together tonight.

He felt a surge of anger and resentment towards the media for their portrayal of him and his colleagues as incompetent, and particularly towards Alex for somehow stealing the spotlight once again.\n\nThe officer's hand instinctively went to the badge pinned to his chest, his fingers drumming a rhythmic beat against the metal as he stared blankly at the TV screen.
