The city outside was alive with the sounds of construction and late-night revelers, but he felt isolated. His phone buzzed with a text from his latest art critique, a prominent local gallery owner, declining his submission.\n\nThe words \"not ready for prime time\" stung, echoing the doubts he'd been trying to silence for months. He thought about all the rejections, the countless shows where his work didn't sell, the friends who encouraged him to pursue a \"stable\" career. A sense of panic crept up his throat as he wondered if he'd ever make it as an artist.\n\nHis eyes wandered to the uncompleted painting on his easel, the vibrant colors now seeming dull and uninspired. He felt like he was losing himself in this endless cycle of rejection and uncertainty. Suddenly, the lights in the studio flickered, and the sound of shattering glass echoed through the space, making him jump. In the chaos, he knocked over a jar of paint, its contents spilling onto the floor, staining his shoes.<|eot_id|>",

As if he wasn't trying, as if he hadn't been bleeding onto these canvases every day for years! The city outside laughed at him, its noise suddenly grating and jeering. He felt it all closing in, the walls of his studio narrowing like a tunnel that was swallowing him whole.\n\nHis painting\u2014his baby\u2014now looked like a child's scribble under the harsh studio lights. It was a mockery, a testament to his failure. How could he have been so foolish? His hands shook as he gripped the paintbrush too tight, the bristles snapping off into the jar. He didn't notice when it toppled over, paint spilling like blood onto the floor, staining his shoes red. It was fitting, really. Everything he touched turned to failure.\n\nHe wanted to scream, to smash something\u2014anything\u2014to release this boiling rage inside him. But there was nothing left to break. He'd already shattered himself into a thousand tiny shards of doubt and desperation. And just like that broken jar on the floor, he felt beyond repair."

His stomach growled as he thought about the dwindling bank account, the reminder that his monthly maintenance payment for the condo was due soon. He hadn't received the notice yet, but he knew it was overdue.\n\nHis mind wandered to his ex-wife, who had taken control of the finances during their divorce. He felt a pang of guilt for not being able to manage things better, for not being able to provide what she needed. The memory of her laughter echoed in his head, followed by the harsh reality of her parting words: \"I'm doing fine without you.\"\n\nAs he gazed out the window, watching people walk by, he wondered if anyone would even notice if he disappeared. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and for a moment, he forgot about the bills, the responsibility, and everything else.

It was that feeling again\u2014the one that said he was failing, that he couldn't hack it alone. His ex-wife's words echoed in his mind, \"I'm doing fine without you.\" He could almost hear the triumph in her voice.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" he muttered back at the phantom voice, \"You're doing just peachy without me.\" He felt a pang of jealousy, but that was ridiculous, right? They were divorced. She had moved on, and so should he.\n\nBut how could he move on when every time he looked at these bills, all he saw was his own inadequacy staring back at him? It wasn't like he was some finance failure; it was just... temporary. A little bump in the road.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, eyes drifting out the window. People walked by, oblivious to his internal struggle. They didn't know about the hollow feeling inside him, the one that told him he was alone and would always be. But wasn't everyone alone, deep down?\n\nHe sighed, turning back to the bills. \"Alright, let's tackle this beast,\" he said aloud, as if challenging the very papers that held his reality captive.
