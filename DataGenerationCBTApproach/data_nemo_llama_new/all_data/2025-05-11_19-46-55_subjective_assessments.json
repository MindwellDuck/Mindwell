A pang of regret washed over her, followed by a wave of anger towards herself for still carrying the torch for someone who had long since moved on.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the ticking clock on the wall. She felt trapped, stuck between the weight of her past and the uncertainty of her future.
