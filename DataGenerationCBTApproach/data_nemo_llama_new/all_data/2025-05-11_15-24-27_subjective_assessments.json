He picked it up, hoping it was a call about a high-stakes case, but instead, it was the captain's voice, asking him to come down to his office immediately.\n\nAs he walked to the captain's office, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. When he arrived, he found two other officers from his department waiting, their expressions somber. The captain sat behind his desk, flanked by the two officers.\n\n\"Sir, you're being reassigned,\" one of the officers said, handing him a file. Inside, a scathing review of his performance during the previous investigation was highlighted. The captain explained that the new assignment would be a 'fresh start,' but the tone made it clear that his career was now tied to meeting expectations.\n\nThe room fell silent, and he felt the weight of his colleagues' disapproval settle upon him like a shroud. He knew he'd worked hard, but the sting of humiliation lingered, a bitter taste that refused to dissipate.<|eot_id|>",

He'd busted his ass on that case, but here they were, treating him like some green rookie who couldn't handle the pressure.\n\nThe captain's voice droned on about 'new opportunities' and 'growth,' but all he heard was 'you messed up.' *Shouldn't have happened like this*, he thought, resentment simmering. He'd envisioned a different scene - a pat on the back, maybe even a commendation, not this.\n\nHe looked at his colleagues, their faces a mirror of disapproval. *They should understand*, he thought.
