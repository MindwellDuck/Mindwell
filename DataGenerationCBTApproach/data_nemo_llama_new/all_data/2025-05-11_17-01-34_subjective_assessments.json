But as she scrolled through the chart, her mind began to wander to the upcoming birthday party of a young girl she'd been caring for earlier that week \u2013 a child who had lost her mother just a few months prior.\n\nThe contrast between the sterile hospital environment and the tiny hands holding hers during those brief visits had always made this job feel hollow. Now, as the weight of another loss settled upon her shoulders, she felt a familiar ache in her chest. The quiet beeping of machines seemed to grow louder, a relentless reminder of all she couldn't save. Her eyes prickled as she forced herself back to the task at hand, but the words on the screen blurred together, and she knew she wouldn't be able to focus.<|eot_id|>",

She sighed inwardly, wondering if they'd learn anything from this one.

He started to feel anxious, scanning the room for potential threats, and his mind racing with worst-case scenarios. His wife always said he was too cautious, but what if she was right?

He could feel the tension in his shoulders, the knot forming in his stomach. *It's like she's doing it on purpose.*\n\nHe glanced around the room, his eyes lingering on the other nurses bustling about their morning routines. *Why can't they be more careful?* he thought, another label applied, this one broader and more sweeping than the last. *Lazy*, *unobservant* - the words came easily, each one a stone added to his mental fortress of judgment.\n\nHis phone buzzed, pulling him out of his thoughts. It was his wife, asking how his day was going. He hesitated, then typed out a reply, fingers moving quickly over the screen. \"Just another day in paradise,\" he wrote, adding a sarcastic winky face for emphasis. *No need to worry her,* he told himself, tucking away his frustration like an old, worn-out sweater. *Besides, she wouldn't understand.*"
