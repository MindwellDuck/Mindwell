Another day, another mountain of work to climb. As she began to sort through the assignments, one name caught her eye - hers own. The grade she had given herself weeks ago was still scribbled on the page, a meager B+ that now seemed laughable.\n\nHer mind wandered back to the parent-teacher conference from last week, where she'd been asked about her plans for retirement. Retirement. It felt like a distant memory, a relic of a life she'd yet to live. She'd always assumed she'd spend her golden years traveling, volunteering, or simply enjoying time with loved ones. But the truth was, she'd be alone - still living in this small apartment, still grading papers until the end of her days.\n\nAs she gazed at the stack, the weight of her loneliness settled in, like a shroud. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them away, refusing to let them fall. Not here, not now. She took a deep breath, forced herself to focus on the task at hand, and began to grade.<|eot_id|>",

She couldn't see past the tower of papers, it was like a wall blocking out the future. She'd be here forever, grading until her hands cramped and her eyes burned. She could feel it, the weight of tomorrow pressing down on her chest, suffocating her. \"I can't fucking do this,\" she spat, pushing the stack away, tears of frustration threatening to spill over. But she wouldn't cry, not today. Today, she'd fight back, even if it was just with a red pen and some fucking papers. She grabbed them again, her fingers trembling as she started grading, each stroke of the pen a battle cry against the future she saw looming ahead."

Her partner had called in sick, leaving her to respond to this solo call alone. As she began to survey the area, a faint cry echoed through the darkness - a child's voice, muffled but unmistakable.\n\nHer heart skipped a beat as she sprinted down the alley, her hand instinctively reaching for her Taser. The voice seemed to be coming from a nearby dumpster, its lid slightly ajar. She approached cautiously, her eyes adjusting to the dim light.\n\nSuddenly, the voice stopped. An oppressive silence fell over the alley, punctuated only by the sound of rain pattering against the walls. She hesitated, her senses on high alert, wondering if she was too late. Then, a small hand emerged from the dumpster, clutching a dirty rag to its mouth.\n\nA wave of panic washed over her as she realized she was face-to-face with a lost five-year-old, shivering in the darkness. No parents in sight. Her training kicked in, but her instincts screamed at her to get the child to safety - now.<|eot_id|>",

Probably passed out somewhere, too fucked up to care.\" She shook her head, her thoughts racing. \"Christ, I'm soaked through. This is what happens when you're stuck with a rookie partner who can't handle one goddamn night shift.\"\n\nShe glanced at the nearby buildings, their windows glinting in the rain. \"Bet those desk jockies are warm and dry right now, complaining about the noise.\" She sighed, tightening her grip on the kid. \"And here I am, wading through this shitstorm like always. Why can't it be them out here for once?
