The hospital's bright fluorescent lights made her look even more disheveled than she felt, and she couldn't help but feel a flush rise to her cheeks as she stood up, trying to compose herself.\n\nJust then, one of her colleagues walked into the supply closet, took in the scene before her, and raised an eyebrow. \"Rough night?\" she asked, her voice tinged with amusement, and the nurse's face grew even hotter as she mumbled something about needing to get going.<|eot_id|>",

Never did these mornings bring anything but this sinking sensation, he thought. The entire team was either blind or indifferent to the finer details of their patients' conditions.\n\nHis gaze fell upon the whiteboard, a mess of scribbles and cross-outs that seemed to mock him. Whole cases were dismissed with a single line, a recommendation for further testing. It was enough to make his stomach churn, as if his body too rejected this gross oversight.\n\nHe sighed, leaning against the cool wall. This wasn't how it was supposed to be. He had chosen medicine to heal, not to stand helplessly by while they missed crucial signs. But every day felt like a bleak reminder of their collective inadequacy."
