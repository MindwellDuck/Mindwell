As he scrutinized each step of her preparation, his tone grew increasingly critical, making her feel like she was being pulled apart.\n\nThe pressure mounted, and her mind began to wander to all the times she'd spent hours perfecting recipes, only to have some nitpicky detail hold up the service. She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach, her breathing quickening as the inspector's words became a mantra of inadequacy.<|eot_id|>",

It was like those words were a personal attack, each one carving into her pride like the knife she held in her hand. Her heart pounded against her ribs, keeping time with the ticking clock above the door.\n\nEvery nitpick felt like a mountain today, every criticism a punch to the gut. She knew this place was her baby, but days like these made it feel more like a monster, ready to swallow her whole if she let it. But she wouldn't. Not again."

She remembered the day she'd submitted this exact painting to him, full of hope and anticipation.\n\nThe professor had always believed in her, but now, as she gazed at the almost-completed piece, she wondered if she'd been foolish to think she was good enough. What if she wasn't? What if all her years of hard work, all her late nights and early mornings, had been for nothing?\n\nHer eyes drifted away from the canvas, and her gaze fell upon a worn-out photograph of herself and her professor standing in front of a vibrant street art mural they'd created together. A pang of regret twisted in her chest as she thought about how far she'd strayed from his advice \u2013 towards stability, security, and a more conventional career path.<|eot_id|>",

He'd probably take one look at it and say, \"Sarah, what were you thinking?\" If he even remembers who I am anymore.
