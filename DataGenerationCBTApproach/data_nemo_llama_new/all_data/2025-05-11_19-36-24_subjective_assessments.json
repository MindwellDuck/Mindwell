A patient had been scheduled for an emergency procedure earlier that morning, but now it was nowhere to be found. The nurse explained that someone must have misplaced it, and the doctor would have to reschedule.\n\nThe doctor's face tightened as she thought about the time and effort already wasted. She had promised the patient's family that the surgery would happen today, and now they were being kept in limbo. As she waited for the nurse to try and locate the missing chart again, her mind began to replay all the times similar mistakes had happened under her supervision \u2013 the wrong medications, the misread test results... \n\nHer grip on the edge of the counter started to show, and the sound of her fingernails digging into the smooth surface seemed amplified in the silence. The nurse noticed and took a step back, sensing something was off. But before she could intervene, the doctor let out a sharp breath, and her voice cut through the quiet room, \"Just find me that chart.\"<|eot_id|>",

Her eyes welled up as she thought about the anniversary of his passing.\n\nShe hadn't come here in years, but today something compelled her to return. Maybe it was the anniversary of their wedding, which was also his birthday. Whatever the reason, she felt an overwhelming urge to confront the emptiness that lingered within these walls.\n\nAs she approached the mailbox, a gust of wind blew through the yard, rustling the leaves and sending a small piece of paper fluttering towards her feet. She picked it up, noticing it was a bill addressed to her \u2013 a utility bill she'd been putting off paying for months. The due date was today.\n\nShe felt a wave of shame wash over her as she realized she'd let things slip further than usual.
