She couldn't shake the feeling that he was hiding something from her. The thought sent a familiar knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach.\n\nThe email finally loaded, displaying a single message from her manager: \"Re: Project Launch Review - Please be there 15 minutes prior to kickoff.\" A wave of dread washed over her as she read the words, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of her partner's absence.<|eot_id|>",

My fingers tapped out an impatient rhythm on my desk, a habit I'd never quite kicked despite all those mindfulness apps I'd tried. As the seconds ticked by, my mind wandered to all the potential pitfalls tomorrow's launch could bring.\n\nI glanced over at Sarah from Product, her workspace adorned with plants and inspirational quotes. She was probably already prepping her presentation, her confidence radiating like one of those solar-powered garden lights. I felt a twinge of envy; she seemed so put together, so sure of herself. Unlike me, who could barely string together a sentence without worrying about sounding stupid.\n\nWhen the invite finally popped up, my stomach dropped at the sight of the early arrival time. Great, another chance for someone else to shine while I sat there like a bump on a log. I looked around the office, taking in the bustling energy. Everyone seemed so ready, so capable. Except me, stuck here with my anxious thoughts and trembling fingers.\n\nI tried to shake off the feeling as I opened my notes app, but the words refused to come. It was going to be another long night, just me and my doubts."
