The ache in her chest grew heavier, and she felt a lump form in her throat.

The sun had long since set, casting a dark silhouette over the streets where they'd walked hand-in-hand so many times before.\n\nA gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby trees, carrying the faint scent of wood smoke from the neighbor's fireplace. She smiled wistfully, remembering how often he'd started fires late into the night, the smell filling their home with warmth and comfort.\n\nAs she turned to leave, a car pulled up behind hers, its headlights casting an eerie glow on the pavement. She felt a pang in her chest, the sound of the engine idling like a heartbeat. A young couple stepped out, laughing and chattering, their arms around each other. They walked past her, oblivious to her presence, their joy a stark contrast to the emptiness that had become her reality.\n\nWithout thinking, she reached into her pocket and grasped the small silver locket, the one her husband used to wear, now empty except for a faded photo of the two of them standing together. Her fingers tightened around it, a familiar weight settling into place, but the ache within her remained unchanged.<|eot_id|>",
