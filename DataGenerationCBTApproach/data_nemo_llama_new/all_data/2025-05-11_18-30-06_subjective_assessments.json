He failed to acknowledge that he'd been praised for his meticulous work countless times before that day.\n\nAs he took another sip of his now-cold coffee, he frowned at the half-full mug. \"Even this wretched beverage is a testament to my failures,\" he thought bitterly, choosing to overlook the fact that he'd made it himself, something he'd once prided himself on being quite good at. He set the mug down with a thud, his lip curling in disdain.\n\nHis gaze wandered around the cluttered room, settling on a framed photograph of him and his ex-wife, taken during happier times. \"She never would have put up with this mess,\" he thought, his voice laced with self-reproach. He refused to acknowledge that she'd often teased him about his organized chaos, claiming it was part of his charm.\n\nAs he stood there, surrounded by evidence of his past successes and present struggles, he couldn't help but feel like a failure.
