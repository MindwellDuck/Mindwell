As she reached for the garlic press, he caught her hand, his fingers intertwining with hers.\n\n\"Hey, I almost forgot,\" he said, handing her a note. \"I made reservations at Le Coeur for our anniversary tomorrow night.\"\n\nA pang of unease settled in her stomach as she glanced down at the reservation confirmation. The restaurant was one of her favorite spots, but it was also where they had first met \u2013 over a plate of escargot and a glass of wine.\n\nJohn noticed her expression and pulled her close. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice low and concerned.\n\nShe tried to brush it off, but her mind started racing with thoughts of other women, smiling faces, and warm touches.

The water was lukewarm, but it didn't matter \u2013 his mind was still simmering.

He turned off the faucet, his eyes locking onto hers. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the air thick with unspoken tension. Then she smiled, oblivious, and said, \"Oh, sorry, I forgot you're working today.\"\n\nThe sound of clinking dishes and muted conversation snapped him back to reality.

But as he gazed deeper into the photo, his smile faltered. That girl had grown up, moved away, and started her own family. Meanwhile, he was stuck in this marriage, feeling increasingly disconnected from the person he used to be.\n\nHis mind began to wander to all the choices he could've made differently, all the paths not taken. What if he'd pursued a career change? What if he'd stayed closer to his roots? The what-ifs swirled, leaving him with a hollow feeling that lingered long after he closed the book.<|eot_id|>",

She didn't say anything about my cooking, not really. Just that one line about presentation. It's all I can fucking think about now. Did she not notice how perfectly I cooked that lamb?
