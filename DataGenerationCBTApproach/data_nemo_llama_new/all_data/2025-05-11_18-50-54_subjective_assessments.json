He hadn't touched it since she was gone.\n\nAs he gazed at the condiment, memories flooded back \u2013 the countless dinner dates, the fights over cooking duties, and the silent nights when one of them stayed up late, exhausted from work while the other slept soundly beside them. \n\nHis stomach churned as he recalled the argument they had two days before she left. She'd cooked this exact marinara sauce for Sunday dinner, and he'd complained about the taste being too bland. She'd stormed off to the store, returning with a new jar, but by then, the damage was done.\n\nThe smell of the marinara wafted through the air, transporting him back to that moment. His eyes narrowed, and he felt a familiar knot forming in his chest.<|eot_id|>",

Instead, it was the principal, informing her that the school administration had been made aware of some...inconsistencies in her evaluation process. It seemed that several parents had noticed discrepancies between her scores and the actual grades their children had received.\n\nThe line went silent as she processed the information, her mind racing with the implications. She tried to speak, but her voice caught in her throat. The principal continued to drone on, explaining that they would need her to come in for a meeting to discuss this further.\n\nAs she hung up the phone, the room seemed to darken around her, and her vision blurred for a moment.

She could almost see him shaking his head disapprovingly, his brow furrowed in disappointment.\n\nHer thoughts raced like wild horses, galloping through scenarios she hadn't considered until now. They must have found out about the time she rounded up a student's grade to boost their self-esteem. Or perhaps they had noticed how she sometimes let her personal biases influence her scoring. Her stomach churned at the thought of them digging through her records, finding every instance where she had deviated from the strict guidelines.\n\nShe clutched the pen in her hand like a lifeline, as if by holding onto it tightly enough, she could hold back the wave of panic that threatened to consume her. She tried to focus on the stack of papers in front of her, but they swam before her eyes, the words blurring into an indecipherable mess.\n\n\"Maybe I should just resign,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding of her heart against her ribcage. \"Before they ask me to leave.\" She could see it now, the scene playing out in her mind like a movie reel: the principal's stern face as he handed her the termination letter, the whispers of her colleagues as they gathered around their desks, discussing her fall from grace.\n\nShe shook her head, trying to clear the images from her mind.
