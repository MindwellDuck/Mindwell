One woman in particular catches your eye - she looks strikingly similar to your ex-wife.\n\nAs they approach you, exchanging pleasantries, the woman mentions her upcoming wedding anniversary. For a moment, it feels like there's a connection between you two that's eerily familiar. Describe how this makes you feel and think, maintaining a sarcastic tone and avoiding explicit mention of personalization bias.\n\n**Text:**\n\n\"Oh great, here we go again,\" I muttered under my breath as the group of fresh-faced docs spilled out of the building, all smiles and chatter. One of them, a young woman with a laugh that grated on my nerves just like Sarah's used to, caught my eye. \"Must be my lucky day,\" I thought, rolling my eyes internally.\n\n\"Hey there, are you waiting for someone?\" she asked, flashing a smile that was way too bright for this particular moment. I forced one back, because hey, professionalism and all that.\n\n\"Yeah, your boss actually. We've got... some things to discuss.\" I felt my cheeks flush slightly, but I held her gaze, daring her to make something of it.\n\nShe tilted her head, studying me with an intensity that made my stomach churn. \"Anniversary next week,\" she announced suddenly, as if it was somehow relevant to this conversation. \"Five years already, can you believe it?\" She laughed again, and I felt that familiar pang of insecurity.\n\n\"Well, isn't that just peachy,\" I replied, my voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Here's hoping yours is better than mine was.\" And there it was - the subtle sting of comparison, because of course her life was perfect now, and mine was... well, it was me standing out here like a spare part.\n\nI watched as they walked away, their laughter echoing behind them. I couldn't help but wonder if she'd told her fianc\u00e9 about meeting the crazy ex-wife outside his office. Probably not, I thought bitterly. Some things are just too embarrassing to share."
