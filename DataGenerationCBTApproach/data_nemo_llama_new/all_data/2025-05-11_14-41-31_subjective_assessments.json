A recent expos\u00e9 on corporate greed had left him feeling hollow, the words 'injustice' and 'betrayal' echoing in his mind. As he thought about his late wife, who'd passed away two years ago, he couldn't shake off the memory of their final conversation \u2013 her words still haunting him.\n\nThe phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill and insistent. He picked it up, expecting another journalist asking for quotes or sources. Instead, it was a young woman, her voice trembling as she introduced herself as Sarah, a single mother struggling to make ends meet.\n\nWith a mix of guilt and desperation, she explained how her company had laid her off due to 'budget cuts', despite having worked diligently for over a decade. The more she spoke, the more he felt a familiar knot forming in his chest \u2013 a reminder of all the stories he'd written, but never followed through on, never changed the system enough.\n\nAs the call ended, he slumped back into his chair, unable to look away from the rain-drenched streets below. The sound of his own breathing seemed deafening, and for a moment, the only thing he could think about was what he would do differently if given the chance.<|eot_id|>",

He'd barely spoken to her, but he knew - she was just like all the others.\n\n**Response:**\n\"I've heard it all before,\" he muttered, clicking off the voicemail. Sarah's story was as predictable as the rain outside. She probably hadn't even tried hard enough at work. These single mothers, always expecting handouts.\n\nHe picked up his pen, tapping it against his notepad. He'd write her off in his next article. \"Another victim of corporate greed,\" he'd say. It would be a hit, just like the others. They loved stories that fit their narratives.\n\nBut Sarah wouldn't fit into any narrative. She was just another cog in the system, another casualty of progress. He could already see her face, tear-streaked and defeated, as she read his words. Good, he thought. Maybe it'll finally make them realize they're not special. They're all the same.\n\nHe stood up abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. He had work to do. There were more stories like Sarah's out there, waiting for him to tell them, to shape them into something meaningful. And he knew just how to frame them. After all, he thought with a grim smile, he was an expert at seeing through people."

I can just see it now - they'll have a marvelous time, laughing over champagne and hors d'oeuvres, while I sit here in this godforsaken silence.\n\nI mean, really, who are these people? They're probably not even grateful for what they have. They've probably never had to struggle through a Christmas like mine, where every melody of Bing Crosby feels like a stab in the heart. They're just so... happy. It's almost nauseating.\n\nAnd that charity event? A waste of time if you ask me. They'll all be too busy enjoying themselves to care about anyone else's pain.
