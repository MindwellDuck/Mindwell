He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he thought about how this could affect his wife's favorite armchair, which still sat in the living room, waiting for her return.\n\nWith shaking hands, he began to calculate the amount needed to cover the debt, but the numbers seemed to blur together as tears pricked at the corners of his eyes.

She'd always say, 'We're doing just fine, love. We'll have a nice nest egg by retirement.' Ha! 'Just fine,' she said. Where's that getting us now?\n\nI mean, it's not like I'm asking for some grand miracle here. Just... a little bit of understanding, you know? A tiny reprieve from all this shit storming down on me.
