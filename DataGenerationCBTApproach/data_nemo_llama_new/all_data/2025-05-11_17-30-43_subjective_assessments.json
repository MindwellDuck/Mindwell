The morning rush was about to start, and she still needed to finish reviewing the patient charts for her first shift. As she scanned the room, her eyes landed on a familiar face - Dr. Thompson, the attending physician who had been critical of her care during a recent peer review.\n\nHe caught her eye, smiled condescendingly, and began walking towards her, his stride purposefully slow. She felt a knot form in her stomach, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios and all the ways she'd failed. Her hands tightened around the cup, the ceramic cold against her palms as she struggled to breathe. The sounds of the cafeteria receded into the background, replaced by the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears.<|eot_id|>",

A year had passed since her passing, yet the ache within him still lingered \u2013 a dull hum he'd grown accustomed to, but couldn't silence.\n\nAs he dipped his brush into the vibrant colors of the cityscape unfolding before him, his gaze drifted toward the photograph on his easel. The one where she smiled, arms wrapped around him, and their children's laughter echoed through the frame.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the otherwise quiet space. He hesitated, hand hovering above the canvas as if reluctant to begin anew. It was a call from his daughter's school, reminding him of an upcoming art show. His stomach twisted, memories of similar events flooding back.\n\nA faint tremble ran through his fingers as he tried to steady himself. He took a deep breath, letting go of the fragile thread of control, and let the paint flow onto the canvas once more. This time, it wasn't about capturing beauty; it was about exorcising the pain that clung to every stroke.<|eot_id|>",

A scribbled note caught his eye \u2013 a new medication, one he hadn't prescribed before. His heart sank, thinking of all the times he'd promised her better health, more time together.

His wife's perfume still lingered in the air, a reminder of her absence.*\n\n*\"Always,\" he muttered to himself, his voice barely audible over the ticking clock. \"She always does this.\" He picked up the invitation, scanning it as if it were an accusation. \"Another dinner with her colleagues. Whole evenings wasted on people who don't even appreciate her.\" His grip tightened around the paper.*\n\n*\"Never,\" he continued, his voice growing louder, more insistent. \"She never thinks about what I want. It's always about them, isn't it?\" He threw the invitation back onto the floor, now a crumpled mess of colorful ink and harsh words.*\n\n*\"My birthday, for crying out loud,\" he said, his voice shaking with emotion. \"And she doesn't even care enough to plan something together?

The morning sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust motes dancing in the air, but he couldn't shake off the feeling of emptiness that had been suffocating him since his wife left two years ago.\n\nAs he gazed at the bills, a faint memory from his police days flashed before his eyes - the faces of families who'd lost loved ones, the senseless violence, the feeling of powerlessness. He thought about all the times he'd sworn to protect people like this, yet here he was, unable to even take care of himself.\n\nThe weight of his responsibilities as a divorced man bearing the bulk of their household expenses began to bear down on him.
