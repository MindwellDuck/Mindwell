A text from Alex, her art mentor, had appeared out of nowhere - an invitation to join their gallery group show in two weeks. As she read through his message, nostalgia washed over her.\n\nHer eyes landed on the photo of them standing together at last year's exhibition, beaming with pride. She remembered how he'd taken her under his wing, guiding her through the ups and downs of her fledgling career. But now, as she scrolled through their past conversations, she realized Alex had been offering more than just constructive feedback - he'd been pushing her to take credit for his own work, subtly shifting the spotlight onto himself.\n\nA bitter taste formed in her mouth as she recalled the way he'd dismissed her ideas, saying they were'amateurish' and 'unoriginal.' The sting of those words still lingered, and now, as she looked at Alex's text, she felt like she was being offered a slap in the face - a reminder of all the times she'd sacrificed her own vision for his approval.\n\nThe room began to spin, and she felt a wave of nausea wash over her. Her hands trembled as she typed a hasty response, apologizing for her absence but making it clear she wouldn't be able to attend the show after all. As she hit send, a cold sweat broke out on her forehead, and she couldn't shake the feeling that a part of her was dying inside.<|eot_id|>",
