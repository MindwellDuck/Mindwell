He hadn't finished the piece, couldn't seem to bring himself to add the final touches.\n\nHis wife had always been his muse \u2013 the one who encouraged him to push boundaries, to try new techniques.

He recalled the last time they'd worked together, side by side, their conversation flowing as easily as the paint.\n\nAs he dipped his brush into the palette, a speck of turpentine fell onto the floor, shattering the silence. He knelt to pick it up, his eyes drifting toward the old photograph on his studio wall. A snapshot of the two of them, taken at a gallery opening years ago. Her smile still lit up the room, even after all these years.\n\nThe door creaked open behind him, but he didn't turn around. His gaze remained fixed on the photo, memories flooding back like watercolors on wet paper. He felt the sting of tears, tried to shake it off, but it was too late. The paint-stained rag in his hand began to tremble.<|eot_id|>",
