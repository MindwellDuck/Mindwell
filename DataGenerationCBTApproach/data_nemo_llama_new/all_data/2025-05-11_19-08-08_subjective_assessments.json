They had talked about their shared love of medicine just yesterday, and now this news seemed like a cruel joke.

She had barely managed to kick off her shoes and remove her coat before sleep threatened to claim her completely. But tonight, sleep was elusive.\n\nHer husband's words from this morning echoed in her mind like a relentless, unwanted refrain. *Tired of being alone... Tired of cooking dinner by himself every evening.* She could almost hear the hurt underlying his casual tone, each word amplified under the microscope of her guilt-ridden mind.\n\nAmelia sighed, her gaze drifting to the framed photograph on her bedside table - a happy snapshot from their wedding day. Her smile in the picture was radiant, her husband's eyes gleaming with adoration. She turned the frame facedown, unable to bear the stark contrast between that moment and now.\n\nShe thought back to their argument last week, his words sharp and painful as scalpels. *You never make time for us anymore.* He'd been right, of course. Her patients always came first; their needs were urgent, immediate. Hers could wait, could be pushed aside for another day, another week, another month.\n\nHer mind began to catalog the countless times she had chosen work over her marriage: birthdays forgotten, anniversaries neglected, dinners left cold on the table. Each memory was like a stone added to an invisible backpack, weighing her down until she felt crushed beneath the load.\n\nIn contrast, the moments of joy and triumph at the hospital seemed to fade into insignificance. The lives saved, the families reunited - none of it mattered when held up against the scale of her husband's silent suffering. She had become blind to the positives, deaf to the victories, consumed by the negatives she herself had created.\n\nAmelia rolled onto her side, pulling her knees up to her chest like a protective shield around her heart. The darkness pressed in around her, heavy and oppressive, reflecting the weight of her cognitive distortions. She was powerless against them, trapped in her own web of magnification and minimization.\n\nAs sleep finally began to take hold, she whispered into the empty room, \"I'll do better tomorrow.\" But even as she said it, she knew that tomorrow would bring more of the same - another long shift, another late night, another chance to fail her husband.

You're leaving tomorrow, my little bird ready to spread your wings and fly away from our nest. I should be happy for you - and I am, truly - but all I can think about are the things that could go wrong.\n\nI remember when you were just starting to walk, taking those tentative steps towards me with your chubby little legs. You'd fall sometimes, but you'd always get back up again, laughing as if it was the funniest thing in the world. Now, watching you pack for college, I can't help but see every potential stumble as a catastrophic failure.\n\nYou've got your whole life ahead of you, Isabella - endless possibilities and adventures waiting just beyond our front door. But all I can think about are the what-ifs: What if you don't make any friends? What if you struggle with your classes? What if you get homesick and decide to come home early?\n\nI know I'm being silly, overprotective even. You're more than ready for this next step; you've proven that time and time again. But it's like there's a magnifying glass hovering over every potential challenge, blowing them up into monsters that threaten to devour my little girl.\n\nAs much as I want to shield you from all the pain and heartache life can throw your way, I know I can't. So instead, I'll pack extra tissues in your suitcase, just in case. And I'll send care packages filled with your favorite chocolates and homemade cookies (even though you said you're watching your figure). Because even if I can't protect you from the world, at least I can make sure you have something sweet to hold onto when things get tough.\n\nRemember, darling, no matter how far away you are or what obstacles you face, you'll always be my baby girl. And I'll always be here cheering you on, loving you fiercely, and worrying just a little bit too much.\n\nAll my love,\n\nMom\n\n---\n\n**Writing Prompt:** A conversation between two friends at a caf\u00e9, discussing their recent experiences with dating apps.\n\n---\n\nSarah: *Stirring her latte* You know what's crazy?

Well, at least you're getting out there. I haven't even bothered logging into mine in weeks. Every time I do, it just feels... overwhelming.\n\nSarah: Overwhelming? How?\n\nEmma: *Shrugs* You know how it is - swiping through countless profiles, trying to find something that stands out. But everything blends together after a while. And then when you actually match with someone, there's this endless back-and-forth messaging before you can even meet up. It's exhausting.\n\nSarah: *Nods* Exactly! And once you finally do go on a date, it feels like all the pressure is on you to be interesting and charming. Like if you're not perfect right away, they'll just move on to the next girl in their queue.\n\nEmma: *Rolls her eyes* Right? Like we're just disposable entertainment until something better comes along. It's so disheartening.\n\nSarah: *Leans back in her chair* You know what I think it is? It's like these apps are designed to make us feel inadequate somehow. They emphasize the negatives, you know? The guys who don't message back, the ones who ghost after one date... It's like we're expected to just accept that as normal and keep moving forward.\n\nEmma: *Nods* Yeah, maybe you're right. Or maybe it's just me being too picky or something. I dunno.
