(pauses) 'I'm doing this for us, for our future.'\n\nA faint scent of lavender wafted from the perfume she used to wear, transporting him back to the kitchen where they'd argued. He remembered the way she'd stood by the window, tears streaming down her face as she packed her bags. He recalled the sound of his own voice, shouting, telling her she was being selfish, that she didn't understand what was best for them.\n\nThe image shifted again, and he saw himself standing in that same kitchen, hands clenched into fists, as if willing her to stay. A pang shot through his chest, and he felt a familiar weight settle onto his shoulders. Twenty-five years, and yet the ache remained, the guilt still simmering beneath the surface.<|eot_id|>",
