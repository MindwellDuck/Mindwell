It was a typical Monday morning, with the usual chatter of colleagues and clinking of cups filling the air. But her mind wasn't on the upcoming briefing or the stack of paperwork waiting for her.\n\nHer gaze drifted back to the file folder in front of her \u2013 a case from three years ago, one she had worked tirelessly to solve but couldn't shake off. A young woman, barely twenty, who had been found dead in an alleyway, no leads, no suspects. The investigation had stalled, and the department had all but closed it.\n\nAs she flipped through the cold case files, a name caught her eye \u2013 Sarah Jenkins, the victim's name. She remembered the look on Sarah's mother's face during the press conference, the tears streaming down her cheeks as she begged for justice. Something about it sparked a familiar ache in her chest.\n\nShe felt a sudden urge to grab her keys and hit the road, to start driving down those alleys again, to see if anything had changed. But she knew better. She took a deep breath, letting her eyes wander back to the papers on her desk, trying to focus on the task at hand. Yet, the feeling lingered, like a shadow in the corner of her vision.<|eot_id|>",

Twenty years old. Dead in an alley. No leads, no suspects. Just another cold case gathering dust.\"\n\nHe flipped through the pages, eyes scanning but not really seeing. \"Forensics found nothing useful. Witnesses? None. And what's this?\" His finger tapped angrily on a report detailing a witness who'd seen someone lurking nearby. \"Just some 'shady figure'. Great. That narrows it down.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples. \"Three years and we've got nothing. Not even a bloody hunch to chase after.\" His gaze flicked over the other case files stacked neatly on his desk. But he didn't see them. He couldn't see anything but Sarah Jenkins' face staring blankly at him from her photograph.\n\n\"Right,\" he muttered, pushing away from his desk. \"Time for another stakeout in that godforsaken alley.\" And with that, he grabbed his keys and stormed out, leaving the rest of his work untouched."

For a fleeting moment, their eyes locked, and she felt a sudden, unfamiliar tightness in her chest. His expression, usually calm and collected, seemed... distracted.\n\nA faint scent of coffee lingered on his shirt, but what caught her attention was the small notebook resting beside him, filled with scribbled notes and equations. She couldn't quite decipher the symbols, but something about them seemed out of place \u2013 like they belonged to someone else entirely.\n\nWithout breaking eye contact, he returned to examining the slide, his fingers moving deftly over the microscope's controls.

She had always prided herself on being bold and innovative, yet now those traits seemed like liabilities.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the calendar on her wall, where a reminder sticker read 'Lab Meeting - Friday.' The same meeting where her colleague, Rachel, would be presenting their joint research project, which she had spent countless hours working on alongside Rachel. A pang of resentment twisted in her stomach as she wondered if Rachel's success was somehow tied to her own lack of funding.\n\nAs she pushed her chair back, the papers rustled beneath her fingers, releasing a faint whisper of disappointment.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't just about him, about his goddamn salad. It was about everything else too. About Jake, and the life we had together before... before he left me with nothing but memories and a goddamn empty house.\n\nPeople say time heals all wounds, but fuck that.
