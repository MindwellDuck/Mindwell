A young couple, laughing and holding hands, approaches the next lane ahead of him. As they begin to unload their groceries, he catches sight of her - the woman who used to be his wife.\n\nFor a moment, time freezes. The sound of the scanner, the hum of the store's background music, everything fades into silence. He feels a pang in his chest, a familiar ache that never truly goes away. The couple's joy is a cruel contrast to the emptiness he's grown accustomed to.\n\nAs he processes the payment for the couple behind him, his mind wanders back to them. They're smiling at each other, oblivious to the pain he can't shake. He wonders if she ever thinks about him too, or if she's moved on. The thought cuts deep, leaving him feeling hollow and alone once more.<|eot_id|>",

It was her old habit, and it still made his heart ache. \"Probably laughing about how things ended between us.\" He felt a pang of jealousy towards the man beside her. \"He's probably relieved he doesn't have to deal with my baggage.\"*\n\n*His hands tightened around his shopping basket as he stepped forward, scanning his items robotically. The woman behind him smiled, but he barely noticed. His mind was elsewhere.*\n\n*\"Does she even remember our life together?\" He wondered, watching her from the corner of his eye. \"Probably not.

It had been five years since he'd last walked this beach alone, before the divorce. The memories of her laughter carried on the breeze now seemed distant, like someone else's life.\n\nA child's voice pierced the air, and he turned to see two kids building a sandcastle nearby. He watched them work together, their joy infectious. For a moment, he felt a pang of what could have been \u2013 him, working alongside his wife, creating something beautiful with their own hands.\n\nThe little girl looked up and caught his eye. She smiled, and he offered a weak smile back. She scurried off to get a bucket, leaving her brother to continue building. As the boy worked, the girl returned with a handful of seashells and began decorating the castle walls.\n\nHis gaze lingered on the scene, and for a fleeting instant, he was transported back to a time when everything felt perfect. When they were a team, a family. His heart twisted, and he turned away from the ocean, letting the sound of the waves wash over him.<|eot_id|>",

He felt a familiar sense of inadequacy wash over him, like a tidal wave threatening to drown him.\n\n\"They're lucky,\" he said, his voice heavy with unspoken longing. \"They've got something special.\" As if sensing his gaze, the girl looked up and smiled at him again. This time, her smile felt like an accusation, another reminder of what he didn't have.\n\nTurning away from their happiness, he walked back towards his car, leaving the sound of laughter behind. Each step felt heavier than the last, as if weighed down by the unfair comparison that echoed in his mind."
