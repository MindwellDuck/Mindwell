The dim fluorescent lights of the emergency room flickered above her, casting an eerie glow on the worn leather seats. Her eyes wandered to the old photograph on her dashboard \u2013 a picture of herself and her late husband, taken on their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nAs she turned the key in the ignition, memories flooded back. She recalled the countless nights she'd stayed up late, worrying about patients who hadn't made it through surgery. The long hours, the endless cups of coffee, the weight of responsibility. And now, in retirement, she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed somehow.\n\nThe radio crackled to life, playing a soft melody that brought tears to her eyes. She thought about all the times she'd told her daughter to take care of her mother, but had been too busy to notice when her own mother passed away. The silence in the car grew heavier, as if the weight of those unspoken promises was crushing her.<|eot_id|>",

Just then, a faint smudge of turpentine on her sleeve caught her eye, and she realized she must have gotten it on herself while working late last night.

They were smiling, carefree, and it brought a pang of sadness to her chest. The memory of his touch, his laughter, and his unwavering support now felt like a distant luxury, one she couldn't quite grasp anymore.\n\nThe silence between her and her partner grew, punctuated only by the steady beat of the windshield wipers.
