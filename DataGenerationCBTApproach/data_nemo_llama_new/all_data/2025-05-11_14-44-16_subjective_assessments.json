As the sizzling onions filled the kitchen, she couldn't help but think of all the meals she used to cook for her ex-husband when he was home from work. He'd always loved her cooking, and she took pride in making him happy.\n\nAs she glanced at the clock for what felt like the hundredth time, her mind began to wander to the countless nights he'd left her waiting, the takeout menus piling up, and the promises he never kept. She remembered the way he'd complain about her cooking, how it wasn't \"good enough\" for his friends, and how she'd tried so hard to please him.\n\nThe door finally opened, and her child walked in, apologetic and distracted. \"Mom, I'm sorry I'm late,\" they said, barely acknowledging her presence as they began to rummage through their bag for their phone charger. The smell of burnt food wafted from the stove, and for a moment, she felt a pang of resentment, wondering if anyone else even noticed the effort she put into cooking dinner for them.<|eot_id|>",

But don't expect me to enjoy it this time.\" She hung up and turned to her child, who was now slumped at the table, engrossed in their phone. \"You know what? I'm not even hungry anymore. You can just eat that whole thing yourself,\" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she handed them the pizza menu."
