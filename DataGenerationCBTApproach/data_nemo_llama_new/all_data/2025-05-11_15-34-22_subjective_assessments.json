The woman's bright smile and carefree laughter grated on her nerves, reminding her of her own failed marriages and the loneliness she'd grown accustomed to.\n\nAs she expertly flipped the pancakes, the aroma wafted over, carrying with it memories of family breakfasts and holidays spent with loved ones. Her eyes stung, and for a moment, she felt a familiar pang in her chest \u2013 the same one she got every time someone else had something more than she did.\n\nThe woman caught her gaze, smiled again, and this time, it was tinged with kindness. 'You make a wonderful pancake chef,' she said, her voice warm and genuine. The man followed her gaze, his eyes meeting hers before quickly looking away, a flush rising to his cheeks.\n\nThe woman's words and the couple's gentle exchange only made things worse. She felt a seething resentment building inside her, fueled by the cruel twist of fate that kept her alone while others seemed to have found their perfect matches.
