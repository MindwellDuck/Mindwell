His wife had been ill for weeks, and he was supposed to make the difficult decision about her care plan today. The hospital's social worker had already scheduled the meeting, but he hadn't mustered the courage to call it yet.\n\nAs he sifted through the files, a phone rang, shrill in the quiet morning. He let it go to voicemail, hoping it wasn't work-related. But the next call came within minutes \u2013 his wife's oncologist. She asked to speak with him immediately.\n\nFor the first time all week, his mind went completely blank as he listened to her words. What did she mean 'we need to discuss transplant options'? Transplants? At her age... He felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as he tried to recall every conversation they'd had, every test result, every possible complication.\n\nThe room began to spin as his anxiety spiked, making it hard to breathe. He forced himself to focus on the doctor's voice, but his thoughts were racing ahead, conjuring up worst-case scenarios and terrible possibilities. He knew he needed to calm down, but his body seemed frozen, unable to respond.<|eot_id|>",

She pauses, studying the faint lines around his eyes, now more pronounced than they were in life.\n\nA nearby box, labeled 'Art Projects,' catches her attention.

Inside, a series of unfinished canvases, their beginnings abandoned mid-expression. Each one bears the faint outline of a figure \u2013 her, then him, then both of them, intertwined. A shiver runs down her spine as she realizes how far she'd strayed from these initial intentions, the ideas that once fueled her passion for art.\n\nThe air thickens with dust as she gently closes the box.

What then?\"\n\nHe slammed the frame down, knocking over a stack of papers. \"Damn kid,\" he grumbled, \"always so careless.\" But his mind wasn't on his son's driving; it was on the 'what ifs'.

A customer had left them behind, but it wasn't until now, when Sarah walked out of the stockroom, cup in hand, that he realized what he was seeing.

I could practically see the thoughts bubbling up in her head, 'Maybe tonight's the night.'\n\nBut then he leaned in, his face serious all of a sudden. And she... she pulled back, just slightly.
