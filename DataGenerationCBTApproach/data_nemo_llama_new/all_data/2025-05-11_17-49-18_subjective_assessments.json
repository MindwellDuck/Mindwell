The company had been struggling financially, but he had always assumed it would pass. Now, as he scrolled through the list of affected employees, his eyes landed on one name - John, his former colleague from five years ago.\n\nJohn had left the company abruptly after a public argument with their CEO, citing 'creative differences'. At the time, he had seemed confident, even triumphant, when leaving. But now, seeing his name on the list, something inside him shifted. A spark of resentment flared, fueled by memories of their past disagreements and the sense of injustice that had simmered beneath the surface.\n\nAs he read on, the words began to blur together. His mind wandered back to that fateful day when John had stormed out, leaving behind a trail of angry emails and broken promises. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach, a mix of emotions he couldn't quite put into words. All he knew was that his anger had been quietly building, waiting for this moment to reignite.<|eot_id|>",

Another reminder that things would never be the same again.\n\nWithout a second thought, he marched back into the kitchen, grabbed the pan from the stove, and turned off the heat. He couldn't do this anymore. Not today. Not ever again.\n\nAs he sat down at their old kitchen table, the one they had bought together on their first anniversary, he looked around at the empty chairs, the silent walls, the ghosts of memories that haunted every corner. And in that moment, he knew what he had to do. He couldn't keep living like this, surrounded by reminders of what was gone.\n\nHe would sell the restaurant. Start over somewhere new. Somewhere she wasn't. Because seeing her everywhere, hearing her voice in every empty room, feeling her presence in every shadow - it was too much. It was too hard.\n\nAnd so, without even realizing he had drawn such a drastic conclusion based on so little evidence, he made his decision. His mind was made up. He would leave this place behind, and never look back.\n\n|eot_id|"
