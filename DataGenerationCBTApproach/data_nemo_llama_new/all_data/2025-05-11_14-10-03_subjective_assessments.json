They want custom plates, specific wine pairings...it's going to be a nightmare.\"\n\nAs she spoke, his phone buzzed on the counter, displaying a text from his mother: \"Don't forget about Grandma's birthday dinner tonight. I'm counting on you to make something special.\" He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach, the worry creeping up like the rising heat from the sauce. What if he couldn't deliver?
