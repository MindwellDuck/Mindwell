Her mind began to wander to her part-time job, which seemed to be sucking the life out of her.\n\nJust then, a woman approached the counter, asking about a return policy on a dress she had bought three days ago. As she processed the request, she couldn't help but think about how many other returns she would have to process over the next few weeks \u2013 all because people like this woman couldn't even be bothered to try on clothes before buying them.\n\nThe woman smiled sweetly, handed over her receipt, and walked away, leaving her standing alone behind the counter once again. As she watched her go, she felt a familiar emptiness creeping in, like a weight settling onto her chest. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling, but it only seemed to cling to her like a damp shroud.<|eot_id|>",

I kept asking myself, \"What if I can't do this without her?\" What if this is the night everything falls apart? I could feel sweat beading on my forehead as I grabbed the plate, hands shaking like a damn leaf.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but all I could see was that bloody note. \"What if she's right?\" I thought. What if I'm not good enough anymore without her? I stood there for what felt like hours, just staring at that fucking plate, wondering what the hell I was gonna do when they all sat down and took their first bite.\n\nBut then I heard it - laughter from the dining room. They were happy, oblivious to my little existential crisis over here. And suddenly, I realized something: even if this wasn't her recipe, even if it wasn't cooked perfectly, it didn't matter. Because this was my fucking kitchen now, and these were my scallops, and I could do whatever the hell I wanted with them.\n\nSo, I took another deep breath, steeled myself, and walked out there like nothing had happened.
