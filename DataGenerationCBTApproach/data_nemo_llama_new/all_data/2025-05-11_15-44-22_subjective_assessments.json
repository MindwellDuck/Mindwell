A young line cook, probably half his age, expertly laminated dough with ease, their hands moving with a speed and precision he hadn't seen in years.\n\nAs he began prepping ingredients, the chef caught himself comparing his worn, meaty hands to the kid's slender fingers. He thought about how many times he'd struggled to keep up with new recipes, how he'd once been known for his innovative dishes, but now seemed stuck in a rut. The line cook effortlessly plated a dish, garnished with microgreens, while he struggled to get the sauce right. For a moment, he felt like he was drowning in a sea of mediocrity, and it stung.<|eot_id|>",

I could almost see the years etched into my knuckles, like a roadmap of every dish I'd ever served.\n\nIt's not like I wasn't trying. I mean, I've been at this for what feels like forever. But watching him... it was like he was speaking some language I'd forgotten how to understand. He plated that dish, those microgreens sitting pretty on top, and suddenly my sauce felt like a lump of yesterday's leftovers.\n\nI could feel it, that familiar twinge in my chest, like I was sinking. Like the kitchen had become this vast ocean and I was drowning in mediocrity. But hey, it's not like he meant to make me feel small. Right? It's just... sometimes it's hard not to compare, you know?

He hadn't returned to this place since, yet today he felt compelled to stand here, surrounded by the echoes of their past.\n\nAs he gazed up at the window, he noticed something new - a 'For Rent' sign now adorned the glass. The thought crept into his mind like a slow-moving fog: what if he'd taken her back? What if he'd tried harder to make it work?\n\nThe journalist in him kicked in, and he began mentally compiling the possible scenarios, weighing the pros and cons of every decision they'd made during their marriage. His eyes drifted down to the small notebook clutched in his hand, filled with articles he'd written about failed relationships and broken families.\n\nA faint smile twisted his lips as he recalled one particularly scathing review he'd penned for a local restaurant, which had ended up being a minor blunder. But in this moment, he couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than just facts and figures - that maybe, just maybe, he'd been too quick to judge others when he didn't know what it meant to truly love someone.\n\nThe realization left him feeling unsettled, and he turned to leave, the sound of his own footsteps echoing through the empty hallway.<|eot_id|>",

Either I accept that she's happy without me, or I wallow in self-pity until the end of time. No middle ground here. Typical, really. Our relationship was either black or white, so why should this be any different?\n\nAnd hey, maybe he'll turn out to be a prince charming, and they'll live happily ever after.
