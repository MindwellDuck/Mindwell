Like I haven't had enough on my plate already.\n\nI stood outside the conference room, fidgeting with my badge, trying to calm my racing heart. My wife, God bless her, had left me a sweet note this morning telling me she'd be late due to a work thing, but now it was pushing 30 minutes past their usual arrival time.\n\nMy gut told me something was off. It always did when my wife was running late. She'd call, text, or just show up, never leaving me hanging like this. My mind started spinning with worst-case scenarios - did she get into an accident? Did she meet someone else?\n\nI took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for whatever was about to go down. I pushed open the door and slipped inside, trying to look confident as I scanned the room for the department head.\n\n\"Ah, Chief,\" I said, attempting a smile. \"Good morning.\"\n\nHe looked up from his notes, a hint of annoyance on his face. \"Morning, officer. Please, have a seat.\"\n\nI dropped into the chair across from him, trying to appear nonchalant despite the growing knot in my stomach. This wasn't going to be good. Not today.<|eot_id|>",

It never felt this bad without a reason.\n\n\"Sergeant's out sick again,\" someone chimed in from across the room, trying to sound cheerful. I just grunted in response, not bothering to look up.\n\n\"Sick my ass,\" I thought, resentment boiling over. \"He's probably off having fun with his buddies while we're left high and dry. Again.\"\n\nI stormed out of the locker room, leaving behind a trail of tension. My mind was made up - tonight was gonna be a shitshow. It always was when something felt this off."

'Your art isn't good enough,' he'd said, his voice dripping with condescension.\n\nMy husband, John, had always been supportive of my career, but lately, it felt like he was more interested in his own success than mine. His latest business venture was taking off, and I couldn't help but feel like I was just a prop in his game.\n\nI thought back to all the times I'd encouraged him, attended his meetings, and even helped with the marketing. But did he ever return the favor? No, instead, he'd use my passion for art as a way to validate his own accomplishments.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted through the air, transporting me back to happier times. I remembered when we first met, and he'd been so impressed by my artwork. He'd promised to support me, to let me pursue my dreams.\n\nBut now, those promises seemed hollow.\n\nI began to frantically clean up the mess of paintbrushes and canvases, my mind racing with thoughts of revenge. How could I make him see that my art was worth something? That it wasn't just some hobby, but a part of who I was?\n\nAs I scrubbed at a stubborn stain, a sly smile spread across my face. Maybe it was time to take matters into my own hands. Maybe it was time to show him what I was truly capable of.\n\nThe sound of my own laughter sent shivers down my spine. It was a cold, mirthless sound, but it was mine. And in that moment, I knew exactly what I had to do.<|eot_id|>",

It's not like he ever asks about my art anymore.\" She scrubbed harder, the stain seemingly impervious to her efforts. \"But what if... what if I fail? What if no one buys anything? What if it's all for nothing?\"\n\nShe stopped suddenly, looking around her studio as if seeing it for the first time. \"Shit, why am I even doing this?

My patient's chart flashed on the screen, and I felt the familiar knot of anxiety twist in my stomach. Another case of chronic pain, another batch of meds to prescribe, another chance to tell people their lives will get better if they just do this or that.\n\nAs I got dressed, my mind began to wander to all the things I should've done differently.

He's getting worse.' My heart sank, my mind racing with the impossible task ahead.
