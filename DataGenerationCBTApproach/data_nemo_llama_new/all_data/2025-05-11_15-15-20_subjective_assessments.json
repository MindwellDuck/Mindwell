The patient's chart caught his eye - another young adult, barely out of their teenage years, with a diagnosis that would change their life forever.\n\nThe doctor's eyes lingered on the name, \"Alex,\" and the note from Alex's mother, begging him to do everything in his power to save her son. A faint memory of his own childhood, of promises made by parents who couldn't keep them, stirred within him.\n\nAs he began the rounds, he noticed the way the nurse looked at him, with a mixture of pity and respect. He felt a surge of resentment towards her too, for being so far removed from the pain he knew all too well.\n\nAt the next station, a resident asked for his input on the treatment plan, and he found himself nitpicking every detail, as if trying to prove a point to someone who didn't understand what it meant to truly lose someone. The resident's questions were met with curt responses, and the air grew thick with tension.\n\nA low hum of frustration built inside him, until he finally slammed his pen down on the counter, making everyone turn. \"Just do what I say,\" he growled, before turning back to the charts, his eyes scanning the pages with newfound intensity.<|eot_id|>",
