A string of complaints from patients about their medication had already taken up most of his time. As he scanned the latest report, one name caught his eye - Mrs. Johnson, a patient who had been admitted three days ago after a minor surgery.\n\nShe was supposed to be on a simple antibiotic regimen, but now her doctor wanted to change the dosage mid-treatment. The nurse's eyes narrowed as he checked the hospital's electronic medical record system. It seemed someone had incorrectly updated the order, and it wasn't until he called the pharmacy to confirm that he realized the mistake.\n\nA sense of frustration simmered beneath his calm demeanor as he thought about how this was the third miscommunication that day. He took a deep breath and dialed the doctor's extension, hoping to resolve the issue before things escalated further. But as he waited for the doctor to pick up, he couldn't shake off the feeling that the hospital's inefficiencies were slowly draining his energy.<|eot_id|>",

Mrs. Johnson doesn't deserve to be caught in the middle of this clusterfuck because someone couldn't follow simple orders.\" His hands trembled slightly, gripping the pen like a lifeline as he scrawled notes on her chart, underlining each line with an angry flourish. \"This should've been sorted out by now! It's not fucking hard - give the right medicine at the right time!\" He threw the pen down, leaving it to roll across his desk in a frustrated, erratic dance."

Her daughter, Emma, was running late again, and the kitchen was filled with the faint scent of last night's dinner, still lingering on the countertops.\n\nAs she worked, her mind wandered to the conversation they'd had earlier that morning \u2013 about college funds and scholarships. Again. It felt like she was stuck in some kind of never-ending cycle, constantly reassuring Emma that everything would be okay, while secretly wondering if it ever truly would be.\n\nThe timer beeped, signaling that the soup was ready. She ladled it into bowls and set them on the table, where Emma's phone lay, abandoned and forgotten. The silence was oppressive, and for a moment, she felt like she was the only one who remembered the countless promises they'd made to each other \u2013 to support and love, no matter what. Now, it seemed like those promises were nothing more than empty words, lost in the noise of their own busy lives.<|eot_id|>",

She glanced at the clock, then at Emma's phone, lying silent and mocking on the table. \"What if she's not just late... what if something's happened?\" She sighed, running a hand through her hair, leaving it in disarray. \"Goddammit, stop it,\" she whispered to herself, turning off the stove with more force than required."

As they left the store together, he couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd been trying to convince him to spring for the more expensive model all along \u2013 but had ultimately chosen to settle for something less.<|eot_id|>",

You deserve it.\" But his tone felt more like a reflex than genuine praise. She watched as he shook hands with their captain, who was beaming with pride over the successful operation.\n\nAs she sorted through the reports, she noticed a comment from a junior officer about having seen someone suspicious lurking around the scene. Her heart skipped a beat \u2013 that someone was her husband, Alex, who had been on leave after getting into a fender bender a few days ago. She hadn't mentioned it to anyone, thinking it was nothing serious.\n\nThe realization crept up on her like a thief in the night, leaving her feeling hollow and unappreciated.

Her mind raced, filling in the blanks with angry red letters.\n\n*He must've been spying on me,* she thought, her grip tightening around the pen until its plastic body groaned under pressure. *Checking up on me like I'm some rookie who can't handle herself.* She felt a heat rise to her cheeks, anger simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nShe couldn't believe he'd do this, not after everything they'd been through. Not now, when she was finally getting recognition for once. It was bad enough that Mike's praise seemed forced, but Alex? He was supposed to have her back, always. Now it felt like he was stabbing her in the front.\n\nShe slammed the report closed, the sound echoing through the quiet bullpen like a gunshot.
