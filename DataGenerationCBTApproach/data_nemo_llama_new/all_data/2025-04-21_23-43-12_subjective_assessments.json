He was trapped, not by the car or the traffic, but by the relentless barrage of questions that refused to let him go. And he couldn't help but wonder, \"What if this is my life from now on?

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she whispered, \"What am I supposed to do now?\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a challenge, taunting her with the reality of her solitary existence.

The fear that gripped her was not just about losing her husband; it was about losing herself, too.

It's all zeros and ones, isn't that just fucking perfect? Just like him - binary, black or white, no grey areas.\n\nI've tried calling him, messaging him, hell I even tried sending a fucking email because maybe he'd respond to that like some kind of professional, but nothing. Not a damn thing. It's like he's vanished into thin air. And his partner has the audacity to text me about work? Fuck him too!\n\nI keep seeing it all over again - the fights, the socks, the eggshells. I can't fucking breathe in this house without feeling like I'm suffocating under the weight of all those memories. It's not just the silence now, it's the noise. The constant, goddamn noise of everything we had that's now just... gone.\n\nI should care about work, right? I should care about fucking code and deadlines and projects. But how can I when he's out there somewhere, doing who knows what with who knows whom. And here I am, stuck in this goddamn house, staring at this stupid screen like it holds all the answers.\n\nBut you know what? Fuck him. He wants to leave, fine. Let him fucking go. But don't expect me to pick up the pieces and carry on like nothing happened. Because something did happen. Something big, something life-altering, something that's going to take more than a few lines of code to fix.\n\nSo fuck you too, cursor. Blink all you want. I'm not working today. Not tomorrow either. Maybe never again.\""
