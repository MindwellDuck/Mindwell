Instead, he was greeted by a flyer advertising a new line of high-end paints that supposedly rivaled his beloved old favorites. The prices, however, made his eyes widen in disgust \u2013 triple what he'd paid for similar sets back when he first started out.\n\nAs he began browsing through the aisles, he noticed Joe chatting with a young artist, discussing the finer points of modern art techniques. The young man seemed to be genuinely enthusiastic about the new products, completely unaware of their exorbitant cost. \n\nThe artist's gaze lingered on the expensive paints, his mind flashing back to the financial struggles he and his wife had faced during their divorce. He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he thought about how those struggles had forced him to make difficult choices between his passion and his livelihood.\n\nJoe approached him, asking if he needed any assistance, but the artist merely shook his head, feeling like he was being asked to choose between his artistic integrity and his dwindling bank account. With a heavy heart, he turned and left the store, the enticing aroma of paint and creativity now tainted by the memory of his own financial desperation.<|eot_id|>",
