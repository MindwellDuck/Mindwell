As he began explaining the details of his lesson plan, which included displaying provocative student artwork in the school hallways, she felt a wave of disgust wash over her. The idea of exposing sensitive teenage students to such explicit content made her skin crawl. She couldn't help but think about all the hours she'd spent preparing her own students for life outside the classroom, and the thought of someone else potentially undoing that work with reckless abandon was infuriating.<|eot_id|>",

A few minutes later, a young doctor rushed by, looking frazzled, and muttered something under his breath about \"the usual\" complications.
