The woman's careless attitude toward time and respect for colleagues was starting to grate on her nerves, reminiscent of her ex-husband's constant tardiness during their marriage.\n\nThe younger nurse, seemingly oblivious to the older woman's growing frustration, loudly asked the person next to her about the day's schedule. As she responded, her voice boomed across the room, momentarily silencing the quiet hum of conversation. The older woman's eyes narrowed, feeling a familiar spark of irritation ignite within her.\n\nAs the young nurse continued to dominate the conversation, the older woman's thoughts began to wander back to her own life \u2013 the divorce, the empty nest, the exhaustion that seemed to seep into every pore. Her gaze drifted toward the clock on the wall, its steady tick-tock a reminder that some things, like time and respect, never changed.<|eot_id|>",

She frowned slightly, feeling a twinge of annoyance.\n\n\"Must be nice,\" she thought, taking a sip of her coffee, \"to have that kind of freedom, that carelessness.\" Her mind drifted back to her own life, to the days when her husband would saunter in late, apologetic but indifferent. She shook her head slightly, as if shaking off a memory.\n\n\"Well,\" she said aloud, more to herself than anyone else, \"at least someone's enjoying themselves.\" She glanced at the clock again, its hands moving inexorably forward. She sighed internally, feeling a familiar tightness in her chest. \"Some things never change,\" she thought, her gaze lingering on the younger nurse, who seemed entirely absorbed in her conversation."

She hadn't looked at it in a while, but something about the peaceful morning had brought it to mind. As she poured herself a cup of coffee, her hand hesitated above the sugar container, then gently placed the spoon down beside it. The silence of the house felt oppressive, a stark contrast to the familiar hum of conversation and gentle laughter from when he was still by her side.\n\nThe kettle whistled, breaking the stillness.

For a moment, she forgot about the patients waiting for her care, and let herself get lost in the memories of a lifetime, now tinged with emptiness.<|eot_id|>",
