His eyes drifted back to the empty chair across from him, where his wife used to sit during breakfast. He hadn't noticed it before, but the sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the faint scratches on the wooden table edge \u2013 a reminder of her favorite spot.\n\nAs he dried his hands on a towel, his gaze fell upon a small photograph on the counter, taken on their anniversary five years ago. The smile she had given him still lingered on her face, but his own expression felt forced, like he was pretending to be happy. He turned away from the window, feeling the familiar knot in his stomach begin to tighten.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the quiet morning. He hesitated for a moment before answering, his heart rate increasing ever so slightly. It was a colleague from work, calling to discuss an upcoming case. As they chatted, A's mind began to wander back to the scratches on the table, and how much harder it was getting to manage this household alone.<|eot_id|>",

Those scratches on the table... she always had her coffee there, you know? Like they're some sort of fucking tattoo reminding me she's gone.\n\nAnd now, the phone rings. It's gotta be him, right? My colleague from work, calling to talk about that goddamn case we've got coming up next week. But no, it can't just be that. It has to be something more, doesn't it? Maybe he's found out about my fuck-up last month and they're finally gonna can me.\n\nI mean, why else would he call so early in the morning? It's not like we're friends or anything. He probably thinks I'm some kind of charity case now that she's gone. 'Poor old A, can't even keep his shit together without his wife.' Fuck him. And fuck her too, for leaving me here to drown in all this... this emptiness.\n\nI don't know how much longer I can do this, you know? This... this life without her.

She felt a familiar burn in her chest, a slow-burning anger that had nothing to do with the project.\n\nWithout thinking, she deleted the messages, then quickly typed out a response, pouring all her frustration onto the screen. But before she hit send, something stopped her - maybe it was the fear of looking petty, or maybe it was just a fleeting moment of doubt. Whatever it was, she let her hand fall away from the keyboard, and the phone slipped silently back into its cradle.<|eot_id|>",
