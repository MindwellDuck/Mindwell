A quiet confidence had always defined her teaching style \u2013 the kind that commanded respect without needing to shout. Now, as she gazed out at the sea of unfamiliar faces before her, something inside stirred.\n\nHer gaze drifted to a particularly promising student from years ago, whose family had struggled financially and eventually lost their home due to foreclosure. The same struggles she'd faced after her husband's passing, which left her struggling to make ends meet. \n\nAs she began to hand out the assignments, one name caught her eye \u2013 Emily Wilson. She remembered Emily's parents being evicted, and how they'd later receive notice about owing back rent. There was something unsettlingly familiar about seeing the same desperation reflected in Emily's current grades, reminding her own failures to provide stability for her late daughter.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, the carefully constructed walls around her heart cracked open. As the room fell silent, her usually composed voice trembled when speaking Emily's name aloud.<|eot_id|>",

Just looking at it made her stomach churn, like she'd swallowed something sour. She could practically see the eviction notice pinned to their door, hear the echoes of her own past resonating in those three syllables.\n\n*Emily.* It tasted bitter on her tongue, like a curse rather than a name. She felt her grip tighten around the pile of assignments, knuckles turning white. How dare this girl remind her of such failures? As if she didn't have enough trouble trying to keep up appearances, being the paragon of stability amidst these hormonal wrecking balls.\n\nShe took a deep breath, attempting to steady herself. But her heart was pounding like a drum in her chest, screaming at her that something was terribly wrong. This was ridiculous! She wasn't some frail, emotional wreck; she was a professional, dammit!\n\nYet, as she opened her mouth to call out Emily's name, her voice wavered, betraying her composure. She felt the heat rise in her cheeks, anger and embarrassment mingling together. How could this one little girl evoke such chaos within her? It was absurd! But then again, hadn't she always known that happiness was a fragile thing, built on quicksand?\n\nShe huffed, steeling herself against the wave of emotion threatening to consume her. \"Emily Wilson,\" she said, enunciating each syllable with exaggerated care. As if speaking the name aloud could somehow tame it, make it less... *dangerous*."
