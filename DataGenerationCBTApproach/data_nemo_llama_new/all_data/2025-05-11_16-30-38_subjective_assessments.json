The leader of the team, Dr. Patel, cleared his throat before speaking.\n\n\"I'm afraid we've decided to go with Dr. Lee's proposal instead of yours,\" he said, his voice flat and unyielding. \n\nAs the words hung in the air, she felt a coldness spreading through her chest. She tried to process what was happening, but her mind seemed to be stuck in neutral. She glanced at her partner, who sat across the room, sipping his coffee and staring straight ahead.\n\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the air conditioning. She felt like she'd been punched in the gut, the wind knocked out of her lungs. She couldn't bring herself to speak, couldn't muster the energy to ask why her years of hard work had gone unnoticed.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away the minutes until he could collect his things and leave. As he started to write on the blackboard, his mind wandered to the conversation he'd had with his ex-wife the night before.\n\nShe'd mentioned how she was seeing someone new, casually mentioning it like it was no big deal. He'd tried to brush it off, but the words still stung. He felt a familiar knot form in his stomach as he watched one of his students start to get into trouble.\n\nThe kid was loud, out of control, and completely unresponsive to authority. It was a behavior his own son used to exhibit when he was younger, and for a moment, he was transported back to those sleepless nights and endless arguments. The student's antics sparked something inside him, and he found himself biting back a growl as he struggled to regain his composure.\n\nAs the bell rang, signaling the end of the period, he let out a sigh and rubbed the weariness from his eyes. Another day, another dollar, but for now, all he wanted was to escape the pain and find some solace in the quiet of his car.<|eot_id|>",

Without saying a word, he walked over to Jake and slammed a textbook down in front of him, harder than he'd intended. Jake looked up, surprised, but didn't say anything. Just like his ex-wife, no remorse or understanding. He stormed out of the classroom, leaving behind a hushed room full of students who seemed to be judging him silently. \"Great,\" he muttered under his breath, \"Now they all think I'm some kind of tyrant.\""

It's not like it means anything.\"\n\nHe glanced at his watch, then back up at the woman. She was still looking at him, but this time, she smiled slightly before returning her gaze to her book.
