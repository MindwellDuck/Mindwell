My fellow officers, meanwhile, were already engrossed in their own conversations, laughter filling the air as they prepared to depart. I felt a pang of envy at their ease, their ability to shrug off such encounters without a second thought.\n\nI found myself wondering why she was staring so intently. Was it my appearance? My job? Or perhaps something more sinister? I glanced around surreptitiously, but no one else seemed to have noticed our silent exchange. It was just the two of us, and I couldn't help but feel like I was being sized up, measured against some unknown standard.\n\nAs she finally looked away, I felt a shiver run down my spine. It was irrational, I knew that. But there it was nonetheless - that gnawing sense of unease, lingering long after I had locked myself safely inside my patrol car and driven off into the darkness. I tried to tell myself it was just paranoia, but a small voice in the back of my mind whispered otherwise. After all, who was I to compare with others? My job was different, my life was different.
