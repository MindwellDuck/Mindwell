No, she had to go and get herself into a situation where she'd have to call me to bail her out... again.

It was like she thought she could charm her way out of anything. Either she was a master manipulator or just plain oblivious.

Please report to the ICU immediately.\"\n\nThe room erupted into chaos as nurses scrambled to respond. Dr. Lee didn't hesitate; she sprinted towards the ICU, leaving me in her wake. I followed close behind, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nAs we burst into the ICU, I saw the paramedics struggling to stabilize the patient. The air was thick with tension, and I could feel the weight of responsibility settling onto my shoulders.\n\nAnd then, just as we were about to take over, Dr. Lee turned to me, her eyes blazing with a mixture of anger and desperation. \"Get the patient's family on the phone,\" she snapped. \"We need to get this situation under control, and fast.\"\n\nI felt my mind reel as I tried to process the demands being thrown at me. The patient's life hung in the balance, and I was expected to perform miracles.

I almost wanted to reach across the table and wipe that smug smile off his face.\n\nI could feel the heat rising in my cheeks, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest.

Describe how you feel about your career compared to those of your peers.\n\n---\n\nEmily's eyes met her reflection, and she let out a sigh that was part frustration, part exhaustion. \"Jesus Christ,\" she muttered, running a hand through her disheveled hair. She couldn't help but think about Sarah, her old college roommate who'd gone on to become some hotshot editor at a national magazine. Sarah's Instagram was always filled with fancy dinners, designer clothes, and awards ceremonies.\n\nEmily leaned in closer to the mirror, scrutinizing the fine lines around her eyes that seemed to have appeared overnight. \"You're practically a dinosaur compared to her,\" she whispered to herself, feeling the familiar pang of envy mixed with anxiety.\n\nShe turned on the tap, letting the water run cold before splashing some onto her face. \"But who gives a shit about Sarah?\" she said aloud, trying to shake off the comparison. \"This isn't a fucking competition.\" But even as she said it, she knew she was lying to herself. Every time she saw another friend landing a dream job or winning an award, Emily couldn't help but feel like she was falling behind.\n\nShe grabbed her towel and dabbed at her face, feeling the weight of her own words pressing down on her. \"Fuck,\" she sighed again, resigned to another day of feeling like she was playing catch-up in a race she hadn't even known she'd entered."

        "Triggering Event": "As she sat alone at her kitchen table, surrounded by stacks of unpaid bills and unopened letters, Margaret's eyes fell upon the latest notice from the utility company. The words danced before her, a blur of numbers and ink, but one phrase seared itself into her mind: \"Account Overdue - Immediate Payment Required.\"\n\nHer heart racing, Margaret felt a familiar weight settle within her chest. It was a feeling she had grown all too accustomed to over the past year \u2013 a sense of powerlessness, of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of poverty. The stress had taken its toll on her once-sharp mind, now clouded by a perpetual haze of anxiety.\n\nShe thought back to the days when her husband was still alive, when they had worked together as a team, their combined skills earning them a comfortable living. But life had other plans, and he had passed away suddenly, leaving her to navigate the treacherous waters of solo financial management.\n\nMargaret's rage simmered just below the surface, fueled by the knowledge that she was now forced to rely on government assistance just to make ends meet. She felt like a failure, a shadow of the woman she once was. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she wondered how it had come to this \u2013 75 years old, and yet, still struggling to get by.\n\nWith shaking hands, Margaret reached for the phone, her finger hovering over the dial as she hesitated. What was the point of calling? Who would listen? The line seemed to stretch out before her like an endless, hopeless expanse. She slumped back in her chair, the weight of her situation crushing her. The overdue notice might as well have been a death sentence, a constant reminder that she was running out of time.<|eot_id|>",

Her breathing grew shallow, chest tightening as she felt the familiar surge of anger. There was no room for nuance when it came to her financial struggles; people were either helpful or useless, and right now, everyone seemed utterly useless. She couldn't fathom that some might be trying their best within a flawed system, nor could she accept that she had once been able to manage finances just fine \u2013 now, it was either total failure or absolute success, with no shades of gray in between."
