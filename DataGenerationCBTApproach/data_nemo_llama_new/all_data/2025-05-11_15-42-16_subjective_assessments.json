The nurse had been assigned to care for her overnight, but a last-minute transfer meant she would be leaving at 6 am to accommodate another patient's needs.\n\nA cold sweat broke out on her forehead as she mentally rehearsed the chaos that might ensue when the new nurse took over. What if they didn't know the patient's medical history? What if they made a critical mistake during her recovery?\n\nHer mind racing, she glanced at the clock, feeling the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. She took a deep breath, trying to push the thoughts aside, but her heart rate remained steady, betraying her attempts to calm down.<|eot_id|>",

Instead, she's acting like she doesn't know what to say, like she's afraid to acknowledge my loss.\n\nAnd Tom, my old friend and colleague, he should be the same old Tom.
