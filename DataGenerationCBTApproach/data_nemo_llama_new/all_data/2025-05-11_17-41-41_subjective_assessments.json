The classroom, once filled with the quiet hum of students awaiting his lecture, now buzzed with whispers and sniggers.

After all, there was no in-between here; either he salvaged the lesson, or it was a total loss.\n\nHe glared at the student who'd made the snide remark, his mind instantly labeling her as 'the rude one.'
