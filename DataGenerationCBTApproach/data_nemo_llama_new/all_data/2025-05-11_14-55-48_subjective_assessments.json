The conversation was familiar, yet it only seemed to highlight the gap between her own research and the cutting-edge work being showcased.\n\nAs Rachel mentioned the upcoming publication of her team's findings, she couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. She had spent countless hours perfecting her own experiments, only to have them consistently underfunded and overlooked by the department. The same issues that had plagued her for years \u2013 lack of resources, inadequate support, and a general disregard for her contributions \u2013 still lingered.\n\nThe quiet hum of the laboratory equipment seemed to grow louder, echoing the sense of disappointment and resentment that had been building inside her. Her eyes drifted away from the microscope, focusing instead on the faint smudge on the edge of the slide. It was a small imperfection, one that might be easily overlooked by others, but to her, it represented the tiny cracks in the system that allowed her colleagues to succeed while she struggled to make headway.\n\nWithout thinking, she reached out to touch the slide, her fingers tracing the outline of the smear. The sensation was almost primal, a desperate attempt to reconnect with something tangible amidst the sea of frustration and disillusionment. As she stood there, lost in thought, the world around her began to fade into the background, leaving only the dull ache of bitterness that had taken up residence in her chest.<|eot_id|>",

This is just the final nail in my coffin.\"\n\nHe didn't need any proof \u2013 the pattern was clear enough. It was always like this; they never appreciated his hard work here. He could feel the familiar heat of resentment building, threatening to boil over.\n\nWithout even realizing he'd made up his mind, Alex started drafting a resignation email. He couldn't stand another minute of this charade, not when he knew they were just waiting for him to leave. He was tired of being taken for granted, tired of watching others reap the rewards of his labor.\n\nBut first, he needed to vent. He grabbed his phone and opened a message thread with his best friend from college, the one who always listened without judgment. Alex started typing out his grievances, each word punctuated by the pounding of his heart against his ribcage.\n\n*I guess they've finally found someone willing to do my job for less,* he wrote, already convinced that this was the case despite having no concrete evidence. *Guess it's time for me to move on.*"
