The light changed, and they crossed the street together, but the gap between them felt vast and unbridgeable.\n\nAs she turned onto her street, she saw her neighbor's house, all lit up, books stacked high on the windowsill. She knew he was working on his memoir, had even offered to read it when he finished. But what did he need with her novice attempts? His stories were important, while hers... hers were just a child's plaything.\n\nShe let herself into her apartment, tossing her coat onto the couch.
