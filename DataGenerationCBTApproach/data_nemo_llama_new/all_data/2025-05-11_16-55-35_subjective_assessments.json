The patient's name was crossed out, replaced by a hastily scrawled note: 'Code Blue \u2013 Failed Resuscitation.' A faint scent of disinfectant lingered, mingling with the faint smell of her husband's cologne on her uniform.\n\nHer mind replayed the frantic phone call from the nurse, the urgency in her voice still echoing in her ears. 'We've lost him, Doctor... we couldn't get his heart back...' As she'd rushed into the room, she'd seen her husband slumped over the bedside table, his eyes frozen in a permanent stare.\n\nA wave of guilt washed over her, followed by a creeping sense of dread. She thought about the countless rounds of 'Do-not-resuscitate' orders they'd discussed before his admission, the assurances he'd given her. But had she really believed them? Had she ever truly accepted the possibility?\n\nThe sound of footsteps outside broke the silence, and she turned away from the chart, her gaze drifting toward the door as if searching for an escape from the memories that threatened to consume her.<|eot_id|>",
