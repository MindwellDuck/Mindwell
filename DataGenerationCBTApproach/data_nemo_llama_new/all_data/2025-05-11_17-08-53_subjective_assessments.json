A 911 call from a domestic violence incident had gone horribly wrong, resulting in the death of both victims - a young couple, barely out of their twenties.\n\nThe officer couldn't shake off the memory of the countless calls he'd responded to like this over the years. The same story, different faces. The same senseless loss, the same shattered lives. He thought about his own life, his empty apartment, the late-night shifts, and the crushing loneliness that seemed to seep into every pore.\n\nAs he watched, a group of protesters gathered across the street, holding signs that read 'Justice for the Innocent' and 'End Domestic Violence'. Their chants echoed through the air, but it was drowned out by the officer's own internal monologue, where he wondered if anyone would ever truly make a difference, or if he'd be stuck in this never-ending cycle of pain forever.<|eot_id|>",
