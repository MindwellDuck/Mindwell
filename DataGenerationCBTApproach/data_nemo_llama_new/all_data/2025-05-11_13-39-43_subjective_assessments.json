The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach. His wife had been on his case all morning about getting the grading done, but he couldn't shake off the sense of inadequacy that had been building up since his student's parents complained about their child's recent test results.\n\nAs he mechanically began to grade the papers, his mind kept wandering back to the conversation he'd overheard between two colleagues earlier that day. They were talking about how they'd both managed to secure promotions and raises while he was stuck in the same old role. The sting of it still lingered, making him feel like he was somehow failing in his own life.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from his wife, reminding him that she'd be home early from work and expected to see the grading done by then. He felt a wave of anxiety wash over him as he realized he still had hours of work ahead, and the thought of facing her disappointment was almost too much to bear.<|eot_id|>",

Lovely.\" His mind fixated on the one completed task, the mountain of work ahead seemed insurmountable. The hum of the fluorescent lights grew louder, more intrusive. He couldn't shake the feeling that each ungraded paper was a testament to his failure, a silent accusation of his inadequacy. \"Promotions,\" he scoffed, scribbling a 'B+' on another paper, \"As if they know what it's like, stuck here with these... these reminders of my stagnation.\" He barely noticed the stack of completed papers growing beside him, his focus solely on the next ungraded task. His wife's text message buzzed again, but he let it go unanswered, lost in his mental filter of doom and gloom."

He had been waiting for her under the awning across the street, nursing his third cup of coffee in as many hours. The text message he'd received earlier that morning still lingered in his mind like an unwanted echo.\n\n\"Be careful tonight,\" it had read. No name, no number, just those four words that seemed to carry a heavier weight than they should have. He tried to brush it off as some prankster from the force, but the chill that ran down his spine refused to dissipate.\n\nEmily approached him with her usual smile, but today it didn't quite reach her eyes. \"Ready for another long night?\" she asked, falling into step beside him as they headed towards their unmarked car.\n\nThompson glanced at her, taking in her confident stride and the determined set of her jaw. Yet, despite her outward poise, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. It wasn't just the text message; it was all those other times when suspects had slipped through their fingers like sand.\n\nHe thought about the 'Carlton' case \u2013 how they'd spent weeks tracking down leads only to find out the suspect had vanished into thin air, leaving behind nothing but empty apartments and dead-end trails. And what about 'Greenwood'? They'd been so sure they had him cornered, but somehow, he'd managed to give them the slip right under their noses.\n\nHis mind continued to race back through other cases, each one a reminder of how quickly situations could spiral out of control. As Emily slid into the driver's seat and started the engine, Thompson felt an unsettling sense of foreboding wash over him. This was it; another night where anything could happen, where they could be caught off guard once again.\n\nHe took a deep breath, steeling himself for what lay ahead. \"Let's get this show on the road,\" he said, his voice steady despite the turmoil within. Little did he know, tonight would turn out to be one of those nights that would forever change their perception of 'always' and 'never'."

Now, he was left alone to finish it, wondering if anyone would even care.\n\nThe phone on his desk rang, snapping him out of his reverie. His colleague, Dr. Patel, asked about the status of their research. He hesitated, unsure how much to share. The truth was, he hadn't made any progress in months.\n\n\"Ah, sorry, Raj,\" he said finally. \"I've just...been dealing with some personal stuff.\"\n\nRaj's voice was sympathetic, but he could sense the hesitation on the other end. \"Take all the time you need,\" he said. \"We'll catch up soon.\"\n\nAs he hung up, the microscope seemed to loom over him, reminding him of the countless hours he'd spent working alongside his partner.
