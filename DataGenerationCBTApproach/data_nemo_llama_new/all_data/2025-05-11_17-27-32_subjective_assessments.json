They seemed out of place among the older crowd, laughing and chatting as if they owned the store. The woman with the expensive clothing caught his eye again, this time with a mixture of annoyance and entitlement.\n\nShe picked up another bag, one from a different brand, and asked him to price it for her. As he rang it up, she complained about the quality, claiming it was 'inferior' compared to the first one. He politely corrected her, explaining the return policy, but she insisted on speaking to his manager. \n\nThe young couple, now waiting in line behind her, started whispering to each other, snickering about someone else's shopping cart being full of discounted items. Their mocking tone carried across the store, drawing more attention to the woman's growing agitation. She finally stormed off, leaving the young couple looking smug, and him feeling slightly annoyed and irritated.<|eot_id|>",
