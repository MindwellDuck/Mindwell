A fleeting thought of his own relationship crossed his mind, but he quickly pushed it aside, thinking he wasn't ready to discuss anything personal.\n\nLater that evening, while walking home from work, he noticed her \u2013 a woman sitting alone at a small caf\u00e9, sipping a coffee and staring intently at her phone. The dim lighting highlighted the curve of her neck, and for a moment, their eyes met. He felt a jolt, but before he could process what had happened, she looked away and took another sip, lost in her own thoughts.\n\nAs he continued walking, he couldn't shake off the feeling of unease, wondering if there was something wrong with him, or if it was something else entirely. The city seemed quieter than usual, the sounds muffled by the hum of his footsteps on the pavement. His mind wandered back to Alex's words about being single again, and he found himself pondering the possibility of what could be happening in his own life.<|eot_id|>",

What if she was waiting for someone? What if that someone never came? His steps echoed louder, each one pounding out another 'what if'. What if he had stopped to talk to her? Would she have smiled, or would she have looked away again, uninterested?\n\nThe streetlights seemed harsher now, their glow casting harsh shadows on the faces of passersby. He wondered if they too were plagued by these relentless questions. What if his relationship was like Alex's? What if tomorrow brought another 'what if' that he couldn't ignore? His mind spun in circles, each one tightening around him like a noose.\n\nHe reached his apartment door, the key turning with a harsh scrape of metal against metal. The silence inside was deafening, mocking his restless thoughts. He tossed his keys onto the table, the clatter echoing his inner turmoil. What if tomorrow brought another 'what if'?"

He felt like he was drowning in a sea of despair, unable to find a lifeline to cling to.\n\nAs he read through the report again, a particular line caught his eye: \"No evidence of cancer, but severe organ damage.\" Severe organ damage that could have been prevented if only...if only he'd seen it sooner. If only...\n\nHis gaze drifted away from the report, and he let out a slow breath. His wife's hand tightened around his knee, but she didn't say a word. They both knew what was coming next.

I sat at my desk, the hospital report still clutched in my hand, its ink blurring before my eyes. Another life lost under my watch, another family shattered.\n\nI heard glasses clinking and soft chuckles from across the hall. Dr. Thompson was celebrating another victory, no doubt. My gaze drifted towards his open door, taking in the scene - the smiles, the champagne, the relief etched on every face. It was a stark contrast to the heaviness in my own office.\n\nI felt a pang of envy, sharp and unexpected. Why wasn't that me? Why weren't my patients celebrating another successful surgery? Why was it always so hard for me?\n\nI turned back to the report, tracing the lines with my finger, wishing I could erase them, rewrite them. But every line seemed like a testament to my failure. Another patient lost on my watch.\n\nAs Dr. Thompson's laughter echoed down the hall, I couldn't help but compare our outcomes. He seemed to breeze through cases while I struggled, sank, drowned.
