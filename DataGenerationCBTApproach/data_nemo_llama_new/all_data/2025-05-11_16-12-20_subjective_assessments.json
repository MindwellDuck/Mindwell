She hadn't seen him all week, and their usual dinner plans had fallen through.\n\nAs she walked home, the cool evening air did little to lift her mood. The streets were quiet, save for the distant hum of traffic on the highway. Her phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, inviting her to grab drinks after work tomorrow.
