The faint scent of antiseptic and the soft hum of the hospital equipment faded into the background as she frantically scanned the notes, searching for any sign of error.\n\nHer husband's words echoed in her mind: \"You're not getting any younger, and these mistakes can't keep happening.\" She felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach, one she'd grown accustomed to over the years, but it still managed to suffocate her.\n\nA gentle tap on her shoulder broke the spell, and she turned to see their team leader approaching. \"Everything okay?\" he asked, his expression a mixture of concern and expectation. She forced a smile, trying to conceal the turmoil brewing inside, but the weight of her mistakes seemed to settle heavier on her shoulders.<|eot_id|>",

A young nurse, new to the ward, approached him with a concerned expression. \"Sir, I need you to sign off on these charts,\" she said, holding out a stack of papers.\n\nAs he took the papers, their fingers touched briefly, sending a spark of annoyance through him. He felt a familiar burn in his chest, one he'd learned to suppress over the years but couldn't quite shake.\n\nThe new nurse's tone was clipped, her words measured, as if she expected him to be grateful for her help. It wasn't that she was rude; it was just... efficient. Too much like his wife when they were first together, always so put-together, never a moment to spare.\n\nHis mind began to wander back to their conversation earlier, about whose turn it was to take out the trash. She'd mentioned it casually, as if it was no big deal, but he'd felt a twinge of resentment nonetheless. Now, as he signed the charts, he caught himself wishing he could tell her \u2013 not that anything would come of it, but just to let it all out.\n\nThe new nurse handed him the papers, her eyes flicking to his before quickly looking away. For a moment, their gazes locked, and he felt a jolt of spite. Not at her, exactly; at the way things had been lately, at the little frustrations that added up to feel like a lot more than they should.<|eot_id|>",
