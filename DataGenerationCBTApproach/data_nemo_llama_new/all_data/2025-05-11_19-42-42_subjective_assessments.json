As he began to set up his easel, he noticed the familiar smell of turpentine and oil paints wafting through the air, but it was quickly overpowered by the pungent aroma of last week's Chinese takeout left behind by his roommate.\n\nThe smell seemed to transport him back to his wife's passing, the overwhelming scent of her perfume lingering long after she'd been gone. He remembered how she used to make him laugh, even on his worst days, and how she'd always be there to offer a comforting smile when he came home reeking of paint and turpentine.\n\nBut now, as he stood amidst the half-finished canvases and scattered art supplies, the smell brought nothing but bitter memories. He felt a wave of disgust wash over him, his stomach churning at the thought of sharing this space with someone else, of living a life without her by his side.<|eot_id|>",
