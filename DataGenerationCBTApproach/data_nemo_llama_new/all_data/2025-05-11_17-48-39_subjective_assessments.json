A nurse's frantic voice echoed through the hallway as she rushed past, apologizing profusely for the mess. The doctor's eyes darted towards the patient's room, where her partner was sitting by their bedside, holding their hand.\n\nAs she watched, a young intern, probably fresh out of medical school, hesitantly approached the group. His eyes locked onto hers, and he cleared his throat to speak. \"I'm so sorry, Doctor... I didn't mean to interrupt. I was trying to find the medication log for patient three \u2013\"\n\nThe words trailed off as the doctor's gaze fell upon the chart in her hand, and her eyes widened in horror. She felt a wave of shame wash over her, a familiar, suffocating sensation. Her mind flashed back to the countless times she'd made mistakes like this, the patients who'd suffered because of her carelessness. She took a deep breath, attempting to compose herself, but it was too late. The damage was done.<|eot_id|>",

Like it was her fault he couldn't keep track of his charts.\n\nShe scoffed, shaking her head. \"I should've known better than to leave them unsupervised,\" she thought, avoiding eye contact with the intern. She felt a twinge of annoyance at having to deal with this now, on top of everything else. It was always something with these kids. Always something for her to fix or clean up.\n\nAs he apologized again, she waved him off dismissively. \"Just get it cleaned up already,\" she snapped, turning away from him. She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks, that familiar feeling of embarrassment washing over her. Again. Because of them. Because of their incompetence.\n\nShe stormed off down the hall, leaving the intern to his mess. \"Fucking hell,\" she muttered again, under her breath. Always something for her to deal with.

She could see it in Rachel's concerned glances, hear it in the pauses that lingered too long before someone spoke up with another issue to address. Each \"Unable to replicate results\" echoed like a grim mantra in her mind.\n\nShe tried to refocus, but her thoughts were sludge, heavy and slow. \"Failure,\" she whispered silently, testing the word on her tongue as if it were a bitter pill she'd been forced to swallow. Her hands shook slightly as she typed out responses, each keystroke feeling like a confession of her inadequacy.\n\nAisha felt like a fraud, a charade playing out in slow motion.

He didn't care. Let them all leave. They couldn't hurt him anymore than they already had.\n\nHe stood alone in the kitchen, his reflection staring back at him from the polished stainless steel.
