He was practically MIA until things started getting heated. And don't even get me started on that text he got \u2013 'See you soon', my ass.\" I scoff, leaning forward to rest my elbows on the desk.\n\n\"And sure, yeah, sometimes he's there for me.

Maybe I'm just being too sensitive.\" I shrug, but the knot in my stomach stays tight."
