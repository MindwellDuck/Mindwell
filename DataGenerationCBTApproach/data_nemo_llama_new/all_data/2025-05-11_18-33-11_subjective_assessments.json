Rejection letter, plain text. No explanation, no feedback. Just a curt dismissal. His phone buzzed with a social media notification \u2013 another friend's artwork had been featured, garnering dozens of likes and comments. He scrolled through their feed, feeling a familiar knot form in his stomach as he wondered why his own art wasn't being recognized.

He read it again, as if expecting different words to materialize like some magical ink. But no, there they were: \"We regret to inform you...\" The familiar chill of rejection seeped into his bones, and he could almost see the future - a bleak landscape where his art gathered dust in obscurity.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers beneath his chin. \"Well,\" he mused aloud, \"I suppose I should start packing up my studio now. No point in wasting more time on something that's doomed to failure.\" His voice was calm, almost conversational, but there was an undercurrent of bitter sarcasm.\n\nHe swiveled his chair to face the blank canvas propped against the wall. \"Perhaps I'll start on my 'Obituary Series' instead,\" he continued, feigning enthusiasm. \"After all, if this is what success looks like, then I might as well embrace defeat.\" He chuckled softly, a sound devoid of humor.\n\nHis gaze flicked back to the email, his eyes lingering on that final sentence: \"We wish you luck in your future endeavors.\" He scoffed internally. *Luck*, he thought. *As if luck has anything to do with this.* He felt a wave of dread wash over him as he imagined himself years from now, still striving for recognition while everyone else celebrated their own successes.\n\nYet despite the doomsday forecast playing out in his mind, there was no panic, no urge to change course. Instead, he stood up, squared his shoulders, and said aloud, \"Well, I suppose tomorrow is another day to fail spectacularly.\" And with that, he turned off the lights and left his studio, closing the door softly behind him, as if closing out the inevitable doom he had predicted for himself."
