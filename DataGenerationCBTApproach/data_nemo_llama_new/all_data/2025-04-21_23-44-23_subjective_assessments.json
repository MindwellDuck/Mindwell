As she pushed aside yellowed papers and outdated headlines, a crumpled notebook caught her eye. It belonged to her now-departed colleague, Rachel.\n\nAs she flipped through the pages, a familiar phrase jumped out at her - 'I can never forgive you.' The handwriting was unmistakable, but what really stuck was the date - their last meeting before Rachel left the paper, abruptly citing 'creative differences.'\n\nIt had been ten years since then, yet the words still stung. Emily remembered the argument, the way Rachel's voice rose as she accused Emily of sabotaging her work. They'd been friends once, bonding over late-night stories and coffee-fueled brainstorming sessions.\n\nNow, as Emily read the note again, she felt a pang in her chest. She recalled the phone call after it all fell apart, where Rachel curtly told Emily that everything they'd shared was just a 'business arrangement,' no deeper connection ever existed between them.\n\nEmily closed her eyes, letting the memories wash over her. She remembered the countless hours spent chasing down leads, working tirelessly to meet deadlines, and the unwavering support Rachel showed her during those early days.\n\nBut beneath it all lay a subtle resentment - the feeling that Emily had let Rachel down, failed to live up to the promise of their friendship. It wasn't until now, ten years later, when the nostalgia hit her like a tidal wave, did she realize how much she'd been carrying around this burden all these years.\n\nWith shaking hands, Emily carefully tucked the notebook back into its hiding spot, wondering why it took so long for her to confront the truth. Maybe someday she'd find closure; maybe someday she could learn to forgive herself.<|eot_id|>",

They were partners, for Christ's sake. They were supposed to be in this together. But no, Rachel had to go and act like some petulant child, storming off over a fucking argument.\n\nEmily could still hear Rachel's voice echoing in her mind, accusing her of sabotaging her work. Bullshit! She would never do that. They were on the same team, goddammit. Emily should've been able to trust her, and Rachel should've trusted her too.\n\nShe shouldn't have had to carry this guilt around for ten fucking years. It wasn't fair. None of it was fair. Emily deserved better than this. She deserved a friend who would stand by her, not one who'd throw her under the bus at the first sign of trouble.\n\nAs she tucked the notebook back into its hiding spot, Emily felt a surge of anger mingling with the sadness. It shouldn't be like this. Their friendship should've been stronger than this. Rachel should've fought for them, and Emily should've demanded more from her friend.\n\nBut life wasn't fair, was it? And now, here she was, ten years later, still fucking hurting over something that was never even her fault to begin with. Fuck you, Rachel, Emily thought bitterly as she walked away from the file cabinets, leaving behind a piece of her heart amidst the yellowed papers and outdated headlines."

His mind began to wander to his own wedding day, the way his wife used to laugh at him, the smell of her perfume...\n\nA faint scent wafted through the air, reminiscent of his late wife's signature fragrance. John's grip on the shelf tightened, his knuckles whitening as memories he thought he'd long buried resurfaced. He couldn't help but notice the young couple's behavior \u2013 always together, holding hands, and smiling.\n\nFeeling a pang of resentment, John cleared his throat and returned to work, his movements mechanical.

They should have been celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary today, not him standing alone in a store that was becoming more like a mausoleum with each passing day.\n\nHe couldn't help but think they should have known better than to flaunt their happiness so brazenly. Didn't they know it was rude to be happy around someone who wasn't? He should have been able to enjoy seeing others in love, not feel this...this emptiness gnawing at him.\n\nHis wife's perfume, or rather the ghost of it, lingered in the air like a taunting specter. It shouldn't still affect him like this. He should be stronger by now, shouldn't he? Five years was enough time to heal, wasn't it?\n\nHe watched as they walked away, their laughter echoing through the store like a mocking chorus. They should have understood that their happiness was a reminder of what he didn't have anymore. They should have been quieter, more considerate.\n\nBut no, they were just like everyone else - oblivious to his pain, blind to his silent suffering.

He couldn't help but feel every glance, every smile was a silent reproach, a reminder of what he'd lost. The barista handed him his coffee with a cheerful \"Have a great day!\" He scowled, taking the cup. Did she have to be so damn happy when he felt like this? It was like they were all conspiring against him, forcing him to remember."
