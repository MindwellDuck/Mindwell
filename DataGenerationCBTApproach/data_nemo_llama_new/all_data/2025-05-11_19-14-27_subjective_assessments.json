The faded blue paint seemed to mock him now, a constant reminder he'd never be able to afford repairs. A new engine, a new transmission \u2013 all would be too expensive. He thought back to the countless nights he spent patrolling these streets as a younger officer, the thrill of the job still alive in his veins. Now, at sixty-five, he was just another retired man struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAs he watched, a young couple drove by, laughing and holding hands. The man behind the wheel, probably half his age, grinned at his passenger, oblivious to the struggles just a few feet away. The old officer's jaw clenched, fists tightening at his sides as he felt the familiar burn of anger rising up.<|eot_id|>",

It wasn't fair that she got the promotion \u2013 they'd worked together on countless projects, and he knew he deserved it just as much as she did.\n\nShe stood up, closing her laptop, and began to walk towards him. \"Hey, great to see you,\" she said, extending a hand. \"I've been meaning to discuss the upcoming meeting with you.\"\n\nHe shook her hand, his grip firm, but his mind already racing ahead to all the things that could go wrong.
