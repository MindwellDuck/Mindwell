Her mind kept drifting back to the conversation she had with Principal Smith earlier that morning - a casual comment about a potential new curriculum change, which had led him to suggest she might be too old-fashioned for the role.\n\nAs she took a seat at the conference table, eyes met hers across from Mrs. Johnson, a colleague of over twenty years who had always been supportive. But now, as they exchanged pleasantries, the teacher couldn't shake off the feeling that Mrs. Johnson was trying to tell her something with her knowing smile and gentle tone - that maybe it was time to consider stepping aside, to let someone younger take the reins.\n\nThe principal began the meeting, and the teacher listened mechanically as he outlined the proposed changes. She felt like an outsider looking in, her heart sinking with each passing minute. The room seemed to fade away, leaving only the echo of Mrs. Johnson's sympathetic glance, and the nagging sense that perhaps she wasn't cut out for this job after all.<|eot_id|>",

They're just 'nice words' that don't actually prove anything.\"\n\nShe picked up a note from little Timmy's mom, gushing about how much he loved Ms. Thompson's class this year. \"Pfft,\" she scoffed, crumpling the paper and tossing it aside. \"Anyone can write nice things. It doesn't mean I'm doing my job any better than last year.\" She paused, her gaze landing on a framed photo of herself accepting an award for 'Teacher of the Year'. \"That was a fluke,\" she muttered, turning away from the picture.\n\nAs she poured herself a glass of wine, she took a deep breath. \"I just need to prepare for the worst. They'll probably tell me I'm too set in my ways, that I need to 'adapt' or something.\" She took a sip, her expression souring. \"But I've been doing this for twenty years.
