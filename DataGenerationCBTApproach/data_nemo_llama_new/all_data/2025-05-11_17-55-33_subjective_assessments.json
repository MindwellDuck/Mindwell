Her ex-husband's hands moved deftly as he chopped vegetables, their banter and laughter filling the air. She had cooked his favorite dinner that evening, just like she used to.\n\nAs she began preparing tonight's menu, her eyes fell upon the old cookbook they'd shared, its pages dog-eared and stained with sauce. A memory of him praising her cooking, telling her it was the best meal he'd ever had, flashed before her mind's eye. The warmth and love in his voice now seemed insincere, a manipulation to keep her tied to him.\n\nHer hands stilled, the knife hovering above the cutting board. She felt a familiar pang in her chest, one she thought she'd long since learned to manage. But the scent of butter and flour brought it rushing back, and for a moment, the kitchen around her melted away, leaving only the bitter taste of resentment.<|eot_id|>",

Not just for herself, but also for her late husband, who had always been her biggest supporter. He was no longer there to offer words of encouragement or share in her triumphs. A faint smile crept onto her face as she recalled his gentle critiques and suggestions, which had often helped shape her art into something more refined.\n\nA wave of regret washed over her, mingling with the sting of frustration.
