But no, today I totally lost it.\n\nSo, we had this patient come in, and she was having some major issues with her meds. I mean, we'd already adjusted them like three times before, but she just couldn't seem to shake off this awful rash. And I swear, every time I looked at those poor skin cells under the microscope, my mind started racing.\n\nI kept thinking about Sarah - my partner, my rock. We've been together for over a decade, and I thought we were solid. But then I saw him today, talking to her, laughing with her... and I felt this pang of jealousy. Like, why was he there? What did they talk about?\n\nAnd it wasn't even a big thing! Just small talk, catching up. But somehow it felt so much bigger than that. It felt like he was replacing me or something. And I hate that feeling. I hate knowing I'm not the center of his universe anymore.\n\nAfter the patient left, I just snapped. I slammed my hand down on the counter, making everyone jump. They all looked at me like I'd lost it, which, honestly, I probably did. I stormed out of the room, leaving my team looking after the patient. I don't even remember how long I stood there, staring blankly into space, trying to process everything.\n\nIt's just... sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself in all of this. Like I'm just a cog in the machine, churning out diagnoses and prescriptions without any real connection to the people I'm helping. And when I see other doctors, working together seamlessly, I wonder if that's where I went wrong.\n\nSarah's always telling me to take care of myself, to prioritize my own well-being. But it's hard when you're stuck in this rut. When you feel like you're failing everyone around you. Especially when you start to doubt your own abilities.\n\nI guess what really gets me is that I'm not even sure what I want to do about it. Part of me wants to throw in the towel, walk away from it all. But another part of me feels like I owe it to Sarah, to our relationship, to keep going. To prove to myself that I can make a difference.\n\nWhatever it is, I know I need to figure it out soon. Before things get any worse.<|eot_id|>",

It's not like I have a goddamn sign on my back that says 'Trash Duty Bitch.'\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like he looks at me and just sees a walking chore chart. Like I'm not even his partner anymore, but some kind of domestic robot he programs to do all the shitty tasks around the house.\n\nAnd now here we are, sitting in silence, him sulking on the couch with his stupid game, and me stewing over here in the kitchen, washing these goddamn dishes like they're somehow responsible for our fight.

We hadn't spoken in months, but apparently, our mutual friends' Instagram posts were just too much to bear.\n\nShe spotted me from across the room and flashed that fake smile, like we used to be besties or something. Newsflash, Rach: we weren't. But hey, who needs actual feelings when you've got a decent filter?\n\nWe exchanged awkward hellos, and I couldn't help but notice how effortlessly she'd dropped 10 pounds since our divorce. I mean, it's not like I'm jealous or anything... Nope, not at all. It's just that, wow, she looks so... healthy now.\n\nAs we ordered our drinks, I noticed she was sitting down at our favorite table by the window. Like, what are the chances? It's not like the universe has a personal vendetta against us or anything. I decided to make the most of it and sat down across from her, ready to rehash old memories and pretend everything was fine.\n\nBut then, she starts telling me about her new boyfriend \u2013 some brooding artist type who's clearly way out of his league. And I'm just sitting there, listening to her gush about him, thinking, \"Wow, Rach, you really have moved on... to someone who's probably going to break your heart within a week.\"\n\nI forced a laugh, trying to play it cool, but inside, I was seething. Who does she think she is, anyway? The queen of rebound relationships? I made a mental note to look up her new beau online later, just to see if he's as artsy as she claims.\n\nAs we parted ways, she tossed me a condescending wave, like I was some kind of sad, divorced loser. Well, let me tell you, Rach, I may not have your perfect little life together, but at least I don't need to resort to dating guys who think they're poets just because they can string together a few pretentious words.\n\nOh wait, I forgot \u2013 she's already doing that.<|eot_id|>",

The 'divorced loser' table by the window, the pitying glances from the barista who used to greet me with a smile. I'm not that person anymore. But here comes Rachel, waltzing in like she owns the place, expecting me to just roll over and play nice.\n\nI can't believe I even sat down with her. What was I thinking? Oh right, like an idiot, I thought maybe we could catch up, be civil... Ha! How stupid of me. She's not interested in catching up \u2013 she's interested in rubbing her perfect little life in my face.\n\nAnd that boyfriend of hers? Please. He's probably some hipster wanna-be who thinks he can just waltz into Rachel's life and make it all better. Well, newsflash, buddy: you're not special. You're just the flavor of the month.\n\nI swear, if I have to sit there and watch another one of Rachel's relationships implode in spectacular fashion, I'm gonna lose it. She thinks she can label me as some washed-up has-been? Fine. But don't think for a second that I've forgotten who really ended things between us \u2013 and why.\n\nI guess some people never change.

Every article he worked on, every investigative report, seemed to get swallowed whole by the system. He'd always said it was worth fighting for the truth, but now it felt like a futile exercise.\n\nSarah's eyes wandered around the cluttered office, taking in the familiar scent of stale coffee and yesterday's news clippings.

Maybe, just maybe, this was why she kept going \u2013 to keep telling those stories, no matter how pointless it all seemed.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Sarah began to rework her husband's final draft, determined to see it through, even if it killed her.<|eot_id|>",

And now, they'd taken even that away from him.\n\nSarah's fingers traced the outline of his wedding band on her own finger, the metal cool and smooth under her touch.

I glared at him, because what's a little marital bliss without a healthy dose of resentment?\n\n\"You know exactly why,\" I snapped, my voice low enough to ensure he didn't hear the full-blown scream brewing inside me.\n\nHe looked taken aback, but only for a nanosecond before he launched into some saccharine nonsense about 'tough days' and 'we're in this together.'

We're married, not best buds.\n\nI bit back a retort, opting instead to storm into the kitchen and pour myself a glass of wine, which I promptly proceeded to slam against the counter with such force that the windows rattled.

Respect for the time and effort I've put into this kitchen, respect for the love I pour into every dish, and most of all, respect for the fact that I'm still the one bringing home the bacon.\n\nSo yeah, today's been a real hoot. Can't wait to see what other 'surprises' she's got planned for me tomorrow.\""

        "Triggering Event": "I'd been waiting outside her apartment for hours, my foot tapping against the cracked sidewalk. That damn fool had finally decided to come home.\n\nAs I watched through the peephole, she walked out, oblivious to the hell she was about to unleash. Her stupid little boyfriend, thinking he could just waltz back into our lives like nothing ever happened. Newsflash, buddy: you're not welcome here.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but it was no use. My mind was racing with all the ways I could hurt him. Make him beg for mercy. Make him wish he never crossed me.\n\nShe opened the door, and I slipped inside, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of him. He was sitting on the couch, looking smug as always, like he owned the place. I spotted him and my blood started boiling.\n\n\"You think you can just walk away from this?\" I spat at her, my voice low and menacing. \"You think you can just leave me like I'm nothing?\"\n\nHer eyes darted between us, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of fear. But then she stepped forward, placing a hand on his arm.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey,\" she said, her voice weak. \"I didn't mean to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Hurt me?\" I laughed, the sound cold and mirthless. \"You have no idea what hurt feels like. You've been playing me like a fool for years, and now you get to just waltz back in here and act like everything's fine?\"\n\nHe looked up at me, a mixture of fear and defiance in his eyes. And in that moment, I knew I had him right where I wanted him.\n\n\"Get out,\" I growled, my voice barely above a whisper. \"Both of you. Get out before I lose my temper completely.\"<|eot_id|>",

She was supposed to be loyal, not fucking me over for some douchebag. I clenched my fists, nails digging into palms. This shit wasn't right. She should've known better than to bring him here, to our place. \"Goddammit, Sarah!\" I shouted, slamming my hand against the wall. \"You're supposed to be different. You're supposed to be mine.\""
