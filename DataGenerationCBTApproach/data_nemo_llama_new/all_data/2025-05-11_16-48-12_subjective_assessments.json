Her mind wandered back to the case she'd been working on, a string of burglaries in the area where the elderly residents seemed particularly vulnerable.\n\nAs she pondered the possible motives and suspects, her gaze drifted to the photo on her mantle \u2013 a faded picture of her late husband, smiling and proud as he pinned her badge during her swearing-in ceremony all those years ago. A pang of worry settled in the pit of her stomach as she wondered if she was making the right decisions, if she was doing enough to keep herself safe, and if it was all worth the stress.\n\nThe sound of her phone buzzing broke the spell, and she hesitated before answering, her heart sinking as she saw the caller ID: dispatch. Another call about a possible break-in at one of the targeted homes.<|eot_id|>",

Her partner had left early that day to run errands, and she was expecting him back later.\n\nAs she waited in line for a cup of coffee, she noticed a young nurse laughing with a colleague at the table by the window. They were both in their mid-twenties, and their easy camaraderie struck a chord. She felt a pang as she watched them share a smile, feeling like she'd been married long enough to have experienced that kind of effortless connection.\n\nWhen it was her turn to order, she asked for black coffee, trying to avoid eye contact with anyone. As she took her coffee and turned to leave, she accidentally knocked over a chair, spilling condiments everywhere. Apologetic murmurs filled the air, but no one rushed to help her clean up.\n\nFeeling embarrassed and self-conscious, she quickly grabbed a handful of napkins and began to tidy up the mess. The noise of the cafeteria faded into the background as she focused on mopping up the spills, her eyes welling up with tears.<|eot_id|>",

She had always felt guilty for not being able to prevent it, and now here was Dr. Smith again, seemingly oblivious to the risks he took with his own patients.\n\nAs she turned to grab another cup of coffee, Alex knocked over his glass, spilling water all over the counter. \"Sorry,\" he said, as he began to clean up the mess. She watched him, feeling a familiar sense of frustration and resentment towards the small, careless things he did every day, like leaving his dirty socks on the floor or forgetting to pick up milk.

She could already see it, the gallery owner's face twisting in disdain, another rejection letter crumpled in his hand. \"You're not ready,\" he'd say, just like her ex had. The words stung like a slap across her face.\n\nShe picked up her pencil, chewing on its worn-down tip. Her mind filled with images of other artists, their work displayed proudly on gallery walls, their names whispered in revered tones. She could see herself there too, but only for a moment before the image was replaced by her ex's sneer, his voice dripping with contempt.\n\nHer eyes welled up with tears, blurring her vision and turning the sketch into a watercolor mess. \"Why can't I just be good enough?\" she whispered to herself, her voice barely audible over the pounding of her heart.
