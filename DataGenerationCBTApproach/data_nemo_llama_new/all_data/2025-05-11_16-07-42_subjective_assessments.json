They must be sitting at home, laughing it up while we're all hiding in here like scared cats.\n\nI guided my students through the routine, closing the blinds and ushering them into the corner. Some grumbled about missing recess, others looked nervous, but hey, that's not my fault, right? I'm just doing what I'm told. If only Principal Thompson would focus more on running the school than causing these unnecessary panic attacks.\n\nAs we waited for the all-clear, I couldn't help but wonder why they couldn't just hire better security or something. It's not like I'm paid enough to deal with this stress too. *Maybe I should start charging hazard pay,* I thought with a wry smile. My students noticed and chuckled, breaking some of the tension.
