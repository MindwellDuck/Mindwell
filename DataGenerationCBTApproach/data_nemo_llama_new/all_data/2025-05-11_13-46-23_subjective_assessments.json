The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare, making him squint. As he gazed out into the crowded waiting room, his eyes landed on a group of young nurses gathered around a patient's bedside.\n\nTheir bright smiles and animated conversation about the latest medical breakthroughs struck a discordant note within him. He felt a pang of discomfort, sensing their carefree camaraderie was a far cry from his own solitary existence since her passing. The sound of their laughter echoed through the sterile hallway, punctuating the silence that had become his constant companion.\n\nThe doors slid open, and he stepped into the elevator, his gaze drifting toward the floor display: '3rd Floor, Emergency Surgery'. A chill crept up his spine as the words seemed to mock him \u2013 a stark reminder of the countless lives lost to the very disease he'd spent his career fighting against. The elevator lurched to life, and he felt himself being pulled down into the abyss of uncertainty, his breath catching in his throat.<|eot_id|>",
