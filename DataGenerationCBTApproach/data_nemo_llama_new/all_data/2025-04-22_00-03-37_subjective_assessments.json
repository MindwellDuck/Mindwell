Again.\n\nI was busy plating the main course, carefully arranging the garnishes and drizzling the reduction sauce, when he strolled into the kitchen, a smug look plastered on his face. \"Honey, how do you expect to get this restaurant off the ground if you can't even manage a simple dish like chicken parmesan?\" he said, his voice dripping with condescension.\n\nSimple dish? Simple dish?! Does he have any idea what goes into creating something as complex as a perfectly cooked chicken parmesan? The tenderization process, the breading, the precise temperature control... it's not just about throwing some breaded chicken in the oven and hoping for the best.\n\nI felt my anger simmering just below the surface, but I bit back the retort that threatened to spit venom at him. Instead, I smiled sweetly and replied, \"Oh, I see. So now you're an expert on Italian cuisine? I didn't know you'd spent years studying under the great masters.\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed, but I could tell he was taken aback by my sarcasm. He opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, I cut him off. \"Actually, dear, I think I'll let the guests decide who's the real chef around here.\" With a flourish, I presented the dish to our guests, who all oohed and ahhed over its perfection.\n\nMy husband's face turned bright red with rage, but I just laughed, a cold, mirthless sound. \"Looks like someone needs to take a cooking class,\" I sneered, turning back to the stove to sear the remaining vegetables.\n\nAs the night wore on, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. I'd shown him who was really in charge in the kitchen \u2013 me. And as we left the restaurant, arm in arm, I knew that I'd made my point. He might think he's the boss, but I'm the one with the culinary skills. And I wouldn't let anyone forget it.<|eot_id|>",

Because what I really needed was to relive our entire failed marriage through his dusty old newspapers.\n\nI swear, every time I thought I'd finally closed that chapter, some long-forgotten receipt or faded photograph would surface, shattering the fragile illusion I'd built around myself as a functioning adult. Today was no exception.\n\nAs I dug through the cobwebs, a tattered copy of the local paper from '82 caught my eye. The headline read: \"Local Couple Celebrates 25 Years of Marriage.\" I let out a snort, more out of disgust than amusement. Who were these people? Did they even know what love was?\n\nI flipped through the pages, stopping at a photo of us \u2013 or rather, him, grinning like a complete idiot next to me, looking like I was about to vomit. Our kids must have been teenagers back then. How had we managed to fool ourselves into thinking this was all going to work out?\n\nA crumpled up ticket stub for a couples' cooking class caught my attention. Cooking classes. What a joke. I remembered those disastrous nights, standing side by side in that cramped kitchen, trying to chop onions without killing each other. It was a wonder we didn't poison each other.\n\nI tossed the papers back into the trunk, amidst a flurry of receipts and forgotten dreams. As I stood up, my eyes landed on an old Polaroid of our wedding day. I glared at the photo, my mind racing with all the ways it could've gone wrong.

        "Triggering Event": "\"Are you fucking kidding me?!\"\n\nI slammed my fist onto the desk, making my wife jump in her seat. We were at home, surrounded by the chaos of dinner prep and kids' arguing in the background. My editor just called, and I was supposed to have this major expos\u00e9 ready within the hour.\n\nBut what did I get instead? A mediocre piece of shit from some young upstart journalist who'd been assigned to cover the same story. The kid had done zero research and still managed to churn out a better article than mine. And now, I was stuck with the crappy job of rewriting it for our next issue.\n\nMy mind started racing as I thought about all the times I'd worked tirelessly on stories, pouring my heart and soul into them, only to have someone else take credit for the work. It wasn't fair. I was the one who'd spent years building a reputation, who'd earned the respect of my peers. This kid was just a flash in the pan.\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with people these days?\" I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. My wife looked at me, concerned, but I just shook off her question. \"Nothing,\" I lied. \"Just work stuff.\"\n\nBut inside, I was seething. I couldn't believe I was stuck in this rut, watching others succeed while I struggled to make ends meet. It was infuriating. And for what? So some entitled kid could coast on my experience?\n\nI stood up, grabbed my phone, and dialed my brother's number. \"Hey, Mike, it's me. I need your help. Can you do me a favor?\"\n\nAs I waited for his response, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease spreading through my chest. It was like a ticking time bomb, waiting to go off.<|eot_id|>",

People should show some fucking respect for the craft, you know? And that kid... Jesus, he should've at least done some research before submitting his half-baked crap. It's not like I'm asking for perfection, but damn, some effort would be nice! And my editor should've seen this coming, should've given me a heads-up instead of springing this shit on me last minute. Life just isn't fair, man. People should step up and do their part, that's all I'm saying.\""
