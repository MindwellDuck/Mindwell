She'd looked at him with those big, brown eyes full of questions he couldn't answer, and he'd felt the weight of her silent accusations like stones piled onto his heart. But what could he do? Those lessons were tough, designed to challenge even the brightest minds. Emily just wasn't trying hard enough. Or perhaps she was too smart for his teaching methods, a silent critic hidden behind those wide eyes.\n\nHe remembered young Thomas, his first failure as a teacher. The boy had left his office with tears streaming down his face, and he'd never been able to shake the feeling that Thomas blamed him for his struggles. Even now, all these years later, he could swear he saw the same accusation in Emily's gaze - a silent judgment whispered through unspoken words.\n\nHe picked up her failed exam paper, running his thumb over the red ink circling her low score. He wanted to tell her it didn't matter, that failure was just another stepping stone on the path to success. But how could he say such things when he knew she'd see right through him? She'd know he was lying, hiding behind empty platitudes while his true feelings remained hidden beneath layers of guilt and regret.\n\nAs he sat there, surrounded by memories of students past and present, he couldn't shake the feeling that Emily had abandoned hope. That she blamed him for her struggles, and that no amount of encouragement or extra lessons could bridge the chasm between them. He felt it as surely as if she'd voiced her thoughts aloud, a silent scream echoing in his mind.\n\nYet, when Emily walked into his office the next day, her eyes were bright with unshed tears, not accusations. She spoke of how hard she was working, of how determined she was to improve. And he realized, with a startling clarity, that perhaps he'd been wrong about Emily after all. Perhaps her silent gaze hadn't been filled with blame, but merely sadness and determination. But it was too late now; the seeds of doubt had already taken root in his mind, growing like weeds amidst the remnants of his once-strong self-confidence."

There had to be more messages, something she missed, some clue that would explain this sudden change of heart.\n\nBut why now? Why today? Was it something she said? Or did he find out about...no, no way. She'd been careful. Hadn't she?\n\nHer stomach churned as she watched him laugh at something on his show.
