It was a picture of him and his younger brother, taken just before they'd set out on their summer vacation one year ago. The memory still lingered, like an open wound.\n\nAs he gazed up at the house, memories came flooding back \u2013 laughter, arguments, and late-night conversations about everything and nothing. He remembered the day his brother had gone missing, and how his own mistakes had been questioned by their parents. \n\nA faint breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby trees, carrying with it the scent of cut grass and fresh-cut wood. For a moment, the officer forgot about the long hours at work, the weight of his responsibilities, and let himself be transported back to that fateful summer.\n\nHis eyes wandered down to the old bike leaning against the fence, its chain creaking gently in the wind. That bike had been his brother's favorite, and now it sat idle, a constant reminder of what could never be replaced. The officer felt a pang in his chest, and the familiar ache began to spread through his body, threatening to consume him whole.<|eot_id|>",
