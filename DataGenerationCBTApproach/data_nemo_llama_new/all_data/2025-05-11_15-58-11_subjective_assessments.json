Her eyes, once bright and carefree, now seemed tired and red-rimmed from lack of sleep. She couldn't shake the memory of last night's argument with her sister, which still lingered like an open wound.\n\nHer mind began to wander as she rearranged the display of children's toys. Why had she let things fall apart with her ex-husband? What had she done wrong? The familiar feelings of guilt and regret swirled inside her, threatening to spill over onto her perfectly manicured nails.\n\nShe paused, her hand hovering above the stack of stuffed animals. For a moment, the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the beat of her racing thoughts. The store's background chatter receded, leaving only the echo of her own self-doubt. Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a text from her sister, reminding her of their dinner plans tonight. A knot formed in her stomach as she wondered how she'd face her sister, feeling so lost and uncertain about herself.<|eot_id|>",
