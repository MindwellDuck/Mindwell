What if Rachel wasn't as prepared as she thought?\n\nJust then, a junior resident burst in, frantically explaining a complication in another OR case. The doctor's eyes met Rachel's across the room, and for a fleeting moment, they locked in a silent understanding \u2013 the weight of responsibility, the pressure to perform flawlessly.\n\nAs the resident continued to talk, the doctor's mind began to wander back to Rachel's skills and experience. Was she truly capable of handling this surgery alone? The uncertainty gnawed at her gut, making her palms grow sweaty beneath her gloves. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling, but it lingered, like a faint hum in the background of her thoughts.<|eot_id|>",

Nothing from them.
