His words were like a stain on my apron, impossible to wash out.\n\nJust as I slid the revised dish through the hatch, Pierre called out from the pass, \"We're running low on fresh herbs.\" My hand tightened around the spoon, the metal cool against my skin. Herbs? We had plenty of herbs yesterday when he praised my risotto. But no, today it was different. Today, we were 'running low.'\n\nI sighed, not at Pierre's words, but at the familiar weight that settled in my chest. The praise from yesterday didn't matter now. It never did.
