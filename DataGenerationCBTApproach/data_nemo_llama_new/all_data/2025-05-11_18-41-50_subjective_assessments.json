A middle-aged colleague, fresh from a high-profile research grant, caught her eye - beaming as she accepted congratulations from several colleagues. The woman's newfound status seemed to have earned her automatic invitations to prestigious conferences and collaborations. As the guest of honor approached, her eyes lingered on the gleam of a new smartwatch on the woman's wrist, its price tag likely exceeding twice what she could afford. A fleeting pang of resentment stirred within her, tempered only by the familiar ache of being left out.<|eot_id|>",

It was a symbol, wasn't it? A trophy for success, for importance. My gaze shifted from the watch to her face, radiant with admiration and congratulations. I felt a pang in my chest, a familiar tension winding around my heart like a vine.\n\nI tried to focus on my tea, its warmth barely registering against the sudden chill within me. The laughter of the younger faculty seemed amplified, their joy echoing mockingly through the room. It wasn't that I wasn't happy for her, no, not at all. But why did she deserve this? Why was she the one being feted, while I stood here, invisible?\n\nI looked down at my own watch, a simple digital affair that had served me well these past years. It felt suddenly shabby, insignificant. I could almost hear the whispers of those around her, \"Oh, you've been invited to speak at Harvard? How wonderful!\" And here I was, with nothing but this old watch and a heart full of... what was it? Not jealousy, no. Just... awareness.\n\nI took another sip of my tea, the bitter taste a perfect match for the knot in my stomach. Her success seemed so loud, so large, while mine felt small, quiet, almost non-existent. It wasn't fair. But then again, when had life ever been fair? I was here, after all, wasn't I? Standing alone by the refreshments, watching her shine. And that was just how it was. Just how it would always be."
