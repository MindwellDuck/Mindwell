It was the hospital's central switchboard, calling to inform her that one of her residents had been admitted with a rare complication from a procedure she had supervised just yesterday.\n\nThe resident, a young woman with a promising career ahead of her, was now facing a potentially life-altering outcome \u2013 one that could have serious implications for Dr.'s own professional reputation and licensure. The doctor felt a knot form in her stomach as she listened to the nurse's hasty explanation, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios and all the 'what ifs' that seemed to crowd out the rational thoughts she'd developed over years of experience.<|eot_id|>",

His nephew, visiting from out of town, poked his head in with a cup of coffee. \"Hey, Uncle, I brought some breakfast.\"\n\nThe artist barely acknowledged him, too caught up in his own frustration. But as he took the cup, their fingers touched, and a jolt of anger shot through him. It was a small thing, but it reminded him of all the times she'd made him laugh, all the ways she'd touched his hand while cooking dinner.\n\n\"You're here to help me sell these paintings, aren't you?\" he snapped, his voice low and even.\n\nHis nephew looked taken aback. \"Uh, no, actually... I was thinking maybe we could talk about something else?\"\n\nBut the artist was beyond listening.

The sound of praise and admiration for his wife's work grew louder, punctuated by the soft clinking of champagne glasses as they celebrated another successful exhibition.

He winced, feeling a flush rise to his cheeks. His wife would kill him if she saw this \u2013 sloppy, careless. He quickly reapplied some correction fluid, erasing the mistake, but the image lingered: his wife's disappointed expression when he'd forgotten to bring home her favorite dessert.\n\nThe students began to murmur, sensing his distraction.

The ease with which Emily fit in was a stark contrast to his own experiences as a divorced father trying to balance work and parenting responsibilities.\n\nEmily turned to him and said, \"Hey, I heard you're the best trauma nurse we have. Can I ask for your advice on how to handle a particularly tough case?\" Her smile faltered for a fraction of a second before she regained her composure, and he felt a pang of disappointment. \n\nThe moment passed, and Emily moved on to ask another colleague for guidance, leaving him feeling like an outsider, wondering if anyone truly wanted his expertise.<|eot_id|>",

She was either a natural at this nursing gig, or she was fakin' it till she made it. There ain't no in-between with her, is there?\n\nAnd then she asked me for advice. For half a second, I thought maybe, just maybe, I could be something more than just the divorced dad who's always running late and forgets his lunch.
