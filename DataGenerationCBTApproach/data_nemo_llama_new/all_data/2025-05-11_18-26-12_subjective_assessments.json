A particular article caught his eye - a paper co-authored by one of his former colleagues, now a prominent researcher in their field. The man had always been ambitious, but now, it seemed, even more so.\n\nAs Dr. Thompson began to read the abstract, his eyes narrowed, and a faint scowl creased his forehead. It was a study on the long-term effects of early retirement, and what caught his attention was the mention of a small grant he'd once received to fund his own research projects. The funding had dried up abruptly when he left the hospital, leaving him with significant debt and a tarnished reputation.\n\nThe doctor's gaze lingered on the article, his mind replaying the memories of those late nights spent pouring over data, and the promises he'd made to himself to make a difference. Now, it seemed, someone else was reaping the rewards. His eyes lingered on the author's name, and for a moment, a bitter taste filled his mouth.<|eot_id|>",
