He felt a familiar knot forming in his stomach as he headed out the door, his hand instinctively resting on the grip of his gun.\n\nThe rain-soaked streets seemed to stretch on forever as he drove to the scene, his thoughts racing with worst-case scenarios. What if this was another copycat? What if someone was trying to provoke him? The more he thought about it, the tighter his jaw got, and the harder his heart pounded. By the time he arrived at the convenience store, his breath came out in short gasps, and his hands were slick with sweat.<|eot_id|>",
