The younger officer caught her eye again, this time holding it for a fraction of a second longer than necessary before looking away.\n\nA few minutes later, during the roll call, their sergeant mentioned that the department was considering implementing new performance metrics, which would include quarterly reviews of officers' cases. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach as she listened, her mind racing with the possibility of being judged or found wanting.
