The morning sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust particles dancing in the air, but she didn't notice. Her mind kept drifting back to the phone call from the editor the day before, asking if she could take on a few more freelance assignments to make up for some lost revenue.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, she thought about all the times she'd had to put off paying the electricity bill, the water bill, and even the mortgage. She knew it was only temporary, but it felt like an eternity since she'd been able to afford the things she needed. The silence of her empty apartment seemed to be closing in around her, a constant reminder of her own neglect.\n\nThe sound of the refrigerator humming in the background broke the spell, and she finally turned her attention to the bills. But instead of tackling them head-on, she let her gaze wander to the old photo album on the shelf. It was filled with pictures of her children, now grown and moved away. She hadn't seen them in months, and the guilt and loneliness were starting to feel overwhelming.<|eot_id|>",

They exchanged a brief, awkward smile before moving on to their tasks.

Not today.*\n\n*She paused by the vending machine, staring at the colorful rows of snacks but not seeing them.
