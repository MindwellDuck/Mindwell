Her eyes wandered out to the park across the street, where kids were playing tag with their parents. She couldn't help but think about how different things would've been if she'd had someone to share those moments with.\n\nJust then, the door swung open and her partner, Rachel, plopped down beside her. \"Hey, kiddo, long day?\"\n\nMargaret forced a weak smile, trying to hide the weight that always settled in after a particularly tough call. Rachel noticed it anyway and handed her a box of tissues. \"I brought these.\"\n\nMargaret took them, feeling like a teenager again, on the verge of tears. Rachel didn't say anything; just sat there, letting Margaret know she was there.\n\nThey sat in silence for a while, watching as people came and went outside. Margaret's mind started to wander back to the case they'd worked on earlier that morning \u2013 the one where a young family's dog got hit by a car. The look on the kid's face when they found out... Margaret shuddered, pushing the memory away.\n\n\"Rachel?\" she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Do you ever feel like we're just going through the motions?

Always spewing his trash about how he's fighting for the little guy, but really, he's just lining his own pockets with taxpayer dollars.\n\nAs I was asking him questions, he had the nerve to look me dead in the eye and say, \"You know, sweetheart, you're just a journalist trying to make a name for yourself.\" Oh, wow, real original, buddy.

Like, hello, I've been reporting on this stuff for years, and I know exactly what I'm doing. But no, he had to go and try to patronize me.\n\nAnd then, to add insult to injury, someone from the audience stood up and started shouting at me, saying I was being too aggressive and confrontational.

She had spent decades dedicating herself to educating the minds of future generations, pouring over lesson plans, grading papers, and sacrificing precious moments with loved ones.\n\nBut none of it seemed to matter now. Not when she was reminded daily of her own shortcomings as a mother. Her ex-husband, John, had left her years ago, taking their daughter with him. The pain still lingered, a festering wound that refused to heal.\n\nMrs. Johnson's eyes drifted towards the framed photograph on her desk. It was a picture of her and John, taken on what felt like a lifetime ago. They were smiling, happy, and full of promise. But beneath the surface, she knew they were both suffocating under the pressure of their own expectations.\n\nShe thought back to the countless nights she'd stayed up late, worrying about her daughter's grades, her future, and her well-being. Had she been enough? Had she provided the stability and love her child deserved?\n\nA cold sweat broke out on her forehead as she recalled the argument they'd had just yesterday. Her daughter, now a grown woman, had accused Mrs. Johnson of being emotionally absent during her childhood. The words cut deep, and for a moment, Mrs. Johnson felt like she'd been punched in the gut.\n\nWhy hadn't she been there more? Why hadn't she been able to provide the one thing her daughter needed most \u2013 unconditional love and acceptance?

She would face this guilt head-on, no matter how painful it seemed. For her daughter's sake, if nothing else.

Not anymore.\n\nHe talked about their life together, about their dreams and aspirations, about the plans they had for the future. And with each passing minute, my chest felt heavier, my eyes pricking with tears. Why couldn't I have that? Why did I end up alone?\n\nAt one point, he mentioned her favorite coffee shop, the place where they used to meet for breakfast every Sunday. I felt a pang in my gut, a wave of nostalgia washing over me. That coffee shop was now a painful reminder of what I'd lost, a constant echo of the laughter and conversation we once shared.\n\n\"Can I ask,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper, \"how do you...how do you go to bed at night?\"\n\nHe looked at me, confusion etched on his face. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know exactly what I mean,\" I snapped, frustration boiling over. \"How do you sleep, knowing she's gone?\"\n\nFor a moment, he seemed taken aback, his expression softening. But then, that mask slipped back into place, and he smiled \u2013 a warm, genuine smile that made my heart ache.\n\n\"I sleep just fine, kiddo,\" he said. \"We may not be together anymore, but our love remains.\"\n\nLove. Easy for him to say. He didn't have to live with the weight of his grief every day. He didn't have to wonder if I was okay, if I needed someone to talk to.\n\nAs the interview drew to a close, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of sorrow. I excused myself early, citing exhaustion, and made a beeline for the door.\n\nOutside, I collapsed against the wall, my eyes streaming with tears. Why did he get to move on so easily? Why couldn't I find it in myself to let go?\n\nThe sound of my own ragged breathing was the only thing that kept me anchored to reality. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm down, but the pain lingered, a constant reminder of what I'd lost forever.<|eot_id|>",

She's been trying to ignore it, but tonight, she snaps.\n\n**Text:**\n\n*Seriously?* I glance at my clock again - 1:37 AM. *Really?!* I flop back onto my pillows, ears still ringing from the thumping bass next door. *How can they be so inconsiderate?*\n\nI've had it up to here with their endless chatter and laughter spilling over into my quiet nights. Don't they realize I have work tomorrow? Or maybe they just don't care, because *why would they?* It's not like anyone else matters in their little world.\n\n*Ugh, there goes the shouting again.* I can hear every word, even with my windows closed. *Why tonight, of all nights?* I've been stressed out enough without this noise pollution. They must know I'm trying to sleep - my ceiling lamp is probably blinking like a madwoman from their stomping around.\n\n*Oh, look at that,* they're starting up with the music again. *Just great.* I can feel my blood pressure rising as I imagine them dancing, laughing, having the time of their lives while I'm stuck here, wide awake and seething.\n\n*Typical.* They probably think everyone else should just put up with their chaos because it's too much trouble to quiet down. *Well, guess what?* I'm not going to take this lying down any longer."
