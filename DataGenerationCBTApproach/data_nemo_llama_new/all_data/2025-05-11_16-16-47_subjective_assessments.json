They were laughing about how she'd found someone who was \"way out of her league\" - implying he hadn't been good enough. A woman with a bright smile and a messy bun sat down next to him, ordering a sandwich from the counter. As she waited for her food, one of the coworkers chimed in, saying, \"I heard he still can't handle his kids' schedules.\" The group erupted into snickers, and the woman glanced at him, concern etched on her face.\n\nThe nurse's eyes narrowed, his grip on his coffee cup tightening as the woman asked, \"Is everything okay?\" He forced a neutral tone, but the words stuck in his throat, leaving only a bitter taste.<|eot_id|>",

He hadn't painted in weeks, since...since they'd moved into their new house. Everything felt off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on why.\n\nAs he gazed out the studio window, watching the sun set over the unfamiliar neighborhood, memories flooded back. The smell of freshly cut grass, the sound of children laughing in the park \u2013 it all brought him back to their old home, to the life they'd left behind.\n\nHis wife had been excited about this new chapter, about starting fresh and making new memories together. But now, as he stood amidst the sterile walls of their new home, feeling like a stranger in a world that wasn't his own, he wondered if she was truly happy here too. And that thought sent a pang through him, leaving him feeling hollow and uncertain.<|eot_id|>",

We'd been sitting in this sterile living room for what felt like hours now, and she hadn't said a word. I couldn't help but feel that she was just waiting for me to finish this damn painting so we could move on with our lives.\n\nI swear, sometimes I think she doesn't understand how important my art is to me. Like, does she even get that this isn't just some hobby? It's my passion, my lifeblood. She can't possibly comprehend the sheer agony of staring at a blank canvas, let alone one that's half-finished and feels like it's mocking you.\n\nI glanced over at her again, her thumbs dancing across the screen. *She's probably reading some stupid article about how to 'support' her struggling artist husband,* I thought bitterly. *Or maybe she's just scrolling through social media, comparing our lives to everyone else's.* Either way, it was clear that she wasn't taking this seriously.\n\n*Maybe if she'd just show a little more enthusiasm,* I thought, *a bit of genuine interest in what I'm doing, things would be different.* But no, instead she sits there, silent and distant, making me feel like I'm all alone in this."
