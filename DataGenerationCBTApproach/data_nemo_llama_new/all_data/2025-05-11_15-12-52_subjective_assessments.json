The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the empty hallways, making him feel even more anxious. As a teacher, he was used to being in control, but today he couldn't shake the feeling of being lost.\n\nJust as he managed to remember where he'd put the key, the principal's voice came over the intercom, announcing a surprise visit from the school board. They were coming to observe a class \u2013 one of his most challenging ones \u2013 and he still hadn't prepared a lesson plan.\n\nA cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he thought about the students' recent behavior. He had been trying to reach them, but they seemed to be slipping further away. What if the board saw him as incompetent? What if they took away his teaching position?\n\nWith a jolt, the lock clicked open, and he let himself into the classroom. But instead of finding reassurance among the familiar desks and books, he saw a sea of expectant faces staring back at him, each one a reminder of his own doubts and fears.<|eot_id|>",

'Surprise visit from the board,' she says. Surprise, my ass. They're coming to watch my class \u2013 my mess of a class. Those kids... they've been acting out, pulling away. I'm trying, fuck, I am trying, but it's like they're slipping through my fingers.\n\nMy heart's pounding like a damn drum in my chest. What if they see me? See the chaos I can't control?

Not again.\n\nFinally, finally, the lock clicks open. But it's not relief I feel. It's like a fucking wave of dread crashing over me as I see those faces staring back at me. Expectant. Judging.

She mentioned that Mr. Thompson had been given the lead role in the upcoming school play, much to the delight of the students.\n\nThe comment struck a chord within him. He remembered the countless hours he'd spent preparing lessons, grading papers, and attending meetings \u2013 all for the sake of providing a quality education. Now, it seemed like the spotlight was being shone on someone else's achievements.\n\nMrs. Johnson turned to him and asked how his day was going. He forced a smile, but couldn't help noticing the way she spoke about Mr. Thompson with such enthusiasm, while barely acknowledging his contributions to the school.\n\nThe atmosphere in the staff room felt suffocating, and for a moment, he wondered if anyone truly cared about the people who'd dedicated their lives to this place.

I'm just the old workhorse, plugging away in my classroom while everyone else gets the glory.\n\nI mean, come on! I've been here for what, ten years now? Where's my promotion? Where's my pat on the back? Instead, they're handing out the gold stars to some newbie who's probably got less teaching experience than my left sock. It's not fair. She doesn't know what it's like, day in and day out, pouring my heart into these kids... and for what? A lousy 'thank you' at the end of the year?\n\nAnd Thompson? He's probably just pretending to care about the play too. I bet he's only doing it for the attention, thinking he can charm his way into Mrs. Johnson's good books. Typical.
