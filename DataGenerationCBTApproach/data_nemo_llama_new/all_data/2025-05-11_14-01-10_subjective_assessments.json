The teacher felt a knot form in her stomach as she listened to the principal explain that this decision was made despite her own efforts to secure funding and partnerships.\n\nAs she took notes, her eyes wandered to the empty chairs at the front of the room where the music teachers usually sat.

You've just attended your weekly staff meeting where the administration announced that due to budget cuts, all music programs across the district are being eliminated. Despite your efforts to secure funding and partnerships, this decision has been made. As you sit there, taking notes, feel the knot forming in your stomach. Let's explore how you react to this news, subtly reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Unfair Comparisons' without explicitly stating it.\n\n**Text:**\n\n*Damn it all,* I thought as Principal Thompson droned on about standardized testing and academic achievement. *Why didn't anyone think of that before cutting the music programs?* My gaze drifted to the empty chairs at the front, where the other music teachers usually sat. They'd poured their hearts into this program, just like me. Now, it felt like all our hard work had been reduced to nothing more than a fleeting memory.\n\nI could feel the familiar sting of inadequacy creeping up on me. *Why wasn't I able to secure enough funding?* I wondered. *Why didn't I push harder for partnerships?* It seemed like every other teacher in this room had managed to keep their programs intact, but not me. Not us.\n\nAs the meeting finally ended, I gathered my things and left the stuffy conference room, feeling the weight of failure settle heavy on my shoulders. Out in the hallway, I passed Mrs. Harper, the science teacher. She was beaming about some new equipment she'd managed to acquire for her classroom. I offered her a weak smile, but inside, all I could think was: *Why can't I be more like her?* It felt like everyone else had found a way around these cuts except me."
