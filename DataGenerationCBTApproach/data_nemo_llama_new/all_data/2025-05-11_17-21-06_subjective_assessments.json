She tried to brush it off, attributing his comment to a minor oversight, but Dr. Patel continued, his tone measured but laced with a hint of skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not sure if it's just my interpretation, but...I think someone might have tampered with your data.\"\n\nThe words hung in the air like a challenge, casting a shadow over her morning routine.<|eot_id|>",

It was the gallery owner, calling to confirm the details of the show. The artist hesitated, feeling a familiar sense of unease wash over him. What if he couldn't deliver?
