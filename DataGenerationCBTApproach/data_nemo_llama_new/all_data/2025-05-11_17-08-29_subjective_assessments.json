I need to know if she's showing any signs of dehydration,\" she said, glancing over her shoulder at another nurse who was already on their way to the room.\n\nAs the younger nurse rushed off, the older woman's eyes flicked to the patient's chart on the clipboard, and then to the empty chair beside it \u2013 the one where Mrs. Johnson usually sat. The bed was made, the blanket smoothed, but there was no sign of the frail elderly woman.\n\nThe supervisor's expression turned concerned, and she looked back at our nurse, expecting an update. Our nurse hesitated, feeling a twinge of anxiety and guilt. She had been the last one to interact with Mrs. Johnson before going home early the previous day, citing exhaustion.\n\nThe supervisor's gaze lingered on her, as if waiting for some explanation, and our nurse felt her face grow warm, her heart rate quicken. She fumbled with the clipboard, trying to stall, but the supervisor simply nodded and moved on to the next task, leaving our nurse feeling exposed and ashamed.<|eot_id|>",

The amount was more than double what he'd anticipated, and for a moment, his anger simmered just below the surface. He took another sip of coffee, his mind wandering back to the argument they'd had earlier that week.\n\nThe door to his office opened, and one of the nurses poked her head in, interrupting his reverie. \"Dr., I need you to review these test results ASAP.\" As she handed him the charts, her voice was bright and cheerful, oblivious to the storm brewing inside him.\n\nHe forced a smile and began to scan the papers, his fingers drumming a staccato beat on the counter as he tried to calm himself down.

Each figure, each line item, felt like another betrayal. How could he have missed this? He'd been so careful, so meticulous, hadn't he?\n\nThe rest of the world faded away as he delved deeper into the financial maelstrom. The patients waiting outside his door, the test results needing review, they all blurred into insignificance. All that mattered were these numbers, this proof of his ex-wife's supposed greed.\n\nWhen the nurse poked her head in again, asking about a patient's medication, he barely heard her. \"Not now,\" he snapped, his eyes still glued to the documents, his mind consumed by one tiny aspect of his divorce. The whole picture was lost on him, swallowed up by his mental filter."
