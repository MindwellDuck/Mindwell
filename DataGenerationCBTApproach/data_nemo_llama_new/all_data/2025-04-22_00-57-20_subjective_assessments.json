It's like she doesn't know what's goin' on behind closed doors. 'Hey, how's it goin'? How's your day?' Are you kiddin' me? My day is a never-endin' cycle of grief and desperation.

It was from her sister, the one who'd barely spoken to us since... well, since everything happened.\n\nI tore it open, scanning the lines quickly. An invitation? To Christmas? My eyes caught on the words \"would love to have you join us,\" but I couldn't focus past the noise in my head. How could they possibly think I'd want to celebrate this year?\n\nThe rest of the letter blurred together. Something about traditions, about memories being made, about how it would mean so much to them if I came. But all I could see was the glaring absence of her name, the silence where her voice used to be.\n\nI crumpled the paper in my fist, tossing it into the trash with more force than necessary. Christmas was for families, for laughter and joy. Not for this empty house, not for me. They just didn't understand. None of them did."

I was a successful journalist now, living in a decent apartment and making enough money to afford a mediocre wine collection. Meanwhile, she was over here building a life with someone who probably thought he was God's gift to women just because he had a six-pack.\n\nI chuckled wryly to myself as I watched her latest post, which included a caption about \"grateful\" and \"blessed.\" Please, she must have been drinking from the same poisoned chalice as all the other entitled rich kids I knew.\n\nIt hit me like a ton of bricks when I saw the picture of them holding hands on the beach, the sun setting behind them like they were the only two people left on earth. I felt a pang in my chest, but it wasn't sadness \u2013 it was something far more toxic.\n\nI remembered the countless nights I spent crying myself to sleep, wondering what I'd done wrong. Wondering if I was good enough. And for what? So some guy could swoop in and steal her away from me?\n\nAs I continued scrolling, I started to notice all the little things \u2013 the way she posted updates about her prenatal appointments, the way she gushed about her unborn child. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion, except instead of being fascinated, I was consumed by anger.\n\nWho was this woman, really? Some shallow, self-absorbed pretty face who thought she deserved every ounce of happiness just because she existed? Newsflash, honey: you don't deserve happiness. You're lucky I didn't kill you when we were together.\n\nI closed my laptop, feeling empty and hollow.

But now, it seemed like none of that mattered. She was either a dedicated student or a cheater; there was no middle ground.\n\nAs I paced my empty classroom, I couldn't shake off the feeling of betrayal. It was as if she'd thrown away everything we stood for \u2013 integrity, honesty, hard work. There were no shades of gray here, just black and white: Emily was either a model student or a deceitful cheat.\n\nI picked up my phone to call her parents, but hesitated. What if the note was wrong? What if it was some cruel prank by another student? I put down the phone, feeling confused. Could I really condemn Emily without concrete proof?\n\nBut as I sat there, wrestling with doubt, I realized that wasn't the point. This wasn't about proving her guilt or innocence; it was about trust. Either she was someone I could still believe in, or she wasn't. There was no room for uncertainty here.\n\nI picked up my phone again, resolute. If Emily was innocent, she deserved the chance to defend herself. But if not... well, I couldn't abide deceit in my classroom. Not even from her."

Why did I get so worked up over nothing?\n\nAs I continued to watch them, I noticed Alex's hand brushing against hers as they walked out of the meeting room. My gut twisted into a knot, and I felt my face heat up. I took a deep breath, trying to calm down, but my anxiety only seemed to intensify.\n\nWhy did I care so much about what Rachel was doing right now? She was my wife, wasn't she? And yet, here I was, feeling like a jealous husband from a bad rom-com. I shook my head, trying to clear the cobwebs. It was just paranoia, I told myself. But the doubt lingered, refusing to be silenced.<|eot_id|>",

Rachel's eyes are sparkling brighter than the Christmas lights we've got up in the office lobby. I mean, come on! She's gotta be flirting, right? Or maybe Alex has some secret admiration society for her and she's just too clueless to notice. God forbid she should realize someone finds her remotely interesting.\n\nI swear, if they start exchanging glances like that over our dinner table tonight... I can't even. It'll be like one of those cheesy rom-coms where the wife is oblivious to her husband's feelings while she fawns over the 'nice guy' from work. Except, you know, real life. And I'm not the nice guy.\n\nShe catches my eye and smiles, all innocent-like. Yeah, yeah, save it for Alex, sweetheart. I'm onto you both. This isn't some Hallmark movie where everything magically works out in the end. I can feel it in my bones \u2013 something's gonna happen here, and it's not gonna be pretty.\n\nMaybe I should just wear a sign that says 'I Exist Too, You Know'. Or maybe they'll start reading each other's minds without even needing telepathy. Either way, I'm stuck here, watching the show unfold like some awkward spectator sport.\""

Our team lead finally decided to'reorganize' the project we've been working on for months, so now our deadline has been pushed back three weeks.\n\nI'm sitting in the conference room trying to explain to him why this is a huge problem, but he just won't listen. He keeps interrupting me, talking over me, like I'm some kind of idiot who doesn't know what they're doing. And then, to top it all off, he has the nerve to say that if I don't meet these new deadlines, my job will be up for grabs.\n\nYou know what really gets my blood boiling? It's when people think they can just walk all over you because they have more power than you do. Like, hello, I used to be able to get things done without needing constant approval from someone else. I used to be able to make decisions without being second-guessed.\n\nBut no, now I'm just a lowly software engineer, stuck in this dead-end job, with no respect from anyone above me. It's like I'm invisible. And you know what the worst part is? He thinks he's doing this to help me. Help me? Are you kidding me?\n\nHe genuinely believes that by pushing me to the limit, I'll magically become more productive and efficient. Newsflash, buddy: it's not about me, it's about you. You want to control everyone around you, keep them in line, make sure they never question your authority. Well, let me tell you something, pal, it's not going to work on me.\n\nI'm done playing nice. I'm done pretending to care about your little project. I'm done being treated like dirt. If this is how you treat your employees, maybe you shouldn't be leading anything. Maybe you should just stick to managing a bunch of yes-men.\n\nOh, and by the way, I just happened to notice that my ex-wife got a promotion last week. Yeah, that's right. She's the one who always knew how to get ahead. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, wasting my life away on projects that nobody cares about. Just great.<|eot_id|>",

Always with the fucking targets. Like I don't have enough shit to deal with already.\n\nEvery time someone walks in here complaining about a missing book or wanting some obscure reference material, it's on me. Whole bloody day goes down the drain chasing after stuff nobody else gives a damn about.\n\nAnd now they're saying my numbers are down? Never mind that I've been busting my ass to keep this place running smoothly. No, instead of seeing all the shit I do, they focus on some goddamn spreadsheet that doesn't tell half the story.\n\nIt's like nobody remembers what it was like before I took over. Entire fucking library would've fallen apart without me. But no, now they want me to 'step up my game.' Fuck that.\n\nI'm done with this place. Always putting on a goddamn smile, acting like everything's fine while they stab you in the back. Never again.\""
