His wife had mentioned again how he'd been working non-stop since the lab accident, and how it was starting to take a toll on their family life.\n\nAs he scanned the rows of data, one entry caught his eye - the latest cost estimate for the new equipment they needed to repair the damaged lab. It was already over budget, and he knew he wouldn't be able to get approval from the funding committee until next quarter.\n\nThe realization hit him like a punch to the gut: even if everything went according to plan, they still wouldn't have enough money to cover the costs. The lab would remain shut down indefinitely, putting his research on hold and jeopardizing the future of their team.\n\nHe felt a wave of desperation wash over him, followed by a crushing sense of hopelessness. What was the point of continuing? The lab, his research, his entire career - all seemed doomed to fail.<|eot_id|>",
