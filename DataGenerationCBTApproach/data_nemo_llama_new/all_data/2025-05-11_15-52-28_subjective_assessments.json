They had talked about their plans for their future together, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she had let him down. She had been so caught up in her work, in helping others, that she had forgotten about her own needs and desires.\n\nAs she rinsed off the soap, her eyes landed on a small photo on the edge of the counter - a picture of the two of them on their first date, smiling and carefree.

The sound of her phone buzzing from her pocket broke the silence, but she didn't move, unable to tear herself away from the memory.<|eot_id|>",

That was then, this is... Well, this is just life, isn't it?\" She snapped off the light, leaving the photo in shadow as she stepped out of the room, shoulders hunched against an unseen weight."
