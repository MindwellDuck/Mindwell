The memory brought a faint smile to her face, but it was quickly replaced by a creeping sense of dread.\n\nThe company's CEO had announced earlier that week that they would be undergoing a major restructuring, and rumors swirled about potential layoffs. She'd tried to brush it off as mere speculation, but the seed of doubt had taken root.\n\nHer fingers hesitated on the keyboard, and the cursor continued its maddening blink.
