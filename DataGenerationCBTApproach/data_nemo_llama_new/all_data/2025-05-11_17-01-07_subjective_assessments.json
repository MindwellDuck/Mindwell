The woman smiled condescendingly and began to offer guidance, speaking over his head about \"pushing boundaries\" and \"taking risks.\" Her eyes lingered on him, but only to assess how much of a challenge she could pose.\n\nThe room filled with laughter and conversation, but all he could think about was the years they'd wasted together, the creative spark that had once driven them now extinguished by her mediocrity.

She never lifted a finger to clean up after herself. He could feel the anger simmering within him, like the untouched stew bubbling over on the stove.\n\nAs he sat down at the table, his eyes flicked to the empty chair opposite him. It was always empty these days, he reflected grimly. Her absence seemed to swallow up the room, leaving it stark and hollow. He picked up his fork, but the food tasted like ashes in his mouth. Why bother, when she wasn't even here to appreciate it?\n\nHe pushed the plate away, his appetite gone. It was always like this - her carelessness casting a shadow over everything, overshadowing the good times they'd shared. He sighed, his breath misting slightly in the cool air.
