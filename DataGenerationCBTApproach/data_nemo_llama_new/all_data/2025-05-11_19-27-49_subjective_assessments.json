They didn't seem so bold now, but timid, almost childish. She couldn't help but wonder if he was right, if her grief had bled into her art and tainted it somehow. But she wouldn't dwell on it, wouldn't let his words take root in her mind like weeds choking out the beauty she knew was there.\n\nShe picked up another color, mixed it with another until it was almost, but not quite, the same shade as her favorite painting. \"He can keep his finesse,\" she said, dipping her brush into the paint. \"I'll stick to my passion.\""
