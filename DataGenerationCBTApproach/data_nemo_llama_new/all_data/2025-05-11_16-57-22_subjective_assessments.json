I suppose that's what happens when one trades in their old, insufficient model for a newer, shinier version. How quaint it must be to have someone so 'supportive', unlike myself, who was evidently a callous beast during our divorce.\n\nI must say, I do appreciate the casual manner in which she flaunts her newfound happiness right under my nose. It's almost as if she believes I'm still that same old brute she left behind - incapable of growth or change. How positively charming.\n\nAnd isn't it just typical that all these other couples around us seem to be living in some sort of perfect, harmonious bubble? They're either oblivious to the tension at our table or simply don't care enough to acknowledge it. It's almost laughable, really - almost.\n\nI suppose I should focus on little Timothy and his crayons now. After all, he's the only one here who hasn't been tarnished by my supposedly permanent label as a failure. Oh, but how delightfully ironic that even he seems bored with his own artwork today!"
