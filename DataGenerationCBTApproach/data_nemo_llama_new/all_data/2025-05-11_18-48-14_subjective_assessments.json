He felt a knot form in his stomach as he realized his mistake. It wasn't the first time he'd made a similar error, but this was the first time it had been pointed out in front of everyone.\n\nRachel paused, taking a deep breath before continuing. \"Let me take a look.\" She leaned over his shoulder, her presence suffocating.

Alex, meanwhile, was still engrossed in conversation with Jamie, our newest hire. He laughed loudly at something Jamie said, his hands gesturing animatedly as he helped restock the shelves. A small frown tugged at the corners of my mouth; it seemed like Alex had all the time in the world today.\n\nI headed to the stockroom, my steps echoing in the empty hallway. The memo on my phone about Alex's double shift tomorrow caught my eye. Another one, I thought, my grip tightening around my phone. It wasn't that I minded covering for him occasionally, but this was getting ridiculous. His charm might win over customers, but it didn't seem to extend to considering others' workload.\n\nI pulled out the inventory list, scanning it with more intensity than necessary. The numbers blurred slightly as I recalled the countless times I'd stayed late to cover Alex's shifts. My fingers tapped impatiently against the clipboard as I waited for him to finish his social hour. It wasn't fair, really. He got praised for his charm, while my hard work went unnoticed. Again.\n\nAs I walked back out to help with closing, I caught sight of myself in the mirror behind the counter. My reflection showed tired eyes and a slight furrow between my brows.
