She hadn't organized the photos in decades; they were scattered across the house, hidden away in trunks and attics.\n\nAs she sifted through the worn album, she came across a picture of herself as a young mother, standing proudly beside her children. Her husband was by their side, beaming with pride. The date was scribbled on the back \u2013 a birthday party from twenty years ago.\n\nA pang hit her chest, and she felt a lump form in her throat. Suddenly, she realized she hadn't cleaned out the house in months. Dust coated every surface, and the air was thick with the smell of decay. The once-nice living room now resembled a storage unit.\n\nThe photograph slipped from her fingers, landing face-down on the floor. As she bent to pick it up, her gaze fell upon a faint note tucked between the couch cushions. It was a reminder to call her sister about a family gathering. But there was no phone number, only a hasty scrawl of \"call me soon.\"\n\nThe realization washed over her like a wave: she'd neglected her own needs, just as she'd neglected her home. The thought echoed through her mind like a mantra, leaving her feeling lost and forgotten.<|eot_id|>",
