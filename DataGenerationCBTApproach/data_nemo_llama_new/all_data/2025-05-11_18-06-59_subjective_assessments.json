The restaurant was already busy, but he still felt like he'd never be able to get everything done on time. His mind began to wander to all the things that could go wrong - a kitchen fire, a food poisoning outbreak, a table of picky customers.\n\nJust then, one of the line cooks called out that they were running low on the key ingredient for the special of the day. He cursed under his breath as he realized he had ordered too little and now had to scramble to find a replacement supplier. The phone started ringing, and he knew it would only be the supplier calling to tell him that their delivery was hours late.\n\nAs he tried to juggle the orders and make calls, the fire alarm went off in the walk-in fridge. The staff rushed to evacuate the building, leaving him alone to deal with the chaos. The stress of it all suddenly felt suffocating, and he could feel his heart racing in his chest.<|eot_id|>",
