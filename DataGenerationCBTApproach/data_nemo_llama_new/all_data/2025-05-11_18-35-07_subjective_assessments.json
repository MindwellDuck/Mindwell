Her solitude by the window seemed like a stark contrast to her earlier conviviality, almost... accusatory. It felt like a confirmation of what I've always feared - that I'm invisible, inconsequential.\n\nThe rest of my break was marred by this silent rebuke.

His wife had always been the one to start the conversation, to ask about his plans and listen attentively as he shared them. Now, she rarely called him during the week, and when she did, it was just to check in or discuss something mundane.\n\nA gentle creak of the store's old wooden floorboards broke the silence, and he turned to see the manager approaching with a stack of papers to review. Their eyes met briefly, and for a fleeting moment, he thought he saw a flicker of concern \u2013 but it was quickly replaced by a neutral expression, leaving him feeling isolated once again.<|eot_id|>",
