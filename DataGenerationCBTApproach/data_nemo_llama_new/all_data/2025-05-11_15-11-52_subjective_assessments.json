His wife used to love watching him work, sitting beside him as he explained his latest discoveries to her.\n\nA sudden chill ran down his spine as he recalled the day she passed away \u2013 the feeling of emptiness, the silence that followed every conversation. He shook off the thought, focusing on the sample in question. But his mind kept drifting back to their last project together, one they'd been working on for months but never completed.\n\nThe microscope's LED light flickered, casting an eerie glow over the room. As he adjusted it, his eyes wandered to the framed photo on the edge of the bench \u2013 a picture of them both, smiling and holding hands. The smile seemed to falter, and for a moment, he felt like he was drowning in the weight of his own memories.<|eot_id|>",

He had said it was embarrassing, that people would think they were sloppy because of the mess. The words stung, and suddenly her paintbrush felt heavy in her hand.

This was why they were in this mess \u2013 because of him and his cheap habits.\n\nHer heart pounded, anger surging through her veins like a river breaking its banks.
