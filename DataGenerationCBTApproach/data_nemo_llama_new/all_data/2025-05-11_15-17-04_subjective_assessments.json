His wife had left him five years ago, taking their two grown children with her. He'd tried to fill the void with work, but even the familiar rhythms of the hospital couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness.\n\nAs he scanned the news headlines on his phone, one article caught his eye - a profile piece on a prominent local couple who were celebrating their 40th anniversary together. They had three children, traveled the world, and still managed to look radiant in photos. The contrast between their life and his own stung, making him feel like a failure.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from his ex-wife - checking in about the kids' school schedules. For a moment, he let himself get lost in the familiarity of the exchange, but it was quickly replaced by a pang of loneliness as she signed off. He set his phone down, the silence in the room closing in around him like a shroud.<|eot_id|>",

Instead, he was left with late-night phone calls and hurried goodbyes at the door, his face buried in a mask or gloves instead of hers. This wasn't the plan. It shouldn't be like this.\n\nHe slammed off the tap, leaving the water to drip down the drain, mirroring the emptiness inside him. He should have been more present, more devoted. He should have made her a priority. But he hadn't. And now, their anniversary was looming, another milestone he'd likely fail to mark properly.\n\nHe yanked off his scrub cap, throwing it onto the counter with a huff. \"I should be better than this,\" he muttered, his reflection nodding in agreement, its eyes burning with unspoken recriminations."
