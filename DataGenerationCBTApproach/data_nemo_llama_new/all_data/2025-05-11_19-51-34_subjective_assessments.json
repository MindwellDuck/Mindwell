As he waited for the students to arrive, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he'd lost touch with his passion for teaching. The stack of papers on his desk, the endless meetings with administrators, and the pressure to meet standardized test scores all seemed to be suffocating him.\n\nJust then, the door burst open, and a sea of chattering faces flooded the room. He forced a weak smile onto his face, trying to project confidence, but as he scanned the room, his eyes landed on a student who looked eerily familiar \u2013 the son of one of his former colleagues who had left the district under acrimonious circumstances. The boy's eyes locked onto his, and for an instant, they just stared at each other, the noise around them fading away.<|eot_id|>",
