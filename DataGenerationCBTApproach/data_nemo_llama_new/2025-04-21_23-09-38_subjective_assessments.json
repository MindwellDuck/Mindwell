Yeah, because that was the real challenge \u2013 finishing something that would probably collect dust in some dingy office somewhere.\n\nAs I walked into the ceremony, I spotted her \u2013 Rachel, my ex's new 'partner'.

But then I remembered why we ended up in divorce court \u2013 because I wasn't the star of my own life anymore.\n\n'Hey, Rachel!' I forced a laugh, trying to sound casual despite the bitter taste in my mouth. 'What brings you here?'\n\n\"Oh, just getting my degree,\" she chirped, oblivious to the fact that I'd rather eat glass. \"We're thinking of starting a lab together.\"\n\nMy gut twisted into a knot as I watched them exchange warm smiles. Starting a lab together? Because nothing says 'dream team' like two people who can't even tolerate each other's presence outside of a professional setting.\n\nI turned to leave, but not before catching a glimpse of myself in a nearby window reflection. The scientist who thought she had it all figured out now looked like a hot mess \u2013 frazzled hair, tired eyes, and a face that said 'I'm still trying to adult'.\n\nI shook off the feeling and continued walking, but the sound of their laughter lingered in the air, a cruel reminder that sometimes, the people who get the prize don't always get the prize.\"<|eot_id|>",

She was slipping away, and no one seemed to care.\n\nHe rubbed his temples, feeling the familiar ache of frustration. Why did it always have to be this way? Why did he get stuck with the crappy shifts, the endless paperwork, and the constant stream of broken dreams?\n\nThe nurse next to him, Rachel, caught his eye and raised an eyebrow. \"Hey, you okay?\" she asked, her voice soft but concerned.\n\nHe shook his head, not trusting himself to speak. Just nodded instead, feeling like a total coward.\n\nRachel gave him a sympathetic smile before turning back to her own work. He watched her, feeling a pang of envy. At least she had a partner, someone to come home to. Someone who cared.\n\nHe sighed, tucking his hands into his pockets. Maybe tomorrow would be different. Maybe he'd get a new shift, or a new patient, or something would magically change. But until then, he was stuck in this never-ending cycle of hopelessness, watching the world slowly drown around him.<|eot_id|>",

It was a bitter pill to swallow, but he'd ingested it nonetheless, filing the necessary paperwork and testifying at the subsequent disciplinary hearing.\n\nNow, as they prepared for Operation Nightfall, an intricate sting that could dismantle one of the city's most notorious crime syndicates, Thompson couldn't shake off his doubts. His partner, Detective Harris, was a seasoned officer with an impeccable record - until now. The Murphy incident had cast long shadows, and Thompson found himself questioning everything.\n\n\"Harris,\" Thompson began, his voice steady despite the turmoil within him, \"I need you to walk me through your role in this operation again.\" He listened attentively as Harris laid out their plan, but he couldn't silence the nagging voice in his head. *How can I be sure this won't happen again? How can I trust that the whole department isn't tainted somehow?*"

        "Triggering Event": "Ugh, my fucking life can't even get any worse than this.\n\nI'm walking into the hospital cafeteria, still in my scrubs from the morning shift, when I see her. My former coworker, Karen, from ten years ago. We used to work together at Mercy General, and she was always so full of herself. Thought she was better than everyone just because she had those fancy degrees from Harvard.\n\nWe part ways, professional and all that, but I never thought I'd run into her again. Especially not here, at our old haunt. And then it hits me - she's now working as the head nurse in the ER, making twice what I make, no less.\n\nAs we lock eyes, she flashes that fake smile and comes over to chat. \"Oh, Margaret, it's been ages! How's life treating you?\" Life treating me? Are you kidding me? She has no idea.\n\n\"So, how's your family?\" she asks, like she really cares. Like we're still buddies or something. Newsflash, Karen: I don't have time for your small talk. I've got real patients to attend to.\n\nBut I bite my tongue, play nice. \"Oh, they're good, thanks for asking.\" Just to shut her up.\n\nAnd then she drops the bombshell: \"By the way, I heard you got fired last week for 'not meeting performance expectations'.\" Not meet performance expectations? That's rich coming from the queen of entitled nonsense.\n\nMy blood boils, but I keep my cool. \"That's not true,\" I say through gritted teeth. But she just laughs, like it's the most hilarious thing she's ever heard. \"Oh, come on, Margaret. Everyone knows.\"\n\nThe whole cafeteria falls silent, and all eyes are on us. I feel my face burning with shame and humiliation. I just want to crawl under a rock and die.\n\nFinally, I snap. \"Get out of my sight, Karen. Now.\" I turn around and storm off, leaving her looking taken aback.\n\nAs I walk away, I can hear her whispering to someone behind me, \"Wow, looks like someone's still got some attitude issues.\" Attitude issues? She's the one who needs to take a long, hard look at herself.<|eot_id|>",

I can feel the eyes of every fucking person in there burning into my back, whispering about me, judging me. But fuck them all. Fuck Karen too. How dare she act like she knows everything? Like she has any right to talk about me?\n\nI can see it now, clear as day - tomorrow is gonna be a shitstorm. The whole hospital will know by then, thanks to her big mouth. They'll all be looking at me differently, whispering behind my back, just waiting for me to screw up again. I can't fucking stand the thought of it.\n\nI'm gonna have to face them all tomorrow, aren't I? Walk into that ER and have every single person there know about... about what? About nothing, that's what! It was a misunderstanding, a fuckup on their part, not mine. But will they see it that way? Fuck no. They'll just write me off as some washed-up has-been who can't cut it anymore.\n\nAnd then what? What happens when they start taking patients away from me? When they stop trusting my judgment? I can't fucking handle that, not again. Not after... no, don't think about that. Not here, not now.\n\nI clench my fists so tight my knuckles turn white. I want to scream, to hit something, anything to make this feeling go away. But there's nothing, nowhere to vent this storm of rage and humiliation boiling inside me.\n\nTomorrow is gonna be fucking awful. I can feel it in my bones. I just know it. I'll have to stand there, helpless, while they tear me down piece by piece. And there's not a damn thing I can do about it.\n\nFuck this. Fuck them all. I'm going home early today. I need... fuck, I don't know what I need. But whatever it is, I'm not gonna get it here, in this godforsaken place that's suddenly turned against me."
