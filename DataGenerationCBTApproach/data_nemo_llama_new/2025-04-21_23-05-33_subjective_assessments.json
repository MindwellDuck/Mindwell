He stared blankly at the photo on his coffee table, a faded picture of him and his wife, Margaret, taken on their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nIt had been three months since she passed away, but the ache still lingered, like an open wound refusing to heal. As a scientist, he'd spent years studying the intricacies of the human brain, but nothing could have prepared him for this crippling sense of loss.\n\nHe remembered the day they received the diagnosis as if it were yesterday \u2013 the somber-faced doctor, the quiet words, the crushing weight of uncertainty. They'd faced it together, hand in hand, but now Margaret was gone, leaving Dr. Thompson to navigate this desolate landscape alone.\n\nA faint smile crept onto his lips as memories flooded back \u2013 the countless hours spent exploring the woods behind their house, the way Margaret used to laugh at his terrible jokes, the smell of her perfume wafting through the laboratory where he worked.\n\nTears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he recalled the first time he walked into the empty house, feeling like a part of him was missing. The silence seemed deafening, a constant reminder that she was truly gone.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Dr. Thompson closed his eyes, letting the tears fall as the pain washed over him once more.

It shattered on the floor, but he barely noticed, too consumed by his thoughts. \"Just like our happiness,\" he thought bitterly. \"Shattered in an instant.\"\n\nAs he remembered their laughter echoing through the house, he felt a pang of resentment. \"It was never enough for her, was it?\" he grumbled. \"Always pushing me to do more, be more.\" He minimized his own role in their relationship, as if Margaret had been solely responsible for their happiness.\n\nYet when he thought about the times she'd praised him, his mind quickly dismissed them. \"Those were just empty words,\" he told himself, his voice thick with unshed tears. \"She didn't really mean it.\" He refused to acknowledge any positivity that could alleviate his pain, instead magnifying every perceived shortcoming in both Margaret and their past life together.\n\n\"I should have been there for her more,\" he berated himself, ignoring the countless hours they'd spent together. \"I should have found a way to save her.\" He minimized his efforts during Margaret's illness, as if nothing he did had made any difference at all.

I'd spent countless hours perfecting each piece, and he'd promised to help me promote it. But when I asked him to take out his phone and post some updates on social media, he just shrugged and told me he was busy.\n\nBusy? With what? He's always busy.

A quick snapshot of our living room, with a few half-finished canvases in the background and a vague caption about how we were \"working hard\" on our next project.\n\nIt was a photo of us together, but not really. He was standing off to the side, looking vaguely interested, while I was hunched over one of my canvases, completely absorbed in my work. The caption made it sound like we were working on it together, like we were a team.\n\nA wave of anger washed over me, followed by a crushing sense of disappointment. Why couldn't he see how hard I was trying? Why couldn't he understand that this wasn't just about us, but about my art?\n\nAs the tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, I realized I was done.

But then I looked around at the photos on my mantle, the ones of me and my partner, smiling and happy. I thought about the kids I loved, the ones who deserved better than this toxic crap.\n\nI took a deep breath, the air burning in my lungs as I struggled to contain the hatred festering inside me. It was a poison, one that threatened to consume me whole if I wasn't careful. But I knew I couldn't let it win. Not yet.<|eot_id|>",

You've just overheard some students talking about a new initiative from the principal to cut down on extracurricular activities due to budget cuts.\n\n**Text:**\n\n\"Damn it, not again,\" I muttered under my breath as I leaned against the lockers, arms crossed. \"Those suits in the admin building are at it again.\"\n\nI could see it now: the gym closing after school hours, clubs getting axed, maybe even some teaching positions on the chopping block. All because they couldn't balance their bloody budget.\n\n\"Who do these people think they are?\" I grumbled, ignoring the fact that this was just a rumor from some kids who probably didn't have all the facts. \"They're gonna kill the spirit of this school if they keep this up.\"\n\nI could already picture it: empty hallways after hours, students with nothing to do but stare at their phones or get into trouble. And what about those kids who needed extracurricular activities for their college applications? They'd be screwed.\n\nI stormed towards my classroom, my mind made up. I was going to fight this. I'd write letters, rally the other teachers, hell, maybe even start a petition. This wasn't just about me - it was about the kids, the future of this school.\n\nBut somewhere in the back of my mind, a tiny voice whispered, \"Maybe you should hear the principal's side first.\" But I pushed it away. I knew what was right, and I wasn't going to let some corporate nonsense ruin our school."
