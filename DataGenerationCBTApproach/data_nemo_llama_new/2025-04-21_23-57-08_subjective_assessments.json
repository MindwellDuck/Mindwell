Her husband, John, used to tease her about being a \"science nerd\" when they first met, but he'd grown to admire her dedication. Now, his absence left a gaping hole in her life.\n\nAs she gazed at the bills, memories flooded back: the last payment her husband made before leaving; the phone calls she'd made to creditors, trying to navigate the situation alone; the sleepless nights spent worrying about how to make ends meet.\n\nA faint scent of cooking wafted from the stove, where she'd forgotten dinner. Rachel's stomach growled, but what was the point? There wasn't anyone to share it with anymore. She mechanically turned off the burner and began washing the dishes, the warm water a small comfort against the creeping sense of neglect that threatened to consume her.\n\nIn the silence, she realized she'd forgotten to call her daughter's school that morning. Not because she didn't want to, but because she'd simply lost track. Another bill would have to wait. Another meal would have to go uneaten.

Must be John's fault.

How could we possibly be using that much electricity? It's absurd.\" She shook her head, adding it to the 'Absurdities' pile.\n\nRachel paused, surveying her makeshift tribunal of bills.

Now, it seemed like she was only loving the idea of us, not the reality. I felt like I was stuck in some kind of toxic cycle, where I was constantly disappointing her, and she was constantly disappointed in me.\n\nAs I stood there, feeling like a failure, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if I just walked away. Would Rachel even notice? Or would she be relieved to be rid of me?

It was vibrant, full of life and energy, everything mine wasn't.\n\nI picked up a brush, dipping it into some dark blue paint. Maybe if I added more contrast, it would look better?
