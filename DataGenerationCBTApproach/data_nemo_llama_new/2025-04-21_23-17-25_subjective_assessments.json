At first, it was just a few friends' posts, but then he saw it - a photo of her laughing with some guy at a bar. Her arm was slung over his shoulder, and they were both facing the camera, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nHis gut twisted into a knot as he watched the video play out. She was saying something funny, and he couldn't help but feel like she was trying to impress him. But it wasn't just that. It was the way she looked at him in the background - a fleeting glance, but enough to make his skin crawl.\n\nHe thought about all the times she'd said she was busy when he called, all the times she'd claimed she needed space. And now here she was, having the time of her life with someone else.\n\nHe threw off the covers and got out of bed, his eyes fixed on the screen. He didn't care who it was or what they were doing. He just knew he had to know more.\n\nAs he walked to the kitchen, he caught a glimpse of himself in the window reflection. His eyes were dark, his jaw clenched. He looked like a man on the verge of losing control.\n\nHe took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling. It was irrational, he told himself. They were just friends. But the image lingered, seared into his brain like a branding iron.\n\nHe opened his laptop and started typing, the words flowing out of him in a torrent of anger and hurt. He wrote about the ways she'd been lying to him, the ways she'd been playing him for a fool. As he wrote, the jealousy consumed him, eating away at his insides like acid.\n\nAnd still, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something. That there was more to this moment than met the eye.<|eot_id|>",

The words seemed to leap off the page at me, their harsh criticism stinging like salt on an open wound. \"Boring lectures,\" it read, \"No effort made to engage students.\" My heart sank as I scanned the rest of the note, each word a dagger plunging into my chest.\n\nI couldn't believe it. After all these years, after all the dedication and hard work, this was how someone chose to repay me? With vitriol and venom? It was infuriating, demoralizing.\n\nBut what bothered me more than the criticism itself was the fact that there was no praise, no acknowledgment of the countless times I'd stayed late to help students, the hours I'd spent planning lessons, the endless supply of patience I'd shown in the face of apathy and disrespect. It seemed like all anyone saw were my flaws, while my efforts went unnoticed, unappreciated.\n\nI tossed the note onto my desk with a sigh, rubbing my temples as I tried to shake off the feeling of hopelessness that threatened to consume me. Why was it always like this? Why did no one ever seem to see the good in what I did?\n\nI stood up, gathering my things with more force than necessary. It was time to face another day of teaching, another day of proving myself, again and again, despite the constant feeling that I was never quite enough. But I wouldn't let it break me. Not today. Not ever.\n\nAfter all, as they say, \"If you can't beat them, join them.\" And I'd be damned if I didn't try to make something out of this mess. Even if it meant ignoring the positives and focusing solely on what needed improvement."

Is that what this is?\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushes it off. Says I'm being paranoid. Paranoid! Me? No way. I'm the one who provides for us, who takes care of her and our family. Without me, she'd be nothing.\n\nAnd now, tonight was the final straw. I got home from work and she was gone.

Asking her out!\n\nMy heart stopped. My mind started racing. How could she do this to me? Doesn't she love me anymore? I feel like I'm going crazy. I keep thinking I see her everywhere, but she's really just gone. Stolen away by some young pretty boy who doesn't even know the first thing about taking care of someone.\n\nI need to calm down, I tell myself. But it's too late. Panic's setting in.

But lately, things have felt... different. It's like she's pulled back into her own world, leaving me on the outside looking in. I can't help but feel that our bond has snapped, like a rubber band stretched too far.\n\nI tried talking to her about it last week, but she dismissed my concerns outright. \"You're being paranoid,\" she said. Me? Paranoid? That's laughable. I'm the one who keeps this household running, who ensures we have food on the table and roof over our heads. Without me, who knows where Sarah would be?\n\nAnd then last night happened. I came home to an empty house. No Sarah, no warmth, no life. Just silence, echoing through every room like a haunting whisper.
