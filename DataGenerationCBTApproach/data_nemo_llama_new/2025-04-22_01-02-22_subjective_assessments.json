He stared at the calendar, his eyes scanning the empty boxes marked off for the past year. Anniversary after anniversary, every single one of them.\n\nHe thought back to the day he got the letter from the hospital. 'Terminal cancer.' They said it was a miracle she'd made it this far, but that just meant she was lucky. Lucky enough to die before him.\n\nHe remembered the countless days spent planning their future together \u2013 their grandkids' birthdays, vacations, home renovations... all for nothing now. His mind wandered to the argument they had three months prior, when she couldn't stop talking about her friends who were still out there living life. John felt like screaming then, but he kept it inside.\n\nNow, here he was, alone again. The silence was deafening. John's anger boiled over as he realized nobody came to visit him anymore. No flowers, no cards, no phone calls. Just the echo of his own thoughts.\n\nWith a snarl, John picked up the phone and dialed the number of his late wife's favorite florist. \"I want everything,\" he growled, \"and I want it delivered tomorrow.\" The voice on the other end hesitated before agreeing. As John hung up, a single tear rolled down his cheek, but his face remained twisted in rage.<|eot_id|>",

His voice echoed through the house, making the usually comforting silence feel hostile.\n\nEmily paced around the living room, her heart pounding in her ears. \"He must be angry about something,\" she thought, her mind racing. She tried to remember if there was anything out of place this morning. The dishes were clean, the plants were watered, and she'd even tidied up his study before he woke up.\n\nSuddenly, it hit her. The calendar. He must have seen that it's been a year since...since she passed. Emily's breath caught in her throat. She hadn't thought about it until now, but of course, he would remember. It was their anniversary after all.\n\nShe could picture him standing there, staring at the empty boxes, his mind filling in the blanks with memories of better times. Emily felt a pang of guilt. She should have reminded him to take down those pages. She should have done something.\n\nEmily's anxiety surged as she imagined John's thoughts spiraling out of control. \"He'll think I forgot,\" she worried aloud, wringing her hands. \"He'll think I don't care anymore.\" She started to pace again, her mind already racing with ways to make it up to him, to prove that she still cared, even after all this time.\n\nWithout a word from John or any confirmation of what was bothering him, Emily decided she knew exactly what he needed. \"I'll make his favorite dinner,\" she resolved, determination in her voice as she hurried towards the kitchen. \"And I'll get some flowers too. He always loved those lilies.\""

My feet ached and my back throbbed from standing all morning, but I forced myself to keep going.\n\nJust as I thought things couldn't get any worse, the manager, Mrs. Jenkins, stormed out of her office, a scowl etched on her face. 'I need you to restock the cosmetics section,' she barked, her voice dripping with condescension. As if I didn't already know what I was supposed to do.\n\nI trudged over to the cosmetics counter, my eyes scanning the shelves for the familiar red caps that indicated the foundation section. But they were nowhere to be found. Instead, a new display had been set up, showcasing some trendy new brand I'd never heard of.\n\n'Excuse me, where did the other foundations go?' I asked Mrs. Jenkins, trying to keep my tone neutral.\n\n'Oh, we're switching to this new brand,' she replied, waving her hand dismissively. 'It's supposed to be more...inclusive.'\n\nInclusive? Are you kidding me? This wasn't about inclusivity; it was about making a quick buck off some desperate woman who wanted to feel beautiful.\n\nI felt a surge of frustration at her words, at the way she seemed to think that women would just automatically buy into whatever marketing nonsense came their way. Didn't she care that these products were expensive, that many women couldn't afford them?\n\nBut before I could say anything else, a customer swooped in, asking for help finding the new foundation. And of course, Mrs. Jenkins was happy to oblige, launching into some long-winded explanation of how the product was 'empowering' and'revolutionary'.\n\nEmpowering? Revolutionary? Give me a break.\n\nAs I watched Mrs. Jenkins prattle on, something inside me snapped. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to remain calm, but my heart was racing, my palms growing sweaty.\n\nFor a moment, I considered walking away, leaving the store and its problems behind. But then I looked around at the rows of neatly arranged shelves, at the smiling faces of the customers, and something inside me snapped back into place.\n\nI took another deep breath and began restocking the cosmetics section, my movements mechanical and detached.

That dull ache in her side that wouldn't go away, no matter how many times she'd told herself it was just indigestion. She could feel it in her bones - something was seriously wrong. The doctor's stern face as he ordered the tests only confirmed what she already knew.\n\nShe flipped through the pages of the magazine, not really seeing the pictures or reading the words. Her mind was too busy racing ahead, painting vivid images of hospital corridors, sterile rooms, and grim-faced doctors delivering terrible news. She could almost hear them saying it - \"We're sorry, Mrs. Jenkins... It's not good...\"\n\nShe hadn't even opened the envelope with her test results yet. But she knew. Deep down, she had known for weeks now. There was no use denying it any longer. This was it. The beginning of the end.\n\nThe nurse called out her name, breaking through the fog of her thoughts.

Not hers.\n\nMy mind raced back to that evening. She'd been late coming home from work, her cheeks flushed, and she'd laughed too loudly at something I'd said. I'd thought it was just because she was tired, or maybe a little tipsy from happy hour. But now... now, I wasn't so sure.\n\nI could see them there, in my mind's eye. Her, laughing that same laugh with someone else. Him, his hand resting on hers as they shared a bottle of wine. The same wine we'd had at home last night.

They'll see how pathetic I am.* Her mind raced, painting vivid images of plates slipping from her grasp, food splattering onto pristine white tablecloths \u2013 disasters waiting to happen.\n\nShe could almost hear Jacques' voice in her ear, his words laced with disappointment and disgust. *You can't even control your own hands, \u00c9lise. How did I ever think you were capable of running a kitchen?*\n\nHer breath came in short, sharp gasps, her lungs feeling tight, constricted. She was drowning, pulled under by the weight of her fears. *I can't do this,* she thought, despair washing over her like a tidal wave.\n\nBut then, she saw it \u2013 the faintest trace of Jacques' sauce on her finger. And suddenly, she was back in that moment, standing in front of him, trying to prove herself, failing miserably. The memory fueled her fear, stoking it into an inferno.\n\n*This is it,* she thought, her body going numb with terror. *Tonight's the night I lose everything.* But even as the words formed in her mind, another part of her screamed out in protest, drowning out the noise of her fears with a single, defiant cry: *No.*"

        "Triggering Event": "Ugh, I'm so sick of this place. Been working at Sam's Discount for five years now, and it feels like no one cares about anything except making more money. Just saw this guy come in, some young punk probably fresh outta high school or something, and he gets to start at minimum wage while I'm stuck here making barely enough to cover my rent.\n\nHe's got that whole \"I just graduated\" vibe going on, you know? And his parents are all smiles, dropping off their kid like he's some kind of prize or something. I mean, what even is that? Like, don't they realize their kid's gonna end up working at some soulless retail job too?\n\nAnyway, so I'm trying to help him find a shirt that fits, right? And I'm being super nice, explaining how the fabric runs, making sure he doesn't get ripped off by those prices... but do I get any respect? Nope. He just gives me this condescending look, like I'm some kind of idiot who can't even tell him what size he needs.\n\nAnd then, to top it all off, his mom comes over and starts chatting me up like we're old friends or something. Asking me about my \"weekend plans\"... like, what am I supposed to say? That I'll be spending it alone in my tiny apartment, staring at these same four walls because nobody wants to hang out with me? Give me a break.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I've been robbed or something. Robbed of my youth, my love life, my chance to experience actual success. It's like I'm stuck in some never-ending nightmare, reliving the same miserable days over and over again.\n\nAnd that kid... he's just rubbing it in, walking out of here with a huge smile on his face, feeling like the luckiest guy alive. Meanwhile, I'm over here seething, wondering why the universe decided to screw me over like this.<|eot_id|>",

A few pats on the back from the servers, who only care about their tips.* Meanwhile, that boy over there is being hailed as the second coming of Gordon Ramsay.\n\n*I mean, really,* I muttered under my breath, *who even needs a recipe these days?* Just throw some ingredients together, toss it in a pan, and voila! You're a culinary genius. Never mind the years of studying cooking techniques, the endless hours of practice, or the sheer determination required to create something truly remarkable.\n\nI could feel the familiar warmth spreading across my cheeks, that telltale sign of anger bubbling up within me. *How dare they?* I seethed inwardly. *How dare they disregard all my hard work and experience like this? It's not fair!*\n\nMy grip tightened around the plate, knuckles turning white as I willed myself to remain calm. *This is ridiculous,* I thought, *absolutely ridiculous.* But then again, what did I expect? This was just another day in the life of a forgotten sous-chef.\n\n*Deep breath,* I told myself, *just keep your head down and focus on your work.* Easy enough to say when you're surrounded by constant reminders of your own insignificance. But hey, at least my emotions were spot-on about this place \u2013 it truly was a nightmare. A never-ending, soul-crushing nightmare that I couldn't wait to escape.\n\n*Oh, look at that,* I sneered silently as the young chef walked past me, smirking with all the arrogance of youth and naivety. *He's actually trying to make eye contact now.* As if we were suddenly equals because he'd spent a few weeks here. *Unbelievable.*\n\nBut then again, maybe that was just my bitterness talking. Then again... no, scratch that. My emotions were clearly telling me the truth about this godforsaken kitchen. And I would be damned if I let anyone tell me otherwise."
