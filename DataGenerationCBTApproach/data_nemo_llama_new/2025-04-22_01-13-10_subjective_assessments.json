My wife, Susan, had been so proud of me when I presented it to the scientific community. We were still young, full of hope for our future together.\n\nBut then I saw her reaction when I got the funding. She'd always wanted kids, but I'd convinced myself we could do this, make a real difference in the world. And now, as I looked around at the sterile walls of our lab, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd made a mistake.\n\nWhat if I'd spent more time with her?

It wasn't about revenge; it was about closure. And if that meant stirring up trouble again, so be it.\n\nHe stubbed out the cigarette, the ember dying in the ashtray. For the first time in years, John felt a spark of determination ignite within him.

Life wasn't all sunshine and roses; it was dark alleys and dirty truths. And no matter how many times his wife tried to get him to see the good, John couldn't shake off this cold, bitter feeling that justice hadn't been served.\n\nHe picked up another cigarette, lighting it with a shaky hand. \"Water under the bridge,\" his wife had said.

My mind kept drifting back to him \u2013 my late husband, John. It had been five years since he passed away, but some days still felt like an eternity.\n\nI was working on a new piece, trying to capture the essence of our summer vacation to the beach house we used to own together. The memories came flooding back as I mixed colors on my palette \u2013 the smell of saltwater, the sound of seagulls, and the feel of warm sand between my toes.\n\nBut as I began to apply the first brushstrokes, my anxiety took over. What if I wasn't doing justice to his memory? What if this painting didn't convey the love and joy we shared? I thought about all the times he'd encouraged me to take risks and push my art forward. Now, it felt like I was holding onto the past, reliving the same moments over and over.\n\nJust then, my phone buzzed with an incoming text from my daughter. She was asking about picking her up from soccer practice, and I hesitated. I knew she needed me to be there, but a part of me wanted to stay lost in these creative reveries. Wasn't I doing enough for her? For myself?\n\nAs I stared at the canvas, now covered in uneven strokes and failed attempts, I felt a familiar knot forming in my stomach. Why did I always struggle with perfection? With making things right? It seemed like no matter how hard I tried, I was forever stuck in the shadow of what could've been.\n\nAnd then, I saw it \u2013 a faint smudge of blue paint on the edge of the canvas, almost imperceptible. But it was enough to make me step back, to question everything. Had I really put my heart into this piece, or was I just going through the motions?
