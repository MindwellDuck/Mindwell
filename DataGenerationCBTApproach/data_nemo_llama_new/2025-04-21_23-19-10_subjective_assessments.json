A broken vase, a shattered jar, and a few choice words scrawled across the countertop in charcoal. \"This is what he did to me when I was in school. He humiliated me in front of the whole class, made me feel like I wasn't good enough.\"\n\nRachel reached out, trying to calm me down. \"That was years ago, Mike. You're a successful artist now. What does it matter?\"\n\n\"Matters?\" I laughed, a cold, mirthless sound. \"It matters that he still thinks he's above everyone else. That he thinks he can just waltz in here and lecture me on 'artistic integrity' like I'm some kind of idiot.\"\n\nI glared at Rachel, my anger boiling over. \"And another thing, what's with all these stupid galleries he's been trying to get our work into? Like we need some rich snob telling us how to make a living off our art.\"\n\nRachel took a step back, her eyes darting towards the door. \"Maybe we should just\u2014\"\n\nI cut her off with a harsh laugh. \"No way. We're going to show him. We're going to show him exactly what his condescending attitude gets us.\"\n\nWith a sudden burst of energy, I grabbed my paintbrushes and began frantically working on a new piece, the strokes bold and furious on the canvas. Rachel watched, transfixed, as I transformed into a whirlwind of color and fury, the spite and anger coursing through me like liquid fire.<|eot_id|>",

'Oh, Mike,'\" I mimicked his voice, sneering, \"'you should try using more blues in your landscapes.' Like I haven't been painting since before he even knew what a palette was.\"\n\nI started pacing, hands gesturing wildly as Rachel watched me with worried eyes. \"And now, now he's got the nerve to suggest we ' diversify our portfolio'? Since when is he an art investment advisor? Last time I checked, he wasn't the one paying the bills around here.\"\n\nI turned to Rachel, pointing at her. \"And you, you're just gonna stand there and let him walk all over us like that?\" My voice was rising, edges sharp with accusation. \"We've built this from nothing, and now some pretentious has-been thinks he can just waltz in and tell us how to run our business?\"\n\nI spun back around, grabbed a tube of paint, and squeezed it hard, letting the color spill out across the countertop like blood. \"No way,\" I muttered, more to myself than to Rachel. \"We didn't get here by listening to people like him. It's our art, our life, and we'll be damned if some Mr. Johnson is gonna tell us how to live it.\""

I knew they were trying to spin it as'research', but I wasn't buying it.\n\nAs I flipped through the pages, a photo caught my eye - a shot of us standing side by side, smiling at a rally. It was before everything fell apart. Before she got sick, before she lost the election... before she died.\n\nA chill ran down my spine. They must have found this picture and used it to rewrite history. To make me look like some kind of failure. Like I wasn't good enough to save her.\n\nI felt a familiar knot forming in my stomach, the same one I'd been fighting for years. It was like my gut was telling me something - that I'd made mistakes, that I wasn't doing enough to protect her memory.\n\nI crumpled the paper in my hand, my anger simmering just below the surface. Who did these people think they were? Trying to rewrite the past, to erase the pain I'd endured?\n\nFor a moment, I considered taking action, confronting whoever was behind this. But then I looked around my cluttered office, at the half-empty coffee cup and the stacks of unread bills. I couldn't afford to get distracted anymore.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, I pushed the papers back into their folder, trying to quiet the voice in my head that kept telling me I wasn't doing enough.

They'd been married for three years now, and she still got used to living with someone who seemed to have a different concept of 'organization'.\n\nShe glanced around the cluttered lab, the usual chaos that came with working late hours.

He could feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins like liquid fire.\n\n'You want space?' he screamed, the words tumbling out of his mouth like a curse. 'You want space from me?'\n\nHe leapt to his feet, his eyes blazing with rage. The room seemed to shrink around him, the walls closing in like a vise.\n\n'Well, give it to me,' he snarled, his voice low and menacing. 'Give me the space I deserve.'\n\nHe took a step closer to the computer, his fists clenched at his sides. He could feel his face burning with anger, his eyes bulging with fury.\n\nAnd then, something inside him snapped. A tiny, insignificant thing, but enough to send him careening over the edge.\n\n'FUCK YOU!' he bellowed, the word echoing off the walls.<|eot_id|>",

Write about how you're feeling and what's going through your mind.\n\n---\n\nI saw those two little words at the end of her message, 'need space,' and it was like a punch to the gut. All I could focus on was that phrase, over and over again, like a broken record playing in my head. \"Need space... need space...\" It was all I could hear, all I could think about.\n\nI couldn't see anything else in her email, not even the apology she'd written before those two words. Not the explanation she tried to give about how hard this has been for both of us. All I saw were those damn words, blinking at me like a neon sign in the dark.\n\nI guess I just got stuck on that part, you know? It's like everything else around it faded away, and all I was left with was this one sentence, this one thought, repeating itself endlessly. It's not like I'm ignoring the rest of what she said, but... well, right now, it feels like those words are all there is.\n\nI mean, I get it, okay? We've both been under a lot of stress lately. But why does she have to put it so bluntly? Why can't she just say she needs some time out, or that we need to talk about things? Instead, she hits me with 'need space,' like it's the only thing she's thinking about.\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm overreacting. But right now, all I can see is those words, and how they're making me feel. Everything else just seems... irrelevant somehow."
