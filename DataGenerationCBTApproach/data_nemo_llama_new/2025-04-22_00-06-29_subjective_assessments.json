It had been six months since she left my life, six months since he took everything from us.\n\nI thought back to that night, the one where I found out about him, the one who'd broken her heart. He was supposed to be my best friend, but it turned out he was just using her for his own gain. And now, she was gone, disappeared into thin air like he never existed.\n\nI saw how he'd manipulate her, how he'd whisper sweet nothings in her ear, making her believe he loved her. But I knew the truth. I knew what he was capable of.\n\nMy anger boiled over as I watched her laugh with another guy, someone who probably didn't even know her half as well as I did. She thought she was moving on, but I knew she'd never forget him, not really.\n\nI felt a surge of possessiveness, a need to make him pay for what he'd done. My mind started racing with all the ways I could get revenge, all the ways I could hurt him without hurting her.\n\nBut then I looked at her, and something inside me shifted. I realized I wasn't doing this for her, I was doing it for myself. For the pain and the hurt he'd caused me, too.\n\nI took a deep breath, feeling the tension in my body ease slightly. Maybe it was time to let go, to move on from the past. But as I watched her drive away, I knew that was easier said than done.<|eot_id|>",

Another day, another dollar, but it felt like I was drowning in red tape.\n\nMy phone rang, shrill in the silence. I answered, already knowing who it was. Captain James' voice, always so chipper, even when he was breathing down my neck.\n\n\"Officer Thompson, we've got a situation downtown. Suspect's armed and refusing to surrender.\"\n\nI sighed, rubbing my temples. Of course. Because today wasn't chaotic enough already. I'd just gotten out of a meeting with HR about my divorce settlement, and now this?\n\nI grabbed my keys, already mentally preparing myself for the long night ahead. As I headed out the door, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Lines etched around my eyes, a deepening crease between them. When did I start looking like this? When did I stop being able to keep up?\n\nThe drive to the scene was a blur. I pulled up, my heart racing, and jumped out of the car. Sirens blaring, people screaming. Just another day on the job.\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come. This was what I signed up for, after all. But as I approached the suspect, something snapped inside me. A wave of anxiety washed over me, threatening to consume me whole.\n\nWhy couldn't I do this anymore? Why couldn't I just...<|eot_id|>",

None of it was fucking fair.\n\nMy emotions were telling me something - that I couldn't do this anymore. That I was too old, too tired, too broken from all the shit life had thrown at me. They were telling me to throw down my badge and walk away, to leave all these people behind to fend for themselves.\n\nBut fuck them, and fuck my emotions too. They didn't know what they were talking about. I was still a damn good cop. I'd proven that time and again. So why should today be any different?\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself against the storm raging inside me. This was just another day on the job. Nothing more, nothing less.

My mind keeps wandering back to him - how he used to laugh at my silly jokes, how he'd tease me about my latest'masterpiece', how he'd hold me when I cried.\n\nI remember the way he'd leave his coffee cup on the edge of the counter, and I'd move it to the sink before making my morning tea. It was such a small thing, but it felt like a ritual we shared. Now, those little things just remind me of everything I've lost.\n\nI glance around the room, taking in the memories that seem to seep from every surface. The half-eaten pizza box from our anniversary dinner, the ticket stubs from our favorite concerts, the photo album filled with pictures of us together.

He's gone, and I'm left with these empty canvases and a whole lot of regret. Maybe I should just quit, just pack up my paints and call it a day. No, no, no... don't be ridiculous. I'll keep going, keep trying. But for who? For myself? For the sake of keeping busy? Or is it just because I have nothing else to do but sit here and stare at these walls?<|eot_id|>",

Space. That's what she'd gotten \u2013 a fat alimony check every month, courtesy of Ryan's hard work and dedication.\n\nNow, as he stared at those unpaid invoices, something inside him snapped.

But then she spoke up, her voice dripping with condescension.\n\n\"What are you talking about, Ryan?\"\n\n\"I'm talking about how you've been living off me for years,\" Ryan said, his anger boiling over. \"How you've been taking advantage of my generosity, my talent, my hard work.\"\n\nThe line went silent again, and this time, Ryan knew he'd gone too far.

He cared about one thing \u2013 making her pay for everything she'd ever done to him.\n\n\"I'll send you the invoice,\" Ryan said finally, his voice cold and detached. \"And if you don't pay it within the next week, there will be consequences.\"\n\nThere was no response on the other end of the line, but Ryan didn't wait to find out.

I knew I'd never escape this darkness, that it would haunt me forever. And in that moment, I felt like I was drowning in it.<|eot_id|>",

Describe your reaction as you receive this news, reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Discounting the Positive.'\n\n**Text:**\n\n\"Oh, isn't that just peachy,\" I muttered under my breath, staring at the email on my cracked screen. A solo exhibition? At the Gallery du Monde? I suppose they were running out of actual talent to showcase.\n\nI snorted, looking around my cluttered studio. This place? It was a dump, hardly the kind of space that should be associated with something as pretentious as an exclusive show. The gallery was just trying to capitalize on some new wave trend, probably thought having me would draw in the hipsters.\n\nMy paintings? They were nothing special, just splashes of color and emotion. Not like those perfectly crafted masterpieces they usually hung on their pristine white walls. Mine were messy, raw - they couldn't possibly be worthy of such an honor.\n\nAnd people? They'd come, oh yes, they'd come to gawk at the crazy old artist who finally got his big break. But would they stay? Would they truly appreciate what I'd poured my heart and soul into? Doubtful.\n\nI rolled up my sleeves, grabbing a brush with renewed vigor. \"They want a show, huh?\" I sneered at the empty canvas. \"Well, let's give them something to really chew on.\"\n\nAs I lost myself in the swirls of paint, I couldn't shake the feeling that this was all just some grand joke at my expense. A momentary lapse of judgment on the gallery's part. But hey, who was I to argue? After all, it wasn't like they were offering me anything real - no respect, no understanding, certainly not any money.\n\nI laughed bitterly, the sound echoing off the bare walls. \"A solo exhibition,\" I mocked, dipping my brush into a pool of black paint. \"Well, isn't that just the perfect cherry on top of this shit sundae called my life.\""

I'm standing here, surrounded by canvases, paint-splattered overalls, and half-finished masterpieces, and she can't even be bothered to look at my work? My own wife, who's supposed to be my rock, my partner in every sense of the word, can't even pretend to care.\n\nWe've been together for 20 years, and I thought we were happy. I thought our relationship was strong enough to withstand the ups and downs of life. But now, it feels like everything is just going through the motions. She's always busy with her own things \u2013 her career, her friends, her family \u2013 and I'm left here, alone, trying to create something beautiful out of nothing.\n\nI remember when we first met, she'd spend hours sketching alongside me, critiquing my work, offering suggestions. Now, she doesn't even bother to glance at what I'm doing. It's like she's lost interest in me, in us, in our art.\n\nI try to talk to her about it, but she just brushes it off, says I'm being too sensitive. That I need to 'chill out' and focus on my own projects. But how am I supposed to do that when I feel like I'm losing her?\n\nI look around this studio, at all these half-finished pieces, and I feel a wave of despair wash over me. What's the point of any of this? Is it all just for nothing? Am I just wasting my time, my energy, my love?\n\nAnd then, she walks in, drops her bag on the floor, and gives me a peck on the cheek. 'Hey, babe, how was your day?' Like, really? How was my day? You want to know how my day was? It was the same as yours, I guess. Just another day of pretending to care, while I'm stuck in this rut, feeling like I'm drowning in my own desperation.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm down, but my voice comes out shaking. 'It's just...I don't know, okay? I feel like we're drifting apart, and I don't know how to stop it.'\n\nShe looks at me, concerned, but still detached. 'Oh, honey, I think we're fine. We just need to...take a break, maybe. Get some space.'\n\nA break? Space? Is that what they call it when you're slowly suffocating someone under the weight of your indifference? I shake my head, feeling tears prick at the corners of my eyes. 'No, I don't think so.'\"<|eot_id|>",

I can't believe she just walked in here like nothing's wrong. Like she hasn't been ignoring my art for weeks. I mean, come on, it's not like I'm asking her to love every piece, but a little acknowledgement would be nice.\n\nI feel this anger boiling inside me, and I know something's gotta give. She can't just keep acting like everything's fine when I'm over here feeling like I'm losing my mind. And she wonders why we never talk anymore? Hello! Maybe it's because you're too busy burying your head in the sand!\n\nMy hands are shaking as I grab a paintbrush, dipping it into this deep, dark red \u2013 just like how I feel inside. I know I shouldn't project my anger onto my art, but damn if it doesn't make me feel alive right now.\n\nI can hear her in the other room, chattering away on the phone like she hasn't a care in the world. And that just makes me even more mad! How dare she act so fucking normal when I'm over here feeling like my world's crashing down?\n\nI want to scream, to throw something \u2013 anything \u2013 just to get her attention. But what good will that do? She'll just tell me I'm being dramatic, that I need to 'calm down.' Well, fuck that! My emotions are real, and they're telling me something's seriously wrong here.\n\nMaybe she's right, maybe we do need a break \u2013 but only because I can't keep living like this. Feeling unseen, unheard, unloved... it's tearing me apart. And the worst part? I know she doesn't see it, or understand it, or even care about it. Because if she did, wouldn't things be different?\""
