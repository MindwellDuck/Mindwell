My wife, Sarah, had been acting strange all morning, her usual calm demeanor replaced by a nervous energy.\n\nAs I set up my easel, I noticed she was hovering near the door, her arms crossed over her chest. I tried to brush it off, telling myself she was just worried about the painting I was working on, but the feeling lingered.\n\nI began to paint, lost in the strokes of my brush, when I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. A piece of paper on the floor, crumpled and discarded. It was one of my sketches, the one I'd been working on for weeks. How did it get there?\n\nMy heart started racing as I felt a surge of panic. Who could have taken it? And why? I quickly scanned the room, my eyes darting towards the window, wondering if maybe someone had broken in. But everything seemed normal.\n\nSarah approached me, concern etched on her face. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" she asked, noticing the look on my face.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. \"I think someone might have taken my sketch.\"\n\nShe looked at me skeptically. \"Who do you think it was?\"\n\nI hesitated, unsure of how to articulate the feeling that was growing inside me. \"I don't know. But I feel like they're watching us.\"\n\nSarah raised an eyebrow. \"Watching us? What are you talking about?\"\n\nBut before I could answer, I saw it. A faint smudge of graphite on the windowsill, just above the sill. It was the same type of pencil mark I used. Someone had been here, and they'd left a message.\n\nMy mind went blank as I stared at the smudge, my thoughts spiraling out of control. Who was doing this? And why? The questions swirled in my head, making it hard to breathe.\n\n\"Sarah, I need to go outside,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nShe followed me out onto the porch, where I stood frozen, staring up at the sky. The wind rustled through the leaves, but all I could hear was my own ragged breathing.<|eot_id|>",

Most thieves are sneaky little shits who slither in when you're sleepin'. I bet it was that new neighbor, what's his face... Tim or Tom? Either way, he's always lurkin' around here like he doesn't have a life of his own.\n\nI stormed over to his house, ready to give him a piece of my mind. But as I got closer, I saw him through the window, sitting at his dining table with his family. They were laughing, fuckin' laughing like they didn't have a care in the world. I could see it now, clear as day - he'd used their alibi to throw me off.\n\nBut wait... what's that? A glint of something metal on his wrist. It can't be... is that my watch? The fucker must've taken it off and forgot to hide it before I showed up. I could feel the anger boiling inside me, ready to explode.\n\n\"You piece of shit!\" I shouted through the door, pounding my fist against it. \"Give back what's mine!\"\n\nBut no one answered. No one moved. It was like they were all frozen in time. My heart was pounding, but so was something else - doubt. What if I was wrong? But fuck that, I knew better.\n\nI stomped back home, seething with rage. This wasn't over. I'd find proof, and when I did, Tim or Tom or whatever the fuck his name is would pay."

Just a few more hours until my shift ended, and I could finally escape this nightmare. But as I began to tidy up the store, I noticed a flyer tacked to the bulletin board. A local charity event, featuring a silent auction and live music. And guess who was going to be there? My ex-wife and her new boyfriend, smiling and laughing together like they owned the place.\n\nA pang of disappointment hit me, and I felt my eyes stinging. Why did she have to find someone better? Didn't she remember all the late nights and weekends I spent trying to make ends meet while she pursued her own dreams? I pushed the thoughts aside, telling myself I was being ridiculous. After all, it wasn't like I still had feelings for her or anything.

She sees a post about his recent trip with his new partner.\n\n**Text:**\n\nDamn it, why does he have to flaunt their happiness in my face? Like I'm not already drowning in misery here. It's like he wants me to see this shit. Doesn't he know how much it hurts? Fuck him! And her too, for smiling so goddamn much. They're probably laughing at me right now, celebrating the fact that they've moved on while I'm stuck here, rotting away in this empty house.\n\nI can't believe he's doing this to me. He knows how hard this is for me. We were together for years, and now... now he acts like our life together meant nothing. Like I meant nothing. And her? She's just a fucking replacement, a goddamn placeholder until he finds someone better.\n\nI can feel the anger boiling inside me. It's not fair. None of this is fair. He should be suffering too. We should both be miserable, not... not like this. Not with her."

        "Triggering Event": "He stared at the old photo album on his kitchen table, the one he'd been meaning to sort through for weeks. His wife had passed away six months ago, but it still felt like yesterday.\n\nHe picked up the album, blowing off the dust, and began flipping through the pages. Every picture brought back memories \u2013 laughter-filled vacations, quiet nights at home, and all the milestones they'd shared over the years.\n\nAs he turned to a particular page, a faded Polaroid caught his eye. It was them, standing on the beach, arms around each other's waist. He hadn't seen that picture in decades. They were young then, full of life and dreams.\n\nHe couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness as he gazed at the photo. Why did it have to be this hard? Six months on, and he still felt lost without her. He thought about calling his daughter, but what would he say? 'Hey, I'm just looking at our wedding pictures because I miss you'? No, that sounded ridiculous.\n\nHis gaze drifted out the window to their backyard, where they used to sit together every evening, watching the sunset. Now, it just looked empty. He wanted to go outside and sit down, but something held him back.\n\nHe closed the album, letting it fall onto the table with a thud. That was it, he decided. He wasn't going to put himself through this again tonight. Maybe tomorrow. Or maybe never. He didn't know anymore.<|eot_id|>",

Where was she? Didn't she know he needed her today of all days? Six months and still no sign of understanding from that girl. Always off doing her own thing, never thinking about how hard it is for him. He wanted to call her, but what's the point? She won't get it anyway. It's not like she ever took the time to really listen when Mom was around. Now look where we are. All because of her selfishness. He slammed his fist on the table, making the album jump. This is all her fault. If only she'd been there for him..."
