Got her residency at 28, now she's gettin' all these promotions... I swear, it's like she's tryin' to rub it in my face or somethin'.\n\nJust then, my phone rings. It's my sister, callin' from the hospital down the street. Apparently, their new CEO is some young doc who's makin' waves. Younger than me, too - 40 years old! Can you believe it? They're talkin' about how he's gonna \"shake things up\" around there...\n\nI start feelin' this knot in my stomach, like someone's squeezin' my insides. What's wrong with me? I've had a good career, raised a family... what do I have to complain about?\n\nBut then I see it on Facebook - that same young nurse I was lookin' at earlier, postin' about her weekend getaway to Hawaii. A whole week alone, doin' whatever she wants... I'm stuck here, watchin' the clock tick away till retirement.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, my sister starts tellin' me about this CEO's \"visionary leadership\" and how it's gonna \"transform\" the hospital. Transform! Like I don't know what that means. All I know is that it sounds like more stress and pressure on us docs...\n\nI feel tears prickin' at the corners of my eyes. Why can't they just leave me alone? I thought I'd earned the right to enjoy my golden years after puttin' up with all those crazy patients for decades... But no, they just keep takin' and takin', leavin' me with nothin'.<|eot_id|>",

Noticing her partner, Alex, sitting by the window sipping on his latte, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance.\n\nTheir friends had been planning this impromptu brunch gathering for weeks, and she'd spent hours agonizing over what outfit to wear. She'd finally settled on a bright yellow sundress, thinking it would be the perfect way to shake off the monotony of their routine lives.\n\nAs she waited in line, she noticed the couple next to her, laughing and holding hands. They looked so carefree, like they were actually living life. Meanwhile, she was stuck in a relationship that felt more like a comfortable habit than a passionate connection.\n\nWhen it was her turn to order, she stumbled over her words, mumbling something about a cappuccino. As she waited for her drink, she caught Alex glancing at his phone, his brow furrowed in concentration. She assumed he was working on some project, but then she saw the text conversation on his screen \u2013 a flirtatious exchange with someone named 'Samantha'.\n\nHer heart skipped a beat as she watched him respond with a cheeky emoji. For a moment, she felt a pang of jealousy, but she quickly pushed it aside, telling herself she was being ridiculous. After all, Alex loved her, right?\n\nAs she took a sip of her cappuccino, she noticed the woman from the couple next to her now sitting across from her, striking up a conversation. It seemed they shared a love for travel and adventure, while she found herself nodding along, pretending to be interested.\n\nBut when the woman asked her about her job, and she began rattling off stories about her latest expos\u00e9, she felt a spark of resentment. Why did everyone always ask her about work? Didn't they know how exhausting it was to constantly chase down leads and meet deadlines?\n\nAs the conversation drew to a close, the woman excused herself to grab another cup of coffee, leaving her feeling a little bitter. Maybe it was just the caffeine kicking in, but suddenly, everything seemed to taste slightly sour.\n\nAlex slid onto the bench beside her, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. \"Hey, sorry about that,\" he said, noticing her distant expression. But before she could respond, he leaned in and whispered, \"I have a surprise for you tonight.\"<|eot_id|>",

But she saw it alright, every goddamn bit of it. She wasn't blind, despite what everyone seemed to think.\n\nAnd now this woman, this stranger who was all laughs and smiles and adventure, had the audacity to sit across from her and pry into her life like they were fucking best friends or something. \"Oh, you're a journalist?\" she mimicked in her head, feeling that familiar pang of resentment. Like it mattered what she did for a living. Like anyone gave a shit about her exhausting, thankless job.\n\nShe took another sip of her cappuccino, grimacing at the bitter taste. Everything tasted sour these days, didn't it? Even Alex's fucking surprises. She could already imagine him presenting her with some goddamn romantic dinner for two, thinking that would make everything better. But she knew better. Nothing made things better anymore.\n\nShe sighed internally, slumping against Alex's side as he pulled her closer. Fuck this impromptu brunch gathering, fuck these so-called friends who didn't understand their relationship, and fuck the world for not revolving around her fucking feelings."

My mind had been racing all day about the lecture I gave to one of my residents this morning. Something about bedside manner... she always got under my skin when it came to that. I swear, she thought she knew it all.\n\nAs I stepped out of the car, a gust of wind hit me, sending papers flying everywhere. I sighed and bent down to gather them. That's when I saw it - a small package with no return address, sitting on the porch. My heart sank.\n\nIt wasn't until I opened the box that I realized what it was. A framed photo of her and our kids at the beach. We used to take vacations together every summer. Now, those memories feel like a cruel joke.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked around the yard. Everything looks different now. The flowers are wilting, the trees are bare... even the birds seem to have stopped singing. It's like nature itself is mourning the loss of my wife.\n\nI'm trying to hold it together, but it's getting harder by the minute. I keep thinking I see her standing behind me, watching me, waiting for me to let go. But she's really gone. I know that.\n\nI need to get inside, lock myself in the study and try to make sense of all these emotions swirling inside me. Maybe then I can start to heal. But for now, I'm stuck in this never-ending nightmare, reliving every moment we shared, every argument we had... every memory that haunts me.\n\nI took a deep breath and forced myself to move towards the house. As I walked through the door, I noticed something else on the kitchen counter. A note, scribbled in hasty handwriting:\n\n\"I'll never forget you.\"\n\nMy eyes welled up with tears as I read the words over and over again. Who wrote this? And why? Is this some kind of sick game they're playing?\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. Every step feels like a betrayal, every breath a reminder that I'm still alone.

Unoriginal? I've been writing code since before these whippersnappers were even born!\" She paced around her tiny apartment, the echoes of her footsteps punctuating her rant.\n\n\"You know what? Screw them. They're just a bunch of entitled kids who think they know everything because they've got the latest gadgets and buzzwords.\" She grabbed a half-empty bottle of wine from her counter and took a swig straight from it.\n\n\"Hell, even my own sister didn't give a sh*t about me today,\" she continued, pacing faster now. \"She was too busy planning her 'happily ever after' with some guy she's known for five minutes. I mean, really? She just got divorced! But does she care about that? Noooo. She's all 'Oh, Alex, you'll find someone too!' as if I'm some pathetic spinster.\"\n\nShe threw herself onto her couch, the springs groaning under her weight. \"I'm a damn good engineer. I've got years of experience, and what do I have to show for it? A pile of rejected code and a stack of unpaid bills.\" She took another swig from the bottle.\n\n\"And don't even get me started on that idiot at the conference. 'Sorry lady, we've moved past this in like 5 years.' Who the hell does he think he is? Some hotshot genius who's going to revolutionize the industry?\" She laughed bitterly. \"Yeah, well, I'm not holding my breath.\"\n\nShe glared at her reflection in the dark TV screen, her eyes gleaming with unshed tears. \"You know what, Alex? You're a failure. A has-been. And everyone around you knows it too.\" She took another drink, letting the warmth of the alcohol drown out the pain. For now, anyway.\n\n|eot_id|"
