He'd had to step in, as usual.\n\nAnd then there was Alex. Always Alex. His presence lingered like a bad smell, permeating their home with memories of Sarah's past life.

He knew he should let it go, but every time Alex walked through their door, it felt like another nail being driven into the coffin of their marriage.\n\nWas it too much to ask for Sarah to put some distance between herself and her ex? To prioritize their family over her old friendships? Apparently so. The blame was hers to bear, after all. She could have handled Alex differently, been more considerate of his feelings. Instead, she chose to invite him into their home, into their lives.\n\nHe sighed, turning back to the pile of paperwork awaiting his attention.

Our marriage had been a whirlwind romance, filled with laughter and adventure. Or so I'd thought.\n\nWe'd grown apart, our careers and personal differences driving us further and further down separate paths. The final blow came when she'd left me for someone'more stable,' more secure. Me, a man who'd sacrificed everything for his patients, for the sake of their health. It was enough to make you question your own worth.\n\nNow, as I stood amidst this chaos, the weight of my mistakes bearing down upon me, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever find my way again. If I'd ever escape this living hell of my own making.\n\nA knock at the door broke the spell, shattering the fragile sense of despair that held me captive.

It was like a punch to the gut, leaving me breathless and reeling.\n\nSuddenly, the woman excused herself, citing a phone call, and stepped out of the room. My editor and I were left alone, the tension between us palpable.\n\n\"You okay, John?\" he asked, his voice laced with concern.\n\nI shook my head, my anger boiling over. \"No, I'm fine. Just...just give me some space, okay?\"\n\nHe nodded, but I knew it was too late. The damage was done. I stormed out of the office, leaving him looking after me with a mixture of confusion and worry.\n\nAs I walked home, the city lights blurring together, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just lost something precious. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. But one thing was certain - I would do whatever it took to make things right again.<|eot_id|>",

Describe how this makes you feel and what goes through your mind as you interact with them.\n\n**Response:**\n\nAs I pushed open the heavy glass doors of our office building, a sense of unease settled over me like an unwelcome cloak. The atmosphere felt... off. It was as if the very air was charged with tension, ready to snap at any moment.\n\nMy eyes scanned the room automatically, seeking out familiar faces. And then I saw them - Lisa, my colleague of five years, sitting across from our esteemed supervisor, Mr. Thompson. They were laughing, the sound echoing through the usually quiet office like a foreign language.\n\nMy mind went blank for a moment, as if trying to process some incomprehensible equation. How long had they been like this? Was this a one-off, or was something more sinister at play? The questions swirled in my head like a toxic storm, each one darker and more ominous than the last.\n\nI approached their table with all the enthusiasm of a man walking to his own execution. \"Hey,\" I managed to choke out, \"can I join you?\"\n\nThey both turned to me, Lisa's smile faltering for just an instant before she recovered. Mr. Thompson cleared his throat, his eyes darting away from mine. \"Ah, yes, of course, John,\" he said, shifting in his seat.\n\nAs we talked - or rather, as they talked and I listened - I couldn't help but notice the little things. The way Lisa's hand rested on his arm, the way he leaned in to hear her whispers. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion, each small interaction another nail in my coffin of despair.\n\nWhen Lisa excused herself, citing some telephone call or other, it was as if the very oxygen had been sucked out of the room. Mr. Thompson and I were left alone, the silence between us heavy with unspoken words.\n\n\"You alright, John?\" he asked finally, his voice laced with concern that rang hollow in my ears.\n\nI shook my head, my anger boiling over like lava from a volcano long dormant. \"No,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper, \"no, I'm not fine. Not by a long shot.\"\n\nAnd with that, I rose from my seat and walked out of the office, leaving him looking after me with an expression I couldn't quite decipher. As I made my way home through the neon-lit streets, one thought echoed through my mind like a mantra: \"This can't be happening again. Not again.\""
