Six years since she left, six years since the fire consumed their studio, our home, our lives.\n\n\"Six fucking years,\" he growled, spitting the words onto the wet paint. The colors blended, merged, and swirled together in a mess of despair, a reflection of the chaos inside him.\n\nHis brush danced across the canvas, strokes wild and reckless as he tried to exorcise the demons haunting him. Memories of her laughter, her touch, her eyes \u2013 they all seeped into the painting, infecting it with a sickening sweetness that made his gut twist into knots.\n\nHe stepped back, surveying the monstrosity he'd created. It was a mess, just like his mind. Colors clashed, shapes twisted, and the overall effect was a jumbled mess that screamed 'I'M A MESS'.\n\nA sob ripped from his chest, and he let it rip, unashamed. He let the sound echo through the empty studio, letting it merge with the silence, creating an unholy union of pain and regret.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the bills piling up, about the art world that had moved on without him, about the loneliness that had become his constant companion.

His eyes flitted from one painting to another, lingering on the brushstrokes that once held meaning but now seemed like mere lines drawn by a stranger's hand.\n\n\"Six years,\" he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper, yet it echoed in the silent room as if amplified by the emptiness surrounding him. His gaze fell upon a particular painting, its colors still vibrant despite the passage of time. It was her favorite, she'd said so once, laughing with that infectious joy that could light up even the gloomiest of rooms.\n\nHe stepped closer to it, his eyes narrowing as he focused on a single smudge of paint at the bottom left corner. How had he missed that before? It was an imperfection, a blemish marring what would have been an otherwise perfect piece. His heart pounded in his chest, anger simmering within him like molten lava ready to erupt.\n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" he muttered, his voice tight with tension. He grabbed a cloth and began to scrub at the smudge, his movements jerky and forceful. The paint resisted, clinging stubbornly to the canvas as if mocking him. \"How could I have let this happen?\" he whispered, his breaths coming in short gasps now.\n\nHe didn't notice the other paintings, their colors blending beautifully together, creating a harmonious symphony of art that spoke volumes about his journey through life and loss. He was too focused on that one tiny imperfection, too blinded by it to see the bigger picture. The studio could have been burning down around him, but all he would have seen was that damned smudge.\n\nAs he finally managed to remove the offending mark, he stepped back, chest heaving, eyes burning with unshed tears. He surveyed his work, a small satisfied smile playing on his lips. But then, his gaze flickered to another painting, and there it was - another imperfection. And so, the cycle continued, each detail magnified under his scrutinizing glare until the world outside ceased to exist."

She's got this new haircut, and her eyes seem to hold this secret smile.\n\nAnyway, I try to play it cool, but inside I'm freaking out.

Because, yeah, that would be awesome. Me, Rachel, and some other guy getting married in the same place where we used to live... it's just too much to handle.\n\nI end up telling them no, that we don't really live there anymore, and quickly change the subject. As soon as they leave, I just lose it. I start yelling at Rachel, telling her that she has no right to bring me down like that. But she just stands there, smiling, saying sorry and whatever.\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is? The couple comes back, and they're still talking about getting married there.

It was that cow from number 42, always snooping around, 'helping' when no help was asked for.\n\n\"Fuck you too,\" she spat, crumpling the letter and tossing it into the bin.
