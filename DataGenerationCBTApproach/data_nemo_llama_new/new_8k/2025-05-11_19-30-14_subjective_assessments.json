His wife had been gone three weeks now, and the silence in their home felt oppressive. He tried to focus on the task at hand, but his mind kept drifting back to the memories they'd made together in this very spot.\n\nAs he worked, he noticed a small, forgotten coffee mug from her favorite shop on the counter. It was still wrapped in its original packaging, untouched since she'd left. A pang of sadness hit him, and he felt a lump form in his throat. He tried to clear it, but the dust particles stuck in his vocal cords, making his voice hoarse when he finally spoke aloud, \"I think I'll go grab my lunch.\"\n\nThe door closed behind him as he walked out into the bright sunlight, and the world seemed a little emptier than usual. The sound of children laughing and birds chirping filled the air, but it didn't bring a smile to his face. He ordered his usual sandwich and stood in line, lost in thought, replaying conversations he'd had with his wife about their future plans. As he waited for his food, he checked his phone for what felt like the hundredth time, half-expecting to see a message from her, but there was only silence.<|eot_id|>",

As he scribbled corrections, the phone rang. It was the school administration, informing him that another teacher would be taking over his department next semester due to budget cuts.\n\nThe administrator's cheerful tone grated on his nerves. He felt like he'd been punched in the gut \u2013 all his years of planning, his reputation as a dedicated educator, and it meant nothing. The administrator prattled on about the \"opportunity\" for him to focus on other areas of the school, but he tuned out, his mind racing with thoughts of retirement, and how he'd never get to see those students graduate. \n\nAs the conversation ended, he let out a slow breath, feeling a familiar burning sensation in the pit of his stomach. His eyes drifted back to the paper in front of him, and for a moment, the mistakes seemed to stare back at him, mocking him.<|eot_id|>",

How dare they? Years of service, countless sleepless nights planning lessons, and this was how they repaid him? An insignificant \"opportunity\" to focus on other areas? Ridiculous! As if he hadn't already been doing that, and more.\n\nHis gaze drifted back to the paper in front of him, the red ink scrawls of his corrections seeming almost grotesque now. He had always prided himself on his thoroughness, but now it felt like a waste of time. What was the point? They were taking away his chance to see these students grow, to watch them graduate. All those years, down the drain.\n\nHe grabbed another paper, flipping through it with barely concealed annoyance. More mistakes. Always more mistakes. Why couldn't they just apply themselves? It wasn't as if he didn't make things clear enough in his lessons. Yet, here they were, proving him wrong once again. He could feel the familiar burning sensation in his stomach, a knot of frustration and anger that seemed to grow with each passing day.\n\nHis mind raced, jumping from one thought to another like a restless animal. Retirement. They wanted him out, didn't they? Well, he wouldn't make it easy for them. He'd work harder, show them what dedication really meant. And those students... he wouldn't give up on them. No matter how many mistakes they made, no matter how much they disappointed him, he would push through.\n\nBut why did everything have to be so hard? Why couldn't they see his worth? His mind was a whirlwind of negativity, each thought feeding into the next, growing and multiplying like some grotesque parody of a snowball effect. He barely noticed as the clock hands inched towards midnight, the room growing darker around him, mirroring his mood.\n\n---"

His wife had criticized it again, saying it was amateurish and wouldn't sell. He remembered her words from last night \u2013 \"You're wasting your time, you'll never make a living off this.\" The memory stung, and for the first time, he saw the critique not as constructive feedback but as a personal attack.\n\nAs he began to clean up, his hand brushed against a small notebook where his wife had scribbled some sarcastic remarks about his art. The words blurred together as his anger surged. He recalled how she'd always been dismissive of his passion, now questioning whether he even deserved to pursue it. The irritation simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over into something more destructive.<|eot_id|>",
