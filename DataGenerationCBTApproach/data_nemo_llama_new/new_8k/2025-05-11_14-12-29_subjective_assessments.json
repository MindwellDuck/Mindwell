A patient had been transferred to another facility during the night, leaving behind only the faint scent of antiseptic and the echoes of quiet conversations. She wandered down the aisle, running her hand over the railing, feeling the familiar contours of the furniture, but it was a comforting routine now, devoid of the warmth and laughter that once filled these spaces.\n\nAs she turned a corner, her eyes landed on the old photograph on the nurse's station \u2013 a group shot from her residency days, beaming with colleagues and friends. The memory of their late-night rounds, shared stories, and camaraderie still lingered, a bittersweet reminder of what she'd lost. The silence in the ward seemed to close in around her, and for a moment, she felt the weight of her solitude settle heavy upon her chest.<|eot_id|>",

The ward was never about those empty beds, it was filled with patients, laughter, even on bad days. But now, all she sees are the gaps where they used to be. It's annoying how her mind zeros in on that one transferred patient, like a beacon of everything that's changed. She can't shake off the feeling that something's been taken away, not gained. Even the photograph feels more like a taunt than a reminder of good times. The whole place might as well be deserted, despite the handful of patients still here. It's like she's got blinders on, and all she can see is what she's lost."

It was a short message, just a few lines thanking him for cooking dinner last night. *Big fuckin' deal*, he thought, a bitter taste in his mouth.\n\n*She doesn't know how much time I've lost*, he grumbled inwardly, as if her words were an attempt to sugarcoat the reality of his situation. He couldn't shake off the gnawing feeling that he was failing them somehow, even though she seemed perfectly content with what little he did contribute around the house.\n\n*She doesn't see how hard I work*, he muttered under his breath, scrolling through the countless emails from colleagues and conference organizers. His eyes scanned over the compliments on his presentation skills, his dedication to research, but they might as well have been written in invisible ink for all the credit he gave himself.\n\nHe couldn't help but feel like she was trying to make him feel better about himself, but it just made him more annoyed. *I don't need her fuckin' pity*, he thought, slamming his laptop shut with a little too much force. He leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling as if searching for something he'd lost long ago - like his ability to appreciate the positives in his life.\n\nAs he sat there, stewing in his self-imposed guilt, he couldn't bring himself to reply to her email. It wasn't that he was ungrateful; it just felt like another thing on a never-ending list of things he had to do, another positive experience he couldn't quite allow himself to enjoy."
