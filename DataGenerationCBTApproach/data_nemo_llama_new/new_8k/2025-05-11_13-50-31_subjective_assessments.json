The silence from his ex-wife was deafening, a stark contrast to the constant barrage of emails and phone calls he'd grown accustomed to during their marriage. The words 'neglect' and 'abandonment' echoed through his mind as he thought about the empty apartment they once shared.\n\nThe newsroom was bustling around him, but the sound of clacking keyboards and murmured conversations seemed muffled, distant. He couldn't recall the last time he felt truly seen or heard by anyone, including himself. His eyes wandered to the framed photo of his late parents on his shelf \u2013 the same ones who had always encouraged him to chase his dreams.\n\nA faint memory of a phone call he'd received weeks ago, where his editor had informed him that the paper would be downsizing staff due to budget cuts, flickered across his consciousness. He'd tried to brush it off, telling himself he still had connections, but now the doubts crept in like a slow-moving fog. The hopelessness seeped into his bones, weighing him down, making every breath feel like a struggle.<|eot_id|>",

The room hummed with life, yet he felt a profound detachment, like an invisible wall separated him from the world outside.\n\nHe picked up the framed photo of his parents, their smiles warm and inviting despite the faded colors. They'd always believed in him, encouraged him to pursue journalism even when it seemed like a pipe dream. But now, staring at their faces, he couldn't help but feel they'd been mistaken. Their support felt like a distant echo, easily dismissed by the cacophony of self-doubt that echoed through his mind.\n\nWalter glanced back at the photo on his desk - him accepting an award for Investigative Reporting. The room had erupted in applause that night, but today it just looked like a cheap trophy gathering dust. He turned it face down with a huff. \"Past glories don't pay the bills,\" he muttered under his breath.\n\nHis gaze fell upon the email from Human Resources, subject line 'Important Notice Regarding Upcoming Changes'. He'd read it weeks ago, but today it seemed to burn into him like an accusation. They were downsizing staff; Walter knew he was safe, they wouldn't dare let him go with his track record... yet, there it was, that niggling doubt creeping back in.\n\nHe looked around at the bustling newsroom, colleagues laughing and chatting over coffee. He used to be a part of that, but now it felt like watching strangers through a window. They didn't know he'd once been nominated for a Pulitzer. They hadn't seen him pull all-nighters chasing leads or heard him dictate award-winning stories into his Dictaphone.\n\nWalter leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples as the noise around him seemed to grow louder, more insistent. He could feel it, that familiar tug of despair threatening to consume him again. But he wouldn't give in. Not today. Today was just... ordinary. Just another day at the office."
