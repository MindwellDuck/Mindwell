The vibrant flowers and lush greenery brought back memories of her bright smile and infectious laughter. Now, all he saw was the neatly manicured lawn, the empty benches, and the subtle scent of freshly cut grass \u2013 a stark reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nAs he continued down the street, he noticed a group of teenagers hanging out by the park. One of them caught his eye \u2013 a young boy no more than ten years old, rummaging through a nearby trash can. Something about the way the boy's eyes lit up as he held up a discarded water bottle sparked a familiar frustration. He felt a surge of contempt for these carefree kids, unaware of the sacrifices their parents made to give them even the smallest privileges.\n\nThe officer's gaze lingered on the boy, his mind replaying the countless hours he'd spent ensuring public safety, only to see it all being undone by a few reckless individuals. The weight of his responsibilities, combined with the emptiness he felt at home, simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over into anger.<|eot_id|>",

They didn't know how lucky they were to have a place like this to waste their time. Didn't they care about anything? Couldn't they see how their recklessness made everything harder for everyone else?\n\nIt was all his fault, really. If he hadn't been so busy protecting them, if he'd been home more often, maybe she wouldn't have... No, no use thinking about that now. He had a duty to uphold, and those punks weren't going to make it any harder for him.\n\nHe felt the familiar heat rising in his chest, like a volcano ready to erupt. It was always the same - he'd see something that reminded him of what he'd lost, and then he'd start noticing all the things that were wrong with the world around him. But this time, he wouldn't hold back. This time, they'd know how much their carelessness hurt."
