The smell of freshly baked pastries wafted through the air, transporting him back to mornings spent with his wife before she passed away two years ago. As he reached for a donut, he noticed a young nurse, probably early twenties, expertly juggling multiple patients while chatting with her colleagues.\n\nThe way she effortlessly moved from one station to another, a look of quiet confidence on her face, brought back memories of his wife's own nursing career. He remembered how proud he was of her dedication to their patients, how she'd always put others before herself. A pang of sadness struck, and he found himself wondering what his life would be like if his wife were still here, sharing these small moments with him.\n\nAs he took a sip of his coffee, the young nurse caught his eye, smiled warmly, and asked if everything was okay. For a moment, they locked gazes, and he felt a lump form in his throat. The simple act of kindness had unlocked a floodgate of emotions, and he quickly looked away, trying to compose himself before returning to his coffee.<|eot_id|>",
