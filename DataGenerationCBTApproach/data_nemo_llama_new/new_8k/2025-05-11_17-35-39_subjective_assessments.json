She felt a surge of contempt for the person who didn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation or the effort she had put into the project. Her husband continued to chat about his day, unaware of the storm brewing inside her.<|eot_id|>",

Another reminder?\" I mutter under my breath, staring at the email. \"Like I don't know we're up against a wall here.\" My stomach churns as I picture everyone else's inboxes, probably empty of such intrusive notifications.\n\nI can hear Harry rustling around in the living room, totally clueless about the chaos brewing inside me. How does he do that? Just...float along, while I'm drowning in work?\n\nThe assistant's tone grates on me like nails on a chalkboard. \"Let's work together,\" she chirps. Together? She has no idea what that means. I've been 'working together' since forever! While everyone else seems to have their lives in order, here I am, scrambling to save face.\n\nI glance at Harry again, now humming some tune as he fills his coffee cup. He doesn't know, can't understand. How could he? His job's a walk in the park compared to this circus. I'm left here, juggling flaming torches while everyone else plays with feathers.\n\nThe clock ticks louder, each second echoing my racing thoughts. It's not fair. None of it is fair. But then again, when has life ever been about fairness?"

As the silence stretched between them, she felt the familiar weight of helplessness settle into her chest. She couldn't fix this, no matter how hard she tried. Not today, at least.<|eot_id|>",
