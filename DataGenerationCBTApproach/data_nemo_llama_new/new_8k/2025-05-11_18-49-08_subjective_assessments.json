Her granddaughter had called earlier, saying she was coming over after school but now wasn't feeling well enough to visit.

She couldn't remember the last time she'd made a dessert just for herself, let alone one that might go uneaten. A sigh escaped her lips as she turned off the heat, the silence in the kitchen suddenly deafening.<|eot_id|>",

But her focus remained fixed on the empty space where they usually put up balloons and streamers.\n\nThe door swung open, and a group of rowdy teenagers walked in, laughing and joking with each other.

The chef de cuisine, her partner in every sense, was nowhere to be found, and she couldn't shake off the feeling of responsibility for the impending celebration.\n\nA customer approached, asking for a recommendation.

Her eyes scanned the kitchen, searching for a familiar face, but it was just another chaotic scene, with pots clanging and orders being shouted. \n\nFor a moment, she felt like she was drowning in a sea of chaos, unable to catch her breath, let alone plate the perfect dish.<|eot_id|>",

No, begged might be a more accurate term. She could still hear the pleading tone in her voice as she'd reminded him about their daughter's birthday party. Yet, here they were, mere days away from the celebration, and not so much as a single balloon had made an appearance.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the merriment unfolding at table twelve, where a group of young patrons were laughing over their shared platter. She couldn't help but notice how they seemed to be having such a wonderful time, while her own daughter's party hung in the balance like a pendulum swaying towards disaster.\n\nShe caught sight of herself in the polished silverware, her reflection showing lines etched deeper than usual. It was as if she could see the weight of her worry manifesting physically. She sighed heavily, the sound barely audible over the clatter of pans and the hiss of flames dancing on stove tops.\n\nHer partner, the chef de cuisine, was nowhere to be seen. He was likely in his office, poring over invoices or planning next week's specials. But all she could think was that he must be avoiding her, dodging the inevitable confrontation about his forgotten promise. She felt a pang of resentment, sharp and bitter as unseasoned beef.\n\nAs she turned to leave the kitchen, she nearly collided with him. He was wearing that familiar, carefree smile, the one that usually made her heart flutter. Today, however, it only served to irritate her further. How could he be so cheerful when their daughter's happiness hung in the balance?\n\nWithout a word, she pushed past him, determined to maintain her composure until she reached the sanctuary of her office. But as she closed the door behind her, she let out a shaky breath and leaned against it, feeling the cold weight of disappointment settling like stone upon her shoulders.\n\nShe knew he was forgetful sometimes, but this...this was different. This was important. And yet, there was no evidence, no sign that he even remembered his promise. She felt a familiar tightness in her chest, a sensation she had come to recognize as worry morphing into anger. It was all too easy to imagine the worst-case scenario playing out: their daughter's disappointment, the ruined party, the inevitable blame game.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself for the conversation they would have to have. She just hoped it wouldn't end in another argument, another round of mutual resentment. But then again, she reasoned bitterly, what was new? Their life seemed to be one long string of unmet expectations and shattered promises."
