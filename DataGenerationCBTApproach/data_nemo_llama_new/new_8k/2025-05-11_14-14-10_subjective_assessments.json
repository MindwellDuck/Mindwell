It had been six months since the accident, yet the familiar scent of disinfectant and the faint tang of formaldehyde still brought back memories.\n\nAs he wiped down a microscope slide, his eyes wandered to a framed photograph on his desk \u2013 a picture of him and his colleague, Dr. Patel, taken during their last research expedition together. They were laughing, arms around each other's shoulders, standing at the edge of a vast desert landscape. A sudden gust of wind blew through the lab, rustling papers and sending the photograph askew.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the lab coat clinging to his sweat-drenched shirt, the weight of his grief pressing down on him like a physical force. He felt the ache in his chest again, as if the pain had shifted from a dull throb to a sharp stab.
