As she listened to him rattle off exotic destinations and relaxation techniques, a familiar sense of resentment simmered beneath the surface.\n\nJust yesterday, she had spent hours working late to meet a looming deadline, only to have her team's project manager reject one of her carefully crafted solutions, citing it was \"not feasible\" due to \"budget constraints.\" The same budget constraints that allowed Alex to attend industry conferences and flaunt his expensive gadgets.\n\nThe comment about his vacation made her think of all the nights she'd spent alone, stuck in traffic or waiting for her flight, feeling like she couldn't catch up on work no matter how hard she tried. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she considered Alex's carefree attitude toward time and responsibility.<|eot_id|>",

Today, the marigolds were in full bloom, their vibrant colors seemingly shouting for attention. He paused for a moment, feeling a flicker of something akin to pleasure. But then he noticed the weeds growing between the stones, a task they used to do together. The joy was quickly dismissed, replaced by guilt.\n\nOne evening, he found himself humming along to an old song playing on the radio while doing dishes. It was one of their favorites, reminding him of countless nights spent dancing in the kitchen. For a brief second, he felt a smile tug at his lips. But then he realized he was alone, and the music seemed to mock him rather than comfort him.
