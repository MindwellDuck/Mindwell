I've told her often enough how her dedication reflects well on me, but those words seem to slip away like the coffee grounds down the drain.\n\nIn the kitchen, I prepare breakfast for two. Her favorite granola, carefully portioned into bowls, topped with a sprinkle of chia seeds because \"they're good for you,\" she'd said once. Yet, when I place hers on the table, there's always that momentary pause before she takes her first bite - as if expecting to find something amiss.\n\nAs I sit down to eat, I notice the sunlight streaming through the window, casting a golden glow over our breakfast nook. It's been a while since we've sat here together, sharing more than just meals. But these moments of solitude are necessary, aren't they?
