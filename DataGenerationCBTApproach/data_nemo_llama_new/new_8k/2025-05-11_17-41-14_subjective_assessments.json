The familiar ache of disappointment had given way to a low simmering anger, fueled by the memory of countless rejections and unfulfilled dreams. Her gaze drifted to the small studio apartment she shared with two roommates, where half-finished canvases and discarded sketches seemed to mock her failures.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. She hesitated, then picked up, her voice guarded. It was her sister, asking how the application process was going. The conversation was stilted, the usual reassurances and platitudes falling flat. As they parted ways, the artist felt a surge of resentment toward her own perceived shortcomings \u2013 the lack of connections, the mediocre work, the perpetual struggle to make ends meet. The quiet rage simmered beneath her calm exterior, waiting to boil over at any moment.<|eot_id|>",

You know they're missing out.\" I could picture him, running a hand through his disheveled hair, that look of sympathetic frustration on his face.\n\n\"I guess,\" I replied, my gaze drifting to the framed posters of successful bands adorning my walls. Each one seemed to taunt me with their achievements, their concerts sold-out, albums platinum. \"Sometimes I wonder if I'm just not good enough.\"\n\nAlex protested, \"Hey, don't do that. You're amazing at what you do.\" But his words felt hollow against the weight of comparison. It was always easier to see someone else's success than my own potential.\n\n\"I just need some time alone,\" I said, turning away from the posters. \"I'll catch up with you later?\" After hanging up, I stared at my reflection in the dark window, seeing only a pale imitation of the musicians I admired. The familiar pang of inadequacy threatened to consume me, but I pushed it down, focusing instead on the silent symphony waiting within reach of my fingers."

She hesitated before answering, unsure if she had the energy to deal with another call from her well-meaning but intrusive neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins. The conversation was going nowhere \u2013 Mrs. Jenkins wanted advice on fixing her own computer, which A had already told her multiple times would be best left to a professional.\n\nThe phone call ended, and A felt the familiar weight of frustration settle in.
