She crumpled it between her fingers, the creases forming a map of her clenched fists.\n\nThe phone rang, breaking the silence. It was a telemarketer, offering discounts on hiking poles.

The easels stood tall, like soldiers at attention, awaiting their orders. But they weren't hers to command now, were they? Not when he wasn't here to guide them both.\n\nThe canvas lay there, pristine and untouched, a blank slate staring back at her with accusation. It should be filled by now, shouldn't it? This was supposed to be her sanctuary, her escape from the world outside. But now, it felt like a prison cell, its walls closing in around her.\n\nShe reached for the paintbrush, her fingers tracing the cool metal handle as if it were a relic from another life. It should feel comfortable, shouldn't it? Like an old friend's embrace. But instead, it felt heavy and foreign in her grasp.\n\nThe smell of turpentine hung heavy in the air, but it wasn't the comforting scent she remembered. It was harsh and biting now, like a chastisement for her hesitation. She should be able to lose herself in its familiar musk, shouldn't she? But today, it felt more like an unwanted reminder.\n\nHer eyes drifted to the empty walls, their once vibrant hues now faded like old photographs. They used to echo with laughter and late-night conversations. Now, they stared back at her silently, judging her silence. She should be filling them up again with new life, shouldn't she? But all she could see were the ghosts of memories past.\n\nShe gripped the paintbrush tighter, willing herself to begin. But her hand refused to cooperate, hanging limp and heavy like a dead weight. The canvas seemed to mock her from its place on the easel. It should be covered in bold strokes of color by now, shouldn't it? Not left untouched like this...like an unfinished apology.\n\nThe silence pressed down on her, oppressive and suffocating. She could almost hear his voice echoing in the emptiness, offering critiques that used to make her laugh. But today, all she could hear was the hollow emptiness of his absence.\n\nShe looked at the brush in her hand, then at the canvas before her. Then, with a soft sigh, she let it slip from her fingers, falling to the floor with a quiet thud. It should have felt like a relief, shouldn't it? But instead, it felt like another failure. Another 'should' left unfulfilled."
