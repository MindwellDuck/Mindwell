The morning's schedule was already running behind, and he knew he had to make some tough decisions about who to prioritize first.\n\nAs he scanned the charts, one name kept popping up: Emma Wilson. A young mother of two, diagnosed with stage three cancer last week. He had been her primary doctor since her initial consultation, and their conversations had left him feeling... off. Not just because of the grim prognosis, but because she had this aura about her \u2013 confidence, strength \u2013 that made him question his own abilities.\n\nHe rubbed the weariness from his eyes and focused on the task at hand. But as he began to review Emma's chart, he couldn't shake the nagging sense that he'd somehow missed something crucial during her previous appointments. What if there was another way to treat her? What if he could've done more?\n\nA faint knock at the door broke the silence. His nurse, Mrs. Patel, poked her head in. \"Dr. Lee, I have your rounds ready. Shall I start prepping the OR?\"\n\nThe familiar routine of the day threatened to engulf him, but the doubts lingered, gnawing at his gut like a persistent ache.<|eot_id|>",

My gut churned with each page flip - was that a new symptom? A dip in her vitals? Hell, even her handwriting seemed to have gotten worse since yesterday.\n\nI could practically feel the cancer cells multiplying like some morbid time-lapse video in my mind's eye. Stage three, my ass. It's probably stage five by now. I'm sure of it.\n\nMrs. Patel knocked softly at the door, pulling me from my mental downward spiral. \"Dr. Lee?\" she called out gently, her voice laced with concern. She knew something was up; she always did.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" I sighed, closing Emma's chart and stacking it neatly on top of the others. \"Let's get this show on the road.\" But as we headed towards the OR, all I could see were those damn cancer cells, multiplying relentlessly, and me standing there helplessly, watching my patient slip through my fingers like sand in an hourglass.\n\nI can't lose another one, not like this.
