Her eyes welled up as she recalled her own mother's frailty during a particularly grueling illness, the look of desperation etched on her face as she begged for a second chance.\n\nThe sound of the coffee machine interrupted her reverie, and as she turned to grab another cup, her gaze fell upon a framed photo on the nurse's station \u2013 a picture of herself and her husband, taken on their wedding day, beaming with joy.
