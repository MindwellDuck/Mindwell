This exhibition was my chance, our chance, to finally get noticed. To prove that all these sleepless nights, all this paint-stained solitude, wasn't for nothing.\n\nI looked down at my brush, frozen mid-air like a damning accusation.

So many details vying for my attention, pushing me further from the finish line with every passing moment.\n\nI silenced my phone, letting the call go to voicemail. For now, I needed to focus. On the canvas, on the colors, on the quiet hum of creation that used to be my sanctuary.

Everything else *would* wait. Even if it meant drowning in a sea of unfinished canvases and scattered paint tubes until then."
