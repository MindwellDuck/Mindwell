He shrugged, not really feeling like talking about it.\n\nAs he began to make himself a drink, he noticed the TV was still on from last night, showing the highlight reel of his friend's bachelor party from three years ago. The same friends were laughing and cheering, having an incredible time \u2013 a stark contrast to the mundane routine of his own life right now.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the photos for a moment before moving on to the messy kitchen, where he started making himself a sandwich. He couldn't help but think that his own life wasn't as exciting as this one, that he was stuck in a rut while his friends seemed to be living it up.

He could feel the familiar anxiety creeping in, that gnawing feeling that everyone else was having more fun than him, living lives more worth living.\n\nHe took a bite of his sandwich, chewing mechanically as he stared at the TV, his eyes reflecting not the joy of the party, but the bitter taste of comparison. \"Fuck,\" he muttered again, this time with resignation. \"I need to get my shit together.\" But even as he said it, he knew he'd be back tomorrow, watching someone else's life play out on the screen, feeling that same old familiar envy gnawing at him."
