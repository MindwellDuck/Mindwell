A patient had been admitted overnight with severe abdominal pain, and despite the team's best efforts, his condition was deteriorating rapidly. The doctor was running late, and the hospital's ER was filling up.\n\nAs she scanned the list of patients awaiting transfer, one name caught her eye \u2013 Mrs. Jenkins, a 75-year-old woman who had been a patient under her care for weeks. The woman's family had been pushing for a more aggressive treatment plan, which the nurse had vehemently opposed due to concerns about her mother's fragile health. Now, as she gazed at Mrs. Jenkins' chart, she saw that her condition had taken a turn for the worse.\n\nA sense of dread crept over her as she realized the family might try to override her judgment once again. She felt a familiar knot of anxiety forming in her stomach, threatening to spill over into her hands as she tried to focus on the task at hand.<|eot_id|>",

Her condition had worsened overnight \u2013 as if it wasn't bad enough already. I could feel the anxiety clawing at me, my heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped animal. It was that familiar feeling, the one that told me her family would push for more intervention, damn the consequences.\n\nI set down my coffee, its warmth no longer comforting but now seeming bitter and cold. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for Mrs. Jenkins' chart, and I had to take a deep breath before I could open it. It was like I could see the argument brewing already, her family's faces red with anger, their voices raised in challenge.\n\nI knew they thought I wasn't doing enough. But how could they not understand? This wasn't some young, healthy person we were dealing with here. Mrs. Jenkins was fragile, like an antique vase that could shatter at the slightest touch. And yet, they wanted me to treat her like she was made of steel.\n\nI felt a surge of anger then, hot and fierce, burning away the anxiety for a moment. How dare they? They weren't the ones with years of experience, with a career spent caring for people like Mrs. Jenkins. No, they just saw their mother suffering and wanted someone to blame.\n\nBut I couldn't let them see how much this was getting to me. Not today, not when there were so many other patients needing my attention. So I took another deep breath, squared my shoulders, and prepared to face whatever storm Mrs. Jenkins' family chose to bring today. Because no matter what they said or thought, I knew \u2013 *felt* \u2013 that I was right. And that had to count for something."

He had spent hours perfecting it, adding a subtle kick of spice that he knew would set it apart from the rest.\n\nAs he turned to taste, he caught a glimpse of her - Emma, the new pastry chef they'd hired last week. She was chatting with one of the line cooks, laughing easily as she demonstrated a technique.

It was a fleeting connection, but it was enough to make him feel like he'd been left out of something important.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the dinner service, about the prep work still to be done, and all he could think about was what could have been if he'd been the one to catch her eye.

Nope, not when there's a new fucking star in town. I can feel the heat of the kitchen, the sweat dripping down my back, but it's nothing compared to the fire inside me. I'm missing something here, something big, but all I can focus on is that damn smile.\n\nI plate up the special, the dish I've been fucking around with for hours, and what do I see?
