His mind wandered back to the dinner party he had planned for last weekend, which his ex-girlfriend had cancelled at the last minute. The same one where he had spent hours perfecting his signature beef Wellington.\n\nAs he reached for a pinch of thyme, his hand brushed against a worn-out recipe card tucked away between two others. It was the exact same recipe he had used for her favorite dish \u2013 the one she had raved about during their entire relationship. A pang of regret washed over him as he wondered what could've been if only she'd given it another chance.<|eot_id|>",

Look at its gleaming glaze! Not a single crack or chip.\" She set it down gently beside the husband's mug, making sure they were touching.\n\n\"But this?\" She snatched up his mug, turning it around in her hands as if searching for something. \"This is... well, it's just ordinary, isn't it? Nothing special about it at all.\" She put it back with a definitive thud, not meeting the customer's curious gaze. \"Just another mug,\" she muttered, walking away to busy herself with restocking the cookies, leaving an awkward silence hanging in the air like a cloud of dust."
