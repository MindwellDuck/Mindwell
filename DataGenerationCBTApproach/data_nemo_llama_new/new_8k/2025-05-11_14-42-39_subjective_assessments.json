The phone had stopped ringing months ago, but the mail kept coming \u2013 collections notices, overdue fines, and letters from debt collectors. He rubbed the tiredness from his eyes, feeling like he was drowning in responsibilities.\n\nAs he scanned the latest bill, his mind began to numb, weighing the impossibility of paying it off. His shift at the hospital had been unpredictable lately, and even when he did get paid, most of it went towards rent and utilities. The isolation of his small apartment felt suffocating, like a physical weight pressing down on him.\n\nThe sink clogged with dirty dishes, a reminder of another day spent working double shifts and barely having time for himself. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he thought about how this was where he'd ended up \u2013 alone, exhausted, and struggling to make ends meet.<|eot_id|>",

A particular study caught his eye - one he had abandoned mid-presentation at a conference three years ago, citing lack of time to finalize. The lead author had since published a groundbreaking paper, building upon their initial findings.\n\nAs he read through the abstract, memories of the conference began to surface: the excitement of presenting his work, the sense of camaraderie among peers, and the feeling of being on the cusp of something significant. But most vivid was the moment he realized others were more invested in his idea than he was \u2013 the weight of their expectations, the pressure to deliver.\n\nHis eyes drifted away from the screen, lost in thought, as the room fell silent around him. The only sound was the soft hum of the air conditioning and the faint rustle of papers shifting on his desk. Time seemed to stand still, and all he could think about was what could have been if he'd seen it through.<|eot_id|>",

It should have been his name on that paper. His findings, his breakthrough. Not theirs. They didn't understand it like he did. They couldn't have possibly done it justice.\n\nHe felt a surge of anger, then guilt. He shouldn't feel this way. He should be happy for them, right? That's what everyone always said.
