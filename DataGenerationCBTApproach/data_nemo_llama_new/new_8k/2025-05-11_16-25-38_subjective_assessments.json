It had been five years since John passed away, but some days still felt like an eternity without him. As she began to sort through the stack of paperwork on her desk, her eyes landed on the empty chair beside hers.\n\nA new officer, a young man with a keen expression, caught her eye as he approached. He introduced himself and they exchanged pleasantries about the upcoming training exercises. But as they chatted, she couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched \u2013 by everyone around her, including this newcomer.\n\nHe mentioned his own wife was expecting their first child, and she forced a smile, trying to be supportive. But the mention of a family made her think of what she'd never have again. The way John used to hold her hand when they came home from a long shift, the laughter they shared during breakfasts together... all of it came flooding back, leaving her breathless and her heart heavy.<|eot_id|>",

It was a picture of her, taken on her wedding day, smiling beside a man who now stood as a stranger in her life. She felt the familiar ache in her chest, but it was nothing compared to the crushing weight that settled in her stomach as she thought about the anniversary of his passing \u2013 tomorrow.\n\nRachel's voice faded into the background as the officer's mind began to wander, her thoughts consumed by the same sense of emptiness that had become all too familiar since the loss of her husband.<|eot_id|>",

I couldn't care less about some reheated leftovers when there's this... this void gnawing at me.\n\nI mean, really, who cares if the office is quiet today? Who cares if it's just another day of shuffling papers and pretending to make a difference? It's not like tomorrow matters. Not with that anniversary looming over me like a dark cloud. I can practically hear the clock ticking away, each second echoing louder than Rachel's voice.\n\nAnd why should I bother with her concern? She doesn't understand. None of them do.
