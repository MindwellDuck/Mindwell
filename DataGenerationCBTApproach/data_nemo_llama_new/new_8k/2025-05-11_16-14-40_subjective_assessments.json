He hadn't sent any flowers or called her family. \n\nAs he watched the conversation unfold, his mind began to wander to the same conversation he'd had with his wife six months ago \u2013 the one where they'd discussed taking a weekend trip together. She'd been so excited, but after she passed away, he'd struggled to make even small plans. Now, the idea felt like a hollow reminder of what he'd lost.\n\nThe coworker glanced over, noticing his expression, and quickly changed the subject. The office noise faded into the background as he became lost in thought, replaying conversations he wished he could have, and memories he couldn't shake.<|eot_id|>",

Her mind was a whirlwind of 'shoulds' and 'should haves', each one stinging like a tiny needle prick. She shouldn't have snapped at him yesterday. He shouldn't have been so insensitive.

He'd always encouraged her to follow her dreams, to chase the colors and textures that danced within her.\n\nA pang of regret settled in her chest as she recalled the countless times she'd hesitated, afraid to take risks or pursue opportunities that might have led to more time together. She thought of all the late nights spent working on art instead of being there for him, of the moments lost to her own ambitions.\n\nThe brushstrokes that had once flowed so freely now felt clumsy, hesitant. A single mistake marred the otherwise flawless canvas, a tiny smudge that seemed to mock her. In that moment, she wondered what would have happened if she'd taken a different path, if she'd balanced her passion for art with a deeper connection to the man who'd loved her unconditionally.<|eot_id|>",

But what did it matter now? It wasn't perfect, not like the ones she'd painted when he was alive. Back then, every brushstroke had been infused with his love and encouragement.\n\nHer stomach churned as she thought about all those nights she'd stayed up late, long after he'd gone to bed. She could've been spending that time with him, but no, she'd chosen to paint instead. How selfish of her.\n\nShe remembered the countless opportunities she'd turned down, the trips they could've taken together if only she hadn't been so consumed by her art. She was sure he would've understood, but now... now it felt like those moments were gone forever because of her stubbornness.\n\nThe painting seemed to stare back at her, accusing. \"You're not good enough,\" it whispered. \"Not without him.\" She sighed, setting down her brush with a trembling hand. Maybe she'd been wrong to think she could still create something beautiful after all this time. Maybe she should just give up and accept that she wasn't the artist he believed her to be."

What if seeing them made me crumble?\n\nI stood there, frozen, my heart pounding in my chest. \"What if I find something that makes me remember her even more?\" I thought. \"What if the memories are too raw, too fresh?

But then, another question popped into my head, one she used to ask me when we'd face our fears together: \"What if you don't try at all?\" And just like that, I opened the door, ready to face whatever came next."
