As he waited in line, his eyes landed on her \u2013 his wife, standing by the salad bar, chatting with their nurse colleagues. They exchanged a brief, awkward smile, but she quickly turned back to the conversation, oblivious to his presence.\n\nThe line inched forward, and he ordered his usual breakfast sandwich. As he waited for his food, he couldn't help but think about how he'd been feeling all week \u2013 stuck in this dead-end job, feeling underappreciated by his superiors, and struggling to make ends meet. The tension between them had been building, and now it seemed like they were just going through the motions of their marriage.\n\nWhen it was finally his turn to pick up his food, he grabbed a cup of coffee and made his way over to the table where she sat. She looked up at him, expectant, and he felt a surge of resentment wash over him. \"Hey,\" he said curtly, dropping his bag onto the floor beside her. \"Just got my stuff.\"\n\nShe smiled again, but this time it didn't reach her eyes. \"Okay, hon. How was your morning?\"\n\nFor a moment, they just sat there, the silence between them thick and heavy. He could feel the bitterness rising up inside him, threatening to spill out. But then, she reached out and took his hand, her touch a fleeting reminder of the life they'd built together.<|eot_id|>",

But now, it felt like they were strangers trying to navigate a conversation in a language they didn't understand.\n\nHe stirred his coffee vigorously, the spoon clinking against the sides with an irritating rhythm that seemed to match the pounding in his head. \"It was fine,\" he replied, his tone sharper than intended. He hadn't meant to snap at her, but it just came out that way. She flinched slightly, and he felt a pang of guilt, but it was quickly overshadowed by the familiar resentment.\n\nHe shouldn't have to feel like this, he thought. They should be able to talk about their days without it feeling like walking on eggshells. He shouldn't have to tiptoe around her feelings while she seemed completely oblivious to his. It's not how it was supposed to be, and the fact that it is, well, that just pissed him off more.\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. She looked at him with those big, worried eyes, and for a moment, he thought maybe she understood. But then she opened her mouth, and the words that came out weren't what he'd been hoping for. They were just... wrong."
