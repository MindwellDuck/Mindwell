Her mind wandered to the emails she'd received from galleries, politely declining her work \u2013 again. The rejections stung less now, but the thought of having to start over, to find new inspiration and talent, felt suffocating.\n\nAs she stood there, frozen, her phone buzzed with a text from her sister, asking if she needed help moving boxes into her studio. She hadn't asked for assistance, couldn't bear the thought of being a burden. But what choice did she have? The bills were piling up, and her savings were dwindling. With a heavy sigh, she set down her brush and began to pack away her paints, feeling the weight of her own insignificance.<|eot_id|>",

It was a faint brown mark, barely noticeable, but it seemed out of place among the pristine whites and creams of their kitchen linens. He felt a twinge of revulsion, not towards the stain itself, but towards the careless abandon with which it had been made.<|eot_id|>",

As they discussed the details, the woman couldn't help but think about how much of her own time and resources went into supporting these events, while the volunteer seemed content to simply collect a paycheck.\n\n\"I don't understand why we need to have so many fundraisers,\" the woman said, trying to keep her tone neutral. The volunteer coordinator looked taken aback, her expression turning slightly defensive. \"Well, someone has to pay for the supplies and whatnot.\"\n\nThe woman raised an eyebrow, feeling a twinge of annoyance.

Every event, every fundraiser, it was all just another mountain of work for me to climb alone. I mean, sure, Mrs. Thompson was organizing this one, but she didn't know what it took. She wouldn't be up until midnight on Friday baking cookies and cupcakes like some kind of martyr.\n\nAnd for what? A few hundred dollars in the school's coffers? It wasn't worth it.
