A chart slipped from her hand, papers spilling onto the floor as she rushed to grab it. As she bent down to gather the scattered sheets, her heel caught on the edge of a nearby bed frame.\n\nHer phone rang, shrill in the sudden silence. Apologetic, she picked up, only to hear the unmistakable voice of Dr. Thompson on the other end \u2013 her former husband's name still familiar to her ear. He'd called earlier that week, asking to speak with her about the patient he was transferring care to; they were no longer married, but the connection still lingered.\n\nAs she listened, mortified, her colleagues began to stare, their faces a blur of concern and curiosity. The humiliation washed over her like a cold wave \u2013 the public exposure, the professional awkwardness, the painful reminder that some wounds never fully healed. She let out a tight breath, the sound echoing through the room, and hastily ended the call.<|eot_id|>",

Dr. Thompson, that's who. My ex-husband's namesake, calling me out in front of the entire ward. 'Oh, hey, can we talk about your patient?' Sure thing, doc! Let's just ignore the fact that we're not married anymore and you're making me feel like a teenager caught on the phone after curfew.\n\nAnd did you see their faces? My colleagues, I mean.

The critics were raving about it, the art world was abuzz, and he was basking in the attention. \n\nAs she gazed at the torn newspaper clippings, the paint-splattered canvas, and the deliberate disarray, a familiar frustration simmered beneath the surface. Years of supporting his career, sacrificing their social life, and putting up with his ego had finally paid off \u2013 but at what cost? Her own work was relegated to the garage, her passion stifled by his relentless pursuit of fame.\n\nA faint scent of turpentine wafted from the nearby easel, where she'd left her own abandoned project.

His eyes narrowed, taking in the ring on her finger. A new partner. Another change he hadn't been privy to. The knot in his chest tightened, his breath coming in shallow bursts.\n\nHe turned back to the nurse, his voice barely contained, \"Why wasn't I informed earlier? This is unacceptable.\" He saw her shrink back slightly, her eyes darting away from his stern gaze. But it was her fault, wasn't it? She should have handled this better. They all should have. His daughter, for not telling him sooner. The staff, for not making time for his child's care. Everyone but him.\n\nAs he strode out of the hospital, the automatic doors sliding open with a hiss, he felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle on his shoulders. It was always like this. Always someone else's fault. Always something beyond his control. But wasn't that just life? He was just trying to do his best in a world that seemed determined to make things difficult. And if that meant shouldering the blame, well, so be it. It was better than letting them see him struggle. Better than admitting he felt overwhelmed, alone, and adrift amidst the sea of change around him."
