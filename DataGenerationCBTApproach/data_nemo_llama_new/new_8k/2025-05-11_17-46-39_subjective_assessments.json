As he reached for his wallet, his phone slipped out of his pocket and clattered to the floor, revealing a photo of him and his late wife on their anniversary. A group of young couples nearby turned to stare, and one of them couldn't help but giggle at the awkward moment. The barista handed him his coffee, her expression sympathetic but awkwardly friendly. He forced a smile, took his drink, and quickly made a hasty exit, feeling like everyone was watching him.<|eot_id|>",

The giggle from that couple echoed in my ears louder than the espresso machine's hiss. I could feel every gaze burning into me, probably thinking, 'Wow, what a sad spectacle.' Even the barista looked at me like she'd witnessed a tragic car accident.\n\n'Nice one, mate,' I thought to myself as I grabbed my coffee and bolted. The door swung shut behind me, sealing off the judgmental glances and whispers. 'Just another day in the life of Mr. Tragedy,' I snorted sarcastically, taking a sip from my cup. At least it was hot; unlike me, always the cold one, making everything about me so... bleak.\""
