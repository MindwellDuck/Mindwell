Though, one might argue that if they hadn't been so eager to take the lead, I could have contributed more to the handover discussion. But no, let's not dwell on such trivialities.\n\nAnd then there was Emily, or whatever her name was, with that insincere smile and that patronizing \"Thanks for your help earlier.\" As if she hadn't just stolen my thunder in front of the entire team. I suppose it's my job to be gracious, but really, where are their manners?\n\nI must admit, though, it's not entirely their fault that I'm feeling this way. After all, I am the one who's been here long enough to know how things should be done.
