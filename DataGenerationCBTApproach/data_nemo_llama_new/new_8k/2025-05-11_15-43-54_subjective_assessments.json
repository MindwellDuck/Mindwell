The radio played softly in the background, a familiar tune from their early days together. He could almost see her dancing lightly around the kitchen, her laughter echoing through the empty house.\n\nA car pulled into the driveway, a neighbor stopping by with a casserole. \"Probably just checking if I've starved to death yet,\" he muttered, his hands tightening on the album. He didn't need their pity, couldn't stand their sympathetic eyes. They'd all been whispering since she passed, exchanging knowing glances as if they understood what it was like to lose your other half.\n\nHe heard the front door open, footsteps approaching. \"I'm fine,\" he called out gruffly, not turning around. \"Just leave it on the counter.\"\n\nThe footsteps hesitated, then retreated. He imagined her frowning at him from the doorway, hands on her hips. \"You're being ridiculous, Harry,\" she'd say. But she wasn't here to say anything anymore.\n\nHe flipped through the pages, pausing at a picture of them at the beach. She was laughing, sand in her hair, his arm around her waist. He could almost hear her voice, see her smile. Then he noticed something in the corner of the photo - a dark smudge on the horizon. A storm cloud? Or just a trick of light?\n\nHis heart pounded suddenly. \"She always loved storms,\" he whispered, his breath fogging up the glass protecting the photograph. His mind raced back to that last thunderstorm they'd weathered together, her grip tightening around his hand as lightning flashed outside their window.\n\n\"She knew it was coming,\" he realized aloud, his voice barely above a whisper. \"That's why she was so quiet those last few days.\" He could see it now, clear as day - the silent knowledge in her eyes, the extra squeeze of her hand when they'd watched that thunderstorm together.\n\nHe closed the album, a heavy weight settling in his chest. He knew what he had to do next. He stood up slowly, steadying himself against the armchair. It was time to pack away her clothes, clear out her side of the closet. Time to face the reality of their empty nest.\n\nAs he walked towards the bedroom, he could've sworn he heard her voice again, soft and sad this time. \"It's not your fault, Harry,\" she seemed to say. But he knew better. He'd seen it in her eyes that day at the beach. She'd known something was wrong, even before they did."
