He'd been struggling to find inspiration lately \u2013 the strokes felt forced, the colors dull. His mind kept wandering to his wife, who'd passed away five years ago. He remembered the way she used to sit beside him, offering quiet critiques and words of encouragement.\n\nJust then, a gentle knock at the door broke the spell. It was his neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, come to collect her garden gnomes from the summer sale he'd promised to hold. He hesitated, unsure if he could muster the energy to show her around the studio. But something about her kind face and warm smile put him at ease.\n\nAs they walked through the empty rooms, the weight of his grief settled heavy in his chest.

It was as if he was chained to this easel, condemned to watch others soar while he remained grounded, trapped.\n\nMrs. Jenkins' knock echoed through the studio like a gauntlet thrown down. He scowled at the interruption, his heart pounding with resentment. How could she waltz in here, all smiles and sunshine, when he was drowning in this godforsaken despair? She didn't understand, nobody did. They couldn't see him struggling, couldn't feel the crushing weight of inadequacy that held him prisoner.\n\nHe led her through the studio, his steps heavy with bitterness. Each empty easel they passed seemed like another gloating specter, whispering tales of success and triumph. His hands clenched into fists at his sides, nails digging into palms. This was unfair! He deserved better than this endless sea of mediocrity. He was a failure compared to those geniuses out there, their names whispered in hushed tones of awe.\n\nAs they reached the sale items, he felt a surge of anger so intense it made him lightheaded. He wanted to scream, to lash out, to demand why life had dealt him this cruel hand. But instead, he stood there, rigid and silent, as Mrs. Jenkins cooed over her garden gnomes. The unfairness of it all threatened to consume him, but he swallowed his rage, forcing a smile that felt more like a grimace.\n\nHe knew he should be grateful for small mercies, for customers like Mrs. Jenkins who kept his business afloat.
