As he reached for the last gaming console, a woman, likely a customer, began arguing with a coworker about a return policy. The coworker, a tall, lanky man with a scruffy beard, was trying to explain the rules, but the woman wouldn't listen.\n\nShe cut him off mid-sentence, her voice rising, and began yelling at him. He felt a surge of annoyance as she started criticizing his judgment and intelligence. She seemed oblivious to the fact that everyone else in the store was watching, including his girlfriend, who stood nearby, sipping a coffee.\n\nAs the argument escalated, he found himself rolling his eyes in frustration. He couldn't believe how condescending and entitled this woman was being. He felt a twinge of resentment towards her, and his mind started to wander back to all the times his girlfriend had been treated unfairly by others \u2013 the way people would talk down to her, or assume she didn't know something because of her age or appearance.<|eot_id|>",

This woman was acting like she owned the place, bossing around that poor employee who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. Couldn't she see how ridiculous she sounded?\n\nI mean, seriously, who does she think she is? It's not his fault the store has a policy! I could feel my blood pressure rising just watching her. And where was the manager in all this? Shouldn't they be intervening?\n\nMy girlfriend, Emma, just stood there calm as ever, sipping her coffee like nothing was happening. How could she be so unfazed by this chaos? It wasn't her being talked down to like that!\n\nI couldn't help but think back to the time we were at the DMV and some guy gave her a hard time for not having her license yet. He acted like it was her fault he had to wait! And here she was, again, just taking it all in stride while I was over here ready to explode.\n\nI sighed internally, wishing Emma would stand up for herself, or at least say something to this entitled woman. But no, she just smiled sweetly and said, \"Honey, why don't we grab lunch after this?\" And there I was, left holding the bag of my own pent-up frustration.\""

A text message on his phone caught his eye - a reminder about the upcoming court hearing.\n\nAs he began chopping vegetables, his mind wandered to the divorce proceedings. He'd thought they were settled, but now he was worried about what might come up during the hearing. His hands trembled slightly as he diced the onions, the smell of garlic and ginger filling the air, momentarily overwhelming him.\n\nA customer shouted for their food, breaking the spell. But as the sous chef handed over the dishes, one of them was sent back due to a minor error. The chef's heart skipped a beat as he frantically re-plated it, his palms growing sweaty beneath the heat-resistant gloves.\n\nThe kitchen around him seemed to slow down, every second ticking by like hours. He could feel his pulse racing in his neck, and his breath came out in short gasps. Suddenly, the line cook called out for help, and the chef's attention snapped back to reality. For a moment, everything else faded away, leaving only the oppressive feeling of uncertainty.<|eot_id|>",

It's not like anyone else could feel this knot in his stomach, see these beads of sweat forming under his gloves. He sighed internally, chopping onions with a little too much force. \"Hey, careful,\" the sous chef said, eyes flicking up to meet his, but there was no concern there, just that same knowing smirk. Or maybe it was just his imagination? Either way, it grated on him, like everything else tonight."
