The restaurant was quiet, except for the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional clinking of dishes from the prep station. As he worked, he noticed a faint scent - the unmistakable aroma of a familiar spice blend - wafting through the air.\n\nAt first, he thought it must be one of the new staff members experimenting with a new recipe, but as the minutes ticked by, the smell lingered, refusing to dissipate. He began to feel a growing sense of unease, his mind racing with possibilities. Had someone broken into the kitchen? Was it a prank gone wrong?\n\nHe glanced around the room, his eyes scanning the countertops, the pots and pans, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the feeling persisted, like a low-grade fever that refused to break. And then, he caught a glimpse of something - a small, almost imperceptible droplet of water on the edge of the counter.\n\nIt was a tiny thing, easily overlooked, but to him, it seemed like a deliberate attempt to throw him off balance. His heart rate quickened, and his hands began to shake slightly as he tried to shake off the feeling of being watched.<|eot_id|>",
