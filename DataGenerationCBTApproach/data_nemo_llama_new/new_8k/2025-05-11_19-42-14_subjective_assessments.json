His wife had been on his case about selling some of his work, about scaling back and making a living, but every time he tried to let go of a piece, he felt like he was sacrificing a part of himself.\n\nAs he gazed at the painting, his mind began to wander to all the rejections he'd faced over the years \u2013 galleries that had turned him down, collectors who hadn't bitten, the countless hours spent working on pieces that never seemed to find their audience. He thought about how much money he owed on his mortgage, how his savings were dwindling, and how his wife's patience was wearing thin.\n\nSuddenly, his phone buzzed with a text from his wife, reminding him that she needed him to take out the trash that evening. Something about it sent his heart racing, and before he knew it, he was standing in front of his fridge, staring blankly at the expired yogurt, his hands shaking as he considered the mountain of chores ahead.<|eot_id|>",
