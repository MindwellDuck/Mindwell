No, that honor went to Sarah, my supposed partner, whom I found already ensconced at our usual table, fingers dancing on her laptop keys with an enthusiasm usually reserved for long-lost lovers. She glanced up as I approached, her eyes flickering over me like a distant star before returning to her digital affair.\n\n'Could you add her coffee to the bill?' asked the barista, intruding upon my attempt at greeting Sarah. As if I were some errand boy, not her partner. I felt my irritation grow like a malignant tumor, fueled by the 'nevers' and 'always' of this morning's events.
