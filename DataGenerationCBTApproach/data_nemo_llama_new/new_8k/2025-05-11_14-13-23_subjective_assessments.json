She tried to brush it off, focusing on the patient charts in front of her. However, when John excused himself to attend to another patient, he brushed past Emily's desk, his arm grazing hers.

It wasn't just friendly banter anymore; it was something more.\n\nShe couldn't shake off the image of Emily lingering by the coffee machine, her eyes sparkling as she laughed with John. The pang of discomfort that had struck her earlier now felt like a dull ache in her chest. She tried to dismiss it, telling herself it was just a figment of her overactive imagination. But the memory of John's arm brushing against Emily's, and the shiver it sent down his spine, refused to dissipate.\n\nAmelia took a deep breath, her fingers tracing the edges of the patient charts on her desk. She had always prided herself on her rational thinking, her ability to see things in shades of grey. But now, she found herself sliding into that old pattern, the one she'd worked so hard to overcome. John was either with her or he wasn't. Emily was either just a friendly colleague or something more sinister.\n\nThe thought sent a wave of sadness washing over her. She missed the days when life was simple, when there were clear-cut answers and easy solutions. Now, everything seemed muddled, confusing. It was as if she was trapped in a room with only two doors - one leading to safety, the other to despair. There was no middle ground, no in-between. Just like her feelings for John and Emily, it was all or nothing."
