The soft beeping of machines and muffled cries of patients filled the air. Suddenly, the lights flickered and the elevator jolted to a stop between floors.\n\nThe nurse's eyes widened as the emergency alarm began to wail, and a voice over the intercom announced a power outage throughout the hospital. Panic started to spread among the staff, who scrambled to find flashlights and batteries.\n\nAs the nurse stepped out into the darkened hallway, she felt a chill run down her spine. She clutched the cold metal railing, her heart racing, as she gazed up at the darkness above. The hospital's backup generators roared to life, casting an eerie glow over the deserted corridors.\n\nHer partner, waiting anxiously by the nurse's station, called out to her, but his voice was distant and muffled. The nurse's fear grew as she realized she was alone, separated from the only person who knew how to handle this kind of crisis.<|eot_id|>",

The way he spoke about it was so nostalgic, like he was reminiscing about a different life.\n\nAs she typed out a routine update, her eyes landed on the photo of them taken on their anniversary two years ago. She hadn't looked at it in months, but something about it caught her attention now. The way he smiled, the way she did... it all felt so familiar yet so foreign.\n\nA faint hum from her computer interrupted her reverie, and she blinked away the tears that pricked at the corners of her eyes. It was just a reminder that she needed to finish this project by the end of the day. But as she refocused on the code, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was losing herself in these empty days, searching for something that no longer existed.<|eot_id|>",

Either she'd pull an all-nighter and nail it, or she'd crash and burn. No in-between.\n\nShe grabbed her cigarettes from the drawer, lighting one up despite the open window. The smoke filled her lungs, burning like a fucking warning sign. This was her life now - either she was on top of things, or she was failing miserably. There was no such thing as 'good enough.'
