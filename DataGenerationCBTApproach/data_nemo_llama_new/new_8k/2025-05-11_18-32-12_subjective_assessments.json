She was a symphony of efficiency, while he... he was nothing more than a clumsy discord.\n\nHis hands, those once-strong tools that had built a life for them, now shook like leaves in an autumn wind. He could still see the sugar scattered across the counter like a trail of failure, each grain a mocking reminder of his waning usefulness. How could he have been so foolish to think he could still contribute, when even a simple task like handing over cookies ended in disaster?\n\nMartha's patience was a blade that cut deep into Harold's heart. She hadn't even noticed the mess at first, too engrossed in helping their grandchildren with their new computer. It was as if she didn't see him, or his efforts. And why would she? He was nothing but an old man, a relic of a past that no longer mattered.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to block out the sight of Martha's competent hands and the children's wide, surprised eyes. The cookie he had baked with such care now tasted like ash in his mouth. Everything he touched turned to dust, it seemed.
