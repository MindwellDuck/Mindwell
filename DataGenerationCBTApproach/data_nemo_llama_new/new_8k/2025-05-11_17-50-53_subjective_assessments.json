They'd gotten into it over something trivial \u2013 who was going to attend a conference in another city next month. It wasn't a big deal, but somehow it had escalated into a full-blown fight. Her friend had said some hurtful things, and A's response had only made things worse.\n\nNow, as she delved deeper into the data, A couldn't shake the feeling that she was staring into the abyss, searching for meaning where none existed.
