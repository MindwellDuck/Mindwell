She could almost smell the smoke from his favorite cigar, hear the way he used to laugh when she made him try new recipes. A pang of sadness twisted her stomach as she recalled the argument they'd had three days ago \u2013 the one where he'd told her he needed space, that he couldn't stay in a place that reminded him of his ex.\n\nAs she stirred the sauce, her hand brushed against the wooden spoon he'd given her on their first anniversary. It was now worn and scratched, a constant reminder of what she'd lost. The sweetness of the caramelized sugar turned bitter on her tongue as she thought about all the anniversaries they wouldn't be celebrating anymore.<|eot_id|>",

Would he have liked the way the colors blended together? Would he have critiqued the composition? Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, and she knew she couldn't bear the thought of finishing the piece without him there to share it with.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she set down her brush, the canvas stretching out before her like a cold, empty grave.<|eot_id|>",

She felt a surge of irritation as she thought about all the times she'd warned him about overspending, only to be dismissed with a pat on the back and a promise to be more careful next time.\n\nAs they sat there in silence, the sound of the dishwasher humming in the background, she noticed a small, elegant watch on his wrist \u2013 a gift from his family for his recent promotion.
