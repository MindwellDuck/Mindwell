Or the bread.* His mind flashed images of John's perfectly stocked pantry, his wife's appreciative smile as she cooked with ease.\n\nHe felt a pang of envy, sharp and unexpected, like a paper cut on an already tender finger. *Why can't I be more like that?* He could almost see himself standing in John's pristine kitchen, his wife laughing effortlessly at some shared joke while they cooked together.\n\nHis hands clenched tighter behind his back, knuckles white with tension. *I'm a failure,* he thought, the words echoing hollowly in his mind. *At least John knows how to take care of his wife.* He felt the familiar sting of inadequacy, a constant companion these days.\n\nBut even as these thoughts swirled like storm clouds in his head, he knew he wouldn't voice them aloud. He'd just smile and say it was nothing, because that's what good husbands did, right? They didn't dwell on their failures or compare themselves to others. They just... got on with it."
