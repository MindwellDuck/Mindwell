A customer who had been loudly complaining about the price of a pair of shoes they'd already tried on three times.\n\nAs he restocked the shelves nearby, his mind began to wander back to the argument he'd had with his wife last night \u2013 over something trivial, but it felt like a huge deal at the time. She'd left him feeling small and unimportant, and he couldn't shake the sense that she was right to be upset.\n\nThe coworker's easy resolution of the situation seemed to rub salt in the wound. Why did everyone else get to handle these situations with such ease? Didn't anyone ever get taken advantage of around here?\n\nJust then, a customer approached him, eyeing the same shoes the loud one had tried on earlier. Without waiting for an answer, this new customer started asking questions, trying on multiple sizes and expressing frustration when they didn't fit quite right.\n\nSomething snapped inside him. He found himself growing increasingly short with the customer, his tone sharp and dismissive. The customer looked taken aback, but before he could apologize, the manager intervened, asking if everything was okay.<|eot_id|>",

It had been over something so trivial - the placement of the salt shaker on the dinner table. But she'd made it feel like the end of the world, hadn't she? Her voice echoed in his mind, sharp and accusing. He could almost feel the weight of her disapproval, a physical ache that seemed to confirm his inadequacy.\n\nSarah's laughter rang out as she handed over the refund receipt, drawing him back to the present. \"Well, isn't this just peachy,\" he muttered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Everyone's having a jolly good time while I'm stuck here, swimming in self-pity.\"\n\nA new customer approached, eyes locked on the same pair of shoes that had caused such consternation earlier. He opened his mouth to greet them, but before he could utter a word, they launched into a barrage of questions and demands. His patience, already stretched thin by Sarah's apparent ease and Elizabeth's lingering critique, snapped like a twig.\n\n\"Sir,\" he began, his voice as cold as ice, \"we have a policy here at Macy's. If you insist on trying on every size under the sun, I'm afraid we can't guarantee that they'll all be available for purchase.\" The customer blinked, taken aback by his sudden frostiness.\n\nBefore he could apologize or explain himself, Mr. Thompson, the manager, appeared at his side, eyebrows raised in inquiry. \"Everything alright here, gentlemen?\" he asked, a note of concern in his voice. He felt a twinge of guilt but pushed it aside, telling himself that he was simply standing up for himself and his store's policies. After all, if everyone else could expect special treatment, why shouldn't he demand the same?"
