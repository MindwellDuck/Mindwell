Her husband had been gone two days, working late as he often did, but this time there was no note, no explanation. She'd called his phone until it went straight to voicemail.\n\nAs she gazed around her cluttered studio, her eyes landed on a faint smudge of paint on the windowsill. It looked almost... deliberate. A careless smear, perhaps, but something about it struck her as calculated. Had someone been here? Watching?\n\nThe air seemed thick with secrets. She felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck, as if unblinking eyes were trained on her from the shadows. Her brush trembled, then dropped to the floor with a soft clatter.
