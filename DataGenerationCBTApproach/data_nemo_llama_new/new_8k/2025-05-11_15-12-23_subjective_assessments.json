The anniversary of his passing was approaching, and the familiar ache had begun to intensify. As she gazed at their smiling faces, memories flooded back \u2013 happy moments from their life together, now tinged with sorrow.\n\nHer mind wandered to the hospital where she worked, to the patients who still required care and compassion she could no longer give to her own family. She thought about all the days she'd spent by her husband's bedside during his illness, feeling helpless as he slipped away.\n\nThe weight of those unfulfilled days settled upon her, making her breath catch. A lump formed in her throat as she remembered the countless nights she'd spent alone since his passing, the silence deafening. Her eyes dropped to the worn armchair beside the photo, where a faint smudge of lipstick remained from a long-forgotten kiss.\n\nIn the sudden stillness, she felt the depth of her regret: the things left unsaid, the promises unkept, the love that lingered but was no longer shared. The emptiness of her home seemed to swallow her whole, leaving only the hollow echo of what once was.<|eot_id|>",
