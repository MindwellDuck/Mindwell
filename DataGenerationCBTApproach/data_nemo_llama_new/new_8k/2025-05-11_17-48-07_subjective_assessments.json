His stomach growled in response, reminding him that it had been days since he'd cooked a proper meal. A young woman stood on his porch, a bright smile plastered on her face, holding out a plate of homemade goodies.\n\n\"Hi there! I brought over some fresh bread and jam,\" she said, her eyes sparkling with kindness. \"I saw your ad online for help with gardening and thought maybe you could use some company.\"\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about his art, his grief, and simply looked at her. She seemed so... happy. So carefree. The pang of jealousy caught him off guard, leaving him feeling unsettled and uncomfortable.<|eot_id|>",
