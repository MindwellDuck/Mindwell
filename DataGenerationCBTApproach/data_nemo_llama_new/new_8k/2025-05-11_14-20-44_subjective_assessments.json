But now, it felt like the system was failing them \u2013 again.\n\nThe nurse's apologetic expression only fueled his ire. How could they afford to make such careless mistakes?

Her apologetic face had been enough. It was written all over it: incompetence.\n\nHe stormed out of the hospital, his mind already made up. They didn't care about her struggles, not like he did. Every damn test result mattered here, and another two days could feel like an eternity when you were fighting for your life. He'd heard their excuses before - 'it's just a delay', 'we're doing our best' - but they didn't understand. Not really.\n\nAs he sat in his car, gripping the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white, he thought, \"This is typical.
