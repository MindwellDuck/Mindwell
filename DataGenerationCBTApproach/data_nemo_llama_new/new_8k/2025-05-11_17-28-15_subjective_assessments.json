He remembered the countless hours they'd spent researching this exact issue together, pouring over statistics and talking to experts until their voices were hoarse. They'd planned to write a joint expos\u00e9, but life had gotten in the way \u2013 and then it was too late.\n\nThe clip caught his eye again \u2013 a photo of a young family struggling to make ends meet, their faces etched with desperation.

Either I was in, or I wasn't. There was no in-between."
