She felt her heart racing, her breath catching in her throat. The dining room doors swung open, revealing an empty space where normally there were bustling tables and the hum of conversation.

She felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead, her palms growing slick with perspiration. The kitchen, once her sanctuary, had become a nightmare.<|eot_id|>",

The chaos was deafening, or so it seemed to me; perhaps everyone else was working blissfully unaware of the impending doom. Why wasn't anyone else panicking? Couldn't they see we were sinking?\n\nThe texts buzzed like angry bees, each one a personal attack on my competence. I could almost hear the suppliers' voices, their words dripping with disdain: \"Why haven't you sorted this out yet?\" And the customers! They must be furious at me for ruining their evenings.\n\nWhen the fire alarm screeched to life, it felt like a physical blow. I was sure everyone thought it was my fault, that I'd burned something beyond recognition. The staff stared at me, confusion writ large on their faces. Didn't they understand? This was all happening because of me.\n\nMy heart pounded against my ribs like a trapped animal. Sweat trickled down my spine as I fumbled with the phone, trying to reach the repairman. Each ring felt like an eternity, each second a testament to my failure. Why wasn't he answering? Did he hate me now too?\n\nThe kitchen, once my domain, now felt like a foreign land, hostile and unforgiving. Every appliance seemed to sneer at me, every surface reflected my incompetence back at me. I was drowning in this sea of chaos, alone and unseen."

As she scanned the chart of a young patient admitted under her care, her eyes caught the date \u2013 two years ago today. The day her husband passed away.\n\nHer gaze drifted to the empty space beside her on the couch, where he used to sit during family movie nights. She felt the familiar pang of regret wash over her, wondering if there was more she could've done to prevent his passing. Had she pushed him too hard to finish his residency? Should she have encouraged him to take more time off?\n\nThe beeping of a nearby machine snapped her back to reality. A nurse approached, asking for her input on the patient's medication regimen. As she began to respond, her mind wandered again, replaying conversations they'd had about their future plans. Plans they never got to make together.\n\nA low murmur from another doctor interrupted her thoughts, drawing her attention to the conversation unfolding nearby. Her colleague mentioned a new study on early intervention for certain cancers, which might have altered the course of her husband's treatment.

I felt the familiar warmth of resentment creep into my cheeks.\n\n*Maybe they're talking about something else,* a small voice in my head tried to reason, but I dismissed it. *No, this is definitely about me. He must be telling her how much I've been bugging him.* I could practically hear their conversation, a mocking echo of my own words.\n\nI watched them sit down, order drinks, and continue their laughter-filled chat. My stomach churned with every giggle, each one feels like a tiny knife twisting inside me. *Why isn't he looking for me?* I thought, feeling the urge to interrupt them growing stronger by the second. *Doesn't he know how much this hurts?*\n\nJust then, my friend glanced over and waved me down. \"Hey, come join us!\" he called out, his smile wide and genuine.
