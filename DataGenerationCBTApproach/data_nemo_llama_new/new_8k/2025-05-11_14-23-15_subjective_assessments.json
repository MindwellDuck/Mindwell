His wife had left for her weekly book club meeting earlier that morning, and the silence of their empty house was starting to get to him.\n\nAs he dried his hands, he noticed the calendar on the fridge \u2013 tomorrow was his daughter's birthday. He was supposed to take her out for ice cream, but he'd been putting it off all week, too caught up in work and worrying about the upcoming hospital accreditation visit.\n\nA knock at the door broke his reverie. It was the mailman, delivering a package from the medical supply company. The doctor's heart sank as he saw the invoice inside \u2013 they were threatening to revoke their contract if payment wasn't made within the next two weeks.\n\nThe sound of the mailman's truck driving away seemed to echo through the house, and for a moment, the doctor felt a wave of panic wash over him. What if he lost his job? How would he pay for his daughter's birthday treats? And what if...what if...what if...the worst-case scenario unfolded?<|eot_id|>",

It's not like it's her real birthday present. And besides, she's been acting like such a brat lately, maybe she doesn't deserve a fancy dinner out after all...\"\n\nHis eyes darted back to the calendar, the '13' scrawled in red marker glaring at him like an accusation. \"God, I can't even remember the last time we had fun together. She's probably going to hate whatever I pick for her present too. Might as well save myself the trouble and cancel now.\"\n\nHe sighed heavily, rubbing his temples where a headache was beginning to form. \"And don't even get me started on work.
