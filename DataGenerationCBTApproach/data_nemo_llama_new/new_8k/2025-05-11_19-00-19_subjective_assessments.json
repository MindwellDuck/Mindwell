The woman had been working non-stop since opening, barely taking a break to grab a quick snack from the break room. As she waited for her turn to ring up her own purchases, she noticed the manager lingering by the door, chatting with a regular customer.\n\nThe conversation seemed friendly enough, but it made her feel like she was missing out \u2013 again. Her ex hadn't called all day, and she'd spent most of the evening alone, wondering if he was even thinking about her. The thought made her shoulders sag ever so slightly, and she found herself fidgeting with the shopping bags in her hands.\n\nAs she rang up her purchase, she accidentally knocked over the jar of canned beans, spilling them all over the counter. The noise startled her, and she felt a flush rise to her cheeks as her coworkers turned to help her clean up the mess. For a moment, they all stood there, the only sound the soft clinking of cans against the tile floor.<|eot_id|>",

She could practically hear him thinking, \"Not as efficient as Sarah, always taking her sweet time.\" The thought made her stomach churn, her hands trembling slightly as she swept the errant cans back into the jar.\n\nShe stole a glance at him, standing by the door now, his gaze seemingly fixed on something beyond the window. But was he really? Or was it all an act, a facade to hide his true intentions - to call her out later, to criticize her performance in front of everyone?\n\nHer heart pounded in her chest like a drum, echoing the chaotic thoughts racing through her mind. She couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd been singled out, that they were all conspiring against her somehow. Her coworker's smile seemed too bright, too knowing, as if she was privy to some shared secret.\n\nYet when she looked around, no one else seemed to notice anything amiss. They went about their tasks, oblivious to the storm raging inside her. She felt like a ship adrift in treacherous waters, alone and unmoored, while everyone else sailed smoothly along on calm seas. It was unbearable, this feeling of being left behind, misunderstood. But she couldn't quite put her finger on why, or how it had all gone so wrong."

The kitchen was quiet, except for the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional tick of the clock on the wall. Her mind wandered back to her wedding day, twenty-five years ago.\n\nAs she ladled the risotto onto a serving dish, her hand brushed against the small silver locket that hung around her neck. It contained a photo of her late husband, taken on their first anniversary. She hadn't worn it in years, but something about today's simple meal stirred up memories.\n\nThe kitchen seemed smaller, the air thicker, as she remembered the way he used to stand beside her, watching her cook. He'd always been supportive, never once criticizing her creations. But now, his absence felt like a permanent fixture in the kitchen, a reminder of what could have been.\n\nShe set the dish down, her hands shaking slightly as she wiped them on a towel. The kitchen's warmth didn't penetrate the chill that had settled in her chest. For a moment, time seemed to freeze, and all she could think about was what might have been if he were still here to share this meal with her.<|eot_id|>",

A pang of resentment hit her as she thought about her neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, who still enjoyed meals with her husband every evening.\n\n*Why can't I be like them?* she thought bitterly, *Still together, still happy.*\n\nShe carried the risotto over to the table, setting it down with more force than necessary. As she took her seat, she couldn't shake the feeling of inadequacy that had settled in her stomach like a heavy stone.\n\n*Why did he have to leave me? Look at Mrs. Thompson, she still has hers.* She pushed the food around on her plate, her appetite waning as self-pity began to rise within her. *It's not fair,* she thought, *I should be able to enjoy meals like that too.*\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the thoughts. But the empty chair seemed to mock her, reminding her of all the dinners they'd never have together again. She picked up her fork, but her hands still trembled slightly as she began to eat, the bitterness lingering on her tongue like an unwanted aftertaste."
