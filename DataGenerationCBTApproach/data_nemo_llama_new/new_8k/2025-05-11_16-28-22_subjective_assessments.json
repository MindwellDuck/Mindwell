His mind seemed incapable of acknowledging anything positive about his efforts tonight.\n\nSarah's voice echoed in his mind, \"You've done an excellent job, John.\" He pushed away from his desk, annoyance flashing across his face. \"She hasn't seen the final draft,\" he grumbled. \"If she had, she wouldn't be so quick to praise it.\"\n\nHe returned to his chair, picking up another pen and crossing out a paragraph he'd spent hours crafting. \"This is rubbish,\" he declared, his voice dripping with frustration.

They had involved me, whether they meant to or not, and I intended to see this through to the end.\n\nI stood up, grabbing my coat and keys, preparing to follow the protesters wherever they led me next.
