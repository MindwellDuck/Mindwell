A group of rowdy kids laughed and jeered at the struggling student, their mocking voices piercing through the air. The teacher he worked alongside, usually supportive, looked frazzled and helpless, unable to intervene.\n\nOne particularly obnoxious child, known for disrupting classes, caught his eye. He had been receiving warnings from administrators, but still managed to behave poorly. Today, however, he went too far \u2013 deliberately knocking over a chair, shouting at the student, and spitting on the floor.\n\nThe teacher tried to calm him down, but the boy's tantrum escalated. His face reddened with anger, and he began yelling obscenities at everyone in sight. The room fell silent, all eyes fixed on the chaotic scene unfolding before them.\n\nA parent arrived shortly after, demanding to know why her son wasn't being given more attention in class. She berated the teacher, claiming they were inadequate and incompetent. Her voice dripped with venom, and her accusations cut deep.\n\nAs the situation continued to deteriorate, he felt a familiar burning sensation rising up inside him. It was the same feeling he'd experienced countless times before, the same one that made his heart pound and his vision narrow. He knew it was coming, and he couldn't do anything to stop it.<|eot_id|>",

It was bad enough they had to put up with this brat every day, but now he was disrupting their peace completely. And what the fuck was that parent thinking, storming in here and chewing out the teacher like that? Jesus Christ, if she'd just keep her kid on a leash, none of this would've happened.\n\nIt's not like they didn't try to help him, the other kids I mean. They tried to explain it to him, but he was just too fucking stupid to get it. And now look at this mess! All because nobody could rein that little bastard in. Why should they have to suffer through his tantrums? It's not their fault he's a fuckup.\n\nHe felt the anger boiling inside him, threatening to spill over. This wasn't fair. They shouldn't have to deal with this shit. If only someone would take responsibility for once, then maybe things could go back to normal. But no, it was always up to them to clean up everyone else's messes. Fuck that. He was done being the responsible one. It was time someone else took the blame for a change."

His laughter carried through the room, but it only made her feel more isolated.\n\nAs she finished chopping the vegetables, she caught a glimpse of herself in the reflection of a shiny metal spoon.
