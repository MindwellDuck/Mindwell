As he gently ran his fingers over the weathered stone bench where they'd shared countless afternoons, the sound of children's laughter drifted from the nearby park.\n\nA young mother and her rambunctious toddler passed by, holding hands as they walked towards the swings.

His eyes narrowed slightly, focusing on the delicate skin above her eyebrow where she'd gotten a tiny scratch during their fight.
