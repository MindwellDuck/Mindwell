His wife, Sarah, had always encouraged his passion for art, attending every exhibition and proudly displaying his pieces around their home. Today was different; he was preparing for a solo show at a prominent gallery, a milestone she'd been supportive of from the beginning.\n\nAs he mixed colors, a local artist \u2013 a friend since college \u2013 strolled into the studio, admiring his latest work-in-progress. They chatted about their shared love of Impressionism until the younger man casually mentioned he'd recently acquired a new studio space, roughly twice as large as this one.\n\nThe familiar walls seemed cramped now, the cluttered workspace feeling like a relic of his humble beginnings. A faint sense of disconnection washed over him as he listened to his friend's stories of his rapidly expanding practice, the accolades and commissions pouring in. For an instant, the envy crept in, a slow-burning ember that threatened to consume him.<|eot_id|>",

Her mind wandered to the anniversary of his passing \u2013 another year without him by her side.\n\nAs she gazed out the studio window, watching the sunlight fade behind the trees, she noticed a young couple strolling hand-in-hand along the sidewalk below. They laughed and chatted, their joy infectious but futilely so. She felt a pang in her chest as they stopped beneath a streetlamp, the woman adjusting her husband's jacket, a gesture she used to mimic when they were together.\n\nThe sound of rain pattering against the roof interrupted her reverie, and she let her gaze drift back to the painting, her eyes tracing the faint outline of the subject's face. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she whispered, 'Still here,' the words lost amidst the silence of her empty studio.<|eot_id|>",

I mean, who needs a watch that big and flashy?\n\nAnd what if something happens to it? What if they lose it or someone steals it? That's a lot of money down the drain. And for what? To show off? They could've put that towards their honeymoon or a down payment on a house.\n\nI can't help but think about all the 'what ifs'.
