She looked lost and scared, clutching a small bag to her chest.

It felt like she was looking right at him, seeking help. The weight of responsibility settled heavily on his shoulders. This was his city, his people. How could he stand here and do nothing?\n\nHis hand reached for his radio instinctively, but paused mid-air. He knew the protocol, knew that he should respond to the earlier call first. But how could he abandon her like this? She needed him. He felt it deep within his core, a primal urge that was almost tangible.\n\nHe took a step towards the stairwell, then another, each one bringing him closer to her.
