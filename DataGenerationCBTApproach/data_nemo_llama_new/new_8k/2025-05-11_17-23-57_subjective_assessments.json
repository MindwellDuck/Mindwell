She felt an overwhelming sense of emptiness, as if a part of her had been left behind when he was gone.

I could feel it, the truth of it, as if my emotions were the ultimate arbiter of reality. The world should bend to my feelings, not the other way around.\n\nI clicked out of the post, but the bitterness lingered, clinging to me like a shadow.
