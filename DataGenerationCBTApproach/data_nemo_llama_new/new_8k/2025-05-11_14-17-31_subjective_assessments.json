She pulled away quickly, feeling a surge of annoyance. Alex didn't notice, too caught up in checking his phone.\n\nThe screen lit up with a text from his sister, asking when he'd be coming over tomorrow. He looked up, expecting her to have something to say, but she just nodded curtly and turned back to the stove.\n\nHis eyes narrowed slightly, and he set his glass down. \"Everything okay?\" he asked, his tone a little sharper than usual.\n\nFor a moment, they just stared at each other, the tension between them palpable. Then, without another word, he turned and walked out of the kitchen, leaving her standing alone amidst the chaos of pots and pans.<|eot_id|>",

I took it, feeling the weight in my hands. It was probably just another book from my old mentor, trying to fill the void left by his passing.\n\nI set it down on the table without unwrapping it. No matter how hard I tried, my mind kept wandering back to those people outside, their carefree laughter ringing loud and clear in this silent studio of mine. They were like a slap in the face, reminder after reminder of what I don't have anymore.\n\nThe afternoon sunlight cast long shadows across the canvas as I worked, but every stroke felt heavier than the last. It's not that I'm ungrateful for the package \u2013 it's just... another thing to look at and remember how empty my life has become.
