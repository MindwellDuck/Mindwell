A shiver ran down her spine as she read about the girl's determination to start anew, despite the setback.\n\nThe image of the girl's determined face lingered in her mind, and suddenly, memories of her own failed job interviews began flooding back.

Her eyes welled up with tears as she realized how far she'd come, yet still struggled to find stability in her own career.\n\nHer phone buzzed, breaking the silence.

For a moment, they talked about finding a new opportunity, but then her mom mentioned the impending rent increase, and the pressure was back on. The weight of her responsibilities settled in, and she felt a lump form in her throat as she listened to her mom's words.<|eot_id|>",
