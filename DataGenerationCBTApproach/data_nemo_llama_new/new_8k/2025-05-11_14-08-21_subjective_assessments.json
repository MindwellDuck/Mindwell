His wife had spent hours the previous day tending to it, much to his dismay. He couldn't understand why she insisted on maintaining such a perfect facade.\n\nJust then, his wife walked into the kitchen, a look of excitement on her face. \"I got us tickets to a weekend getaway to the beach,\" she announced, holding up her phone to show him the confirmation email.\n\nA pang of resentment struck him, mixed with a dash of disappointment. They'd been married for three years now, and they'd barely taken a single vacation together. All the planning and preparation seemed to fall on her shoulders \u2013 the research, the booking, the coordination.\n\nAs he forced a smile onto his face, he thought about all the times he'd suggested going to the beach but never made it happen. Never once did he get to take charge, to plan something just for them. The feeling simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over.<|eot_id|>",

He felt a pang of jealousy stab at him like a knife.\n\n*She's doing this on purpose,* he fumed internally, his hands clenched around his coffee mug. *To prove that she can do it better.* He felt the disappointment wash over him like a tidal wave, drowning out any rational thought. He knew, deep down, that she was just trying to surprise him with something nice, but his emotions screamed otherwise.\n\n*I guess I'll be stuck playing catch-up again,* he thought morosely, as if it were an undisputable fact written in stone. *Just like always.* His heart ached with the weight of his feelings, and he couldn't help but feel that this was just another example of how she always got to call the shots.\n\n*But hey,* he thought bitterly, raising his coffee cup in a mock toast, *at least I'll have a tan while I'm drowning under her plans.* His emotions were his truth, and they painted a very bleak picture indeed."

The journalist felt a pang in his chest, wondering when he'd last experienced something like that \u2013 genuine happiness and connection.\n\nThe couple finished their drinks and left, and he was left alone once again, nursing his cold coffee.<|eot_id|>",

They too were smiling, their faces flushed with youth and happiness. Always, it seemed, everyone was like this except him. He felt a pang in his chest, a familiar ache that had become almost comforting in its consistency. Whole days passed without a single moment of genuine happiness, entire weeks stretched out before him like a vast, empty expanse.\n\nHe took another sip of his coffee, now stone cold, and sighed internally. This was just how life was for him, he supposed. Alone, apart from the world's joy, while everyone else seemed to bask in it effortlessly."

A faint smile crept onto her face, but it quickly faded as she realized the emptiness surrounding her.\n\nHer eyes welled up with tears as she placed the final piece of the puzzle, revealing a picture of two people holding hands.

They struck up a conversation about their shared interest in coding, and the woman asked for advice on a project she was working on.\n\nThe barista handed her coffee, and as she took a sip, she felt a pang of resentment towards the woman. Not because of anything she had said or done, but simply because she couldn't help but compare their lives. Her own project at work was stalled, and she was struggling to meet deadlines. This woman, on the other hand, seemed to be effortlessly juggling multiple projects and clients. The contrast was stark, and for a moment, she let her gaze linger on the woman's successful-looking presentation on her laptop.\n\nThe woman finished her coffee, thanked the barista, and stood up to leave.
