The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the beeping of the machines in the ICU down the hall. He checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time, the numbers ticking away with agonizing slowness.\n\nA nurse on his team caught his eye, chatting with a colleague by the water cooler.

The glow of his computer screen cast harsh shadows on his face. \"Always behind, always struggling. They make it look so easy.\" His fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitating before typing another line of code for a project that never seemed to end.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the hospital corridor, to her laughter and carefree chatter. He felt that familiar pang again, jealousy twisting his stomach into knots. But he wasn't jealous of her \u2013 she was happy, after all. No, it was the sense of ease that seemed so out of reach for him. Always the responsible one, always the hard worker. Never the joker, never the carefree spirit.\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to focus on his work.
