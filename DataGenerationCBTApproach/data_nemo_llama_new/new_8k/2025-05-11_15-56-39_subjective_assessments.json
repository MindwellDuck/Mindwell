He was certain he'd locked it before leaving for his shift at the mall. Shrugging it off as forgetfulness, he began to unpack his groceries.\n\nAs he reached for a jar of pasta sauce, he noticed the couch cushions were slightly rearranged. He could've sworn they'd been in their usual spot all day. A faint scent of cologne lingered in the air, but he didn't recognize it. It wasn't anything he'd worn recently.\n\nThe thoughts nagged at him as he went about making dinner. He checked the security cameras, but the feed showed nothing unusual. Still, the feeling persisted \u2013 someone had been in his apartment while he was out. He tried to shake it off, telling himself it was probably just his imagination playing tricks.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: 'You're being watched.'<|eot_id|>",

He remembered the way she'd smile when he presented it to her, the way she'd take a bite and close her eyes, savoring the flavors.\n\nAs he worked, he noticed a group of young couples walking by the restaurant, laughing and holding hands. One of them caught his eye - a girl, probably no more than twenty years old, with a bright smile and a sparkling ring on her finger. The chef felt a pang in his chest, a familiar ache that had become all too common since his wife passed away.\n\nJust then, one of his line cooks accidentally knocked over a container of sauce, spilling it all over the counter. The chef let out a low growl, frustration boiling over. He quickly grabbed a towel and began to clean up the mess, his movements stiff and jerky.\n\nAs he wiped down the counter, he caught a glimpse of himself in a reflective surface. His eyes looked tired, his face lined with worry lines. For a moment, he forgot where he was, forgot what he was doing. All he could think about was how much he wished his wife were there to share this meal with him, to laugh and joke with him like they always did.<|eot_id|>",

This isn't a goddamn fairy tale!\" His voice shook with anger, his eyes blazing as he looked around the kitchen, taking in every detail that wasn't quite right - the spilled sauce, the burnt pot on the stove, the line cook who was moving too slow. \"This is reality! And it's fucking awful.\" He stormed off to his office, leaving a trail of tension behind him, completely blind to the fact that everyone else in the kitchen was working hard and having a fine evening until he snapped."

His wife had passed away six months ago, and he'd been struggling to keep up with the household expenses on his own. As he gazed at the stack, he felt a familiar numbness spreading through his chest, as if the weight of his grief was suffocating him once again.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. He hesitated before answering, wondering who it could be. It was the social worker from the hospice, calling to discuss his wife's estate. The conversation was a blur of legalese and bureaucratic jargon, but one phrase cut through the noise: \"the house will need to be sold.\" A pang of desperation struck him, followed by a crushing sense of hopelessness.

As he closed the door, he felt a twinge of warmth at the gesture. But then, as he placed the casserole on the counter beside the unopened ones from other neighbors, he thought, *This won't make any difference.

His gaze lingered on the messy bun and the faded jeans, and for a moment, he let his mind wander to his own life \u2013 the divorce, the long hours, the sense of being stuck in neutral. He snorted inwardly, chiding himself for even thinking it. He was here to help people, after all.

Always so cheerful, always so smug about his perfect little family. \"All grown up now,\" indeed! As if I haven't been there since the beginning.
