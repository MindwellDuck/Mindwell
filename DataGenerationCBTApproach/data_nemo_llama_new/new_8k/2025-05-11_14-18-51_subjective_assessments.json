She could picture him out there, shoulders relaxed, hands gesturing animatedly as he talked about their upcoming gardening project.\n\nA twinge of warmth nudged at her heart, a memory of how they'd started this project together, laughing over seed catalogs and arguing playfully over which plants to choose. But she pushed it aside, her fingers tightening around the edge of the countertop. That was then, this is now. His plans, his ideas, his friends next door. She felt a pang of something - jealousy? loneliness? - but she dismissed it, rolling her shoulders back and straightening her spine. It didn't count, not really.
