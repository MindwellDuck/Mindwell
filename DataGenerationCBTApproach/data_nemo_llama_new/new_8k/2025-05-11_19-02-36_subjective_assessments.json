She'd be thrilled with whatever Martha chose, but why did my wife have to make such a production of it?

It wasn't as if I didn't care about our garden back home, but who had time for tending roses when there were ledgers to balance and suppliers to haggle with? Martha seemed to think it was some grand failing on my part, but she hadn't a clue how hard I worked to keep this place afloat.\n\nThe gloves spilled over like an omen of chaos. \"Clumsy fool,\" I grumbled at myself, kneeling down to gather them. Martha just stood there, waiting for her change as if it were the most important thing in the world. I handed her the wrong amount, and she took it without so much as a blink. Didn't she care about the mistake? Or was she simply too busy planning her trip to notice?\n\n\"Next weekend,\" she said casually as we stepped out into the crisp autumn air. My stomach twisted into knots at the mention of it. Martha deserved better than this constant state of neglect, but what could I do? The store needed me, and I wasn't about to let it crumble while she flitted off for a visit.\n\nNo, no matter how much Martha smiled or how many gifts she bought for Emily, it wouldn't change the fact that I was failing her.
