She starts talking about starting a cooking blog and involving your son more in the process. How do you react, reflecting 'I believe my emotions reflect reality'?

Her words echoed in the room, \"I've been thinking about starting a cooking blog...\" My heart began to race, a sensation that felt like warning bells ringing loudly in my ears.\n\n\"Involving more of our son,\" she continued, as if discussing the weather. My hands, usually so steady with a knife, started trembling slightly. The onions I was meant to chop lay untouched on the board, their pungent smell now seeming oppressive rather than comforting.\n\nI felt it, the resentment bubbling up within me like the bouillabaisse I'd been preparing for hours. Each word she spoke seemed to validate my frustration, each sip of her coffee a stark reminder of her obliviousness. My mind raced with thoughts of how little she understood, how much I'd sacrificed for this restaurant, for our family.\n\nYet, I said nothing, my lips pressed into a thin line. The words caught in my throat, swallowed by the intensity of my emotions. How could she not see it? How could she suggest such things when all I've done is give my everything to this? My feelings were real, tangible, and they screamed at me that Sarah was wrong, that she was blind to our reality. But I held them in, letting only the chopping of vegetables betray the storm within me."
