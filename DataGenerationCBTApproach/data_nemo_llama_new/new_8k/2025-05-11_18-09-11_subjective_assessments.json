As he sliced the onions, the memories came flooding back - the way she'd laugh at his jokes, the way she'd critique his cooking, the way she'd always make him feel like he was home.\n\nJust then, his phone rang. It was the new sous chef from the restaurant down the street, asking if he could come in for an interview. The man had no idea who he was, but he remembered how his own sous chefs used to respect him, how they'd listen to his advice and follow his lead.\n\nThe anger simmered beneath the surface as he answered the phone, his voice tight with resentment. He asked the sous chef to wait while he finished up, his mind racing with all the things he could tell this newcomer about working under him - about being disrespected, about being overworked, about being taken advantage of.\n\nAs he hung up the phone, he felt his anger boil over, spilling out onto the stovetop where he'd left a perfectly good sauce simmering. The onions were now caramelized, the meat browned, but the dish was ruined.
