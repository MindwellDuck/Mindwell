He'd praised her talent, his words laced with condescension, making her feel like she was only good enough because he believed so.\n\nNow, years later, she couldn't help but wonder what he would think if he saw this piece. Would he still be impressed? Or would he find fault, just as he had always done? She felt a pang of desperation, a longing for validation from someone who no longer existed in her life. Her eyes lingered on the canvas, searching for a spark of inspiration, but it remained elusive.<|eot_id|>",
