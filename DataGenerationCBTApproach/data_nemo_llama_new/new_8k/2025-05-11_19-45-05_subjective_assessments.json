They seemed so carefree, their laughter echoing across the grass. But then, just like that, they stopped. The woman looked over at me, her smile fading.\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. *She must have heard me thinking about how perfect they seem,* I thought to myself. *She's probably judging me for being so bitter.* I quickly averted my gaze, feeling my cheeks flush with embarrassment.\n\nI told myself to calm down, that she couldn't possibly know what I was thinking. But the doubt lingered. *Maybe I should just leave,* I thought. *They'll think I'm weird otherwise.*\n\nBut then the man said something to her, and she laughed again. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. *See? They're not thinking about me at all.* I finished my sandwich, feeling foolish for letting my imagination run wild."
