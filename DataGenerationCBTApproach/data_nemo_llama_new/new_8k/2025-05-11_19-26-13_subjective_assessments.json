It had been three days since her partner, Alex, got hurt on duty \u2013 his broken leg still aching, and his usual cheerful demeanor subdued. She couldn't help but think about what could've been done differently.\n\nAs she began to organize the reports, a phone call from dispatch interrupted her. A young woman reported a domestic disturbance at a nearby apartment complex. The officer assigned to respond was someone else, someone who'd worked with Alex on several cases.\n\nThe description of the scene played out in her mind like a movie reel: the shattered windows, the broken furniture, and the eerie silence that followed. Suddenly, a faint image of Alex's face appeared beside the victim, offering words of comfort as he helped her calm down. Her heart sank as she realized she wouldn't be able to see him smile again anytime soon.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of emptiness, but it lingered, making every pencil scratch feel like a betrayal.<|eot_id|>",

The stack of paperwork before me seems insurmountable today, each sheet a testament to the order we strive for, yet somehow, it all feels... wrong. It shouldn't be like this, not with Alex out, his leg broken and spirit dampened. The silence is deafening, an unspoken reproach against the chaos that should've been prevented.\n\nI sigh, adjusting my glasses as I reach for another report. My fingers trace the neat lines of type, but my mind's eye sees only shards of glass and splintered wood. It shouldn't have happened this way. We're supposed to protect, not be felled by our own streets. The victim's face floats in my vision, a specter of fear and pain. Alex should've been there, his smile a beacon of hope amidst the ruin. But he's not, and that fact feels like a personal failure.\n\nI pause, my pen hovering over the report. I shouldn't be feeling this way, not when there's work to be done. Yet, here I am, adrift in a sea of 'shoulds' and 'oughts', each one a weight pulling me under. It shouldn't be like this, but it is. And that truth, stark and unyielding, is almost too much to bear."
