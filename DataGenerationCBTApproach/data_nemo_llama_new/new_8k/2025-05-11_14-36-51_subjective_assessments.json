Her partner, Alex, had been going through a tough week at work, and she'd offered to make his favorite dinner to take his mind off things. As she stirred the pan, her phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, Emily, asking if she could borrow $200 for an emergency vet visit.\n\nThe text was brief, but it sparked a wave of worry that washed over her. What if Emily needed more help than she could afford? What if she couldn't pay her bills this month? The thought sent a pang of anxiety through her chest, and for a moment, she forgot about the simmering sauce, letting the heat seep into her skin.\n\nAs she turned back to the stove, her gaze drifted to the calendar on the wall, where Alex had scribbled a note about their upcoming vacation plans. They were supposed to be celebrating their anniversary next weekend, but now she wasn't so sure. The weight of responsibility and uncertainty began to settle in, making her hands feel heavy as she reached for the spoon.<|eot_id|>",

He's been stressed out of his mind at work, and I wanted him to come home to something nice for once. But no, Emily has to ruin that too. It's either all about me making dinner for my boyfriend or it's all about her and her fucking cat.\n\nI can't even look at the calendar now without feeling sick. Our anniversary trip was supposed to be our little getaway, just the two of us. But now? Now I'm going to be stressed out about money too, wondering if we should cancel or go anyway and just put it all on a credit card. It's either a perfect fucking vacation or we're drowning in debt. There's no in-between with me, is there?\n\nI can't even enjoy the stupid onions now, not after Emily's text. They're either perfectly caramelized or they're burnt to shit.
