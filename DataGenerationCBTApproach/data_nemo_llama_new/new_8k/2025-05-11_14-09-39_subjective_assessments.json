The evening news plays softly in the background, but he barely notices as he makes a beeline for the kitchen to grab a bottle of water from the fridge.\n\nAs he opens the bottle, his eyes land on a stack of unpaid bills on the counter. His wife had mentioned earlier that she was going to take care of them tonight, but he can't shake the feeling that she's been putting it off again. A knot forms in his stomach as he scans the pile \u2013 another overdue credit card statement, a utility bill that's already past due... \n\nThe TV continues to play, but he's no longer listening. He stands there, staring blankly at the bills, his mind replaying the conversation they had last week about money and stress. How many times have they talked about this? It feels like they're stuck in some kind of never-ending cycle, and he's starting to wonder if things will ever get any better.<|eot_id|>",

They'd often share coffee breaks among the plants, discussing their latest experiments and dreams for the future.\n\nAs he turned away from the view, his fingers absently strayed to the silver locket he kept hidden behind his ear \u2013 a memento of their time together.
