'Doctor, I wanted to discuss your note on patient Smith's case.' He hesitated before continuing, 'I was wondering if you could clarify why you ordered an additional round of antibiotics without discussing it with the team first.'\n\nAs she scanned the chart, a faint flush crept up her neck. She'd been so focused on getting the surgery done efficiently that she must have overlooked the protocol. The resident's question brought back memories of a similar mistake during her residency, one that had earned her a stern reprimand from her supervisor.\n\nA pang of embarrassment stung her chest, and she felt her eyes prick with unshed tears. She hastily composed herself, her voice firm but tight. 'Let me explain,' she began, already anticipating the lecture she knew would follow.<|eot_id|>",
