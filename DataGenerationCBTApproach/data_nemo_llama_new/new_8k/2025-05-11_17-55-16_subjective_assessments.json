A string of delayed lab results from a particularly high-profile case weighed heavily on her mind \u2013 a patient's life hung in the balance, and she was still waiting on crucial test results.\n\nAs she scanned the notes, her eyes landed on a familiar name: Mrs. Johnson, the same woman who had been admitted last week after a fall. The doctor's scribbled note caught her attention \u2013 'Failed to follow up on medication regimen.' The same medication her own mother had refused to take when she'd been diagnosed with diabetes years ago.\n\nA knot formed in her stomach as she wondered if this was another avoidable tragedy waiting to happen. She felt a wave of frustration wash over her, her breath catching in her throat. Her gaze drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking away with agonizing slowness. The report continued to roll in, but all she could hear was the steady beep of the printer, a reminder that time was running out.<|eot_id|>",

Her eyes darted back to the report, lingering on Mrs. Johnson's name.\n\n\"This isn't right,\" she muttered, more to herself than anyone else. She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks, her grip tightening around the papers. \"She should've taken her meds. She shouldn't have ended up here like this.\" Her voice was low, almost accusatory, as if Mrs. Johnson could hear her across the distance.\n\nShe glanced at the clock again, the hands moving too slow for her liking. \"They should've run those tests yesterday,\" she grumbled, tapping her pen against the counter with each passing second. \"This is ridiculous. They're playing with her life here.\"\n\nHer shoulders tensed as she continued to scan the report, her 'shoulds' piling up like a growing list of injustices. She shouldn't have to wait like this. Mrs. Johnson shouldn't be in this position. The lab results should've been back by now.\n\nAs the morning wore on, her frustration grew. It was as if the world around her wasn't following her internal script, and she couldn't understand why everything didn't just fall into place the way it 'should'."
