She felt a twinge of irritation at his intrusion, but tried to brush it off. After all, they'd worked together on countless projects before. But as she watched him, his hands hovering over her work like he owned it, she couldn't shake the feeling that he was trying to undo everything she'd put into this piece \u2013 every stroke, every decision, every fragment of herself. The brush slipped from her fingers, leaving a smudge on the canvas. \"I think I've got it,\" she said curtly, turning away.<|eot_id|>",

The room was filled with familiar faces from the community, including some of her former students now established artists themselves.

One of her students, now a successful painter, awkwardly approached her, offering what he thought was helpful assistance but only made things worse by knocking over his own glass of water in the process. The evening, meant to celebrate her artistic achievements, quickly turned into an uncomfortable blur of embarrassment and failed attempts at salvaging the situation.<|eot_id|>",

As the nurse watched, a younger nurse, likely a recent graduate, approached the family, apologetic but detached, explaining the availability of alternative treatments. \n\nThe older nurse felt a pang in her chest as she thought about her own husband's struggles with the hospital system, and how they'd been forced to wait for months for a specialist to see him.

Their daughter had her whole life ahead of her, and now it's all up in the air because they can't afford some goddamn medication. I couldn't help but think about how we were denied that specialist for months too. We waited until it was almost too late.\n\nWhy them? Why not us? We've been through hell with this cancer thing. I've spent countless nights by his side, watching him waste away. And now these kids, they're just starting out, and they're getting the same shit deal we did.
