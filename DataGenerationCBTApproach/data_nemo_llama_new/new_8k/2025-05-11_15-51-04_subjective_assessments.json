It's not like I've been busting my ass trying to keep this dinosaur network running all these years.\n\nAnd now, *now* they want me to believe that I'm supposed to be excited about some fucking tech conference? Please. Like I could even afford a ticket with the goddamn raise I haven't seen in five years. And who gives a shit if it's 'for women'? It's not like I can just waltz in there and magically become relevant again, is it?\n\nI mean, come on! It's not like I'm going to wake up tomorrow and suddenly be able to afford the latest gadgets or have the latest skills.

The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and he pushed it aside, trying to focus on the mundane task at hand.

Just give him a break?\n\nHe slammed the plate down into the rack harder than necessary. \"Hell,\" he muttered, rubbing his hand. That was going to leave a bruise tomorrow. But what did it matter? Who would notice anyway? Not like she cared anymore.\n\nHis gaze drifted back to her empty chair. He could almost see her sitting there, laughing at something silly he'd said. The memory stung, and he felt the familiar surge of anger. Why did she have to leave him alone with all this? It wasn't fucking fair. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.
