The silence was oppressive, a stark contrast to the chaotic beeps and murmurs of the hospital floor she had left behind. As she gazed out the window, her eyes landed on a photo of her family \u2013 her ex-husband and their two children \u2013 taken on what felt like a lifetime ago.\n\nA faint smile played on his lips, capturing a moment of joy she hadn't experienced in years. Her mind began to wander to the countless mornings she'd rushed out the door to get everyone ready for school, the afternoons spent attending parent-teacher conferences, and the countless nights spent refereeing fights over whose turn it was to do the dishes.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She hesitated before answering, her heart sinking as she heard the voice of her colleague, inquiring about the status of a patient's test results. A wave of sadness washed over her, mingling with the familiar ache of loneliness that seemed to have become her constant companion.<|eot_id|>",

She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself, but her heart was already pounding like a damn drum in her chest. \"I can't do this,\" she whispered to herself, feeling the familiar dread wash over her. \"I just can't.\""

His wife, Margaret, had been fond of those scallops, always requesting them for their anniversary dinner five years ago.

But no, he stuck with the old standby, the safe bet. The one that never failed to make her smile before. Before everything changed.\n\nHe looked at the lavender box, its scent filling the room like an unwanted guest. She'd loved that perfume, used to wear it all the time. But now, it was just a reminder of what could've been. What should've been. He could've done more, said more. Instead, he stood here, stirring scallops in garlic butter, wondering if she'd like them better with a squeeze of lemon or a sprinkle of parsley.\n\nThe pang in his chest grew stronger, the familiar ache that never quite went away. What if he'd cooked something else? Something grander, more romantic? What if he'd made their anniversary dinner perfect, just once? Would it have made a difference? Would she still be here, her eyes sparkling in the candlelight?\n\nHe sighed, turning off the stove. It was too late for what-ifs now. All that was left were the scallops and the ghosts of memories past. He hoped she'd like them, wherever she was. He hoped she'd understand why he kept asking himself these questions, even if he didn't quite understand it himself."
