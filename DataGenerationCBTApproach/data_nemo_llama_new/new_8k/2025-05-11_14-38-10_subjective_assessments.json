He took a seat next to her, ordering a beer from the bartender.\n\nThe conversation was stilted, with long pauses between each question. When he asked her about her day, she replied matter-of-factly, barely elaborating on anything. The usual small talk that usually flowed effortlessly now felt forced.\n\nAs they ordered their drinks again, he caught himself wondering what had changed. Hadn't they been excited to see each other? Now it felt like a chore. The bartender interrupted their silence, asking them if they wanted another round. \n\nShe hesitated before responding, \"No, we're good.\" Her voice was flat, devoid of any warmth or enthusiasm.
