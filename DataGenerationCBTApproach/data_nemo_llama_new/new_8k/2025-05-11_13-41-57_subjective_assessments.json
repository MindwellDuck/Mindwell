She rubbed them away, trying to focus, but her thoughts kept drifting back to their last walk together \u2013 just six months ago. He'd held her hand, and they'd strolled along the river, watching the sunset. The ache in her chest tightened, making every breath feel like a struggle.\n\nAs she lost herself in the memory, her fingers began to hover above the keyboard, hesitant to touch the work that needed doing.

The image seemed to blur, then sharpen, as if it was about to slip away, leaving her with nothing but the hollow feeling of emptiness.<|eot_id|>",
