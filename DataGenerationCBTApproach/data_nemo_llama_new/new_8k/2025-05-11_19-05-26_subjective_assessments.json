She thought about all the small things they'd corrected over the years \u2013 the way he took his eggs too well done, the fact he never liked her favorite coffee blend. It added up, and now, when it came together so effortlessly, she felt like she'd been a nagging presence in his life.\n\nHe settled beside her, unaware of the turmoil brewing inside, and asked how her day was going.

Life shouldn't be this hard.\n\nShe looked at the young woman's face, bathed in the soft morning light, and felt a pang of longing.
