The nurse had been working non-stop since morning, and now it was almost time for her own break. As she waited for the elevator, she noticed the patient's chart on the clipboard \u2013 another one, another family left to worry about.\n\nThe door to the nurses' station swung open, and a young nurse walked out, smiling brightly at the staff. \"Hey everyone, I'm so excited for my honeymoon next week! My husband and I are going to Bora Bora.\" A faint pang in her chest responded to the cheerful announcement, but she pushed it aside, attributing it to exhaustion.\n\nAs she stepped into the elevator, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror \u2013 tired eyes, worn skin, and a hazy expression. For a moment, she wondered if anyone would even notice her absence during the evening shift tonight. Would her husband care? Had he grown accustomed to her being away, like all those other nights?<|eot_id|>",

And right now, they were telling her that everyone had abandoned her, leaving her to bear this burden alone."
