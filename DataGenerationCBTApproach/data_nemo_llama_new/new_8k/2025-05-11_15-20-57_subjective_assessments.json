He had mentioned a possibility of a new opportunity, but hadn't seemed too enthusiastic about it. She remembered him saying he was happy with their current situation.\n\nThe letter inside revealed that the company was indeed offering him a significant raise, but also a promotion to a senior role \u2013 something they had discussed years ago when they first started dating.

It's like he wants everyone to think he's some artsy fuck too, when we both know he can't even draw a straight line.\n\nI glance over at him, his face all serious and shit while he pretends to inspect my work.
