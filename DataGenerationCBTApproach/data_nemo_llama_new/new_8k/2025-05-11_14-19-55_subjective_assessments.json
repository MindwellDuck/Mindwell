She remembered how he'd always encouraged her art, how proud he was of her latest exhibitions.\n\nShe absent-mindedly picked up a nearby brush and began to mix colors, but instead of creating something new, her hand instinctively reached for the old palette where he used to store his favorite paints. Her fingers closed around the familiar weight of the tube, and for a moment, she felt like he was still there, holding her hand, offering words of encouragement.\n\nThe gesture caught her off guard, and tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. She quickly wiped them away, trying to compose herself, but the pain lingered, a reminder that some wounds would never fully heal.<|eot_id|>",

You always thought she was exaggerating, but now... now you're not so sure.\n\nYou glance at your knitting, untouched in your lap. You can't focus on it, not with this noise.
