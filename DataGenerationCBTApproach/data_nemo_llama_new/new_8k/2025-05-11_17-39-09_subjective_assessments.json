Now, it collected dust, a relic of a career that had slowed to a crawl since her husband passed away.\n\nAs she turned the pages, memories flooded back \u2013 memories of awards won, articles published, and colleagues respected. But also, memories of missed deadlines, botched interviews, and the constant pressure to produce. Her mind wandered to all the times she'd let herself down, all the mistakes she'd made.\n\nA faint scent of pipe tobacco wafted from the book, reminding her of her late husband, who had loved those old books almost as much as he loved her. She felt a pang in her chest, followed by a wave of shame. How could she have been so careless, so uncertain? The doubts crept in, whispering that she was no longer capable of doing what she used to do best.\n\nThe silence in her small study grew thicker, weighing upon her shoulders like an unspoken accusation.<|eot_id|>",

She must be wondering why I haven't written anything worthwhile in years.\" Sarah could almost hear the imagined judgment in her colleague's eyes, even though the woman had simply walked by without a glance.
