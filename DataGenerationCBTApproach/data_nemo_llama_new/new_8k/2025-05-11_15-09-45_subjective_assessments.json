Why did he never put away his phone when they were together?\n\nAs she waited, the silence between them grew thicker, until it felt like a physical presence in the room. The clock ticked away, each passing second making her more anxious, more irritable. She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself it was ridiculous, but it only seemed to intensify as she watched Alex scroll mindlessly through his social media feed.<|eot_id|>",
