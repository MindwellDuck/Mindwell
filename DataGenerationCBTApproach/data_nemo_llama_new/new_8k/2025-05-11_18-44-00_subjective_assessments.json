The name on the screen was Emily Wilson \u2013 the same Emily who had called her in tears three years ago after a medication mix-up had left her paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nAs she scanned the notes, a familiar ache began to form in her chest. She recalled the guilt-ridden conversations they'd had, the sleepless nights spent wondering if she could've done something differently. The patient had since recovered, but the memory of Emily's anguished face still haunted her dreams.\n\nThe nurse's phone buzzed, breaking the spell. A new patient was being prepped for surgery. As she made her way to the OR, the fluorescent lights above seemed to hum in sync with the beating of her heart, reminding her of the weight of responsibility she carried every day.<|eot_id|>",

The rest of the team seemed to be managing fine without her, but she couldn't shake off the gnawing feeling that they were all falling apart without her constant supervision.\n\nShe hurried towards the OR, her mind locked on the impending surgery. Emily's face flashed before her eyes again, but she pushed it away. \"Not now,\" she whispered, focusing solely on the task at hand, oblivious to the broader context of her thoughts and actions."

The teacher forced a polite smile and asked after her family, but the conversation felt stilted. As they chatted, she couldn't help but notice how effortlessly this young woman was moving forward, laughing and joking with her peers, while she was still navigating the empty space beside her.\n\nA familiar pang of bitterness settled in the pit of her stomach as the teacher watched another group of students glance over at her, then quickly look away, sensing her discomfort. She tried to shake off the feeling, attributing it to fatigue, but it lingered \u2013 a constant reminder that some things would never be hers again.<|eot_id|>",
