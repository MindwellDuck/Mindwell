She thought about how many nights they'd eaten takeout because she didn't feel like cooking, or how often he'd fallen asleep on the couch while she watched TV alone.\n\nThe dishes still needed washing, but her attention drifted away from them, lost in thoughts of feeling invisible. The silence between her and her family seemed to grow thicker, heavier, until it felt like a weight pressing down on her chest.<|eot_id|>",

She shook her head, squeezing the sponge so hard water droplets flew onto the countertop. \"It's always like this,\" she whispered, shoulders slumping as if bearing an invisible weight.

He thought about how he'd spent most of the evening pretending to be interested in someone else's life, all while feeling increasingly disconnected.\n\nAs he gazed out the window, watching the sun set behind the city skyline, he realized he hadn't cooked a meal for himself in weeks. The silence was deafening, punctuated only by the occasional chirp of a bird or the rumble of traffic. He felt like a ghost drifting through his own home, invisible and alone. The lights flickered slightly as he turned off the stove, but it wasn't just the burner; it was his heart, too.<|eot_id|>",
