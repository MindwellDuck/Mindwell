A breaking story caught his attention - a prominent local hospital had been fined for patient safety lapses.\n\nThe doctor's mind began to wander to the hospital where he worked. He started mentally rehearsing the procedures they followed, checking off each step, thinking about what could have gone wrong. His eyes drifted to the locked cabinet in the corner of the room where sensitive files were stored.\n\nA faint noise from the hallway caught his attention. He froze, listening intently. It sounded like someone was walking by their apartment door, but it was already past 8 am, and no one usually walked by then. His heart rate quickened slightly as he thought about who it might be.<|eot_id|>",

You'd think the hospital was on fire, not just a few papers went missing.\"\n\nI stalked down the hallway, my mind fixated on that damn incident report. *Patient confidentiality breached*, they said. As if anyone cared about some old lady's medical history getting out. She wasn't exactly Madonna.\n\nBut no, everyone had to make a federal case out of it. I could practically hear the whispers: \"Is Dr. Thompson losing his edge?\" \"Maybe he's not as sharp as he used to be.\" Like they knew better than me, than my own hands that had saved countless lives.\n\nI stormed into the coffee room, grabbed a mug, and poured myself some joe. Black, like my mood. My eyes scanned the room, landing on the new interns huddled by the window. They were laughing about something, probably at my expense. *Idiots*, I thought, turning away.\n\nI took my coffee back to my office, slamming the door behind me. I sat down, staring at the incident report on my desk. Just one detail out of a thousand that made up my day. But it was all anyone cared about now. Typical."
