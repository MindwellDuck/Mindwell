Yet, as he stepped back to observe his work, he couldn't help but feel a pang of inadequacy.\n\nHis mind drifted to Bernard, that young whippersnapper who had burst onto the art scene just last year. The critic's raves about Bernard's \"bold strokes\" and \"raw emotion\" still echoed in Harold's ears. Compared to Bernard's vibrant, sell-out exhibitions, Harold felt his studio was a mere museum of dusty relics.\n\nThe stack of unopened letters on his desk seemed to mock him, their silence louder than any critique. He could almost hear them whispering, \"Not like Bernard, not even close.\" Each letter represented another missed opportunity, another door closed in his face while Bernard's seemed to swing open with ease.\n\nHarold sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of comparison. His wife's portrait seemed to stare back at him, her painted eyes filled with pity or perhaps it was just his imagination reflecting his own disappointment. He picked up a paintbrush, dipping it into a shade of blue that reminded him of her favorite dress. But the brushstrokes felt heavy, weighted down by Bernard's success and Harold's own perceived failures.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. \"Why does Bernard get all the recognition while I'm left here, painting in obscurity?\" His voice echoed in the empty studio, a sad symphony of comparison and despair. Yet, despite the bitterness that clung to his tongue like the taste of sour grapes, Harold knew he wouldn't stop painting. After all, what else did he have left?"
