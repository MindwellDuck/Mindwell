Instead, she saw a young reporter, probably half her age, confidently answering questions about the latest development in the case she'd been working on for months.\n\nAs the young reporter spoke, she noticed how effortlessly he'd framed the opposing view, highlighting their own publication's biases while downplaying theirs. The words stung, echoing the same feelings of inadequacy that had plagued her since her husband's passing \u2013 the constant struggle to prove herself in a male-dominated field.\n\nThe young reporter's tone was smooth, almost condescending, as he wrapped up his answer. She felt a surge of anger at being seen through his lens, at being reduced to a widow trying to make a name for herself rather than a capable journalist in her own right.
