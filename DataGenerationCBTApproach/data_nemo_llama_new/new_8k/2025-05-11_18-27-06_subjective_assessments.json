But the comparisons kept creeping back in, like unwelcome guests at a party. *I'm just not cut out for this,* she thought, her confidence waning with each passing moment. She felt small, insignificant, swallowed whole by the shadows cast by others' perceived greatness.\n\nYet, even as these thoughts swirled around her, she remained unaware of their true nature.
