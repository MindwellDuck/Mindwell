A customer, middle-aged and out of breath, rushes past her, nearly colliding with the shelf display. As she hurries away, she mutters under her breath, 'Like they care.' The cashier rings up a sale for another customer, seemingly oblivious to the woman's hasty departure.\n\nLater, during her break, she sips tea at the employee lounge and notices a coworker, new to the store, chatting with their supervisor about receiving a promotion. The conversation turns to the possibility of raises, and the new employee asks if they can discuss it further with management. The senior worker replies, 'I'm sure we'll get around to it, but first, let's focus on getting the sales up.'\n\nThe elderly woman listens, feeling a familiar knot form in her stomach. She recalls when her last job had increased her hours by a fraction, yet refused to bump her pay. Her thoughts linger on the years since then, spent juggling bills and expectations on an ever-dwindling pension. The sound of clinking cups and polite laughter from her colleagues serves only to heighten her irritation.<|eot_id|>",

They'd never give her more than they had to, never see her worth beyond what she could squeeze into their profit margins.
