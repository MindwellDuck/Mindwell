How delightful for them, I thought, biting back the bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nAnd then there was John, ever the grandfatherly figure, beaming over his grandkids' achievements. The group started discussing retirement plans, and I couldn't help but feel like a child among adults. Their ease, their joy, their security - it all seemed to taunt me, as if they were deliberately rubbing in my face what I didn't have.\n\n'Oh, how wonderful,' I thought, the sarcasm dripping from my mind like acid rain. 'How absolutely, blissfully wonderful for everyone but me.' As if the world cared to exclude little old me. How very thoughtless of them.\""
