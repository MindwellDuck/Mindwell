The beeping of machines and muffled whispers of the ICU team faded into the background as he felt the weight of another loss bearing down on him.\n\nThe patient, an elderly woman who had been under his care since admission, was slipping away. He remembered her bright smile and infectious laugh during their initial conversations, but now she lay still and silent, her once-strong hands limp at her sides.\n\nAs he took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of helplessness, his mind began to wander to his own wife back home. She'd been struggling with anxiety lately, and the guilt of being away from her during this shift was suffocating.\n\nThe nurse's chart slipped from his fingers, fluttering to the floor as he turned away from the room, unable to bear the thought of continuing to watch the life slip out of this stranger's body.<|eot_id|>",

I guess that's what happens when you've spent half the night watching life fade away.\n\nShe was a sweet old lady, always had a joke or a kind word, even with all those tubes and wires sticking out of her. But now... well, she's just another name on a chart, isn't she? Not like it matters anyway. I mean, what did I really know about her? She wasn't my grandma, wasn't my patient for very long.\n\nI'd rather not talk about the actual moment, if you don't mind. It was... quiet. Too damn quiet after all that beeping and buzzing. But hey, it's not like I could've done anything more, right? She was old, her time was up, end of story.\n\nAfterwards, I just wanted to get out of there. The ICU feels like a morgue when you're the one left standing. And God forbid anyone asks how I'm doing. 'Fine,' that's all they need to hear. Who wants to talk about feelings anyway?\n\nI didn't stick around for the family. Not my job, not my place. They had their own grief to deal with. Besides, it's not like she was really gone, right? Her spirit, her essence, whatever you want to call it... that wasn't in that bed anymore. Just an empty shell.\n\nI came home, collapsed on the couch, and told myself I'd earned a night off. But my mind, it wouldn't shut up about the whole damn thing. Kept flashing back to that room, that stupid machine, her lifeless hands. So, I did what any reasonable person would do. I turned on the TV, cranked up the volume, and drowned out the noise in my head with some mindless entertainment.\n\nAnd you know what? It worked. For a little while at least. Until the guilt kicked in. Guilt for not being there for my wife, who's been falling apart lately. Guilt for feeling relieved that it wasn't someone I loved, lying in that bed. Guilt for feeling anything at all, really.\n\nSo here I am, another day down, no thanks to anyone or anything. Just me and my thoughts, spinning their wheels, going nowhere fast.\""

He hadn't worn it since her passing. The soft breeze carried the fragrance back to him, transporting him to their wedding day, when they'd exchanged vows beneath the same sun-drenched flowers now blooming in his garden.\n\nA gentle knock on the door broke the spell, but he didn't respond.
