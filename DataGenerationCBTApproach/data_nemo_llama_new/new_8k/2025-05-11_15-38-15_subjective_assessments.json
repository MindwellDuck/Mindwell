He took his coffee, trying to focus on the day ahead, but his mind kept wandering back to the empty seat at lunchtime, the one they used to share.

The aroma of coffee assaulted my senses, not with its usual comforting warmth, but like an accusing finger prodding at my grief. Six months had passed since her absence began to echo through our home, and still, some days it felt as if she had never left.\n\nThe lunch rush was in full swing, a cacophony of clattering trays and chattering voices that seemed too loud, too cheerful. I stood in line, eyes roving over the faces of colleagues, searching for one face among them - hers. But there was only the void where her smile once shone.\n\nA group of young nurses, barely out of their training shoes, sat huddled around a table, laughter spilling from them like an overflowing cup. One caught my eye, her smile bright and careless, her eyes sparkling with youth and joy. A pang shot through me, sharp as a needle, as I remembered the last time we'd laughed together. It felt like another lifetime.\n\n\"Dr. H,\" the barista called out, snapping me back to reality. I took my coffee, the cardboard cup burning my fingers, much like the guilt that gnawed at me for feeling so alone in a room full of people who knew her too. I scanned the table where we used to sit - now occupied by a group of interns, their heads bent over textbooks. The empty seat, hers, seemed to stare back at me, accusatory.\n\nAs I turned away, my gaze fell upon a bouquet on a nearby table, vibrant blooms bursting from a vase like an explosion of color amidst the sterile white. A card attached read, 'To a wonderful nurse, thank you for being there'. My heart seized in my chest, jealousy clawing at me like a wild beast. Who were they honoring? Certainly not her - she was gone, forgotten already by these people who had once called her friend.\n\nThe cafeteria, once a place of shared meals and stolen moments, now felt foreign, hostile even. Each laugh seemed too loud, each flower too bright, each absence too glaring. I left, coffee untouched, the weight of my grief heavier than ever, drowning out the positives that still lingered like echoes in this place we'd once called ours."

She could see it, clear as day - him shaking his head at her next proposal, his voice echoing in her empty office, \"Not good enough, not this time either.\"\n\nShe felt it then, that familiar knot of dread tightening in her stomach. This was it, the beginning of the end. They'd see her for what she really was - a fraud, a failure. She couldn't do this, not again. But she had to.
