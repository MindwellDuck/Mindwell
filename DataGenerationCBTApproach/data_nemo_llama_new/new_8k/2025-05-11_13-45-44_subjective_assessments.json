The response was immediate \u2013 a photo of her enjoying a meal out with friends, accompanied by a caption about missing him.\n\nThe contrast between their lives hit him hard, leaving him feeling disconnected and isolated in his own home.<|eot_id|>",

His fists clenched, knuckles white, as he fought the urge to scream at the injustice of it all. How could he possibly pay? He was drowning, and no one cared enough to throw him a lifebuoy.
