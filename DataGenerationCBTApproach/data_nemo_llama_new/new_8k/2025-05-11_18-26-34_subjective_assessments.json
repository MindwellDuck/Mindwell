As she flipped through the stack of files, her eyes landed on the latest note from Sarah's mother, reiterating the same concerns about her child's social skills.\n\nJust then, the door swung open and Mrs. Johnson walked in, beaming with pride. \"I'm telling you, I've been working with my daughter's class, and they're doing fantastic! The teacher is doing such a great job.\" She leaned in, a hint of condescension creeping into her voice. \"But I have to say, I do think it would be best if you spent more time on extracurricular activities, rather than focusing on academics.\"\n\nThe teacher's fingers tightened around her pen, her nails biting into her palm as she forced a smile onto her face. She had dealt with this kind of criticism before \u2013 from parents who thought their child was perfect, but hers were somehow lacking. It was infuriating, but she bit back her response, choosing instead to nod politely and make small talk.<|eot_id|>",

The room was filled with art enthusiasts, collectors, and fellow artists, all of whom seemed to be politely pretending to appreciate his work.\n\nAs he scanned the space, his eyes landed on a woman who had been quietly observing him from across the room. She was a curator at a prominent museum, known for her sharp critiques and discerning taste. He had met her briefly at an opening last month, and she had mentioned showing interest in acquiring some of his pieces.\n\nNow, she caught his eye again, this time with a flicker of disappointment. Her gaze lingered on one particular piece, and then quickly looked away, as if embarrassed by her own reaction.

He knew that look \u2013 the one that said he wasn't good enough, that his work wasn't worthy of serious consideration.
