She forced a weak smile onto her face, trying to maintain a professional demeanor, but inside, she felt her face burning with humiliation.<|eot_id|>",

My mind, that once-pristine temple of logic and reason, now felt like a storm-ridden sea.\n\n\"I must be overreacting,\" I told myself, but the words rang hollow. I could almost hear the letter whispering secrets it shouldn't know, accusations it hadn't been given voice to. It was as if the blank envelope contained not just an unknown message, but also every unspoken fear and worry I'd ever had.\n\nI couldn't help but think of all those years in medical school, the endless nights poring over case studies, the weight of responsibility that came with each life entrusted into my care.
