They had always talked about saving for their children's education, but now it seemed like that dream was slipping away.\n\nThe silence from his empty apartment was deafening, and for a moment, he forgot he wasn't alone. The weight of his past mistakes settled heavy on his chest, making it hard to breathe. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had failed as a provider, as a husband, as a father.

His neighbor, Tom, had always seemed to have it together. A successful career, a happy family, no signs of financial struggle. Why couldn't he be more like that? He'd worked just as hard, hadn't he?\n\nHe remembered Tom's kids going off to college last year, their proud smiles and new beginnings. His own children were nearing that age, but the thought of paying for their education felt daunting. He felt a twinge of resentment. It shouldn't be this hard. Others seemed to manage just fine.\n\nHis reflection in the window caught his eye, and he couldn't help but notice the lines etched deeper into his face, the grey hairs at his temples.
