A young postdoc, Rachel, was already there, chatting with one of their graduate students, Alex. They were laughing and gesturing animatedly, their conversation filled with infectious enthusiasm.\n\nAs he poured himself a cup of coffee, he noticed how close they stood together, their bodies angled towards each other. He felt a sudden pang in his chest, a feeling that had been buried beneath the surface for years. It wasn't the proximity that bothered him; it was the way Rachel seemed to be enjoying herself around Alex.\n\nShe smiled at something he said, her eyes sparkling with amusement, and he caught himself tensing, his fingers tightening around the coffee cup. For a moment, he forgot where he was, forgot about his work, and all he could think about was the possibility that she might feel this way about Alex too. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and he hastily took a sip of his coffee, trying to compose himself.<|eot_id|>",

Nothing new there, but then I notice how close they're standing, how she's looking at him...And boom! My mind starts spinning like one of those crazy carnival rides.\n\n'What if she likes him?' I find myself thinking. 'What if he feels the same way? What if they've been sneaking out together after hours? What if their laughter is just a cover-up for all the times they've been caught making out in the supply closet?'\n\nI mean, come on! Who thinks like this at 8 AM? Me, apparently. It's not even about them anymore; it's just me, sitting here with my coffee, going 'what if' this and 'what if' that until I'm drowning in a sea of worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo now I'm all tense, can't focus on my work.

He tried to brush off the feeling, but it only intensified as he continued to teach.\n\nAs the period drew to a close, the boy raised his hand hesitantly. \"Excuse me,\" he said quietly, \"but can I ask you something?\" The teacher nodded curtly, expecting a question about the lesson plan. But instead, the boy asked, \"Do you ever get mad at us when we're being bad?\"\n\nThe teacher felt a surge of defensiveness, but he bit back a snappy response. Instead, he forced himself to take a deep breath. \"Sometimes,\" he said slowly, trying to choose his words carefully. \"We all get frustrated when we're dealing with difficult behavior.\"\n\nThe boy looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded and sat down.
