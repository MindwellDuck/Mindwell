She hesitated for a moment before picking it up, hoping against hope that it wouldn't be him again. But as she heard his calm, detached tone on the other end, her heart sank.\n\n'Can we talk later?' he asked, without elaboration.\n\nShe felt a lump form in her throat as she forced a weak smile onto her face. 'Of course,' she replied, trying to sound nonchalant.\n\nAs she hung up the phone, her eyes wandered to the photo of them on her desk. They were smiling, happy, carefree - everything they'd been pretending to be over the past few weeks. A faint scent of perfume wafted through the air, reminding her of the last time they'd spent an evening together.\n\nHer gaze drifted back to the papers in front of her, and her mind began to wander. To all the times he hadn't shown up, to the fights they'd avoided, to the growing sense of disconnection between them.<|eot_id|>",

He felt the heat rise in his cheeks, a crimson blush that screamed his insecurity louder than any words could. The boy's raised eyebrow was not just an expression of surprise but a damning verdict, echoing the thoughts screaming inside his head.\n\nAnd then, the principal walked in, her smile as bright and unwavering as the sun itself. She approached him, her steps measured, deliberate - each one punctuating his growing anxiety. Her whisper, meant to be reassuring, felt like a knife twisting in his gut. He nodded, forced a smile, but inside, he was crumbling. Every doubt, every fear, every inadequacy he had ever felt was magnified tenfold under her scrutiny. It was overwhelming, consuming - it was reality, according to his emotions. And who was he to argue with himself?"
