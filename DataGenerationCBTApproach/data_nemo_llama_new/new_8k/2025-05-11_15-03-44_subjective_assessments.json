The classroom was empty, except for the faint scent of freshly sharpened pencils from yesterday's lesson. As she began to sort through the worksheets, memories of her husband's gentle voice and encouraging words flooded her mind.\n\nHe used to help her grade these papers during their Friday evenings together. Now, the silence felt oppressive, and the task seemed insurmountable. She rubbed her tired eyes, trying to shake off the haze of grief that had been settling over her for months. But as she looked around the familiar yet somehow unfamiliar room, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was drowning in it all \u2013 the weight of responsibility, the emptiness of her life, and the crushing loneliness that had become her constant companion.<|eot_id|>",

She picked up a worksheet, her eyes lingering on the careless scribbles of a student she barely knew by name.\n\nHow dare he make such silly mistakes? Doesn't he know how hard I work to prepare these lessons? She thought bitterly, her grip tightening around the paper. Doesn't anyone else see how much I'm struggling here?\n\nShe looked around the empty classroom, feeling a pang of resentment. Why weren't the other teachers offering to help her grade today? They must be enjoying their coffee breaks while she was stuck here, drowning in paperwork. She could almost hear their laughter ringing down the hallways, mocking her solitude.\n\nAnd the parents! How could they just send their children off to school without a single thought for how hard she worked? She imagined them sitting comfortably at home, sipping on their morning coffee while she was stuck here, surrounded by the ghosts of her past and the weight of her present. It's not fair, she thought, her eyes welling up with unshed tears. No one understands what I'm going through.\n\nShe shook her head, trying to dislodge these thoughts, but they clung to her like shadows. She picked up another worksheet, her fingers trembling slightly. This one had a thoughtful note written on it, wishing her a happy weekend. She scoffed quietly, her heart aching with bitterness.\n\nHow could anyone possibly have a happy weekend without him? Doesn't this student know that her world has crumbled to pieces? She thought sadly, tucking the worksheet into her bag to take home. Another reminder of what she no longer had."

It was there, years ago, that she'd witnessed her former supervisor, Dr. Lee, berate one of his students in front of the entire department.\n\nDr. Lee's cruel words still echoed in her mind: \"Your research is amateurish, incompetent...you'll never make it in this field.\" The memory had long since faded, but today, something about the scent of disinfectant triggered it anew.\n\nHer eyes narrowed, focusing on the petri dish in front of her. She couldn't shake the feeling that the same hubris and condescension were still present in some form \u2013 maybe even in people like Dr. Lee's successor, who now held a position she'd once coveted.\n\nJohn returned with their lunch, unaware of the storm brewing inside her.

I forced a smile, but my mind was still stuck on those cells dividing under the microscope \u2013 and Dr. Lee's harsh words echoing in my head.\n\n\"Earth to Emma,\" John waved a hand in front of my face, laughing. \"You okay? You've barely touched your lunch.\"\n\nI blinked, realizing I'd been gripping my sandwich like it had offended me somehow. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine,\" I snapped, then softened it with, \"Just lost in thought, you know how it is.\"\n\nBut all I could see was that student being ripped apart by Dr. Lee's words. And now, here I was, letting some ancient memory taint my view of John, of the lab, of everything. It was just a smell, for crying out loud! Yet, it felt like the whole room was conspiring against me.\n\nI took a bite of my sandwich, chewing slowly as if it might reveal some hidden meaning.
