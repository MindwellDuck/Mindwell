The nurse felt a pang in her chest as she realized it had been months since Mrs. Johnson received news of her husband's passing \u2013 news she still hadn't fully processed herself.\n\nAs she continued with her duties, the nurse couldn't shake the feeling that she had somehow failed Mrs. Johnson, that she could have done more to ease the woman's grief.
