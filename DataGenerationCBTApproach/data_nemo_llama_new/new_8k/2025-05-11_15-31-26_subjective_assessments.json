The sounds of sizzling meat and lively chatter filled the air as he began prepping for the lunch service. A young line cook, no more than twenty-five, expertly flipped a pan of pancakes, the golden brown edges glistening with butter.\n\nAs he watched, a woman \u2013 probably a new recruit \u2013 carefully plated a dish, garnishing it with a sprinkle of microgreens and a delicate drizzle of sauce. Her hands moved with precision, each movement deliberate and confident. \n\nA few tables away, a group of diners laughed and chatted over their meals, seemingly oblivious to the chaos behind the scenes. He noticed a couple celebrating what looked like a milestone anniversary, beaming at each other as they shared a tender moment.\n\nFor a fleeting instant, his gaze lingered on the happy couple, and his mind wandered to his own failed marriage. The memory of his ex-wife's smile, now a distant recollection, stung like a fresh wound. His eyes narrowed slightly as he refocused on the task at hand, but the pang of envy lingered, refusing to dissipate.<|eot_id|>",

Her laughter echoed in his mind, louder than the clatter of pans. He watched the young cook flip pancakes, each movement crisp and confident, unlike her hesitant first attempts at cooking together.\n\nShe'd loved trying new recipes, her face scrunched up in concentration as she followed instructions, only to declare them 'a disaster' when they didn't turn out perfectly. He could almost hear her voice, \"I'm not cut out for this, am I?\" But he knew better. She was just being hard on herself.\n\nThe couple at table five caught his eye - laughing, oblivious to the world around them. Just like they'd been once. Her smile, radiant and genuine, used to be reserved for him. Now it belonged to someone else. He could feel it, the way she looked at him, her eyes softening with love. Or so he thought.\n\nHe shook his head, focusing on the mise en place. But the envy lingered, gnawing at him like a hungry rat. It wasn't fair. She was supposed to be here, in their kitchen, laughing over burnt meals and cold leftovers. Not there, with someone else. He could almost hear her voice, \"It's not what you think.\" But he knew better. Didn't he?"
