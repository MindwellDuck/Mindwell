She hesitated, unsure if she should answer it \u2013 it might be another collector asking about her work, another gallery inquiring about a commission, or perhaps a telemarketer trying to sell her something she didn't need.\n\nAs she picked up the receiver, a wave of anxiety washed over her. What if this was someone from her ex-husband? They had a history of being confrontational when discussing their divorce. She took a deep breath and tried to calm herself, but her mind began racing with worst-case scenarios. Who was it? Why were they calling?\n\nThe voice on the other end of the line introduced themselves as a representative from a new art magazine, and they wanted to schedule an interview. The artist's heart skipped a beat as she considered the implications. This could be her big break, or it could lead to scrutiny and criticism she wasn't ready for.<|eot_id|>",

Or maybe he's found some way to make a joke out of our failed marriage in front of his new little family.\" She shook her head, her imagination painting vivid scenes that made her stomach churn.\n\nThe voice on the other end finally registered in her mind, cutting through her internal monologue. \"Uh, hello? I'm calling from... Art Spectrum Magazine?\" It took a moment for the words to sink in, and when they did, she felt a jolt of surprise.\n\n\"Oh, right,\" she sighed, trying to sound nonchalant despite the racing thoughts in her head. \"I thought you were someone else.\" She leaned against an easel, suddenly weary. \"So, what do you want?\""

Twenty-five years of cooking had earned him a reputation in this small town, but what did it mean if no one younger wanted to learn from him?
