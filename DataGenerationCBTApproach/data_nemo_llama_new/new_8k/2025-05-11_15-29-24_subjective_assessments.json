Instead, it was filled with every cut corner, every ignored success from his past articles.

The glowing review for his piece on local recycling initiatives? \"The editor was just being nice,\" he'd insisted.\n\nEach positive memory only served to highlight what he couldn't seem to accomplish now.

Each one was a stark white, unmarred by any wear or dirt. It was as if they were mocking me, just like the rest of the hospital today. Every step felt heavier than the last, each tile a testament to another hour wasted under that resident's scrutinizing gaze.\n\nI couldn't help but think about how different these tiles looked compared to those in the emergency room. The ER tiles were scuffed, worn down by countless footsteps of panicked families and exhausted staff. They had stories to tell, unlike these pristine ones that seemed to whisper 'you're not good enough' with every echoing footfall.\n\nThe rest of the hospital blurred around me as I walked, my focus narrowed down to those tiles. I barely noticed the bustle of activity, the faint scent of disinfectant, or even my partner's concerned voice beside me. All I could see were those tiles, each one a silent, judgmental critic, just like that resident.\n\nWhen we reached the elevator, I finally looked up. My reflection in the polished metal doors showed dark circles under my eyes and a tense set to my mouth. But all I saw was another detail to focus on - a hair out of place, a wrinkle in my shirt. It was as if every aspect of my appearance was shouting 'incompetent' just like that resident's words had.\n\nI stepped into the elevator, my gaze dropping back down to those unforgiving tiles. As the doors slid closed behind me, I felt a strange sense of comfort in their unwavering presence. They were constant, unchanging - unlike everything else today. And somehow, that made them feel like allies rather than critics.\n\nAs we rode up to our floor, my partner tried again to engage me in conversation. But all I could do was nod absently, my mind still firmly fixed on those tiles. It wasn't until she touched my arm gently, pulling me back into the present, that I realized I had entirely tuned out her words.\n\nI stepped out of the elevator, leaving behind the silent judgment of those tiles for now. But as I walked down the familiar corridor towards my office, I couldn't shake the feeling that they were still watching me, waiting to pounce on any mistake I might make.\n\nAnd so, lost in thought and focused solely on one detail, I failed to notice the smiles from colleagues who had witnessed something different earlier - a nurse's stern defense of me, a resident's quiet appreciation for my patient care. Lost in my own world, I missed seeing the whole picture entirely."
