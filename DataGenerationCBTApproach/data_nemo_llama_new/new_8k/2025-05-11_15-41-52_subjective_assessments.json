It was supposed to be the start of a new series, one that would capture the essence of her life as a single woman living alone.

She hadn't looked at it in months, but something about the fading colors and worn edges brought tears to her eyes.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. It was her best friend from art school, calling to ask how her latest project was going. They chatted for a while, laughing and reminiscing about old times. As they said their goodbyes, a pang settled in her chest, like a stone dropping into the well of her heart.\n\nShe set down her brush, unable to bring herself to pick up the canvas again. The silence seemed oppressive, a heavy blanket draped over everything. For the first time in weeks, she wondered if she'd ever find the courage to face another day, alone.<|eot_id|>",

Now, it seemed little more than a mockery of her current existence, each crease and stain a testament to the happiness that had slipped away. She turned her attention back to the canvas, but its pristine whiteness felt like an indictment, a stark reminder of her artistic stagnation.\n\nAs the telephone trilled shrilly beside her, she reached for it mechanically, greeting her oldest friend from art school with a forced joviality. They spoke of old times, of vibrant colors and endless possibilities, but each word felt hollow, echoing the void within her. When at last they hung up, she was left alone again with her thoughts, their weight heavier than ever.\n\nHer brush lay untouched beside the canvas, its bristles splayed like the fingers of a hand reaching out for something unattainable. She could not bring herself to grasp it, for in that moment, all she saw were the shadows cast by her solitude, dwarfing even the faint glimmers of light that tried to pierce through."

Now, it's just me, trying to keep us afloat in this endless ocean of responsibilities.\n\nI know I shouldn't compare, but it's hard not to feel like everyone else has it together except for me.
