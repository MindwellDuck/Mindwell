Her eyes wandered to the framed photo of herself and her ex-husband on the easel beside her work. The laughter they shared, their hands entwined \u2013 memories she'd tried to erase from her mind. \n\nAs she dipped her brush into the vibrant colors, her hand trembled, and a small stroke of paint landed askew on the canvas. She sighed, frustration mingling with regret. Why had she insisted on taking that art class all those years ago? It was supposed to be a hobby, a way to escape the stress of her marriage. But instead, it became an obsession that fueled her anger and resentment when it ended.\n\nThe phone rang, shrill in the silence. It was her daughter, calling to discuss her upcoming art show. A surge of guilt washed over her as she hesitated, wondering if she was ready to face the world again, to showcase her art, and to relive the pain of her past.<|eot_id|>",

You sound...off.\" Her daughter's voice was laced with concern, or was it annoyance?\n\n\"I'm fine, darling,\" she snapped, then softened, \"Just...just lost in my work.\"\n\nSilence stretched out, and she could feel her daughter's eyes rolling. She knew that look, that disapproving silence. It was the same one her ex used to give her.\n\n\"Mom, you've been saying that for weeks now. I worry about you,\" her daughter finally said, voice laced with something that sounded like pity.\n\nShe bristled, her hand tightening around the phone. She wasn't some fragile thing to be pitied! \"I'm fine, alright? You don't need to worry about me.\"\n\nAnother sigh from her daughter, and she could almost see her shaking her head. \"You're not fine, Mom. You haven't been since...you know.\" Her voice trailed off, but they both knew what she meant.\n\nShe felt the familiar anger rising in her chest. Why couldn't her daughter just understand? She wasn't doing this for attention or out of some misguided attempt to relive her past. She was creating art because it's what she loved, what she was good at. And if her daughter couldn't accept that...\n\n\"I have to go,\" she said, voice stiff. \"I'll call you later.\"\n\nShe hung up the phone, staring at it like it had personally offended her. She could almost hear her daughter's thoughts, could see the disappointed shake of her head. But she refused to dwell on it. She had work to do, a canvas waiting for her touch.\n\nShe picked up her brush, dipping it into the paint with renewed vigor. This time, there was no trembling in her hand. There was only determination. And if anyone didn't like it, well...they could just mind their own business."
