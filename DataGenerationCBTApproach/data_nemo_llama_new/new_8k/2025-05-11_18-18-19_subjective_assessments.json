The project had been his passion for months, but now it lay abandoned, a testament to his frustration and fatigue. Her husband had been struggling to find inspiration lately, and she'd grown tired of the constant criticism and disappointment.\n\nAs she gazed upon the tangled mess, a faint scent of gasoline wafted through the air, transporting her back to the fire that had ravaged their childhood home. The memory of flames licking at the wooden beams, of the family's desperate scramble to escape, came flooding back. She felt the familiar knot of fear in her stomach, her breath catching as she turned away from the sculpture, unable to bear the painful reminder.<|eot_id|>",

Barely anyone showed up. And even when they did, they just... stared. No purchases, no commissions, nothing. Just silent, pitying looks that made me want to scream.\n\nSo what if he spent hours hunched over that sculpture, trying to find some 'hidden meaning' in the twisted metal?

The photo showed a group of people laughing and smiling together, their faces bathed in the warm glow of sunset.\n\nThe post was accompanied by a caption about how grateful they were for the simple joys in life \u2013 good food, great company, and endless sunsets.

The thought sent a shiver down his spine as he realized he'd been taking their relationship for granted, assuming it would always be there, unchanged and unchallenged.\n\nThe room fell silent around him, the only sound the soft hum of the refrigerator in the background. Time lost all meaning as he sat there, lost in the depths of his own regret.<|eot_id|>",
