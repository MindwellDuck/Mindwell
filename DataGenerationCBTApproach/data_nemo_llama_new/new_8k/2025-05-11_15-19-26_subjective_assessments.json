He felt a sudden surge of anger as he noticed how carefree she looked, oblivious to the pain she had caused him.\n\nAs he approached the table, his eyes locked onto Rachel's, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. The woman beside her caught his eye, sensing the tension, but said nothing. The kids began to get up from their seats, sensing the awkwardness.\n\nRachel finally broke eye contact, smiling sweetly at him, but it only made him more seething. She started talking about her new boyfriend, someone who was'really great' and'made her happy.' The words cut deep, and he felt his jaw clenched tightly in his mouth.\n\nThe children excused themselves, leaving them alone once again. The silence between them grew thicker, heavy with unspoken resentment.<|eot_id|>",

Now, it seemed outdated, a reminder of a time when things were simpler.\n\nAs he gazed at the badge, memories flooded back \u2013 late-night stakeouts, high-speed chases, and the countless calls he'd responded to alone. His partner had left the force five years ago, taking their camaraderie and trust with them.\n\nThe radio crackled to life, interrupting his reverie. A call about a domestic dispute nearby. He sighed, feeling a familiar knot form in his stomach. This wasn't what he wanted to be doing tonight \u2013 dealing with angry couples and broken glass.\n\nWith a heavy hand, he closed the door to the car, the familiar creak echoing through the stillness.

Her smile was forced, her gaze distant. She was supposed to be safe, dammit. He'd sworn an oath.\n\nHis partner, now long gone from this life and the force, had always told him, \"You can't save them all, Mike.\" But that didn't mean he shouldn't try. It certainly didn't mean he should accept that things were as they are.\n\nHe slammed his fist on the desk, sending papers flying. \"Hell no,\" he muttered, picking up a photograph of the prime suspect. This wasn't how it was supposed to be. The evidence should have been clearer, the leads more plentiful, the outcome different. But life didn't play by his rules, did it?\n\nHe stood abruptly, grabbing his coat and hat. He'd make this right, damn it. Because that's what he should do, wasn't it? That's what a good cop would do. And Mike was still a good cop, despite everything.\n\nAs he stepped out into the rain, he could almost hear his partner's voice echoing in his mind, \"It's not about what you want, Mike.
