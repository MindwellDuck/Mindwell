The pungent aroma wafted through the kitchen, making her stomach turn.\n\nHer eyes met his apologetically, but he barely registered the concern etched on her face. Instead, he ambled over to the prep station, giving her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek before claiming the stool beside her.\n\nShe tried to focus on the dish ahead, but her attention kept drifting back to John's disheveled appearance. A few minutes later, he reached out and snagged a spoonful of sauce from her hand, bringing it to his lips without asking. She felt a surge of disgust at the thoughtlessness, her mind recoiling in distaste.<|eot_id|>",

Or is this all just some grand joke at my expense?* She thought bitterly, her thoughts spiraling. *I mean, look at him, lounging around like he owns the place.
