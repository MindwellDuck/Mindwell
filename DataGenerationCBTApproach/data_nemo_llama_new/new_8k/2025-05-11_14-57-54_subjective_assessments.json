Her mind wandered back to her ex-husband's words from their last argument: \"You'll never be able to make a living off your art.\" The doubt had been simmering beneath the surface ever since, but now it felt like a raging fire.\n\nAs she gazed at the painting, her thoughts drifted to all the times she'd put her own desires on hold \u2013 taking time off work to care for her mother, putting her own creative projects on the backburner to support her husband's career. And what had it gotten her? A divorce and a dwindling bank account.\n\nHer eyes fell upon the paint-splattered easel, its wooden slats worn smooth by years of use. She hadn't worked on a new piece in months, and the thought of facing another rejection letter from galleries made her stomach twist into knots. With a sigh, she let her gaze drop to the floor, the silence between her and the canvas feeling oppressive, heavy with unspoken expectations.<|eot_id|>",

She must have been trying to protect him from her fears.\n\nHe stood there, phone in hand, staring at the burnt remnants in the pan. It was as if he could see her disapproval, hear her silent reprimand. \"You should have been more careful,\" she would say, her voice echoing in his mind. But she wasn't here to say it aloud. She was at the hospital, alone.\n\nHe felt a pang of guilt, sharp and sudden like a knife's edge. He should be there with her, not stuck here in this kitchen, surrounded by the ghosts of old arguments. But what if she needed him here instead?

I can't see past this godforsaken hole in my chest!\" His voice echoed off the bare walls, but there was no answer, only the mocking silence of a house that once knew love and now only knew loss.\n\nHe picked up another photograph, his eyes zeroing in on her smile. \"You promised,\" he whispered, his voice trembling with anger and sorrow. \"You promised we'd grow old together.\" He threw the photo down, watching as it spun across the floor like a drunken top before coming to rest face down, her smile hidden from view.\n\nHe couldn't see the memories they'd made, the love they'd shared, the life they'd built together. All he could see was the gaping chasm of her absence, and it consumed his every thought, his every breath. The whole picture? It didn't exist for him, not anymore.
