The woman felt a twinge of discomfort as she watched Karen excitedly share details about the trip, including the specific hotel they'd booked and the champagne toast they'd have planned.\n\nJust then, the store manager approached them, announcing that the company was offering a 'Diamond Anniversary' promotion, featuring luxurious gifts and exclusive discounts for couples celebrating their milestone years together. The woman's eyes widened slightly as she felt a pang of embarrassment, realizing how many years she'd been out of a relationship, and how far behind she seemed compared to her colleagues who were all still coupled up. She quickly looked away, focusing on rearranging the merchandise nearby.<|eot_id|>",
