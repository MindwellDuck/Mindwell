The radio crackled to life, and a call came in \u2013 another domestic violence case, the fifth this week. He rubbed the fatigue from his eyes, feeling the weight of the job bearing down on him.\n\nAs he listened to the dispatcher's calm voice guiding him through the situation, he couldn't shake the image of his own wife's bruises from last night's argument. She'd been mad about something trivial \u2013 a stupid mistake on his part \u2013 but it had escalated quickly. Now her arms were swollen, and she was too scared to leave the house.\n\nThe officer's gut twisted as he watched two more officers arrive at the scene. They expertly handled the situation, but it only made him feel like a failure. Why couldn't he protect her? What if he wasn't doing enough?\n\nA name flashed on his screen: John Smith \u2013 another man who thought he could control the woman he loved. The officer's hand instinctively went to his gun, his finger tightening around the grip. For a moment, he forgot where he was, what he was doing. All he saw was the other man, standing there, thinking he owned the place.<|eot_id|>",

The house looked like any other on the quiet suburban street, but to him, it might as well have been a fortress of hate. His heart pounded in his chest like a drumbeat, echoing the anger that surged through his veins.\n\nHe could see them now, two figures moving behind the curtains \u2013 John and his wife, likely huddled together in some sick display of unity. The officer's grip tightened on the steering wheel, knuckles turning white. He knew he should wait for backup, but every fiber of his being screamed at him to charge in, to put an end to this once and for all.\n\nHis mind supplied images of bruises blooming like twisted flowers on skin, of terrified eyes darting between the door and the phone. He saw John's hands, large and rough, closing around a delicate wrist, heard the crack of bone echoing through the empty house. His stomach churned at the thought, but his resolve hardened.\n\nHe stepped out of the car, hand resting on his gun, eyes locked onto the front door. This was it \u2013 he could feel it. Today, justice would be served, not just for John's wife, but for every woman who had ever been hurt by a man like him."

He was painfully aware of the stark contrast between himself and the young student. The boy's laughter was effortless, genuine, whereas his own seemed trapped somewhere deep within him, swallowed by the leaden weight in his stomach.\n\nHe could not help but compare their interactions, placing each one on an imaginary scale that tipped precariously in her favor. Her words were gold against his rusted iron, her laughter a symphony to his discordant hum. He felt himself shrinking under the scrutiny of his own mind, diminishing until he was little more than a speck of dust in their wake.\n\nYet, even as these thoughts churned within him, he knew better than to voice them aloud. He would not admit, could not bear to acknowledge, the poisonous tendrils of comparison that had taken root within him.
