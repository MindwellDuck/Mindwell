They sounded so enthusiastic, so... alive. *They don't understand,* she thought bitterly, *how can they, when they've never had their hearts ripped out, only to have them trampled on?*\n\nShe glanced at her own desk, piled high with notes and drafts of stories she'd worked tirelessly on. None of it mattered now. Not when her ex-husband was living his life freely, while hers felt like a prison cell. *What's the point?* She sighed internally, feeling the weight of despair settle heavier on her shoulders.\n\nEven the compliments from yesterday seemed hollow now. \"Great job on that profile,\" they'd said. But what did it matter when she couldn't even write a coherent sentence about her own heartache?
