The couple next to him ordered their lunch, laughing and chatting effortlessly, while he stood there, zoning out.\n\nThe doctor in front of him finally paid and moved aside, revealing a spot open at the counter. He stepped up, only to realize they were out of his favorite sandwich. A familiar ache started to build in his chest as he scanned the menu, his eyes drifting back to the empty space beside him.\n\nA woman with a bright smile and an air of confidence took the spot, ordering a salad with a quiet confidence that seemed almost arrogant. Her words cut through his reverie, and for a moment, he felt a pang of envy, wondering if he'd ever be able to find himself in that same place again.<|eot_id|>",
