The hospital was swarming with patients, and the ER was backed up with emergency cases. Her partner, Alex, was supposed to be home from his shift by now, but the traffic had been a nightmare.\n\nJust then, the charge nurse called out her name. She rushed to the room of a patient who'd been admitted overnight, only to discover they needed a specific medication that wasn't available yet due to a supply chain issue. The doctor was breathing down her neck, demanding an update on the patient's condition.\n\nAs she frantically searched for a solution, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was Alex, calling to check in. But when he answered, he heard the chaos in the background \u2013 beeping machines, muffled conversations, and the sound of sirens outside. He immediately sensed something was wrong, and his voice grew concerned.\n\nShe tried to reassure him it was fine, but her words felt hollow. She couldn't shake off the feeling of being overwhelmed, the weight of responsibility bearing down on her shoulders. The stress crept in like a cold mist, seeping into every pore.<|eot_id|>",

The line hummed with an unspoken tension. She could practically see him furrowing his brow, his mind racing with thoughts that were far beyond her control. How typical of him, she thought, always so quick to jump to conclusions.\n\n'You're worried,' she stated matter-of-factly, breaking the silence. 'I can hear it in your voice.' Her tone was light, almost mocking, as if daring him to deny it. She knew Alex too well; his pauses were like chapters in a book she'd long since memorized.\n\nAlex cleared his throat, taken aback by her assertion. 'Well... I mean, yes, I am concerned,' he conceded, his voice steady and calm. 'But I wasn't going to say anything about it.'\n\nShe smirked, despite the chaos around her. 'Oh, Alex,' she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. 'You never do.'\""
