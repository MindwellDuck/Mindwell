It had been six months since the accident, but the pain still lingered, a constant reminder of what he'd failed to protect.\n\nA knock at the door broke the silence, and he turned to see his partner, Rachel, standing in the doorway with a somber expression. \"We need to review the case files again,\" she said, her voice low.\n\nAs he gathered the files, his mind began to wander back to that fateful night. He replayed the sounds of sirens, the screech of tires, the cries for help. His eyes landed on a photo of himself and his wife, taken just before he left for his shift. They were smiling, happy, carefree.\n\nRachel cleared her throat, snapping him back to reality. \"We need to discuss the evidence,\" she said, handing him a file. As he took it, his fingers brushed against a piece of paper that had slipped out of the folder. A note, scribbled in haste, caught his eye: \"I love you, be careful.\"\n\nHis heart sank, and his face burned with shame. How could he have been so reckless? So selfish? The memory of his wife's words came flooding back, and he felt like he was drowning in guilt.<|eot_id|>",

He tossed the note back into the folder with a careless flick of his wrist, brushing off his wife's tender words as if they were merely trivial remnants of a past he'd rather forget. \"Let's get this over with,\" he sighed, opening the file to reveal the stark, black and white records of his perceived failure."
