It had been three months since the divorce, but the ache still lingered, like a dull throb beneath her ribcage. She'd always defined herself by her role as partner to her husband \u2013 police officer, team leader, protector. Now, she was just another single mom trying to make ends meet.\n\nAs she sifted through the reports, one file caught her eye \u2013 the case she'd been working on when it all fell apart. The memories came flooding back: the late nights, the endless cups of coffee, the desperate hope that they could fix it. But now, it was just a reminder of what she'd lost.\n\nShe felt a lump form in her throat as she read the latest update: the suspect was still out of custody, and the investigation was going nowhere. The numbers didn't add up; the evidence was circumstantial at best. She couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed him, that she'd let him down.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, her voice flat as she answered. \" dispatch.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was familiar, but the words cut like a knife: \"Officer, we've got another one downtown. Looks like a domestic. Possible victim's a minor.\"<|eot_id|>",

Her stomach churned at the thought of wading through it all again, the weight of failure pressing down on her like a physical force.\n\nShe gripped the edge of her desk, nails digging into the worn wood. \"I can't... I can't do this,\" she murmured, though no one was there to hear. The words felt heavy in her mouth, tasting of defeat and despair. She could feel it, the crushing inevitability of it all - another late night, another fruitless search for answers that seemed to slip through her fingers like sand.\n\nBut duty called, its voice harsh and unyielding. She straightened up, steeling herself against the storm she knew was coming. \"I'm on my way,\" she said, her tone now crisp and professional, a mask over the turmoil within.

The aroma of freshly baked bread, a tradition she started, wafted through the air, but it was tainted today, overshadowed by the stench of betrayal that had been lingering since morning.\n\nI caught my reflection in the mirror by the door - lines etched deeper around my eyes, cheeks hollower than usual.

It was therapeutic, this rhythm, this sound of metal against flesh. But today, it felt like more than just a routine. Today, it felt like retribution. Every chop was a silent 'I told you so,' every slice a whisper of 'You're not the only one who can cook.'\n\nThe sizzle of meat on the grill was music to my ears, a symphony of triumph. I was in charge here, not some critic hiding behind a pseudonym, not my ex-wife's new husband with his fancy reviews and even fancier fork. Today, I got to be the chef, the master of this kitchen, the one calling the shots.\n\nAs I plated the dish, I stepped back to admire it. The presentation was perfect, the colors vibrant, the aroma inviting. It was a work of art, a testament to my skill, my passion, my... obsession? No, not obsession. This was just... focus. Single-minded dedication to my craft. After all, they say, 'Don't let the bastards grind you down.' And I wasn't going to. Not today. Not ever.\n\nBut as I looked at the plate, all I could see were her words, scribbled across my forehead in that red lipstick she used to wear. \"The Worst Chef in Town.\" It was a distorted reflection, but it was mine.
