A customer approached, scanning the rows of discounted clothing. As she browsed, her eyes landed on a rack of children's dresses \u2013 ones she had bought for her niece's birthday party three years ago. The memory of smiling at the little girl, watching her twirl around in the colorful dress, washed over her like a wave.\n\nThe woman's gaze lingered on the dresses, and her fingers instinctively tightened around the stack of t-shirts. She felt a familiar ache in her chest, one that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. The customer finally picked out a dress, oblivious to the woman's distraction.

She thought back to the parties, the laughter, the lightness. Now, it was just... this. A clearance section, a job that once felt meaningful but now seemed trivial. She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself it wasn't so bad, but the ache in her chest disagreed. The dresses, once symbols of joy and celebration, now looked faded, their colors muted, much like her life had become.

The girl's eyes met hers, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a connection that went beyond teacher-student.\n\nThe girl's mother had called earlier that week, apologetic and tearful, explaining that they were struggling to make ends meet. The single mom was working two jobs, but it still wasn't enough. The girl's eyes spoke of a desperation that pierced through the teacher's numbness.\n\nThe bell rang, signaling the end of the period. As the students filed out, the girl lingered behind, her backpack slumped against the floor. She looked up, and the teacher saw the faintest glimmer of tears in those same eyes that had connected them moments before.\n\nWithout thinking, the teacher reached into her pocket and pulled out a crumpled dollar bill, which she pressed into the girl's hand. It was a paltry sum, but something about the look on the girl's face told her it might be enough to buy a sandwich, or a bus ticket home. As the girl took the money and quickly left the classroom, the teacher felt a pang in her chest, a reminder that some wounds never fully healed.<|eot_id|>",
