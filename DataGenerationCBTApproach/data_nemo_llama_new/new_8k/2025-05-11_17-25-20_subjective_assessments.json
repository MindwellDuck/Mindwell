All she could think about was him, standing beside her in this very kitchen, guiding her through the chaos of the restaurant.

His sister's wedding anniversary was being celebrated today, and he'd been asked to bring a gift \u2013 something thoughtful, something personal.\n\nAs he scanned the table, his eyes landed on a gleaming silver photo frame, its surface etched with intricate engravings. He felt a pang in his chest, but it wasn't nostalgia. It wasn't even sadness. It was something else entirely \u2013 a seething resentment that had been building for years.\n\nWhy did they still keep her memory alive? Why did they still celebrate their love, as if she were still among them? The silence between them grew thicker, more oppressive, as he reached for the glass of wine at his elbow.\n\nHis eyes met those of the young bride, her smile radiant, her laughter infectious. And for a moment, he saw himself \u2013 30 years ago, full of hope and promise. Now, he was just a relic of the past, a reminder of what could never be again.\n\nThe room seemed to spin around him, the colors bleeding together in a mad dance. He took a step back, his hand grasping for the edge of the table as if it were a lifeline. But it was too late. The words had already spilled out of him, a bitter laugh that cut through the room like a knife.<|eot_id|>",
