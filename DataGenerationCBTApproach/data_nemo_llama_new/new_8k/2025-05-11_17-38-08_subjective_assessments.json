The barista looked up at him apologetically as she tried to discreetly clean the stain. \n\nJust then, one of his senior residents walked by, took one glance at his coat, and let out a snicker. A few other doctors in the area followed suit, their chuckles growing louder as they took in the sight of the coffee-stained coat. He felt a flush rise to his cheeks as he hastily tried to brush off the stain, his eyes darting around the room in embarrassment.\n\nThe resident who had first spoken up cleared his throat and said, \"Well, I guess someone needs a refill.\" The group erupted into laughter again, and this time, even the barista cracked a smile. He quickly grabbed his coffee and made a hasty exit, feeling like he'd just been publicly humiliated.<|eot_id|>",
