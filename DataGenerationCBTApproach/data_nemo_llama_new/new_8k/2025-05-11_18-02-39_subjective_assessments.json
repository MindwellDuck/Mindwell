As he began to grade papers, his eyes wandered to the family photo on the teacher's desk \u2013 him, his ex-wife, and their two grown children, smiling and happy. A sudden pang hit as he thought about the dinner invitation he'd received from his son that evening.\n\nAs he continued grading, his gaze drifted to a new student's file on the computer, a bright-eyed young girl who had recently joined the class. She was sitting in the back, quietly observing her peers, but something caught his attention \u2013 a small silver necklace with a tiny charm in the shape of a heart, similar to the one his daughter used to wear when they were close.\n\nThe image lingered, and for a fleeting moment, he felt a familiar knot in his stomach. The room seemed quieter, the shadows cast by the afternoon sun growing longer and more ominous. His fingers tightened around the pen, the scratching sound echoing through the silence like a warning.<|eot_id|>",

They'd informed him that due to budget cuts, his department would be merging with another, effectively ending his 30-year teaching career. A wave of numbness washed over him, followed by a dull ache in his chest.\n\nThe sound of his own footsteps echoed through the silence as he moved to collect the scattered papers from his desk.

He couldn't help but think of his wife, waiting for him at home, unaware of the weight crushing his heart.\n\nThe lock clicked into place behind him, signaling the end of another day at the only job he'd ever known.
