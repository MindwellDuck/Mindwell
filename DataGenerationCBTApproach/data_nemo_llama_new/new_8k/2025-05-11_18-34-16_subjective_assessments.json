The aroma filled the kitchen, transporting him back to his first job as a line cook in a small bistro. He remembered the owner, Marcel, yelling at him for not adding enough seasoning, making him feel like a failure.\n\nJust then, his sous chef, Emma, walked in and began tasting the sauce. Her eyes widened, and she muttered under her breath, \"Not enough salt.\" The words struck a chord, and he felt a familiar pang in his chest. He quickly added more salt, trying to cover up the taste, but it was too late. Emma had already made her decision, and the dish would need to be reworked.\n\nAs he watched her walk out of the kitchen, he couldn't help but think about how things used to be. How Marcel used to trust him, and Emma used to respect his creativity. Now, they both seemed to have lost their way, and he was left feeling like a substitute for someone he once was. The onions, which had been so tender just moments before, now stung his eyes, and he felt a bitter taste in his mouth.<|eot_id|>",

I stirred in more salt, watching as it slowly dissolved into the once-perfect sauce.
