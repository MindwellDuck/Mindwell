A faded picture of herself and her late husband, smiling together on their wedding day, gazed back. She hadn't looked at this particular snapshot in years.\n\nAs she flipped through the pages, memories long suppressed began to resurface. The laughter, the quiet moments, the arguments \u2013 all came flooding back. Her eyes landed on a page filled with notes from her husband, detailing his plans to help her launch her career as a software engineer. He had been her rock, supporting her every step of the way, until...\n\nHer hand hesitated over the next photo, one of her children's graduations. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she recalled the day he wasn't there to share it with them. His absence still lingered, a constant reminder of what could have been.\n\nThe room fell silent, except for the soft ticking of the clock on the wall. She felt the weight of her regret, the knowledge that she had continued to work without him, leaving him to care for their children alone. The silence stretched out, punctuated only by her ragged breathing.<|eot_id|>",
