He'd tried to fill it with every creative outlet imaginable, but the void still lingered. A faint scent of turpentine wafted up, transporting him back to his late wife's studio, where they'd spent countless hours exploring their shared passion.\n\nThe sound of footsteps outside his studio door broke the spell.

But inside, the silence between them grew thick, like the layer of dried paint clogging the bristles on his brush.<|eot_id|>",
