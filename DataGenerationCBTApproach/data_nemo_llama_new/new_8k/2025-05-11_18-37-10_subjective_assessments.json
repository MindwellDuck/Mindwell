Instead, he spotted their son-in-law, sipping coffee with their daughter by his side. The son-in-law caught his eye and flashed a charming grin, and the doctor felt a sudden pang of annoyance.\n\nAs he waited in line to order, he noticed the son-in-law effortlessly regaling their daughter with stories of his latest golf game, laughing at her giggles. The doctor's mind began to wander back to all the times he'd spent years providing top-notch care, only to see his family members take his expertise for granted.\n\nWhen it was his turn to order, the doctor gruffly asked for his usual cup of tea, barely making eye contact with the cashier. As he took a seat at a nearby table, he couldn't help but notice the son-in-law's impressive watch, a gift from his own father, which the younger man had no doubt acquired on one of his many business trips. A flicker of spite ignited within him, fueled by feelings of resentment and a deep-seated sense of being overlooked.<|eot_id|>",

Yet here I was, reduced to a mere observer in my own family, while he\u2014the interloper\u2014held court. It was as if the universe had conspired to place him on a pedestal, casting me in his shadow.\n\nAs I sat there, gripping my tepid tea, I couldn't help but feel a bitter taste rise in my throat. It wasn't jealousy, no; it was...what was it? Resentment, perhaps? No, that wasn't quite right either. It was something more profound, something older and deeper\u2014a sense of being overlooked, of being diminished in the presence of his...his what? His youth? His wealth?
