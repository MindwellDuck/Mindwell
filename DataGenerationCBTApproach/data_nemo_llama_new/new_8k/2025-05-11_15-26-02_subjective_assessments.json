He sipped his cold coffee, the bitter taste a harsh reminder of another lonely night ahead.\n\nAs he worked, his gaze drifted out the window to the park across the street, where couples strolled hand-in-hand and laughter echoed through the air. A group of friends emerged from a nearby caf\u00e9, their chatter and clinking glasses a stark contrast to the silence in his apartment.\n\nA notification on his phone caught his attention \u2013 a message from his mother, checking in for what felt like the hundredth time this week. The same words she always said: \"Just thinking about you.\" But it wasn't the same anymore. She'd lost her partner a year ago, too, and now they were both alone, trying to navigate this new reality.\n\nThe cursor blinked, taunting him, as he struggled to make progress on the project deadline looming over him. His mind began to wander to all the things he wished he could do instead \u2013 travel, play music, simply have someone to share a laugh with. But those weren't options tonight.

As if that's enough to fill this emptiness.\" His eyes flicked back to the blinking cursor, a scowl forming on his face. \"Work won't wait for me to wallow in self-pity,\" he snapped, turning away from the window. \"But it certainly doesn't care about my feelings either.\" He began typing forcefully, each keystroke a testament to his resentment. \"No, none of this counts,\" he spat, gesturing vaguely at the scene outside and the message on his phone. \"It's all just noise, while I'm stuck here, alone with this... this silence.\" His voice caught on the last word, but he refused to acknowledge the emotion, plunging back into his work with renewed vigor, determined to prove that nothing could touch him tonight."
