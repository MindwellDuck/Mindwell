He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd missed something crucial, that he'd let someone down. As he turned away from the window, his eyes caught sight of a small, almost imperceptible tremble in Susan's hand as she stirred the pot.\n\nIt was a tiny movement, one that went unnoticed by most people, but to him, it was like a punch to the gut.

It's just the stirring.\" But he couldn't shake off the feeling that she was hiding something. He'd seen that tremor before, hadn't he? In the report from yesterday, the teller who'd been 'calm as a cucumber', or so they'd said. But he knew better.\n\nHe paced around the kitchen island, his eyes darting between her face and the trembling hand. \"You can tell me if something's wrong,\" he pressed, his voice rising slightly. He could see it now, clear as day \u2013 that tremor was fear. Fear of what? Of him? Or of something she wasn't telling him?\n\nHis mind raced, filling in the blanks with grim scenarios. She'd been quiet all evening, hadn't she? And she'd avoided looking at him... Was this about the call today? Had she heard something he hadn't? His jaw clenched, his hands balling into fists. He was so close to unraveling it all, yet she seemed determined to keep him in the dark.\n\nHe felt a familiar frustration building within him. He'd seen this before \u2013 people hiding behind lies and half-truths. But not Susan. Not here, in their home. His eyes bored into hers, demanding an explanation, an admission. Anything but this silence that screamed louder than words ever could."

You'd think they were discussing the bloody Nobel Prize, not just some chat about Johnny's latest math score. And here I am, stuck in the past with my lukewarm coffee and colder memories of little Emily's first day at school. That was a lifetime ago.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thompson,\" one of them piped up, \"you must have some great stories to share!\" I could feel their pitying gazes, like a pack of hyenas waiting for the old lion to admit defeat.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" I began, my voice dripping with sarcasm, \"back in my day, we didn't need parents breathing down our necks. We just taught the kids and sent them on their way.\" I glanced around, daring them to challenge me.\n\nBut they just nodded along, like a bunch of damn bobbleheads. I suppose they think they're doing me a favor, including me in their little circle. But they don't understand. They can't understand. It's not their fault, though. None of this is their fault. It's just... it's just the way things are now.\n\nI sighed, looking back down at my coffee cup. \"Another time,\" I murmured, as if anyone had asked. But no one did. No one ever does anymore."
