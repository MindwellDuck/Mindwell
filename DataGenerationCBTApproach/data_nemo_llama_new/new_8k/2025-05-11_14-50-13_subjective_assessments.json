The restaurant was already booked solid, and the pressure to deliver perfect dishes was suffocating him. As he began to chop the onions, the pungent smell wafted up, transporting him back to his childhood, where his mother's tears had been the only accompaniment to her furious yelling whenever he'd cut himself while cooking.\n\nJust as he started to chop the garlic, his phone buzzed with a text from his ex-wife, reminding him about their scheduled court hearing next week. The mention of'reaching a settlement' only made his anxiety spike, and he felt the familiar knot in his stomach tighten. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of being trapped, but the tension lingered, making it hard for him to focus on the sizzling pans and the diners waiting to be fed.<|eot_id|>",

He ignored it, but the knot in his stomach tightened a little more. What if the settlement isn't fair? What if I lose everything? His mind raced through worst-case scenarios, each one making him feel smaller, trapped.\n\nHe took a deep breath, trying to center himself. But the 'what ifs' kept coming, like waves crashing against a shore. What if I can't handle the pressure tonight? What if I mess up and ruin everything?\n\nHe could feel his anxiety climbing, like bile rising in his throat. He pushed it down, focusing on the rhythm of chopping. Left, right. Left, right. But the 'what ifs' lingered, shadows at the edge of his mind, waiting for him to let his guard down.\n\nAs he added the garlic to the pan, he caught sight of his reflection in the window. The face staring back at him looked tired, worried. He sighed internally, turning away from the glass. \"Just get through tonight,\" he whispered to himself, as if saying it aloud would make it true. But even as he spoke, another 'what if' wormed its way into his mind, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting just around the corner, ready to swallow him whole."
