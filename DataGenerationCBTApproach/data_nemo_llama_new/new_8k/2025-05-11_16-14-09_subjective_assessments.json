It had been two years since she'd left the job that had defined her for nearly a decade, but the memories still lingered \u2013 the late nights, the endless meetings, and the sense of camaraderie that had felt like home.\n\nAs she gazed out at the vacant spaces where colleagues once parked their cars, she couldn't help but notice the small notes stuck to the windows of the departing employees' desks. Handwritten reminders of birthdays, anniversaries, and even the occasional inside joke. The ones from her own team were especially poignant \u2013 a crude drawing of a cat wearing a tutu, captioned \"Don't forget our foosball championships.\"\n\nA pang of loneliness hit her as she realized she was the only one who hadn't updated those notes. She'd tried to stay connected with some of her old colleagues through social media, but it wasn't the same as being there in person, sharing laughter and stories around the watercooler.\n\nThe silence of her apartment, broken only by the hum of the refrigerator, seemed to close in around her as she wondered what it would be like to have someone to share these everyday moments with again.<|eot_id|>",

The parking lot outside stretched emptily before her, like an endless abyss mirroring her own barren existence. Each vacant space seemed to whisper tales of departed camaraderie, their echoes resonating within her empty apartment.\n\nHer gaze fell upon the remnants of their shared past: notes stuck haphazardly on windowsills, now faded and yellowed with age. Reminders of birthdays celebrated together, anniversaries marked by collective laughter. And there, amidst the clutter of memories, a crude drawing of a cat in a tutu, a testament to their shared absurdity.\n\nThe pang of loneliness was acute, a physical ache that threatened to consume her. She felt it like a tangible force, closing in around her, suffocating her very existence. It was as if she could see the future unfolding before her eyes: an eternity of solitude, a never-ending torment. How would she bear it? How could she possibly survive this desolation?\n\nHer breath hitched in her throat as she imagined the crushing weight of each passing day, the endless parade of emptiness stretching out before her like an infinite, unyielding prison. She felt it already, the insidious tendrils of despair reaching for her, eager to drag her under into their cold embrace.\n\nBut no, she wouldn't succumb. Not yet. Not ever. For even in the face of such overwhelming solitude, she would hold onto hope. She must. There was no other choice but to stand tall against the storm, to weather the tempest until it passed."

The memory was still fresh, but now it felt like a cruel joke. She thought about how she'd sacrificed countless hours, sleepless nights, and financial stability to keep her practice afloat after her divorce.\n\nHer gaze narrowed as she read the amount due: $15,000. Fifteen thousand dollars, all because she couldn't pay the bills on time. A wave of anger washed over her, followed by a crushing sense of helplessness.

As if she hadn't already done so, nestled comfortably within our life together. How dare she presume to know what I thought, what I felt? Did she not see the love, the dedication, the plans we'd made? Or perhaps she did, and chose to discard them like yesterday's news. Either way, her mind was hers alone, untouchable, unknowable. And yet, she expected me to understand, to accept her whims as valid excuses for leaving. I suppose that's the irony of it all - while she claimed to need space to find herself, she never stopped to consider that I might have been there already, waiting.\""
