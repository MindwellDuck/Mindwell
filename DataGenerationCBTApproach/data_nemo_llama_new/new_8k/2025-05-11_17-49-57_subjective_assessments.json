She screamed for help, but her cries were drowned out by the sound of shattering glass and crunching metal.\n\nThe officer beside her radioed for backup, but it would take at least five minutes to arrive. As they waited, the mother continued to beg for mercy, her eyes wide with terror. But the attacker didn't seem to care \u2013 he was too busy smashing a lamp over her head.\n\nThe officer's phone buzzed, breaking the silence. It was dispatch, telling them the backup unit was running late due to a separate incident elsewhere in the city. The officer's gut twisted with anxiety as she realized how long they'd have to keep the woman alone with this violent man.<|eot_id|>",
