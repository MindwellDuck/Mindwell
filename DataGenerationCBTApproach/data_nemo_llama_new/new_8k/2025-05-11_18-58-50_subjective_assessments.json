His eyes wandered to a shelf where he had carefully placed a stack of old photographs \u2013 pictures of their children, taken on family vacations over the years. As he gently ran his fingers over the faded edges, memories long buried began to resurface.\n\nA faint smell of fresh-cut grass wafted through the air, transporting him back to summer afternoons spent playing catch with his kids in the backyard. He remembered the way his wife used to laugh at the sight of his clumsy throws, her eyes sparkling with amusement. The ache in his chest intensified as he recalled the countless times she'd patiently helped the kids with their homework, always finding time to offer words of encouragement and support.\n\nHis gaze drifted to a small notebook hidden among the boxes. It was filled with notes he'd written to himself during those difficult months after their divorce \u2013 promises he never kept, things he wished he could say but never mustered the courage. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he realized how little he'd done to be there for his family during that tumultuous period.<|eot_id|>",

To punish himself with these echoes of what once was?\n\nThose photos, they shouldn't look so happy now. They were taken in happier times, sure, but why did they seem even brighter than before? It's not fair, not when she's gone and he's left here, drowning in \"should haves\" and \"could haves.\" He shouldn't be feeling this hollow, not after all these years.\n\nAnd the notebook... why did he keep it? Why didn't he burn it like he should have? Those promises, those words unsaid, they're a testament to his failure. He told himself he'd be stronger, better for them, but look at him now, tears pricking his eyes like some weakling. This isn't how it should be."
