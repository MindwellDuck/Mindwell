It was a typical Monday morning, but the grey sky seemed to match his mood perfectly. He'd been working non-stop since the previous Friday, chasing a tight deadline for a piece on the city's new transportation system.\n\nAs he turned back to his desk, he noticed the empty chair beside him \u2013 the one his wife always occupied when he came home from work, eager to hear about his day and share her own stories. But today, she wasn't there. A note on the kitchen table caught his eye: 'Out running errands. Back soon.'\n\nThe journalist's gaze drifted to the old photograph on his mantle, a faded picture of himself and his wife taken during their honeymoon. They were both younger then, full of life and laughter. Now, he couldn't remember the last time they'd had a proper conversation without the sound of the TV blaring in the background or the kids' arguing in the distance.\n\nA faint pang of sadness settled in the pit of his stomach as he mechanically began typing away on his computer, trying to shake off the feeling of emptiness that seemed to be growing with each passing day.<|eot_id|>",

The house was eerily silent without her presence, save for the distant ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway \u2013 an unwelcome metronome marking each second of her absence. He scoffed aloud, his breath misting slightly in the chill that seemed to have seeped into the very walls since she'd left.\n\n\"Out running errands,\" he muttered derisively, tossing her note onto the table with disdain. As if that was enough excuse for deserting him on this godforsaken Monday morning. He could feel the bile rising in his throat at the thought of her carefree jaunt around town while he was stuck here, drowning under paperwork.\n\nHe glared at their wedding photo, its cheerful smiles now mocking reminders of happier times \u2013 times that seemed like a distant dream amidst this desolate reality. Their laughter echoed hollowly through his mind, a cruel phantom sound that only served to deepen the crevasse of bitterness within him.\n\nHis eyes raked over the immaculate kitchen, the gleaming countertops, and the neatly arranged cabinets. All signs of her meticulousness, once endearing, now grated on his nerves like fingernails on chalkboard. He sneered at the pristine state of affairs \u2013 what good was cleanliness when it couldn't cleanse the stain of solitude from his life?\n\nEach stroke of the keyboard became a thunderous declaration of his resentment, echoing through the empty house like a battle cry against the injustice of it all. It was just another example of how she took him for granted, leaving him to languish in this miserable existence while she flitted about town like some carefree socialite.\n\nYet amidst this maelstrom of negativity, one tiny seedling of positivity dared to sprout: perhaps today would be the day he'd finally finish his article. But he crushed it underfoot before it could grow too large, scoffing at such foolish optimism. There was no room for hope in this storm of resentment. No, today would be just another Monday \u2013 grey, dreary, and thoroughly miserable."

He hadn't looked through it in months, but today, something about the dust motes dancing in the sunlight makes him pick it up. The familiar faces stare back \u2013 his children, now grown and moved away; his grandchildren, who would call him every week if they knew he was still here.\n\nA hand reaches out to adjust the oven dial, but he finds himself holding onto the counter instead. The heat from the stovetop seems to seep into his bones as he stands there, lost in memories of laughter and warmth.

She felt a familiar knot in her stomach as she stared blankly at the numbers on her screen, helpless to change the outcome.\n\nHer partner, John, walked into the room, noticed her expression, and asked if everything was okay.
