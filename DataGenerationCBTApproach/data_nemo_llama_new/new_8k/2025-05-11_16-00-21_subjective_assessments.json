She hadn't looked at it in years, but something about it brought back a flood of memories she thought were long buried.\n\nHer eyes wandered to the inscription on the frame \u2013 \"Forever Yours, John.\" Tears pricked at the corners as she remembered the promises they made to each other that day, the dreams they shared, and the life they built together. But now, all those years later, she couldn't help but feel a pang of regret. What had she sacrificed? Had she been too focused on her career to be the wife he deserved?\n\nThe silence in the room seemed to close in around her, and she felt the weight of unspoken words, unresolved conflicts, and missed opportunities. Her gaze drifted away from the photo, her mind lost in the what-ifs that haunted her still.<|eot_id|>",
