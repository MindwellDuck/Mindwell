How dare he? After all these years, all the promises whispered late at night, how could he betray their love so openly?\n\nShe felt the familiar heat of anger rising within her, a volcano about to erupt. She knew what that message meant, knew who it must be from. His eyes had lingered too long on the screen, his fingers hesitated before deleting. It was confirmation enough for her. There was no need for him to say anything, to try and explain away the evidence right in front of them.\n\nShe took a deep breath, steeling herself against the tremor in her voice. \"We were discussing how much I trust you,\" she said, each word sharp as a blade, cutting through the tension between them. She turned around slowly, facing him fully, ready for the fight that was to come."

He forced a nod, but couldn't shake off the feeling of being lost in a world without the one person who truly understood him. The sound of the hospital's morning chaos began to close in around him, and for a moment, he was back in that sterile room, holding his daughter's hand as she took her last breath.<|eot_id|>",
