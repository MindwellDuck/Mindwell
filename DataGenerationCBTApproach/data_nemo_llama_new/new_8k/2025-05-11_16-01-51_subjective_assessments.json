You've recently retired from your job, but the transition hasn't been easy. Today, while trying to set up your new laptop for an online class, you're experiencing technical difficulties. Your neighbor then calls asking for help with their gardening, despite knowing you're not keen on such tasks.\n\n---\n\n\"Damn this thing!\" I slammed my fist on the desk, glaring at the uncooperative cursor blinking back at me like it was laughing. \"Why can't anything just work for once?\" My heart felt heavy, like there was a stone sitting right in the middle of my chest. It's not fair, I thought. Retirement was supposed to be relaxing, not this constant struggle.\n\nThe phone rang, piercing through the silence and startling me. I picked it up, already knowing who it was. \"Hi, Martha,\" I sighed, bracing myself for her request. She wanted help with her garden again, as if I was some kind of gardening guru now that I had all this free time. As if!\n\n\"I don't know why you can't just hire someone to do it,\" I snapped, my voice harsher than intended. Martha paused, taken aback by my tone. \"I'm sorry, Martha,\" I softened, rubbing my temples. \"It's just... this stupid computer won't work and now this garden...\" I trailed off, feeling the weight of responsibility crush down on me.\n\nIt's not like I wanted to be so grumpy, but everyone expects so much from me. They don't understand how hard it is, being alone all day, trying to figure out new things like this computer nonsense. Why can't they just leave me alone? Or better yet, help me for once instead of always asking for favors?\n\nI hung up the phone, feeling even more overwhelmed than before. The cursor on the screen seemed to mock me, blinking away as if it was my fault it wasn't working right. Well, isn't that typical? Always my fault. Always something I have to fix. Why can't others just step up and take some responsibility too?\n\nI slumped back in my chair, the weight of the world on my shoulders. It's not fair, I thought again, but there was no one to listen, no one to blame but myself."
