We chat, or rather, she chats, going on about her new staff like they're incapable of tying their own shoes. I'm standing there, listening, feeling that old sting, but then it turns into this annoying heat in my chest. Like, seriously, what's next? Is she gonna tell me how to do my job too?\n\nI can just see it now - every day she'd find some new way to make me feel like a kid again. I'd show up for shifts, and it'd be, 'Oh, look who's here! The inexperienced one.' Or maybe she'd start picking apart everything I did, saying stuff like, 'You could've done that faster,' or 'That's not how we do things on my floor.'\n\nUgh, just thinking about it makes me want to call in sick tomorrow. It'd be a free-for-all then, wouldn't it? Her running the show, making everyone feel small. I can't deal with that every day. I just can't.\""

The employee listened patiently, taking notes as the woman's voice rose in anger.\n\nAs the conversation escalated, the employee's grip on the pen tightened, her knuckles whitening. She could feel her heart rate pick up, her palms growing sweaty beneath her uniform.\n\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I've reviewed your order and everything seems to be in order,\" she said, trying to remain calm.\n\nThe woman scoffed, her words dripping with venom. \"You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart. You're going to regret the day you ever crossed me.\"\n\nFor a moment, the employee felt a spark of recognition \u2013 a glimmer of understanding that this woman wasn't just some entitled customer, but someone who had been hurt before, deeply enough to make them want revenge.

She looked around at her colleagues, their heads bent over their desks, diligently working through their own calls.\n\nA pang of envy shot through her. They seemed so composed, so unaffected by the constant stream of complaints and abuses they had to endure daily. Their voices were calm, their mannerisms steady. She couldn't help but compare herself to them, finding herself lacking in their quiet efficiency.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. Her heart was still pounding from the heated exchange with the last customer. She could feel the familiar heat of embarrassment creeping up her neck, making her cheeks flush. She looked down at her hands, noting how her fingers were stained with ink from gripping her pen too tightly.\n\nShe sighed internally, wishing she could be more like her colleagues. They seemed to handle these situations with such ease, such grace. She, on the other hand, felt like a frazzled mess, her emotions always hanging by a thread whenever a call went awry.\n\nBut she knew better than to dwell on it. She had work to do, calls to take, customers to assist. She couldn't afford to compare herself with others, to place herself at a disadvantage.
