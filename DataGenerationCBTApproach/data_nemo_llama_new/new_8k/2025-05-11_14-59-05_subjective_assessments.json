Their instructor had given them a glowing review of their recent clinical rotation, praising their teamwork and dedication.\n\nAs he waited in line, his gaze lingered on the students' triumphant smiles, and he felt a pang of resentment towards those who had received recognition while he had struggled to keep up. When it was his turn to order, he gruffly asked for his usual coffee, his tone slightly sharper than necessary.\n\nOne of the students, a girl who had consistently gotten praise for her skills, caught his eye and smiled brightly as she handed him his coffee. He took the cup from her hand, his fingers brushing against hers, and for a moment, they locked gazes. The girl looked away, seemingly unaware of the tension, but he could feel his anger simmering just below the surface.\n\nAs he turned to leave, he knocked over his chair, spilling coffee all over the floor. The students gasped in unison, and one of them quickly jumped up to help clean the mess. The girl rushed over to assist, and as they worked together, he couldn't help but notice the way she moved with confidence and precision \u2013 a stark contrast to his own struggles in the program.\n\nThe cleanup effort seemed to drag on forever, and when it was finally over, the girl smiled sweetly at him and said, \"Don't worry, we've all been there.\" But he knew that she hadn't been there, not really. And in that moment, he felt a spark of vengeful anger ignite within him.<|eot_id|>",

His daily routine was now a monotonous ritual, a reminder of the emptiness that had been building inside him for months. \n\nAs he checked his phone, a notification from his ex-wife flashed on the screen - her birthday was today. He hadn't received a gift or even a card from her in years. The thought of another day spent alone, celebrating what could have been a special occasion with someone who no longer shared his life, felt like a knife twisting in his gut.\n\nThe coffee finally ready, he poured himself a cup and stood up, but his eyes drifted back to his phone. A message from his colleague, inviting him to lunch, suddenly seemed hollow. Another social engagement, another opportunity to pretend everything was fine when it wasn't.<|eot_id|>",

The cafe looks great \u2013 colorful banners, balloons bobbing gently in the breeze from the open door. But it's not enough, is it? I mean, who has a surprise party without a cake? I should've gotten one. I could've just grabbed something at that bakery downtown... but no, I had to try and make it myself. It looks like a toddler made it, with its lopsided frosting and burnt edges.\n\nI glance around the cafe again, taking in the empty tables, the quiet hum of the espresso machine. It's not the same without her here, laughing with everyone, her eyes lighting up when she sees all this. She won't even notice the decorations once she sees what I've done. She'll just think it's another one of my disasters.\n\nI sigh, leaning against the counter. Maybe this was a stupid idea. It's not like she cares anymore, anyway. She's probably too busy with her new friends to care about some old surprise party. I should just pack everything up and go home. No one will miss me... or notice if I'm even here.\n\nBut then I remember her face when we used to come here together \u2013 the way her eyes would sparkle, how she'd laugh at nothing at all. And suddenly, I don't care about the cake or the decorations or anything else. Because this is for her, and maybe it won't be perfect, but it's something. It's my way of saying 'I see you, even when you think no one does.' And isn't that what friends are for?"
