As she wandered through the aisles, he noticed the desperation in her eyes \u2013 the worn expression, the frayed edges of her sleeves.\n\nShe stopped in front of a display of children's toys, running her fingers over the plastic figures, but her gaze drifted away, uninterested. He watched as she pulled out her phone, scrolling through a list of messages, her brow furrowed in worry. She muttered something under her breath, and the child looked up at her, sensing unease.\n\nThe mother's eyes met his, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a silent understanding \u2013 two people drowning in their own struggles, struggling to keep afloat amidst the chaos of everyday life. The mother's eyes dropped back to the floor, and she turned to leave, leaving behind the faint scent of desperation and the echoes of unspoken fears.<|eot_id|>",

I saw the worry lines etched into her forehead, the way she clutched her phone as if it were a lifeline. She shouldn't be so stressed about this. Choosing a toy should be fun, not another chore on an endless list.\n\nShe looked at me, just for a moment, and I felt it too - that sinking feeling of responsibility, of things left undone, of expectations unmet. Her eyes were mirrors reflecting my own struggles back at me. It wasn't fair, none of it was. She should have been able to enjoy this, to find happiness in the simple act of selecting a gift for her child.\n\nBut she didn't. And that made it all feel so much heavier, so much more hopeless.

Funny how things change in an instant, isn't it?\n\nI sit here, surrounded by these piles of paper - reviews, they call them. As if anyone really knows what they're talking about. I mean, where were they when I was busting my ass to get this far? Not that they'd remember, even if they tried.\n\nLook at this one, \"lacks depth and clarity.\" What do they know about depth?

They didn't feel the weight of every experiment gone wrong, every hour lost in fruitless pursuit. No, that was all me.\n\nAnd now, here we are.

They're moving on without me, leaving me behind with nothing but these stupid reviews and their damned criticisms.\n\nI just... I don't understand how they can be so careless with words, so blind to the work that's gone into this. It's not like we're all just having a laugh here. This is my life's work on the line, for crying out loud! But do they care? No. They're too busy laughing and moving on.\n\nI can't help but feel like I'm stuck in some sort of loop, watching as everything I've known and loved slips away from me. It's not fair. It's just... it's not fair at all.\n\nBut what can you do? You take the criticism, you nod along, and you keep pushing forward. Because that's what we do, isn't it? We carry on, even when it feels like no one understands us. Even when it feels like everyone's laughing except for us.\n\nBecause who knows? Maybe tomorrow will be different.
