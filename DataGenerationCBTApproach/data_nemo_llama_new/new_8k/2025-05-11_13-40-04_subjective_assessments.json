It was like each envelope was another article waiting to be written, another deadline looming over me. I hadn't even opened them yet, but I could already feel the weight of it all. It's always like this, isn't it? The pile never ends.\n\nI've been working non-stop on this story for weeks now, and still, it feels like I'm barely making a dent. It's not just about meeting my deadline anymore; it's about proving to myself that I can do this, that I'm not losing my touch.\n\nAnd now, here's Linda asking me about lunch, reminding me of the life we used to have before work took over every waking moment. But how can I enjoy a meal when there are stacks upon stacks of unopened mail waiting for me? It's never just one thing with me, is it? It's always everything.\n\nThe hospital letter didn't help either. Just seeing that logo brought back memories of endless nights spent by my mother's bedside, the sterile smell of hospitals, and the gut-wrenching fear of losing someone you love. I can feel that anxiety creeping in again, threatening to consume me whole. It's like once a negative thought enters my mind, it never truly leaves.\n\nBut I have to push through. I've always been this way - driven, sometimes obsessive. And maybe that's why I'm good at what I do. But it doesn't make these feelings any easier to bear."
