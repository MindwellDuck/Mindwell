As they exchanged a few pleasantries before parting ways, the woman felt a familiar pang in her chest \u2013 one she'd grown accustomed to over the years, but still managed to catch off guard.<|eot_id|>",

The coworker's words dripped with satisfaction, and the nurse felt a pang of frustration, wondering why she herself was still struggling to make ends meet despite working long hours and sacrificing precious time with loved ones.\n\nAs Rachel excused herself to grab a cup of coffee, the nurse caught her eye, and for a fleeting moment, they locked gazes.

They were laughing and embracing, carefree. She felt a pang of regret wash over her, wondering why she hadn't pushed harder for the grant funding. What if she had? Would things be different now?\n\nThe door to the lab opened, and her partner walked in, dropping his bag onto the floor.

Laughter seemed a distant memory now, replaced by the hollow echo of what-ifs. The pang in her chest was not just regret, but confirmation that she had failed. She had let them down, let herself down. If only she had pushed harder, pleaded more fervently for the grant. Then perhaps their laughter wouldn't be frozen in time, a cruel mockery of her current state.\n\nThe lab door creaked open, but it sounded like the gates of hell to her ears. Her partner's voice was barely audible over the roar of self-recrimination in her mind. \"Everything okay?\" he asked, his words floating towards her like lifeboats she couldn't reach.
