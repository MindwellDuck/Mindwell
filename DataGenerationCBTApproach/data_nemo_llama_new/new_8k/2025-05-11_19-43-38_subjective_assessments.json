The leftovers were cold, congealed, and unappetizing \u2013 a stark contrast to the vibrant meal she usually brought home after a long day of work. As he pushed the plate away, memories of her helping him cook dinner a few weeks ago flooded his mind.\n\nShe had taken the time to chop fresh vegetables, saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, and season them with herbs, the aromas filling their small apartment and transporting him back to a time when they spent more quality time together. Now, it seemed like every evening was a solo affair.\n\nAs he gazed out the window, lost in thought, he noticed the neatly organized toolbox in the corner of the room, its contents meticulously maintained by his wife over the years. He remembered how she would often help him with minor repairs and projects around the house, now something he did himself.\n\nA faint scent of lavender wafted through the air, reminding him of the bouquet she used to make for him before bed. It was as if he was drowning in a sea of forgotten moments, each one a poignant reminder of what he felt was slipping further away. The silence between them grew thicker, suffocating him with an unsettling sense of abandonment.<|eot_id|>",
