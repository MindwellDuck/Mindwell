The sky outside was a dreary mimicry of my mood, grey and unyielding. My wife's voice echoed in my mind, \"We can't afford any new furniture.\" Those three words were a veritable sledgehammer against my aspirations for our child.\n\nI had spent countless hours poring over plans, envisioning every detail of the nursery down to the last inch of paint. And yet, here I was, facing an insurmountable obstacle - or so it seemed. The hum of the refrigerators behind me felt like a mocking chorus, underscoring my failure to provide for my unborn child.\n\nI could see her now, crying in her crib because we couldn't afford a proper bassinet. Her first birthday would be spent on a threadbare rug because I was too incompetent to secure our financial future. The thought of it made the lump in my throat grow larger, threatening to choke me.\n\nI glanced around the empty cafeteria, as if seeking solace from the impassive walls and vacant tables. But there was none to be found. Only the relentless hum of those refrigerators, reminding me of all that I had failed to achieve before our child even drew her first breath."
