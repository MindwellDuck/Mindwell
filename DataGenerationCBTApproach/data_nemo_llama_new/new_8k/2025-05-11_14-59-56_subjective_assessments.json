As she rang up the purchase, her partner, Alex, walked into the store, flashing his charming smile at her.\n\nFor a moment, their eyes locked, and she felt a familiar flutter in her chest. But then he noticed the look on her face and asked if everything was okay. She brushed it off, saying she was just tired from work.

Her mind wandered to all the times she'd forgotten important dates, missed social invitations, and struggled to keep up with Alex's increasingly demanding schedule.\n\nAs she handed him the receipt, their fingers touched briefly, and she felt a jolt of embarrassment.

The bell above the entrance jangled, signaling another customer's arrival, and she took a deep breath, trying to compose herself.
