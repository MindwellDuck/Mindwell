He mentioned he'd almost forgotten his lunch at home and asked if she wanted him to swing by the pharmacy to pick one up on the way back. She hesitated, feeling a knot form in her stomach as she considered how their travel plans might be affected. The storm warnings seemed to be intensifying, and now she was worried about whether they'd even make it out of town alive.<|eot_id|>",

A week-long retreat at a luxury resort, complete with expensive meals and activities designed to \"boost collaboration.\" The irony wasn't lost on him - he'd spent years building his career on solo projects and had never needed such exercises.\n\nAs he scrolled through the itinerary, his mind began to wander back to his divorce. His ex-wife's new partner, someone he'd never met but somehow knew better than himself. They were moving forward, starting anew, while he was stuck here, alone, and still trying to pay off their combined debts.\n\nThe email mentioned a \"team dinner\" at the resort, where they'd all be expected to mingle and get to know each other better. The phrase made his stomach twist into knots. He thought about calling in sick, but something stopped him. Maybe it was the sense of obligation, or maybe it was the realization that he couldn't afford to take time off anyway.\n\nHis eyes lingered on the email, the words blurring together as his anger simmered just below the surface.<|eot_id|>",

His eyes zeroed in on the word 'mandatory', his jaw clenching like a vice.\n\nHis mind latched onto the phrase 'luxury resort'. He'd been there once, with her. They'd sat by the pool, sipping overpriced cocktails, laughing about nothing. Now it was just another reminder of what he didn't have anymore.\n\nThe itinerary was a checklist of torture: archery, trust falls, group yoga. Each activity felt like a punch to the gut, highlighting everything he'd lost and everyone he wasn't - except for them. They were doing this stuff together now, weren't they?\n\nHis eyes snagged on the phrase 'team dinner'. He could see it already - laughter, clinking glasses, inside jokes. His stomach churned like he'd swallowed a nest of vipers. This was supposed to be his life too, dammit.\n\nHe could call in sick, couldn't he? But then he thought about the stack of paperwork on his desk and the bills piling up at home. No, he couldn't afford to miss this... even if it meant facing another goddamn 'team dinner'."

Nothing unusual out there - just Mrs. Thompson walking her poodle and Mr. Li watering his plants. Everything's fine, I told myself.
