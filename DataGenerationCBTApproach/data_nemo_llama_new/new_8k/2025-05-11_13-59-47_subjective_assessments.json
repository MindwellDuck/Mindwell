That pang of guilt was still there, gnawing at me like a relentless little beast.\n\nI couldn't help but think about her, standing there in line, fidgeting with that damn purse strap. She'd been impatient, hadn't she? Hell, if I hadn't taken so long counting out my change, she wouldn't have had to wait around. It was her fault for choosing such a busy time to shop.\n\nBut then again, maybe it was my fault for not noticing the date tattooed on my wrist. Maybe I should've been more aware, more attentive. But who could blame me? Life's been a whirlwind lately. Still, the guilt lingered, like an unwelcome houseguest.\n\nAs I walked to my car, I couldn't shake off this feeling that somehow, someway, it was all my fault.

But as I sat there in my car, engine running, heat blasting, I couldn't help but think that somehow, that woman's impatience had become my responsibility.

A text from Alex, her colleague, had arrived exactly thirty minutes ago \u2013 a casual invitation to grab lunch together after their shift ended. She had agreed, thinking it would be a nice way to unwind.\n\nAs she waited, a young nurse rushed past her, chatting animatedly with another colleague. The conversation was easy and playful, and for a moment, she felt a pang of envy. They seemed to have something effortless about their interactions \u2013 a camaraderie that came naturally to them.\n\nThe door swung open, and Alex walked in, flashing a warm smile.

But then he turned to greet his new friend, and she realized with a sinking feeling that this wasn't a social encounter at all \u2013 just a professional one.\n\nHe introduced her to the nurse, and they exchanged pleasantries, but the spark was gone. As Alex excused himself to grab a sandwich, she couldn't help but notice how easily he moved through the crowd, drawing people to him like a magnet. She took a step back, her mind replaying the countless times she'd imagined herself in his shoes, effortlessly charming those around her.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, she wondered if maybe, just maybe, she wasn't cut out for this whole doctor thing. Maybe she was meant to be someone else's patient, not their colleague. The thought sent a shiver down her spine as Alex approached, oblivious to the storm brewing inside her.<|eot_id|>",

She felt her heart flutter - old habits die hard. But then he veered off towards a friend, and just like that, she was forgotten again.\n\nShe could feel the familiar pang of rejection, even though rationally she knew it wasn't personal.

He hadn't been able to muster the energy to donate it, too caught up in his own grief.\n\nA gust of wind whipped through the deserted parking lot, sending the badge flapping against the car. For a moment, it seemed like the world had slowed down, and all he could see was the reflection of himself in the polished metal. The faintest glimmer of his wedding band peeked out from beneath the sleeve of his jacket.\n\nHis eyes drifted away from the badge, and he took a step forward, as if drawn by an unseen force. The sound of sirens pierced the air, transporting him back to nights spent patrolling these streets with his partner, Rachel. They'd laughed together during those long shifts, exchanged jokes about the worst cases they'd ever worked. Her voice echoed in his mind, 'We make a good team.'\n\nThe sirens grew louder, more insistent. A young officer's voice crackled over the radio, 'Respond to 345 Oak Street...possible domestic disturbance.' As he watched, a sleek black cruiser pulled into the parking lot, its lights flashing. A young officer stepped out, scanning the scene before turning toward him.\n\nTheir eyes met, and for an instant, he felt the familiar rush of adrenaline. But this time, there was no Rachel by his side. No one to share the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of a job well done. Just the weight of his regret, pressing down upon him like a physical force.<|eot_id|>",

It deserves better than to be used as a prop in some training exercise.\" His voice wavered slightly, mirroring the anxious flutter in his stomach. \"But what do I know?
