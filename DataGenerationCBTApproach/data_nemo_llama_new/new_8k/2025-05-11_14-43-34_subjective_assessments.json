A food critic from a prominent local magazine had stopped by earlier that day for a tasting. He had been expecting this visit, but still felt a twinge of nervousness.\n\nThe critic's eyes scanned the menu board above the counter, his expression unreadable. After a moment, he picked up a spoon and tasted one of the dishes. His face contorted in distaste, and he set the spoon down.\n\n\"This...this is not good,\" he said, his voice dripping with condescension. \"It's like you're trying to hide something.\"\n\nHe felt a flush rise to his cheeks as the critic continued, \"I mean, seriously, who serves overcooked vegetables?\"\n\nA group of diners nearby began to snicker, their attention drawn to him.

His heart pounded in his chest, each beat echoing the critical words already ringing in his ears: \"overcooked vegetables.\"\n\nHe tried to recall the hours he'd spent perfecting that recipe, the farm-fresh produce he'd sourced, but all he could focus on was that one flaw. It gnawed at him, growing larger and more prominent with each passing second. How had he not noticed it before? His mind whirled with self-doubt, drowning out any positive thoughts.\n\nThe critic's expression remained stoic, giving nothing away. But the chef didn't need a smile to know his dish was a failure. The silence was deafening, amplifying every tiny imperfection until it was all he could see. Even the sniggers from the nearby diners seemed like thunderous jeers in his mind.\n\nHis cheeks burned with humiliation as he realized that this one critique would overshadow everything else. His menu, his reputation, his very skill - it all paled in comparison to those two words: \"overcooked vegetables.\" He felt a surge of anger, but it was directed inward, towards himself for letting this happen."
