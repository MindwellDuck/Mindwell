As she replied to the resident's question, her mind began to wander back to the paperwork waiting for her after the shift, and how it would only add to the exhaustion already building inside her.<|eot_id|>",

It was almost too much to bear.\n\nI could see it now, crystal clear: every sleepless night I'd spent poring over patient charts, every early morning round I'd led while he was off schmoozing with donors. The trophy in his hands might as well have been a noose around my neck, tightening with each word of praise from the administrators.\n\nMy mind's eye painted a grim picture: me, stuck in this hospital for years to come, forever playing second fiddle to him.
