She spotted her partner, Alex, already seated at their usual table, scrolling through his phone. He caught her eye and smiled, but it felt forced, like he was trying to reassure her without actually being present.\n\nAs she approached, the line for the breakfast buffet began to move, and she found herself stuck behind a group of rowdy interns, loudly discussing their weekend plans. The noise and chaos were overwhelming, making her feel anxious and claustrophobic. She fidgeted with her gloves, feeling like she was about to lose it.\n\nAlex finally stood up, gathering his things, and headed towards her. But instead of taking her hand or asking how her day was going, he simply said, \"I've got to run, I have a meeting.\" And with that, he turned and left, leaving her standing alone in the crowded cafeteria, feeling more isolated than ever.<|eot_id|>",

But as the hours ticked by and the evening rush subsided, the silence between them grew thicker.\n\nHer phone buzzed with an incoming call from her mom, checking in about dinner plans. A pang of frustration shot through her chest \u2013 she hadn't eaten all day, too caught up in paperwork and patients' needs. As she listened to her mom's cheerful voice, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing everyone around her: the patients, her colleagues, even herself.

They exchanged pleasantries, and as they chatted, he couldn't help but think about how this person seemed to get all the recognition, while others struggled to make ends meet. His smile began to feel forced, and he quickly excused himself, citing a sudden phone call he needed to attend to.\n\nAs soon as he stepped out of the room, he let out a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.

Now someone else was getting the fucking pat on the back?\n\nIn walked Sarah, the offending colleague, completely clueless about the storm she'd stirred up. She started chatting away about some new campaign idea, like everything was hunky-dory. Jake forced a smile, but it felt as fake as those designer watches she loved to flaunt.\n\nHe could feel the resentment bubbling up inside him, like lava in a volcano. He thought about how Sarah always seemed to be in the spotlight, while he was stuck behind the fucking scenes, pulling all the strings. It wasn't fair. None of it was.\n\nJake cut the conversation short, claiming there was an important call he had to take. As soon as the door closed behind him, he let out a heavy sigh. His emotions were on fire, and they were telling him one thing loud and clear: life wasn't fucking fair. And until someone listened to his feelings, nothing would change.\n\n---"
