The comment was made with a sympathetic smile, but as she listened, she felt a familiar pang of resentment simmer beneath her polite laughter.\n\nAs she watched her coworker effortlessly sipping her juice box, they began discussing their upcoming staff meeting, where the topic of merit pay would likely come up. Her colleague seemed confident in her own abilities, expecting a raise without hesitation. A fleeting glance at the grade book in front of her caught her attention \u2013 another teacher had just received an average score from the same test she'd given weeks ago.\n\nHer hand hovered over the mouse, hesitating before clicking to save her work. As the cursor blinked, her gaze drifted out the window, where sunlight struggled to penetrate the grey clouds. She felt the weight of unspoken frustration, her mind racing with 'what ifs' about fairness and recognition for all her hard work.<|eot_id|>",

She thought about all the hours she had spent perfecting the recipe, the precision required to get it just right. Now, it seemed like none of that mattered.
