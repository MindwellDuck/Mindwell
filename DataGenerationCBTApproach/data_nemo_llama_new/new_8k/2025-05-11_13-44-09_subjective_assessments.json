Her brush hovered inches from the canvas, as if reluctant to add another stroke. The colors she'd chosen seemed dull now, the shapes uninteresting.\n\nHer phone buzzed with a text from her sister, inviting her to join their family for dinner tonight. A smile had crept onto her face as she read the message, but it quickly faltered. She hadn't seen them in months, not since... everything changed. The thought felt like a weight pressing down on her chest.\n\nAs she gazed out the window, watching people walk by, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing \u2013 a sense of purpose, maybe, or connection. Her art used to bring her joy, but lately, even that seemed hollow. She sighed, letting her head fall into her hands.<|eot_id|>",

Our chef's attention was drawn to her, too - she couldn't help but feel the woman was scrutinizing her cooking techniques. A faint sense of unease crept up her spine as the woman finally made her move, sidling up to the counter to ask about the evening's specials.\n\nThe conversation was polite, but the woman asked pointed questions about the preparation methods behind each dish. It felt almost... calculated. As they parted ways, the chef couldn't shake off the feeling that this woman was watching her, waiting for something - or someone. She quickened her pace, mentally preparing herself for the chaos that was about to ensue, but the memory of those piercing eyes lingered.<|eot_id|>",
