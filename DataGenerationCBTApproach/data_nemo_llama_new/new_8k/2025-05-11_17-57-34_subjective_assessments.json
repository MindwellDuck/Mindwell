As she began to organize them alphabetically, her mind wandered to the recent case of Mrs. Johnson, who had died after being misdiagnosed by another nurse.

Suddenly, the fluorescent lights above flickered and died, plunging the room into darkness. She froze, her heart racing as she waited for backup, wondering if anyone would ever find those patients who slipped through the cracks.<|eot_id|>",

He would always encourage her, telling her she was talented and that her paintings were beautiful.\n\nBut he's gone now, and so is the spark that drove her creativity.

She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and picked up her brush once more. \"This is merely a minor setback,\" she declared, resolutely ignoring the fact that every other canvas in the room seemed to be calling out to her, 'We're finished, we're beautiful, why are you torturing yourself over this one?'
