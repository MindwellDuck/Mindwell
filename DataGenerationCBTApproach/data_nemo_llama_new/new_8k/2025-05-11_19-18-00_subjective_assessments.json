Then, she smiled again, this time at someone else, and he felt a pang in his chest, like a door had slammed shut.\n\nHe turned away, trying to shake off the feeling, but the chair creaked beneath him as he sat down, and the sound echoed through the silence like a scream. A group of orderlies wheeled by, their carts filled with equipment and patients' belongings, and he couldn't help but think of his wife's hospital bed, now empty except for the memories.<|eot_id|>",

Below it, her mother had doodled a simple drawing of a sun, accompanied by the phrase \"you shine so bright.\" The memory of those carefree days, when life was simpler, washed over her like a cold wave.\n\nThe silence of her apartment, broken only by the ticking clock, amplified every creak and groan of the old house.
