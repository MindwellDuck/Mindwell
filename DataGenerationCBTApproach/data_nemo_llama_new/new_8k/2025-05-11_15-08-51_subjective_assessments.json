Perhaps if I had pushed harder, networked more, or made my work more commercial, we wouldn't be in this situation. I've let my stubbornness and perfectionism get the better of me, and now it seems like everything is collecting dust - my art, my magazine subscription, even my spirit.\n\nI believe that if I could just get back into the swing of things, create some new pieces that resonate with buyers, we might be able to turn this situation around. But for now, I find myself paralyzed by self-doubt and the weight of responsibility I feel for our lackluster sales.\n\nPlease bear with me during this difficult period.
