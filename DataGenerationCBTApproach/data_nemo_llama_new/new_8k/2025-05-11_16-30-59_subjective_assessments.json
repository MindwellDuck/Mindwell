Her eyes landed on the police report from last night's call \u2013 a domestic dispute at a nearby apartment complex.\n\nAs she began to read through the details, her gaze wandered to a photo of herself and her ex-husband, taken on their wedding day. It had been two years since they'd split, but some things still lingered. She felt a pang in her stomach as she read about another woman's accusations, another shattered home.\n\nThe dispatcher interrupted her thoughts, asking for her input on the case. She hesitated, unsure if she was ready to re-enter the world of conflict resolution. A colleague noticed her unease and approached her desk. \"Hey, you okay? You seem a little off.\" Her response was automatic: \"Just need a coffee.\" The words felt hollow even to her own ears.<|eot_id|>",

And now, as she accepted the commendation, she couldn't shake off the feeling that someone else had deserved it more.\n\nAs she stepped down from the stage, she noticed him \u2013 standing in the back of the room, his arms crossed and a look of quiet satisfaction on his face. It was Jack, her partner of five years. They had worked together on countless cases, and he had always been there to support her. But tonight, he seemed distant, his eyes fixed on some point beyond hers.\n\nThe music started, and the crowd erupted into applause once again.

As they made their way through the throng of people, Jack stopped suddenly, his hand reaching out to brush against hers. For a moment, their fingers touched, and she felt a jolt of electricity run through her body.\n\nBut then he pulled away, his expression unreadable. \"I'll meet you outside,\" he said, his voice low and detached. Without another word, he turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving her standing alone, feeling lost and uncertain.<|eot_id|>",

Just look at the examples provided.\"\n\nHer eyebrow shot up. \"But Mr. Thompson, there's only one example here!
