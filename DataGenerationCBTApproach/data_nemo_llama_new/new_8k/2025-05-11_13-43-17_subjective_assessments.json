A nagging voice whispered in her head, reminding her of all the times she'd told herself they couldn't afford it, that it was just too much debt.\n\nThe sound of rustling paper drew her attention back to the bills, and she felt her face heat up as she read through the list of overdue payments.

He's probably stressing about the bills too, thinking I'm not doing enough. I can see it in his eyes, that look he gets when he's worried about money.\n\nI grab the coffee pot, but my hands are shaking. It's these damn bills, always lurking around the corner. I should've known better than to come here. He's probably been sitting at home, stewing over them all night.\n\nHe walks in, rubbing his eyes like he hasn't slept a wink. \"Hey, hon,\" he says, looking at me with those tired eyes. I know what he's thinking - 'Why didn't you bring the coffee?' But he doesn't say it. He never does. He just looks at me, and I can feel the disappointment radiating off him.\n\nI knock over that stupid pen container, and it's like a metaphor for my life right now - everything's falling apart. And I know he's thinking about the bills too, blaming himself for not making enough, blaming me for spending too much. Even though we never talk about it, I can feel it, hanging heavy in the air between us.\n\nI grab my bag, shoving the bills inside. I don't want him to see them, to know how much we're struggling. He'll just worry more. But he looks at me, and I can tell he knows. He always knows what I'm thinking, even when I don't say a word. It's like we're connected that way.\n\nI leave without saying anything else, feeling his gaze on my back the whole time. We're both thinking the same thing - this is too much. But we'll never admit it out loud. That's just not how we do things."

He hadn't come back to this store since then, but today, something compelled him to return to this spot, to relive the memories he thought he'd long buried.

Now, at 25, he was barely scraping by, teaching high school English on a salary that barely covered his rent. His divorce still stung, but it wasn't the reason he felt hopeless \u2013 it was the realization that his entire life was stuck in neutral, and he was running out of ways to get moving again.\n\nThe door to his classroom opened, and a group of chattering students poured in, completely unaware of the storm brewing inside their usually composed teacher. As they took their seats, he forced a weak smile onto his face, trying to hide the despair that threatened to consume him whole.
