He hadn't called her in months, and now she was struggling in math.\n\nHe remembered how proud he used to be of his accomplishments as a software engineer, but lately, it felt like a hollow title. His wife had left him after he'd made a mistake that cost their company millions.

Now, his daughter struggled because he wasn't there to guide her. A faint scratch on his hand caught his eye; he'd gotten it during that same argument.<|eot_id|>",

He couldn't see past them, couldn't look at the bigger picture or find a way out.\n\nHis daughter's report card was collecting dust on his desk, forgotten amidst the chaos in his head. He hadn't even glanced at it yet, too busy getting tangled up in those tiny details that seemed like everything and nothing all at once.\n\nHe kept staring at that scratch, like it held some fucking secret to fixing this shitstorm.

My mind raced with comparisons - his vivid shots vs my faded memories, his awards vs my mere mentions, his international exhibitions vs my local newspaper features. It seemed so unfair, so unjust that he should reap all these accolades while I was left in his dust.\n\nI found myself questioning his success, as if his mere existence was an affront to mine. \"Surely,\" I thought bitterly, \"his photos aren't really that good.\" But deep down, I knew that wasn't true. The truth stung even more - he was just better than me, and there was nothing unfair about it.
