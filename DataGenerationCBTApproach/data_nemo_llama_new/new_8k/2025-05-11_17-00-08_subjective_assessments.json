He remembered calling her mother, offering condolences, but never speaking to Emily again. Now, the absence felt like neglect, and the guilt began to creep in.\n\nThe silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the creaking of old wooden floorboards beneath his feet. He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd failed somehow, that he'd let down another student who needed guidance and support.
