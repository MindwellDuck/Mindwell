A woman in her late twenties, with a warm smile, effortlessly chatted with their department head as they refilled their cups. As she poured herself a steaming cup, she noticed the younger woman's gleaming new watch, a luxury brand she couldn't afford.\n\nThe conversation turned to weekend plans, and the younger doctor mentioned having tickets to a sold-out concert on Saturday night. The woman felt a pang of disappointment, wondering why she'd never been able to splurge on something like that. She glanced at her own worn sneakers and faded jeans, feeling like a perpetual outsider looking in.<|eot_id|>",

One student, however, caught her eye \u2013 a boy who had been consistently disrupting class and refusing to follow instructions.\n\nAs she started to lecture, he snickered at something another student said, making a face that seemed to deliberately mock her authority. She felt a familiar knot form in her stomach, but tried to push it aside, attributing it to frustration rather than anything more.\n\nBut then, as she handed out worksheets, he deliberately scribbled on his own paper, crossing out her name and drawing a crude, mocking smile next to hers. The room fell silent, all eyes on him, and she could feel the weight of their disapproval settling onto her shoulders.\n\nFor a moment, she was frozen, her anger simmering just below the surface. Then, with a quiet calmness that surprised even herself, she spoke up, her voice low but firm: \"I'd appreciate it if you could focus on your work.\" The classroom erupted into whispers and nervous laughter, but the boy just shrugged, his eyes glinting with a challenge that made her heart sink.<|eot_id|>",

Her eyes flicked to the photo frame on the windowsill, the smiling faces of her past life mocking her present paralysis.\n\n\"Had you not pushed me so hard,\" she whispered to his image, \"I would not be in this predicament.\" She took a deep breath, steeling herself for another failed attempt at capturing the vibrancy that once flowed freely from her brush. It was his fault, after all; his constant criticism had stifled her creativity, left her doubting every stroke.\n\nThe canvas remained untouched, its pristine white surface a testament to her inadequacy. She sighed, placing the brush down gently. \"I simply cannot do this without you,\" she admitted softly, her voice barely audible over the ticking clock. It was not her lack of talent or inspiration that held her back, but his absence. His responsibility, his fault.\n\nShe glanced at the clock, noting the late hour. \"He would have been home by now,\" she murmured, a faint smile playing on her lips. He always brought dinner home, even after long days at work. She could almost hear him laughing as he set the table, his eyes twinkling with pride at her latest masterpiece.\n\nBut he was gone, leaving her alone with her doubts and an unfinished canvas. And so, she blamed him for her sorrow, for her artistic block, for every negative feeling that plagued her. For it could not be her fault; she had loved him, supported him, created for him. No, the blame lay solely on his shoulders. Always had, always would.\n\nWith a sigh, she turned off the lights and left the room, leaving the canvas untouched in the darkness.
