Her eyes wandered to the sketchbook open on her easel, filled with rough drafts of a series exploring themes of identity and belonging \u2013 ideas she'd poured her heart into. A faint bruise above her left eyebrow, a souvenir from a particularly grueling critique session weeks prior, throbbed in time with her racing heartbeat.\n\nThe silence of her solo apartment felt oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the studio's fluorescent light overhead. She hadn't spoken to anyone all day, afraid of sharing her disappointment with someone else, even though her best friend had texted her hours ago asking how her submission went. The thought of facing her empty apartment, devoid of even the comforting presence of art supplies, made her feel hollow and alone.<|eot_id|>",

It was never him on the other end, only his friends or acquaintances calling to check up on her, their voices filled with sympathy that felt more like pity. She couldn't bear it, not again, not today. She'd told them all before, she didn't want to talk about it, didn't want their condolences or their stories of how he was always such a great guy.\n\nShe turned back to her painting, but the words from that long-forgotten conversation echoed in her mind, \"You'll paint again soon enough, my love.\" She'd believed him then, had clung onto his optimism like a lifeline. Now those words felt hollow, another thing taken from her along with him. Her hand shook as she pressed the brush to the canvas, the blue paint bleeding outwards in angry streaks that seemed to mock her, \"You'll never paint like this again,\" they whispered, and she found herself believing them."
