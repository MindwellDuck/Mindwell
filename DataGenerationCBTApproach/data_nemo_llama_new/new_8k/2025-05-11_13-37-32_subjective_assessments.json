The opportunity had slipped away, and now she was left wondering if she'd ever find a role as fulfilling as the one she'd almost had.\n\nAs the cursor blinked impatiently, she let out a soft sigh and rubbed her tired eyes, trying to shake off the nagging sense of regret that lingered, refusing to be silenced.<|eot_id|>",

Every time I see these listings, it's just a reminder of how I've messed up \u2013 again. I should have taken that chance with their graduate program, but no, I hesitated. Now, who knows if I'll ever find something this good again? It's not like I'm exactly 'Employee of the Year' material anyway.\n\nThe cursor blinks at me, mockingly, like it's waiting for some magical words to appear and make everything right.
