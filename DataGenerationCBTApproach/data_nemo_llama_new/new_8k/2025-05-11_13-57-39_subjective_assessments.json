He was new to the school, and she'd only met him once during orientation. As he turned to face her, their eyes locked, and for a moment, they just stared at each other.\n\nThe student, a boy from her class, looked away, embarrassed, while his friends snickered. The man's smile faltered, and he cleared his throat, breaking the silence. \"Just getting some coffee,\" he muttered, before turning back to his classmates.\n\nAs she watched him, a pang of unease settled in her stomach. She felt a sudden, irrational anger towards him \u2013 who was this guy, and why did everyone seem so comfortable around him?<|eot_id|>",

The way he'd smiled at that student, it was either genuine warmth or calculated manipulation. She couldn't imagine anyone being so effortlessly likable. Either everyone here was fooled by his act, or they were all conspiring against her, willingly drawn into his web.\n\nShe took a sip of her coffee, the bitterness mirroring her mood. He caught her eye again, and she looked away, annoyed at herself for feeling so irritated. It was either him or her, and she refused to be the one left out in the cold."
