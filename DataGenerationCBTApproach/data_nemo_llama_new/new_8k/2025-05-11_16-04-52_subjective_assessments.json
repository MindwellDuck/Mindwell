He hesitated, unsure of how to respond. As he fumbled with his wallet to pay, his phone slipped from his fingers and landed with a soft clatter on the counter.\n\nThe screen flickered to life, displaying a photo of himself taken years ago at a company party. His wife, smiling and laughing, stood beside him, her arm slung over his shoulder. He felt a flush rise to his cheeks as he realized everyone around him was staring. The barista's eyes widened slightly, and she quickly looked away, busying herself with another customer's order.<|eot_id|>",

Another piece, another opportunity to share her voice, slipping away from her grasp. Her mind began to wander to all the stories she'd never told, the angles she'd never explored, the sources she'd never gotten to. The cursor kept blinking, taunting her with its emptiness.\n\nShe let out a deep sigh, her eyes drifting toward the framed photograph on her desk \u2013 a picture of her mother, taken just before she passed away. A wave of grief washed over her, followed by the crushing realization that she might never write about the thing that mattered most to her anymore. The silence in the room seemed to close in around her, making it hard to breathe.<|eot_id|>",
