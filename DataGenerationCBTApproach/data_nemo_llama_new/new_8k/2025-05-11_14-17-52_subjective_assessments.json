A sudden email notification caught her eye \u2013 a social media post from an old high school acquaintance had gone viral, tagging her in a embarrassing story from their senior year. The caption read, 'Guess who thought it was okay to do keg stands at 16?' The photo showed her making a duck face, arms around friends, amidst a rowdy party crowd.\n\nHer eyes scanned the comments section, where strangers and acquaintances alike were poking fun at the picture. She felt a flush rise to her cheeks as she scrolled through the stream of snarky remarks and nostalgic laughter. Her phone buzzed with texts from colleagues asking about the article deadline, oblivious to her growing discomfort. As she hesitated, unsure how to respond to the embarrassment festering inside her, her editor walked by, nodding expectantly towards the screen.<|eot_id|>",

She was holding court near the pastry case, chatting with the head chef about the 'art' of making healthy desserts.\n\nA nurse in her late 30s, with a kind face and a worn expression, caught his eye and mouthed \"don't eat the muffins.\" But it was too late; Emily had already devoured two, leaving behind a trail of crumbs and a telltale smudge of blueberry jam on her shirt.
