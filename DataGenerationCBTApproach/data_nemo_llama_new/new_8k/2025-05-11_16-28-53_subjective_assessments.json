The words felt forced, like he was merely parroting the concerns of others.\n\nJust then, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his wife. They'd planned a quiet evening together tonight, a rare moment of respite from the chaos of their lives. He glanced at the screen, expecting a message of support or encouragement. Instead, she asked if he'd picked up milk on his way home.\n\nA pang of irritation hit him, and he felt his fingers tightening around the pen in his hand. Why did she need him to do this? Didn't she trust him to remember? A small, bitter voice in his head whispered that maybe she didn't trust him at all \u2013 that maybe she thought he was just going through the motions, pretending to be a partner when no one really knew what he was thinking.\n\nThe pen slipped from his grasp, clattering onto the floor as he stood up, his chair scraping against the hardwood. For a moment, he just stood there, frozen in frustration, the silence between him and his wife stretching out like a thin, gossamer thread.<|eot_id|>",

His editor had liked his latest piece, but something felt... off. He couldn't put his finger on it, but it was there, gnawing at him like a tiny, persistent rodent.\n\nHis phone buzzed on the desk beside him. A message from Sarah. He expected some words of encouragement, maybe a cute meme to lighten the mood. Instead, she asked if he'd remembered the milk.\n\nIrritation surged through him, swift and unexpected. It was just milk, for fuck's sake. Why couldn't she trust him with that? Didn't she know he had other things on his mind?\n\nHe felt a pang of guilt almost instantly. Sarah trusted him implicitly; she was the one who'd pushed him to pursue journalism when he'd been too afraid to take the leap. But right now, it felt like she didn't understand what he was going through. She couldn't see that he was trying, really trying, to be the journalist he'd always wanted to be.\n\nHe stood up abruptly, his chair screeching against the floorboards. The room felt suddenly claustrophobic, the air too thick to breathe. He needed space, needed to clear his head. Maybe then he could make sense of this... this feeling that something was wrong, that he wasn't good enough.\n\nAs he paced around the small apartment, Sarah's words echoed in his mind. It was just milk, he told himself again. But it didn't feel like 'just' anything. It felt like a symptom of something larger, something more profound. And that scared him."

It was still a fraction of what it used to be.\n\nAs the next customer approached, he felt a twinge of annoyance, which he quickly suppressed. But when the cashier asked him if he needed any help finding anything else, he found himself growling under his breath, 'No, I'm good.'

She must think he couldn't afford it anymore, that he was just another pathetic widower who couldn't hold onto the past.\n\nHe imagined her at home later, popping the DVD into her player, laughing as she remembered him standing there, empty-handed and defeated. She probably thought he'd snap at her if she offered it back, that he'd curse her for his misfortune. He could see it all so clearly, her thoughts written plainly on her face, even though she'd never spoken a word to him.\n\nHis breath caught in his throat, anger surging like bile. \"No,\" he snapped at the cashier, who jumped back as if burned.
