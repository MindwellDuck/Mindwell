She didn't need another distraction right now. Besides, what could she even say? \"Hey, honey, my class is turning into a goddamn riot again\"? Yeah, that would go over well.\n\nAs the noise level rose, so did her frustration. She felt like she was drowning in it, like it was closing in around her, threatening to consume her entirely.
