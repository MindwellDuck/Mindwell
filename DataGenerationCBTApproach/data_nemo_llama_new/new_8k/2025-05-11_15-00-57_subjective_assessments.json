A young nurse, barely out of training, sat beside her, wide-eyed and eager to please. As the discussion turned to staffing shortages, Rachel seamlessly took charge, directing the conversation with confidence.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman felt a pang of resentment towards Rachel's natural leadership abilities, which she once possessed herself before life's challenges had taken their toll. Her own efforts to re-enter the workforce after years of caring for her adult children now seemed inadequate by comparison. The contrast between Rachel's poise and her own fading sense of purpose stung, leaving her wondering if she'd ever regain her footing.<|eot_id|>",

She paused, the pencil hovering above the paper.\n\nAs she looked up, memories began to flood her mind: afternoons spent driving him home from school, helping him with his homework, and watching him grow into a confident young man.

She must be busy, he reasoned, probably lost in her thoughts or her work. But why hadn't she reminded him about the milk? She knew how often he forgot things these days.\n\nHis eyes darted to the counter where her laptop was open, the screen saver casting a soft glow on her half-finished coffee. He could almost see her rolling her eyes, muttering under her breath about his forgetfulness. But that wasn't like her, was it? She usually just sighed and said nothing.\n\nHe picked up her mug, swirling the dark liquid inside, trying to find answers in the depths of her cold coffee. Maybe she'd meant for him to get almond milk all along, but hadn't wanted to nag him about it. Yes, that must be it.

He would just wait until she noticed, he decided. She'd tell him if he'd forgotten something important, wouldn't she? Unless... unless she thought he didn't care enough to remember.\n\nHe shook his head slightly, as if trying to dislodge the thoughts that were starting to clump together like clouds before a storm. He shouldn't overthink it, he told himself. She was probably just preoccupied.

What if she thought he was being too pushy? Or what if she'd already forgotten about the almond milk and now he was reminding her of something she didn't want to remember?\n\nHe sighed, running a hand through his hair.
