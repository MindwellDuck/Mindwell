The woman felt a pang of jealousy \u2013 not because she wanted what the couple had, but because it seemed so... real.\n\nShe couldn't remember the last time she and her partner had done something like that. Sure, they'd been together for years, but who's counting? She scoffed inwardly at the thought of marking their anniversary with anything more than a passing \"Hey, happy anniversary\" over breakfast.\n\nAs Lisa leaned in to wish them a happy anniversary, the woman felt a bitter taste rise in her mouth. Happy indeed, she thought sourly. Her mind was already made up \u2013 their relationship was just going through a dry spell. Nothing worth celebrating there.\n\nShe didn't notice Lisa's concerned glance or the slight frown that followed her back as she moved to help another customer.
