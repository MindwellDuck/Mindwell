Now, every critique felt like a personal rejection.\n\nAs she dipped her brush into the paint, her eyes landed on a small, unassuming gallery poster on the wall \u2013 one she'd forgotten was there. It was from an upcoming exhibition featuring local artists. A woman who looked vaguely familiar smiled back at her, accompanied by a quote about finding inspiration in unexpected places. The image sent a pang through her chest, and for a moment, she wondered what would have happened if she'd met this artist when she was still part of a couple, still building a life together.<|eot_id|>",
