His mind wandered to the restaurant owner's comment earlier that day - \"We need something new, something that'll make us stand out from the competition.\" \n\nA faint memory of his ex-wife's words echoed in his head: \"You're never going to be able to run your own restaurant, you're too scared to take risks.\" He shook off the thought, but it lingered, making him feel like he wasn't good enough.\n\nAs he began to scribble down ideas, his hand hesitated over the pen. What if this dish wasn't innovative? What if it failed?
