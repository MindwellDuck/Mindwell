I immediately assumed something terrible must have happened - maybe she'd had a falling out with her boyfriend or perhaps she'd just gotten some awful news. Without even considering the possibility that it could be something trivial like a spam message or a mundane work email, I marched over to her, ready to offer comfort and support. \"Jane,\" I said, concern laced in my voice, \"What's wrong?\" She looked up, startled, then laughed softly. \"Oh, it's nothing really.
