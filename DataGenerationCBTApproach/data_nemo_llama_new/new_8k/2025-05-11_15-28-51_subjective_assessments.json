He let it slide initially, but when she attempted to pay with a credit card that was clearly declined, his irritation flared.\n\nThe cashier apologized profusely, calling for a manager, while the woman grew defensive, insisting she hadn't tried to pay with a declined card. He felt his jaw tighten, his mind racing with the injustice of being stuck behind this entitled customer, who seemed more concerned with saving face than actually resolving the issue.<|eot_id|>",
