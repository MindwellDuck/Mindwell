It had been three days since the patient's passing, and the weight of responsibility still lingered. The nurse's log showed he'd administered the wrong medication, causing a fatal allergic reaction.\n\nHis wife turned to him, her eyes searching for reassurance. \"How are you doing? You've been distant all day.\" He forced a weak smile, trying to deflect attention from his own guilt-ridden thoughts. \n\nAs they walked out of the hospital together, hand in hand, he couldn't shake off the memory of the beeping monitor and the look of desperation on the patient's face. A gentle tap on his shoulder broke the silence. A colleague handed him a sheet of paper with the latest patient statistics.\n\nThe numbers blurred together, but one caught his eye - a young mother who'd passed away due to a preventable medication error. His stomach dropped as he thought about the similarities between their stories. The sound of his wife's voice brought him back to reality, but the feeling of unease lingered, refusing to dissipate.<|eot_id|>",

He didn't need their pitying glances or smug smiles. *As if they're any better,* he thought, recalling all those times he'd seen other officers speed off, leaving him behind to deal with the paperwork.\n\nHis watch beeped, snapping him back to reality. *Shift's starting.* He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the irritation that was already beginning to claw at his throat. *Just another day in paradise,* he muttered under his breath, grabbing his radio and storming out of the break room.\n\n*Why does this always happen to me?* he thought as he slammed his locker shut, not bothering to notice the other officers filtering into the station, ready for their shift.
