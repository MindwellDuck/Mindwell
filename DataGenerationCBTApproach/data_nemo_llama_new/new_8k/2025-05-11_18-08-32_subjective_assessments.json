The school administration had just informed him that his beloved classroom would be merged with another, forcing him to share resources and compromise on lesson plans.\n\nAs he began to explain the changes, a young student raised her hand, asking why they couldn't keep their current room. He forced a smile, trying to placate her, but the seed of resentment had already been planted. A parent in the back of the room chimed in, loudly questioning the decision and accusing the administration of being heartless.\n\nThe teacher's eyes narrowed as he listened to the outburst. How dare they question his authority? Didn't they know who he was? The man who had dedicated his life to educating these children, who had given up precious time with his own family to make ends meet?\n\nThe anger simmered beneath the surface, waiting to boil over. His mind began to whirl with all the injustices he'd suffered \u2013 the divorce, the failed career moves, the constant struggle to make ends meet. And now, this. This affront to everything he held dear.\n\nFor a moment, he forgot about the students, the parents, and the administrative drone in front of him. All he could see was the face of the woman who had left him, who had walked away from their life together. The face that still haunted his dreams.\n\nHis voice rose, echoing off the walls. \"I've spent my entire career serving this community,\" he spat. \"And this is how I'm repaid?\" The room fell silent, the only sound the soft rustling of papers. The teacher's chest heaved with suppressed rage, his hands clenched into fists under the desk.<|eot_id|>",
