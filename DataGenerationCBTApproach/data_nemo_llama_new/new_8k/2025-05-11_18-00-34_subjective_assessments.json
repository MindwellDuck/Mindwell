The nurse had been assigned to care for this young woman after a tragic car accident left her with severe head injuries.\n\nAs she approached the bed, she noticed a faint bruise on the patient's cheekbone - a distinguishing feature from their previous medical records, which showed no such injury. A surge of anger and resentment welled up inside her as she realized someone must have deliberately inflicted this damage while the patient was under her care.\n\nThe nurse's gaze locked onto the chart, her fingers instinctively tightening around the pen as she scanned the notes for any mention of the incident. But there was nothing - no notation, no indication that anyone had even reported it. The silence seemed deafening, and the nurse felt a cold fury spreading through her veins as she wondered who could have committed such a heinous act, and why they hadn't been held accountable.<|eot_id|>",

You've always prided yourself on your meticulous care and attention to detail. Describe your thoughts and feelings as you notice an unfamiliar bruise on Patient 314's cheekbone during your morning rounds.\n\n**Text:**\n\nAs I approached Patient 314's bedside, my trained eyes immediately noticed something amiss - a faint but unmistakable bruise marring the smooth expanse of her cheekbone. My heart seemed to still in my chest as I took this in, my mind racing with questions. How could this happen under our watch? I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt, as if this was somehow my failure.\n\nI picked up her chart, my fingers automatically tightening around the pen as I scanned the pages for any mention of this injury. But there was nothing - no notation, no indication that anyone had even noticed it, let alone reported it. A sense of resentment began to simmer within me. How could they be so careless? So negligent?\n\nI felt a cold fury spreading through me as I wondered who could have done this, and why they hadn't been held accountable. This wasn't the first time something like this had happened on my watch, but each instance only served to reinforce my belief that I was losing my touch, becoming complacent in my old age.\n\nI decided then and there that I would not let this incident go unnoticed. I would find out who was responsible and ensure they were held accountable. After all, a mistake like this could cost someone their career, or worse, their life. And I couldn't allow that to happen on my watch, not again.\n\nBut for now, I took a deep breath, composing myself before approaching the patient's bedside. I refused to let her see the turmoil I was feeling inside. After all, she needed me to be strong, steady, and above all, competent. Because that's what I was - or so I told myself, even as doubt lingered at the edges of my mind."
