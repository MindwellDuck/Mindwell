Her mind flashed back to that fateful night when he'd gone missing. The memory of her husband's frantic phone call, the police sirens in the distance, and her own desperate search for answers came flooding back.\n\nThe creaking stopped, and the silence returned, leaving her breathless.

Now, as the silence stretched out around her, she realized he wasn't coming home tonight either \u2013 he had a dinner meeting with some colleagues.\n\nThe thought sent a pang through her chest, and she felt a familiar ache settle in.
