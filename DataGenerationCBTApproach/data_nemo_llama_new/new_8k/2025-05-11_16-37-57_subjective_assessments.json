It had been three days since her partner was involved in a high-profile incident, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd failed him.\n\nThe phone on her desk jolted her out of her thoughts, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, expecting another call from the chief about the ongoing investigation. Instead, it was her husband, his voice tight with concern.\n\n\"Hey, I've been trying to reach you all day. Is everything okay?\" he asked, his words laced with a subtle tension that made her gut twist.\n\nFor a moment, she hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The weight of her guilt and frustration threatened to spill over, but she took a deep breath and forced herself to sound calm.\n\n\"Yeah, everything's fine,\" she said finally, the word feeling like a lie on her lips.\n\nHer husband sighed softly on the other end of the line, and she knew he wasn't buying it. But before he could press the issue further, their young daughter chimed in from the next room, asking her mom to help with her math homework. The sudden interruption broke the tension, but the seeds of misery had already been sown.<|eot_id|>",

But here she was, drowning in guilt because she hadn't been there to hold his hand through the ordeal.\n\nShe looked at the mountain of files on her desk, each one seemingly more daunting than the last. \"Christ,\" she swore under her breath, pushing them away in disgust. She couldn't remember the last time she'd had a clean desk, let alone a clear mind. Every fucking file was just another reminder of what she hadn't done, what she could've done better.\n\nHer husband's call had been like rubbing salt in an open wound. He was worried, sure, but did he have any idea what she was going through? No, of course not. He was just another one of those people who thought they could fix everything with a fucking hug and a \"it'll be okay.\" Well, newsflash, asshole, it wasn't okay. It hadn't been okay for days, and she was tired of everyone acting like she should just snap out of it.\n\nAnd the kid... God, the kid. Her sweet little girl who didn't deserve to have a mother who was constantly snapping at her because everything felt like too much. She forced herself to smile, picking up the phone again to call her back into the room. \"Hey, sweetheart,\" she said, her voice noticeably softer. \"Let's do that math together, okay?\" Because even in all this shitstorm, there were still some things worth smiling about. Even if they were fucking small and hard to find."

I glance at the garden, then look away, as if its beauty is a betrayal of her memory.\n\nThe coffee cools untouched beside me, my hands wrapped around it for warmth that isn't there.
