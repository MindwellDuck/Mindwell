A colleague, Dr. Patel, politely interrupted, asking for clarification on the dosage, and she felt her face heat up as she frantically searched through her notes.\n\nIn an attempt to cover, she hastily mentioned the correct dosage, but her voice cracked slightly, and she could sense the room fall silent. One of the residents, a young man, looked at her with concern, and she quickly glanced away, feeling a surge of embarrassment wash over her. She knew she had to compose herself, but the mortification lingered, making it hard for her to focus on the rest of the discussion.<|eot_id|>",

Today, it seemed, she was most definitely not.\n\nHer face still felt hot, as if branded by that moment of silence. She'd forgotten something crucial - not just any detail, but the dosage. *Either you remember everything or you're a failure*, she told herself, her thoughts echoing through the sterile hospital corridors like a grim mantra.\n\nShe paused by the nurses' station, flipping through the charts with a forced nonchalance. Inside, though, there was only black and white, no shades of gray. *Either they think I'm an idiot or they don't*, she thought, glancing up at her colleagues who chatted casually around the coffee maker. She couldn't bear to meet their eyes, certain that they saw nothing but incompetence staring back at them.\n\nHer phone buzzed in her pocket - a message from Dr. Patel asking about a different patient. She felt a pang of guilt, then annoyance. *Either he's checking up on me or he doesn't care*, she thought before deleting the message unread.

The little one wailed louder, its tiny fists shaking with rage. The elderly cashier's expression softened instinctively; she remembered her own children's tantrums all those years ago.\n\nAs she rang up the mother's purchases, their conversation turned to small talk about the weather. But when the mother mentioned her husband's recent layoff, a faint glimmer of worry flickered across the cashier's face. It was a look she'd grown accustomed to seeing in her own reflection lately \u2013 a hint of fear, a whisper of uncertainty.\n\nFor an instant, their roles were reversed: this stranger was struggling, and the cashier felt a pang of recognition, a sense of solidarity with someone who was facing the same kind of invisible battles she was fighting every day. Then the mother thanked her and hurried away, leaving the cashier lost in thought as the store grew quieter once more.<|eot_id|>",
