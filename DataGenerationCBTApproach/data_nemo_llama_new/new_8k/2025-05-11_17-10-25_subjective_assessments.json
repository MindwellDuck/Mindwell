As Alex smiled and handed the customer their change, he couldn't help but notice the way Alex seemed to effortlessly handle the transaction, chatting with the customer about their weekend plans.

He smiled warmly as he walked by, and their brief exchange caught the attention of a coworker. \n\nShe quickly looked away, focusing on arranging a display of scarves, but couldn't shake off the feeling of embarrassment about the way things had ended between them all those years ago. As she continued to work, her mind kept drifting back to memories of their time together, replaying every little detail, from laughter-filled nights out to awkward arguments over trivial matters.\n\nJust then, the store manager called out to her, reminding her of an upcoming meeting to discuss sales figures. She hesitated, struggling to concentrate on the conversation, knowing that she would have to spend more time at home reviewing numbers tonight, instead of watching her favorite TV show. The thought sent a pang of disappointment through her chest, and for a moment, she felt a deep regret for not being able to balance work and personal life better when they were still together.<|eot_id|>",

Like anyone could forget such a thrilling tale.\" She mimicked his imagined voice, \" 'Remember when you thought we were going to end up in Canada?' Ha! As if I haven't heard that joke a million times.\"\n\nAs the manager approached again, she waved him off without looking up. \"Yeah, yeah, sales meeting. I know, I know,\" she snapped, already annoyed by what she assumed would be his critique of her numbers. \"Like he could do any better.\" She shook her head, resolute in her belief that she knew exactly how their conversation would go, even before it had begun."

The silence of his small apartment was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old wooden floorboards. His mind wandered back to her, as it often did, and he felt a familiar knot form in his stomach.\n\nAs he sifted through the mail, a letter from the university where she had taught caught his eye. It was a notification about a grant application deadline, one that would fund research into the very causes she had dedicated her life to studying. A pang of guilt hit him, mixed with a sense of helplessness. He had promised to support her work after she passed, but now she was really gone, leaving him to struggle alone.\n\nThe phone rang, breaking the spell. It was a telemarketer, calling about a new credit card offer. As he listened to the automated pitch, his thoughts drifted further away. What if he couldn't make ends meet? What if he lost the house? The questions swirled, fueled by the nagging fear that he wasn't doing enough to keep their legacy alive.<|eot_id|>",

It's not just about the money anymore; it's about her. Her memory is tangled up in every unopened envelope, every overdue notice.
