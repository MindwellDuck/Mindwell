He crumpled it in his fist, feeling a familiar sense of frustration and helplessness.\n\nThe doorbell rang, breaking the silence. It was one of the line cooks, asking about the special sauce recipe.

The other kids were laughing and high-fiving each other, but his son looked frustrated and disappointed. As he walked over to offer words of encouragement, he noticed the worn-out cleats and the faded uniform.\n\nHis wife had mentioned earlier that they couldn't afford new equipment, but he hadn't thought much of it. He assumed someone would donate something or that it wasn't a big deal. Now, as he looked at his son, he felt a pang of guilt and wondered if he was doing enough to support his child's interests.\n\nAs he helped his son up from the ground, their neighbor, Mr. Johnson, approached them. \"Great job out there, young man,\" he said with a pat on the back. But what caught his attention was when Mr. Johnson glanced at his own son, who was sitting on the sidelines playing video games on a tablet. For a moment, he felt a twinge of jealousy and regret for not spending more quality time with his own son.\n\nThe sound of the umpire calling a timeout broke the silence, and his son looked up at him expectantly. He forced a smile and knelt down beside him. \"Hey, buddy, you're going to be okay.\" But as he stood up to rejoin the game, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was neglecting his family in some way.<|eot_id|>",
