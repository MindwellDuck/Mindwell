She had always been the one to bring lightness into his life, to remind him that there was more to existence than the endless pursuit of knowledge.

She'd always been able to find joy in the smallest things, even when they were stuck in this godforsaken lab, working themselves into the ground. But she wasn't here now, was she? No, she'd left him alone with his fucking grant proposals and his fucking silence.\n\nHe turned back to his desk, the stack of unopened mail mocking him like a pile of rotting corpses.

My hair needs a trim, my eyes are bloodshot from lack of sleep \u2013 who am I kidding?

I can't help but feel this pang of guilt, as if her happiness is some sort of reproach.\n\nAnd then \u2013 oh, the irony! \u2013 I go and spill coffee all over little Timmy's charts. His poor mother was so grateful when he pulled through that infection last week; she even brought in homemade cookies for the staff.

A delivery from the art supply store? Probably. But the thought of stepping away from his work, even briefly, sent a flutter in his chest.\n\nThe knocking grew more insistent. He took a deep breath, his anxiety spiking, and made his way to the entrance. The peephole revealed a woman holding a package \u2013 the same company that delivered his art supplies. She didn't recognize him. For a moment, they simply stared at each other.\n\nShe handed him the package, her hand brushing against his. A spark of electricity ran through his body, but he quickly pushed the feeling aside. He signed for the package, taking the paper from her without making eye contact.\n\nAs she turned to leave, their paths crossed again. This time, their shoulders brushed.

He couldn't place it, but it made him wanna bolt back to his canvas, hide behind his art.\n\nTheir hands brushed, and fuck, was that electricity? No way, must've been his imagination running wild again. Still, he felt his cheeks flush, betraying him. \"Sign here,\" she said, pointing at the paper with a pen. He obliged, trying not to let her see his trembling hand.\n\nShe left without another word, and relief flooded through him. Until their shoulders touched. Just a fleeting moment, but it was enough. His heart hammered in his chest like a kick drum, drowning out the silence of his studio. \"Stupid emotions,\" he muttered, turning back to his canvas.
