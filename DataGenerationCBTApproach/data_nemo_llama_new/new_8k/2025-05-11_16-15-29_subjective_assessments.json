Another day, another dollar, but what was the point? The hospital had been downsizing, and he knew it was only a matter of time before they let him go.\n\nHis mind wandered back to his wife, who'd been struggling with Alzheimer's for years. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was failing her, too \u2013 neglecting her needs, forgetting important appointments, and losing himself in the process.\n\nAs he pushed his chair back from the desk, his eyes landed on the small photo of them on their 50th wedding anniversary, now faded and creased from being stuffed into a worn wallet. He hadn't looked at it in weeks, but something about it stirred a deep sadness within him. What would happen to her when he was gone? Who would care for her then?\n\nThe phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill in its interruption. It was the hospital administrator, informing him of yet another round of layoffs. His stomach dropped as he listened, numbness spreading through his chest like a cold mist.<|eot_id|>",

What if they sent her to some godforsaken nursing home where no one cared? What if she ended up alone, scared, forgotten?\n\nHe sighed heavily, running a hand through his thinning hair. \"What if this happens, what if that happens?\" he muttered to himself. \"Maybe I should just pack it all in now.\" But then again, what would happen to her if he did? The 'what ifs' swirled around him like vultures, each one clawing at him with its cold, bony talons."
