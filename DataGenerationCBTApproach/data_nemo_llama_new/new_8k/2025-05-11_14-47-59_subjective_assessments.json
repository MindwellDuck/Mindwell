The divorce had left them both financially strained, but she'd managed to scrape together enough to pay the essentials so far. Now, as she looked at the pile, she wondered if she'd ever be able to catch up, if they'd have to sell the house or cut back on everything again.\n\nShe tried to push the thought aside, telling herself it was just worry, but as she began loading the dishwasher, her mind kept drifting back to the numbers and the weight of those impending payments.
