Her mistakes were piling up \u2013 medication errors, wrong patient assignments, and a misplaced chart.\n\nAs he watched her fumble through a particularly complex case, he noticed she seemed... off. Her usual attentiveness was replaced by a distracted air, and her eyes kept darting towards the hospital's security cameras. He shrugged it off as nervousness, but the image lingered: those cameras, always watching.\n\nThe new nurse approached him, apologetic, and asked for guidance on a critical diagnosis. As they worked together, she mentioned something about receiving \"concerning\" reports from the IT department regarding her computer usage. Concerning enough to warrant a meeting with the hospital administrator.\n\nA shiver ran down his spine. What had she done? Was she somehow compromising patient care? The thought sent a familiar unease creeping into his gut, like a whispered warning in the dead of night.<|eot_id|>",

He could feel his anxiety rising, like it always did when things weren't under control. \"Why can't they just do their jobs right?\" he thought, clenching his jaw.\n\nAs he guided the new nurse through another complex case, he couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. It was her fault, wasn't it? She was the one making mistakes left and right, causing him stress and sleepless nights. He could feel the tension building in his shoulders, a knot tightening with each wrong move she made.\n\nHe glanced at the security cameras again, their unblinking eyes watching everything, everyone. \"Why can't they just watch out for us?\" he thought bitterly, feeling a pang of resentment towards them too. It was all so unfair. Why did everything always fall on him?"

She sighed, wiping away an unwanted tear with the back of her hand. \"I've been doing this for years,\" she whispered to no one, \"and look at me.
