She could feel it, the tension building between them, growing with each passing day.\n\nShe sighed heavily, her shoulders slumping as she leaned against the counter.

She was sure he would notice, would see it as another reason to pull away from her.\n\nAs if on cue, the front door opened, and she heard his footsteps echo through the house. He called out to her, his voice casual, unaware of the storm brewing inside her. She took a deep breath, pushing down the anger and hurt that threatened to boil over. She would ask him about his late nights tonight, find out what he was hiding from her. Because it had to be something, didn't it? Something that concerned them both, something she needed to know."
