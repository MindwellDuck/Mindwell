The view was familiar, yet the sense of control it usually brought her now felt suffocating. She thought about all the calls she'd responded to over the years \u2013 the accidents, the fights, the lost children \u2013 but none of them had prepared her for this.\n\nHer partner's voice crackled over the radio, calling for backup at a domestic disturbance three blocks away. She hesitated, knowing she couldn't go alone, but a part of her wanted to run. To leave the feeling of powerlessness behind and just disappear for a while.\n\nAs she turned to head back downstairs, her foot slipped on a patch of loose gravel. Her arms flailed wildly, but she couldn't catch herself in time. Time seemed to slow down as she watched herself fall, helpless to stop her own body from plummeting towards the ground.<|eot_id|>",

His wife usually took care of those. He shrugged it off, thinking she'd get around to it later. But as he sat down at the table, he realized he had no idea what day it was. No reminders on his phone, no calendar open on the computer. It wasn't like her to forget something so simple.\n\nThe coffee tasted bitter, and his stomach growled with hunger. He stood up, wondering if he should call her to ask where she was, but then thought better of it. Maybe she was busy, maybe she didn't want to talk right now. He pushed the thoughts aside and headed out to start his patrol car, feeling a little disconnected from the day ahead.<|eot_id|>",

The other chefs exchanged curious glances, and whispers began to circulate about the newcomer's impressive credentials.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, Sophia effortlessly executed intricate designs and presented flawless pastries, drawing the attention of the couple who had ordered earlier.

Why does she get the admiration when I've been slaving away? She's not even trying hard, it's just... natural for her. Like breathing. Makes me want to snatch that dessert right off her hands and shove it in her face. But I won't. I won't because... because... I'm better than that.\n\nBut goddammit, why does this feel so unfair? She hasn't earned this yet. Not like I have. My insides are boiling over, and every ounce of me wants to scream out, \"This is mine!
