The kitchen was a well-oiled machine, but one misplaced step could throw everything off balance. As he plated a particularly intricate salad, his mind began to wander to last night's phone call from his ex \u2013 the one who still had access to their shared apartment.\n\nA text notification on his phone caught his eye: 'Forgot to pay the rent.' His heart sank, and his hands started to tremble. He quickly composed himself, attributing it to fatigue, but the knot in his stomach refused to unravel.

No paintings on the walls, just endless white space.

What if this is the whole story of my artistic career: one unfinished canvas after another?\n\nBut no, I can't think like that. This is just one painting, right? One tiny little blank space out of... well, out of however many there are in total. But suddenly, it feels like every single one of them is screaming at me, \"You can't do this! You'll never be good enough!\" And I don't know how to make them stop shouting because what if they're right? What if I'm just fooling myself into thinking I have any talent at all?\n\nSo here I am, standing in my studio with the sunlight streaming in and dust dancing around like it doesn't have a care in the world. Meanwhile, I'm over here, drowning in this sea of doubt because, honestly, what if everything goes wrong? What if this is just another one of those times where I start something big and bold and end up crashing and burning before anyone even gets to see it?\n\nBut hey, maybe that's just me being dramatic. Maybe tomorrow will be different. Maybe tomorrow, I'll wake up and the blank space on my canvas will be gone, replaced by something beautiful and perfect that everyone will love.
