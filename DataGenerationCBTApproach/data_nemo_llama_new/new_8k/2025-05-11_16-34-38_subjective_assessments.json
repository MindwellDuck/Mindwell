His gaze drifted over rows of discarded items, each one a reminder of holidays past \u2013 Christmas lights that never got used, Easter baskets left behind, Valentine's Day cards still wrapped from last year.\n\nHis fingers brushed against a faded t-shirt with a picture of him and his ex on it. He hadn't looked at it in months, but the familiarity brought a pang to his chest. For a moment, time froze as memories flooded back \u2013 laughter, arguments, and quiet moments like this one, where they'd sit together in silence, watching the world go by. The shirt was gone now, replaced by a newer model, but the ache lingered.<|eot_id|>",

It was all for nothing now, it seemed.\n\nHer mind started to wander back to her husband, who'd always encouraged her work, but now sat at home, wondering why she wasn't bringing him dinner like she used to.

My heart rate picked up, and I felt my body tense. \"What is that doing there?\" I whispered, like the lab was suddenly full of ears listening in on my every thought.
