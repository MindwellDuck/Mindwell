A message from the hospital administrator flashed on his phone - a new policy requiring nurses to report any'safety concerns' immediately. The words 'immediate reporting' echoed in his mind, making him pause. He recalled the last time he'd reported something, only to have it dismissed as 'just a precaution.' It had been five years since his wife passed away, and he still struggled with the pressure of being vigilant.\n\nAs he looked around the quiet ward, patients began stirring, their beeps and murmurs filling the air. His gaze drifted back to the screen, where the administrator's message still lingered. He hesitated before saving it, wondering what exactly constituted a'safety concern.' Was it just a nagging feeling or an actual risk? The uncertainty gnawed at him, like a faint, persistent itch.<|eot_id|>",

She'd seemed fine last night, but what if she wasn't today? What if he missed something? He could feel it, that gnawing unease clawing at his insides. \"Fuck this,\" he spat, snatching up the phone and typing out a message to the administrator. \"Better safe than sorry, right?\" But even as he hit send, the doubts lingered. What if they thought he was overreacting? What if this time, it really was just a precaution?"

The usual hum of chatter and laughter filled the air, but today it grated on him like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nHe had always envisioned Saturdays like this: full of life, colors, and shared smiles. But here he was, feeling like an estranged observer in his own town. The market \"should\" be bustling with familiar faces, not these strangers who seemed to have taken over his space.\n\nHe stopped at a stall filled with fresh produce, the farmer's hands stained with earth and pride. But instead of the usual greeting, he simply nodded, expecting the farmer to understand his silent disapproval for the lackluster tomatoes on display today.\n\nAs he walked away, he caught sight of two women sharing a laugh over a basket of plump strawberries. He felt a pang of jealousy. They \"should\" be enjoying their moment alone, not cluttering up his market with their noise. He quickened his pace, leaving behind the sound of their laughter, feeling more alienated than ever.\n\nBy noon, he had collected his usual haul: a bunch of wilting spinach, some shriveled apples, and a bag of beans that \"should\" have been picked yesterday. But today, they all felt like symbols of his failure to appreciate what was in front of him. He paid the vendors, each time expecting them to apologize for their subpar goods.\n\nAs he headed home, the once-welcome weight of his canvas tote now seemed like a burden. The market \"should\" have been perfect today, but it had failed him, just as everything else seemed to be lately."
