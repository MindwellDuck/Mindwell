The chef listened attentively, asking questions about her favorite ingredients and techniques.\n\nFor a moment, she felt a pang of resentment, wishing she had someone to share her passion with, someone who would appreciate her creativity and dedication to her craft. But before she could process these feelings, the conversation turned to something else, and the chef's wife excused herself to finish preparations for her own dinner party later that night.<|eot_id|>",
