Another standardized test, another opportunity for his students to demonstrate their lack of effort. As he handed out the exams, one student caught his eye \u2013 or rather, didn't catch his eye.\n\nThe boy had been struggling all year, consistently producing subpar work and refusing to take responsibility for his own learning. His parents had called several times, complaining about his grades and demanding action from the school. But this teacher knew better than to make promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAs he walked back to his desk, the boy's eyes met his, and for a moment, they just stared at each other. The boy looked up at him with a mixture of defiance and desperation, and the teacher felt a familiar surge of frustration. He forced himself to breathe, took a deep breath, and began to explain the instructions, trying to drown out the voice in his head that was screaming for a different approach.\n\nBut it was too late. The damage was done. He could see the understanding slipping away from the boy's face, replaced by confusion and anxiety. And the teacher knew he'd failed them both again.<|eot_id|>",

He'd seen potential in him once upon a time, a spark that could've amounted to something. But now? Now he was just another face in the crowd, another student failing to live up to expectations.\n\n*His parents called again yesterday,* he recalled bitterly. *Demanding action.* As if he wasn't doing enough. *This isn't how things should be,* he thought again, a familiar frustration bubbling beneath his skin. He took a deep breath, tried to push it down, but it was too late.\n\nHe could see the understanding slipping away from the boy's face, replaced by confusion and anxiety.
