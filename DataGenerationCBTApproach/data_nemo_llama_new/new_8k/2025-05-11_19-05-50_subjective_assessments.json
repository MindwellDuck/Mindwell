The usual warm chatter and clinking of dishes were absent today, replaced by an uncomfortable silence.\n\nAs she watched him expertly crack eggs into a sizzling pan, memories flooded her mind \u2013 memories of their life together before his recent health scare, when laughter filled their home and their love seemed unshakeable. Now, every day felt like a struggle, each moment a reminder of what he might lose.\n\nThe aroma of bacon wafted through the air, but it was overpowered by the bitter taste in her mouth. She couldn't shake the feeling that their relationship had changed overnight, that the man she fell in love with all those years ago was slowly disappearing before her eyes.\n\nJohn slid a plate of scrambled eggs in front of her, his eyes locking onto hers with a fleeting glance of concern. But she knew better than to trust that look; he'd grown accustomed to hiding his true feelings behind a mask of reassurance. As she forced herself to take a bite, the eggs tasted like ash.<|eot_id|>",

A simple silver necklace with a tiny charm of a heart \u2013 the same one they'd picked out together. Now it seemed like a hollow gesture, a reminder of plans that hadn't come to fruition.

She glanced at it, but her eyes slid right over the words, like they were written in a language she didn't understand. Her mind was too busy replaying those four damn words on an endless loop. *I'm coming home.*\n\nShe huffed out a breath, her frustration boiling over. *Great,* she thought bitterly, *just great*. She'd finally found some semblance of peace up here, and now this. One lousy text message, and all she could see was that one phrase, glowing like neon in her mind's eye.\n\nShe stuffed the phone back into her pocket, her hand curling around it like she wanted to crush it. *Why tonight?* she wondered again, her voice barely above a whisper as she stared out at the city lights.
