As she rang up the latest item, a woman pushed forward, cutting in front of her.\n\nThe cashier, frustrated after dealing with the first customer's dispute, snapped, \"I don't get paid enough for this.\" She glared at the new customer, who looked up innocently, seemingly unaware of the tension. The cashier's tone dripped with annoyance as she continued to ring up the new customer's purchases. \n\nA small child began whining loudly, and the mother apologized profusely while trying to soothe it. The cashier's expression turned icy, and she muttered under her breath, \"Great, just what I need.\" As the new customer finished paying and walked away, the cashier slammed down the scanner, her anger momentarily released but still simmering beneath the surface.<|eot_id|>",
