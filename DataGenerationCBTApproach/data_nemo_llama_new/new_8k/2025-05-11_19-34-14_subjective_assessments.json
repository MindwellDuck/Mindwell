The image brought a sudden pang of anxiety; what if something happened to the house? What if it caught fire while they were away? He couldn't shake the thought, his mind racing with worst-case scenarios as he carefully replaced the photo, his hands moving with a growing sense of restlessness.\n\nThe sound of the front door opening broke the spell, but instead of relief, his heart sank as he saw his wife walk in alone, her expression unreadable.<|eot_id|>",
