The sound of his own breathing was the only disturbance, until he heard it again - the faint creak of the wooden floorboards beneath his feet, followed by the soft rustle of fabric.\n\nAt first, he thought it was just the old house settling, but then he swore he heard footsteps outside his door, light and deliberate, as if someone was trying not to be seen. His heart rate quickened, and his brush hovered above the canvas, poised mid-stroke.\n\nThe silence that followed seemed oppressive, heavy with unspoken intentions. He tried to tell himself it was just his imagination playing tricks on him, but the sense of being watched lingered, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He slowly set down his brush, his eyes scanning the empty room, searching for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. Just the quiet, expectant stillness.<|eot_id|>",
