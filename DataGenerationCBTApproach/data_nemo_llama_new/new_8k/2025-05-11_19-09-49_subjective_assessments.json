She thought about the dinner party they were hosting tonight, and how it was going to be perfect \u2013 the menu, the wine pairings, the decorations. But what if something went wrong? What if the guests didn't like the food?\n\nThe sauce started to simmer too quickly, and she knew she needed to adjust the heat. Her hands moved instinctively to turn down the burner, but as she did, she knocked over a container of flour, spilling it all over the counter. The fine white powder coated every surface, including the stovetop, the countertops, and her apron.\n\nFor a moment, she just stood there, frozen, as the reality of the mess sank in. The kitchen, which had been so tidy just moments before, was now a disaster zone. And with only a few hours until their guests arrived, she felt a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.<|eot_id|>",

My heart sank like a stone in my chest. I couldn't leave now, not with things so fragile between us at home. She'd never understand, would she?

It was absurd!\n\nWithout a second thought, I typed out an angry reply, rejecting the offer outright. As I hit send, I felt a surge of satisfaction. There, that showed them. They didn't understand, none of them did. They couldn't see how hard this was for me, how much I had to lose.\n\nOnly later, as I sat alone in the dark, did it occur to me that perhaps Tom hadn't meant any harm.
