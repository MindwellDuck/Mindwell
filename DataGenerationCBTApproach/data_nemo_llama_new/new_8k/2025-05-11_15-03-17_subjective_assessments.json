She hadn't mentioned her plans for the evening yet \u2013 a dinner date with her old friend from college who had been estranged from their relationship for years.\n\nAs she began to check the patient charts, he casually mentioned his plans to attend a gardening seminar at the community center that weekend. The comment felt like a careless reminder of their own neglected hobby together, one they'd put off since her mother passed away.\n\nA faint scowl creased her forehead as she processed this new information. She glanced up at him, but his eyes were already fixed on the computer screen, oblivious to her growing irritation. He didn't seem to notice her subtle change in demeanor, which only added fuel to the fire simmering within her.<|eot_id|>",

You've been planning a dinner date with an old friend who you haven't seen in years. Your partner casually mentions their plans for the weekend - something they're more passionate about than you are. How do you react, subtly reflecting 'Unfair Comparisons' cognitive distortion?\n\n**Response:**\nUgh, here we go again. Another freakin' gardening seminar, huh? Like he doesn't already spend enough time prancing around our garden, making it the envy of the neighborhood. I mean, who even needs that many types of roses? Not like my dinner date is just some fancy-schmancy event where I'll be wined and dined by a successful friend while John's surrounded by potting soil and overalls.\n\nI bet his plants are all perfectly manicured too, none of this 'rustic charm' nonsense I've been trying to pull off. And there he is, Mr. Green Thumb, yawning like he's tired from all the gardening glory. Meanwhile, I'm up all night stressing about what to wear so I don't look like a complete loser next to my old friend who's probably become some big shot CEO by now.\n\nI mean, seriously? A gardening seminar on a Saturday? It's not like he has any real hobbies or interests that might actually benefit our relationship. No, it's just all about the bloody plants. I guess that's what happens when you marry someone who can grow things from seeds while you're over here trying to keep a cactus alive.\n\nBut hey, at least my dinner date doesn't involve me getting dirt under my nails or learning how to 'properly prune' something. No, no, I'll be too busy comparing myself to everyone else at the restaurant who probably has better jobs, better lives, and better everything. Because that's what I do best - make sure I'm always coming up short."

As he carefully plated the dish one last time, his mind wandered back to when they first started dating. He remembered the excitement and nervous energy he felt, thinking about their future together.\n\nJust then, his daughter walked into the kitchen, her eyes scanning the room until they landed on him. \"Dad, can I help?\" she asked, but before he could respond, she noticed the dish in front of him. Her expression changed from curiosity to disappointment, and she muttered under her breath, \"Again?\"\n\nThe words struck a chord within him, and suddenly, the kitchen seemed to shrink around him. The sizzle of the onions, the clang of pots, everything faded into the background as he felt a familiar pang of regret wash over him. What if he hadn't proposed that day? What if he'd taken more risks in life? The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and for a moment, he forgot how to breathe.<|eot_id|>",

Just like always.\n\nHe smiled at her, a genuine smile that pushed away the shadows for a moment. \"Sure thing, sweetheart,\" he said, handing her the tongs. \"Let's make this lunch something special.\""

He continued his presentation, trying to brush off the discomfort, but his mind kept drifting back to the subtle exchange.

It was meant to show everyone how little she thinks of my work.*\n\n*The whole team congratulated me after that, but it felt hollow.
