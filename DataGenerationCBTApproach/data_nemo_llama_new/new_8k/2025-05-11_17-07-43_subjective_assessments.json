The faded colors seemed to mock her, and the memories it stirred only fueled her resentment. A careless brushstroke had altered the shape of the beach, erasing the curve where he used to hold her.\n\nA faint smudge on the corner caught her eye \u2013 a detail she was certain hadn't been there before. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized it was a subtle change in the color of the sky. It wasn't just a mistake; someone had intentionally altered the piece.\n\nHer mind began to wander back to all the other 'accidents' his art studio had experienced since they moved in together. The missing paint tubes, the scratched canvases, and the occasional'misplaced' sculpture. Each incident had been dismissed as a prank, but now, something about this felt different.\n\nAs she gazed at the altered artwork, a sense of calm gave way to a simmering anger. Her thoughts turned to the countless hours she'd spent helping him, supporting him, and encouraging him. And how many times had he taken credit for her own work?<|eot_id|>",

The thought echoed like a thunderclap in her mind, ricocheting off the walls of their shared past. Each bounce seemed to amplify it, until it was all she could hear, all she could feel. She had nurtured his talent, fed it, and this was how he repaid her? With deceit masquerading as art?\n\nHer heart pounded in her chest like a trapped animal, each beat echoing her outrage. This wasn't just about the painting; it was about everything. The late nights she'd stayed up to help him prepare for exhibitions, the times she'd covered for him when he'd lost track of time in his studio, the countless dinners she'd cooked while he 'needed to finish this one thing'. Each memory now seemed shrouded in a fog of resentment, fueled by the burning conviction that his actions were a reflection of his true nature. He was unappreciative, selfish, and manipulative.\n\nShe felt her body tense, her hands clench into fists at her sides. She wanted to shout, to demand answers, but something held her back. It wasn't fear; it was the quiet, insidious voice that whispered, \"What if you're wrong?\" But how could she be? Her emotions were screaming the truth at her, weren't they? They always did."

The faint scent of her perfume lingered on the edge of the frame, transporting him back to the day she passed away. He hadn't cooked dinner for herself in months, but tonight he found himself rummaging through old recipe books, searching for the one she used to make chicken parmesan.\n\nAs he flipped through the yellowed pages, a torn corner caught his eye \u2013 it was from the same cookbook she had given him on their first anniversary. A faint smudge of sauce still marred the page where they'd shared countless meals together. He couldn't recall the last time he'd prepared a meal just for himself; the silence of his empty house felt oppressive.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, he began to chop vegetables, the familiar motions a reminder of years gone by. As the sizzling onions filled the air, he hesitated, the knife hovering above the cutting board. The memory of their laughter and the sound of her voice calling out from the next room stopped him, leaving only the echo of what could've been.<|eot_id|>",

Just me and my sad little sandwich, in this big old kitchen that echoes with memories.\n\nThe other day, I found this tiny chip on the edge of our dining table.
