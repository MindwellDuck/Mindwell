The silence of her small kitchen was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional clink of utensils against the porcelain. Her mind wandered back to the conversation they'd had two nights prior \u2013 him, her ex-husband, asking about her retirement plans.\n\nA memory long buried resurfaced: the day she'd decided to pursue a career in environmental science, the fire in her stomach now reduced to a smoldering ember. She recalled the countless late nights spent poring over research papers, the sacrifices made for the sake of her work. Yet, it hadn't been enough; he'd left her for someone younger, someone more 'accomplished.'\n\nAs she rinsed the last dish, a wave of regret washed over her. Why had she let her passion fade? What had driven her to prioritize his needs over her own desires? Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she blinked them away, refusing to give in to the familiar ache of sorrow.<|eot_id|>",

It would all be too much to bear. She gripped the edge of the sink, knuckles white, as she braced herself against the oncoming storm she could already feel brewing. \"No,\" she growled, shaking her head vehemently. \"I won't fucking stand for it.\""

If you make a mistake, do not hide behind the guise of 'human error'. We are professionals, and such trivialities should be nonexistent in our vocabulary. I expect every detail to be flawless, every i dotted, every t crossed. This is not about meeting standards; it's about exceeding them.\n\nLet me remind you that we have had setbacks before, but those were anomalies, exceptions that proved the rule of our incompetence. We cannot afford such instances now. I expect nothing less than perfection from all of you, always.
