We'd been arguing all day about something stupid - who left the dishes in the sink again.\n\nBut it wasn't just that. It was everything. School had been killing me lately, and I'd come home feeling like I was drowning in paperwork and parent-teacher conferences. My wife seemed distant, too, like she was always trying to please everyone else but me.\n\nAs I glared at her, she looked up, concern etched on her face. 'Hey, what's wrong?' she asked, setting down the knife.\n\n'Nothing,' I growled, turning away from her. But I could feel my eyes stinging, and I knew I was lying.\n\nShe came over beside me, wrapping her arm around my waist. 'Come on, let's talk about it.'\n\nBut I shook her off. 'Just leave me alone, okay? I need some space.'\n\nAnd with that, I stormed out of the kitchen, leaving her standing there looking lost and worried. I slammed the door behind me, feeling a rush of adrenaline course through my veins.\n\nFor a moment, I just leaned against the wall, letting the silence wash over me. It was a familiar feeling, one I'd grown accustomed to over the past few months. But tonight, it felt different. Tonight, it felt like I was suffocating under its weight.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling. I was fine. I was just stressed. Yeah, that's it.\n\nBut as I turned to head upstairs, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And for a second, our eyes met - hers, from downstairs, and mine, from here.\n\nIn that moment, I saw the emptiness staring back at me, and it made my heart ache.<|eot_id|>"

My research had shown it wasn't just a coincidence \u2013 they were cooking the books, lining their own pockets while everyone else suffered.\n\nThat smug face popped into my head \u2013 Councilman Thompson, who'd claimed he was working tirelessly for our city's benefit. A liar.\n\nMy gut twisted with fury as I read about his lavish lifestyle, the expensive cars, the luxury vacations. Meanwhile, we struggled to make ends meet, families forced to choose between rent and food.\n\n\"You think you can just get away with this?\" I slammed my fist on the desk, making my chair shake.\n\nFor years, I'd kept quiet, focused on my career, but now I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like I was drowning in injustice.\n\nThompson thought he was above the law? He thought he could destroy lives and then just walk free?\n\nA cold sweat broke out on my forehead as I realized I wasn't just angry \u2013 I was plotting. And once I got started, there was no stopping me.\n\nThis was war. And I would win.\n\n\"You're going down, Thompson,\" I whispered, my voice barely audible over the pounding in my chest.\n\nThe world around me melted away, leaving only one thing: vengeance.<|eot_id|>"

Mrs. Johnson's kid is failing again and she's already giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nI try to shake off the feeling as I stand up to start my lesson, but my heart is racing like it's going to burst out of my chest. What if I forget everything? What if I stumble over my words? What if... Ugh, stop it! Focus, Edna!\n\nBut then I see the clock on the wall - 2:45 PM. We've got 15 minutes left before dismissal. I glance around the room, making sure everyone is paying attention, but they're all just staring blankly at their books or chatting amongst themselves.\n\nMy phone starts buzzing in my pocket. It's the school secretary. She needs me to meet her in the office in five minutes to discuss the upcoming staff meeting. Five minutes?! How am I supposed to prepare for this?!\n\nOkay, okay, deep breaths. It'll be fine. Just get through this one lesson and you can worry about tomorrow later. But what if... no, no, no! Stop it! Just stop it right now!\n\nAs I try to regain composure, I notice that Sarah's little girl is sitting in the back row, looking more and more distressed by the minute. Her eyes keep darting towards me, and I can tell she's worried about something. Maybe it's just my imagination, but it feels like she's watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake.\n\nAnd then, just as I'm starting to calm down, I trip on the cord to the projector and the whole room falls silent. Everyone turns to stare at me, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. This is it. This is the moment when everything comes crashing down around me...<|eot_id|>"

But no, you had to go and find some young punk who could handle all the drama that comes with dating a doctor.\"\n\nRachel raised an eyebrow. \"At least I'm not stuck in a loveless marriage with a man who's too scared to grow up.\"\n\nThompson's face turned red with rage. \"How dare you!

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have actual work to do \u2013 unlike some people who just sit around collecting unemployment checks.\"\n\nWith that, Thompson stormed out of the room, leaving Rachel standing alone, still smiling like she owned the place.<|eot_id|>"

His expression was one of expectation, as if he truly believed I possessed some hidden reservoir of skill that would elevate my performance. I forced a smile, a shallow gesture that betrayed none of my true feelings.\n\n\"Good morning, nurse,\" he said, his voice dripping with false warmth. \"I trust you're ready for another grueling day.\"\n\nGrueling? Ha! I'd seen it all before \u2013 the endless stream of patients, each one a puzzle piece in the grand tapestry of suffering. And me, stuck in the middle, trying to make sense of it all while being treated like a novice by those who thought they knew better.\n\nDr. Smith walked in, her face pinched with concern, and began outlining the day's schedule.

Now, she was nothing more than a memory, a bittersweet reminder of what I'd lost.\n\nThe doctor handed me a chart, her handwriting sloppy and illegible. I scanned the pages, my eyes scanning the list of medications and treatments, but my brain remained stubbornly blank. It wasn't the medication itself; it was the sheer volume of data that threatened to overwhelm me at every turn.\n\nA hand touched my shoulder, and I spun around to find Dr. Patel standing behind me, a look of expectant patience etched on his face. \"Ready to get started?\" he asked, his voice a gentle breeze that failed to soothe the storm brewing inside me.\n\nI took a deep breath, the air burning my lungs, and nodded curtly. \"Yes.\"<|eot_id|>"

The way he'd always make her laugh, the smell of pine and cinnamon that filled their little apartment during Christmas, the sound of Bing Crosby crooning \"White Christmas\" in the background.\n\nNow, as she arranged the ornaments by size and shape, her eyes landed on the old photo album hidden behind the decorative figurines. She hadn't looked at it in years, but today something compelled her to take it out. As she flipped through the yellowed pages, memories came flooding back \u2013 the first date, the proposal, the wedding day, the countless nights they'd spent cuddled up on the couch watching movies together.\n\nSarah's gaze fell upon a particularly vivid picture \u2013 one of them standing hand-in-hand on the beach, the sun setting over the ocean. Her heart skipped a beat as she remembered the way his fingers intertwined with hers, the way he'd look at her with such adoration.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she replaced the photo, trying to push the memories away. But they lingered, taunting her like a ghostly presence that refused to leave.\n\nJust then, a customer approached the counter, asking for assistance with finding a certain brand of scarf. Sarah forced a smile onto her face, her mind numb from the wave of emotions that threatened to consume her. She rang up the purchase, her hands shaking slightly as she handed the customer their change.\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind the woman, Sarah let out a sob, her body wracked with sobs that shook her entire frame. The memories had come rushing back, and this time, there was no escape.<|eot_id|>"

He said he had some great news - our favorite local restaurant was hosting a charity dinner tonight, and they wanted us to come as guests.\n\nNow, I love food, but what really got me going was that they were serving my favorite dish - the one I used to make for Mom when she was alive. It brought back so many memories, but Alex didn't seem to care about that. All he cared about was how we could network and maybe get some good stories out of it.\n\nAs we were getting ready to leave, I realized I hadn't even mentioned this to him. I guess I thought he knew how much it meant to me. But now, looking back, I feel like he completely disregarded my feelings. Like, doesn't he know how much that place means to me? Doesn't he know how much Mom loved it?\n\nAlex just shrugged and said he thought it would be fun. Fun! Are you kidding me? This is supposed to be about Mom's memory, not some silly party. And another thing, why did he have to go and mention that he already made reservations under my name? Can you believe that? Like, what if I didn't want to go? What if I needed a night to myself?\n\nWe ended up leaving early, and I'm still fuming. I mean, I love Alex, but sometimes I wonder if he really gets me. Does he ever stop to think about how his actions might affect me? Or am I just too old and set in my ways?\n\nThis is exactly why I don't like covering community events anymore. It's all about the superficial stuff - who's dating who, who's making money off their latest venture... Meanwhile, people are struggling, and no one cares. Maybe I'll start writing about real issues instead. At least then I'll feel like I'm doing something worthwhile.<|eot_id|>"

Again. We'd been married for over 30 years, and I knew I was supposed to be her rock, her partner, her everything. But lately, it felt like I was just going through the motions.\n\nI thought back to our conversation last night. She'd mentioned something about needing some space, about feeling overwhelmed with work and stuff. And I got it, really I did. But all I could think was that she wasn't making time for me anymore. That we were growing apart, piece by piece.\n\nI took a sip of my coffee, watching as the crema dissolved on the surface. It was like our marriage was slowly disappearing before my eyes. I remembered the good times, the laughter, the late-night talks about our dreams and aspirations. Where did it all go?\n\nMy mind started racing with all the little things she'd been forgetting lately - my birthday, my anniversary, even my favorite snack. It was like I was living in a bubble, separate from the rest of the world. Separate from her.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I realized I hadn't seen her smile in weeks. Not since...well, since the kids moved out, I guess. When life became too much, and we both retreated into our own worlds.\n\nI pushed the thoughts aside, trying to focus on the present. But the present was a pretty bleak place right now. As I looked around the kitchen, I saw the remnants of dinner still sitting on the counter - untouched. Unloved.\n\nI set my coffee down, my heart heavy with the weight of neglect. Was this what our marriage had come to? A series of silent, desperate pleas for attention, for love, for connection?<|eot_id|>"

But lately, it seemed like every little thing I did was overlooked or underappreciated.\n\nI remembered the last time she'd come home late from work, how she'd just plop herself down on the couch without so much as a kiss or a thank you. Or the way she'd cancel plans at the last minute because'something came up.' It was always'something came up.'\n\nMy eyes wandered to the framed photo on my nightstand \u2013 us, smiling and happy on our anniversary. I hadn't even noticed when it got dusted off by mistake.

I forced a smile onto my face, trying to play it cool. Maybe she was stuck in traffic, maybe she just forgot \u2013 it could happen to anyone.\n\nBut deep down, a nagging voice whispered that this was just another example of being ignored.

Instead, I was met with the sight of my husband, John, sitting at our usual table, sipping a cup of tea and chatting with one of his colleagues.\n\nMy eyes narrowed as I approached him. Hadn't we discussed this already? Didn't he remember the countless hours I'd spent preparing for today's surgery, the sleepless nights and early mornings, the endless rounds of tests and consultations?\n\n\"John,\" I said, trying to keep my voice low but even, \"we need to talk.\"\n\nHe looked up, a hint of surprise crossing his face before he smiled and set his tea aside. \"Hey, hon, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" I repeated, my anger simmering just below the surface. \"What do you think is wrong? You're always so calm, so collected, while I'm the one who has to deal with the stress and the pressure. You have no idea what it's like to be in my shoes.\"\n\nJohn's expression faltered, and for a moment, I saw a glimmer of uncertainty. But then he leaned back in his chair and smiled again, a patronizing smile that made my blood boil.\n\n\"I know exactly what you mean, dear,\" he said. \"But sometimes you have to learn to delegate, trust your team. You can't do everything alone.\"\n\nI felt a surge of frustration, my anger boiling over. Did he really think I didn't know that? Did he really think I was incapable of managing my own practice? I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could say anything, my phone buzzed with an incoming text from the hospital administrator.\n\n\"Dr. Lee, we need to discuss the new accreditation standards...\".\n\nI took a deep breath, my anger momentarily tempered by the sudden interruption. But as I turned to leave, I caught John's eye, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of guilt there. A fleeting glance that suggested he knew exactly how I felt, and yet, he was doing nothing to help me.<|eot_id|>"
