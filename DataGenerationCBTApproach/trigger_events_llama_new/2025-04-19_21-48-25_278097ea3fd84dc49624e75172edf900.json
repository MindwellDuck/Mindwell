Again.\n\nI trudged through the automatic doors, greeted by the cheerful bell above them, like it was trying to slap me awake from this miserable existence. Another day, another dollar, another chance to pretend I care about these mindless shoppers who think the world revolves around their damned opinions.\n\nI clocked in, exchanged pleasantries with Karen from accounting \u2013 because, of course, we had to have small talk before the chaos ensues \u2013 and began restocking the shelves. My back ached from yesterday's lifting, but what did it matter? It wasn't like anyone cared.\n\nSome moron comes up to me, hands me a can of expired soup, and asks if I can 'find something similar.' Similar?! This thing's been sitting on clearance since the Clinton administration! They must've thought they were buying some sort of gourmet delicacy.\n\nI took it, smiled, and muttered something about 'let me check,' all while seething inside. As I scanned it at the register, my eyes wandered to the wanted posters on the wall \u2013 'Most Wanted' in all caps, featuring the faces of customers who'd tried to return products after the time limit expired. Ha! Like that'd happen to me.\n\nA kid, probably around 10, looked up at me with those big, innocent eyes and asked if Santa was coming this year. What a joke. I forced a smile, lied about the magic of Christmas, and wondered when someone was gonna come along and tell him the truth \u2013 that his old man's too busy working for minimum wage to buy him any presents.\n\nAnother day, another dollar, another reminder that life's just one long, never-ending cycle of disappointment.\"<|eot_id|>"

My parents are breathing down my neck, asking me when I'm gonna get a'real' job. Like, what even is that? A real job means I gotta sacrifice my soul.\n\nJust got off work and my phone's blowing up with texts from Rachel. We were supposed to hang out tonight, but she cancelled at the last minute. Again. She says she's busy with her family or whatever, but I know it's just because she doesn't want to deal with me.\n\nI'm driving home, feeling like crap, when I see him \u2013 my ex, Alex. He's standing outside the mall, laughing with some chick who looks way too young for him. My heart sinks and I slam on the brakes, but it's too late. He sees me and gives this smug little smile.\n\nHe gets out of the car and starts walking towards me, all nonchalant like we're old friends or something. Newsflash, Alex: we're not friends. We're done. And you think you can just waltz back into my life after everything you put me through?\n\nHe stops in front of me and says, \"Hey, man, long time no see.\" Long time no see?! You think that's funny? That's just rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nI try to stay calm, but my voice is shaking. \"What do you want, Alex?\" I growl.\n\nHe shrugs. \"Just thought I'd drop by and say hi. You look good, though. Really good.\"\n\nGood? Are you kidding me? You have no idea how good I feel right now. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of misery and you're just standing there, smiling at me like we're buddies.\n\nSuddenly, his eyes flicker to my face and he seems to realize what's going on. His expression changes, and for a split second, I see a glimmer of the pain and regret he used to show me.\n\nBut it's too late. The damage is done. He turns and walks away, leaving me standing here feeling like a total idiot.<|eot_id|>"

My eyes land on that stupid poster from 20 years ago, the one where I finally cracked the code on the cure for Alzheimer's. Now it just collects dust, a relic of a time when I actually mattered.\n\nI've spent decades studying the human brain, trying to unravel its mysteries, but what do I have to show for it? A bunch of failed grants, a bunch of dead colleagues, and a bunch of pointless paperwork. I'm 60 years old and still single. What's wrong with me?\n\nMy phone buzzes, another reminder that I need to attend some networking event or conference. Because, you know, that's exactly what I want \u2013 to be surrounded by people who are younger, smarter, and more successful than me. Just what I need to make me feel like a complete failure.\n\nI throw my pen across the room, hitting the wall with a loud thud. Why can't anyone take me seriously? I'm a brilliant mind, wasted away in this tiny lab, stuck in a world that doesn't value me anymore. The tears well up in my eyes as I realize that maybe I'm just deluding myself. Maybe I'll never find true love, never find purpose, never find anything worth living for.\n\nThe lab around me starts to fade away, replaced by memories of past failures and unfulfilled dreams. I see myself as a young man, full of hope and ambition, now reduced to a mere shadow of my former self. I try to shake off the feeling, but it's no use. The darkness closes in, and I'm left with nothing but the crushing weight of my own insignificance.<|eot_id|>"

And I was supposed to pick up the pieces? Please.\n\nI thought about all the times she'd promised to help, to support me, but it was all just empty words. She'd show up when it suited her, and then disappear again. Left me to deal with the orders, the customers, the stress. All by myself.\n\nI remembered the first time she'd walked out on us, leaving me to clean up after her. I'd tried to make it work, to convince her to stay. But she'd just laughed, said I was too controlling, that I didn't trust her enough. Like that was my fault.\n\nNow, as I looked around this kitchen, I saw all the reminders of what we'd lost. The faded recipe cards, the worn-out pots, the knives she'd broken. It was all just a mess, just like our marriage.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm down. But it was no use. I was furious, hurt, and angry all at once. Why had she done this to me? Why had she left?\n\nI slammed my hand against the counter, making the pots and pans jump. Stupid kitchen, stupid life. Who needed all this drama anyway? Not me, that's for sure.\n\nBut as I stood there, frozen in anger, something inside me shifted. A tiny spark of sadness ignited, and I felt the weight of my neglect bearing down on me. I wasn't taking care of myself, not really. I was just going through the motions, waiting for someone else to come along and fix everything.\n\nThat realization hit me hard, like a ton of bricks. I realized I'd been neglecting my own needs, my own happiness. And now I was left with nothing but this emptiness, this hollow feeling.\n\nThe kitchen seemed to spin around me, the air thickening with unspoken emotions. I felt like I was drowning in my own regret, my own failures. And in that moment, I knew I had to do something. For myself. For real.<|eot_id|>"

But life had other plans, it seemed. Every time she thought she'd found some semblance of control, another bombshell would drop, leaving her feeling like a ship without anchor or rudder.\n\nShe sighed, rubbed her tired eyes, and tried to focus on the article in front of her. But every sentence felt forced, every word a struggle to come by. It was like trying to write through a thick fog, with no idea how to find the exit.\n\nJust then, her phone buzzed with a text from her best friend, inviting her out for drinks after work. A tiny spark of hope ignited within her \u2013 maybe tonight would be different. Maybe she could leave the stress of the office behind and just...be.\n\nBut as she glanced around her cluttered apartment, she realized she had nothing but bills to pay and deadlines to meet. No escape from reality, no reprieve from the never-ending cycle of helplessness. She felt like Sisyphus, pushing his boulder up the mountain, only to watch it roll back down again, ad infinitum.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she picked up her pen and started typing, the words spilling out of her like blood from a wounded animal. It wasn't pretty, but it was something. And for now, that was enough.<|eot_id|>"

We were discussing a patient's chart, and Mark kept nodding at me, his eyes lingering on mine like he was trying to remember something. Something important.\n\nAnd then there's Emily, our new intern. She keeps following me around the ward, asking me questions about everything from medication schedules to patient care plans. It's not even like she's trying to learn; she's just hovering, waiting for me to make a mistake so she can swoop in and fix it.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around here.

Maybe it's the stress of being single and working late shifts, or maybe it's just paranoia setting in.

Relax? Are you kidding me? I'm the one who's supposed to be calm and collected, not them. But no one believes me. They just pat me on the back and tell me I'll get used to it.\n\nNewsflash: I won't get used to it.

But then he thought about all the people counting on him, his family, his friends. He took a deep breath, trying to push the thoughts aside.\n\n\"It's fine, Mom,\" he typed out finally. \"I'm just stressed with work right now.\" He hit send, feeling a mix of relief and guilt.
