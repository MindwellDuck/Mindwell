My manager, Karen, was already waiting for me, her bright smile a cruel joke in my eyes.\n\n\"Hey buddy! Beautiful day, huh?\" she chirped, completely oblivious to the fact that I wanted to scream.\n\nI forced a weak smile onto my face, trying to play along. \"Yeah, can't complain.\"\n\nKaren handed me a schedule for the day, her fingers brushing against mine. It was like a spark had been lit, igniting a firestorm of grief inside me. Why did it always have to be so... cheerful?\n\nAs I scanned the list, my eyes landed on his name - or rather, what used to be his name. We'd closed up shop together after his passing last week, and now I was stuck here alone, trying to pretend like everything was okay.\n\nKaren noticed my gaze and followed it to the empty chair where he used to sit. Her expression faltered for a split second before she recovered, but not before I caught a glimpse of something else - pain.\n\n\"You okay, hon?\" she asked, her voice softer than usual.\n\nI shook my head, feeling a lump form in my throat. \"Just... missed him, you know?\"\n\nKaren nodded sympathetically, but I could tell she didn't really get it. Who does, anyway? She patted my back awkwardly and moved on to hand out assignments to the other employees.\n\nAs I began my shift, I couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness. The store seemed quieter without him, the mannequins staring at me like ghostly reminders of what I'd lost.\n\nAnd then, to top it all off, our coffee machine broke down, spitting out lukewarm water instead of the much-needed caffeine. I glared at the machine, willing it to magically fix itself.\n\nOf course, it didn't.\n\nJust great. Just peachy.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to focus, but my mind kept wandering back to him. What would he say if he were here right now? Would he tease me about my ridiculous outfit or give me a high-five for surviving another day?\n\nI sighed, feeling the weight of my grief settle back onto my shoulders. Maybe today wouldn't be so bad after all.\n\nMaybe.\n\nUgh, who am I kidding?<|eot_id|>"

Can you believe it? I mean, I'm flattered, I guess, but it's just so... infuriating.\n\nWhat really sets me off, though, is when people start talking about 'building on each other's research.' Like, what does that even mean? Did they think I was just sitting around twiddling my thumbs while they did all the heavy lifting? Newsflash, kids: someone had to lay the groundwork first.\n\nI've got a whole folder full of notes and papers from back in the day.

They're too busy patting themselves on the back for being 'visionary' or some nonsense like that.\n\nYou know what? Screw it. Forget I ever even bothered trying. I'm just going to go ahead and take my award and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. Because at the end of the day, none of it matters anyway. None of it matters except for the fact that those smug little bastards are still going to keep getting all the recognition.\"<|eot_id|>"

Are you kidding me?\n\nI felt my anger spike all over again, and I couldn't help but think about how she always does this \u2013 ignores my feelings and expects me to just calm down and move on.

Are you serious? We've been talking about moving to a new town for months, but now suddenly we're getting promoted? It's like she thinks I'm just going to forget all about my dreams and aspirations because we're stuck in this dead-end job.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" I asked, feeling my frustration boil over.\n\nShe shrugged, still smiling, and said, \"I didn't want to ruin your day.\"\n\nRuined my day? You think I care about ruining my own day? This is about us, about our life together, and you're just going to ignore my feelings and expect me to be happy about it?\n\nI turned and walked away, leaving her sitting there, still smiling, still clueless.<|eot_id|>"

My eyes locked onto the perpetrator - a guy from the lab down the hall, sporting that annoyingly perfect smile he thinks makes him look like a genius. Newsflash, buddy: it doesn't.\n\nMy mind went blank as I stared at those smug little eyes. Blank, because all I could think was how much I wanted to rip his face off. Not just for spilling coffee, but for everything else too. For making me feel like I'll never be good enough. For taking away my husband.\n\nMy voice shook as I forced myself to speak, trying to keep it together. \"So, uh, where were we?\" I muttered, trying to hide the rage brewing inside me. But it was no use. My hands began to shake, and I could feel sweat trickling down my spine.\n\nThe guy took a step back, looking taken aback by my reaction. And rightfully so. Who wouldn't be? I mean, I'm basically a ticking time bomb of anger and hurt. I tried to compose myself, but it was too late. The damage was done.\n\nAs I stormed out of the room, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. The scientist who used to be so composed and collected now looked like a hot mess. My eyes were blazing, my jaw clenched, and my hair was a tangled mess. I couldn't even remember the last time I cried. \n\nBut right now, I felt like I was drowning in tears.<|eot_id|>"

Her husband, John, had passed away two years ago, and she still got these weird calls sometimes.\n\n\"Hello?\" she said, trying to keep her voice steady.\n\nThere was a pause, and then a faint whispering sound. Rachel's skin crawled as she recognized the soft, raspy tone - it sounded exactly like John's.\n\n\"Rachel...I'm sorry,\" the voice whispered.\n\nRachel's grip on the phone tightened as panic set in. She tried to speak, but her voice caught in her throat. Tears began to well up in her eyes as she stumbled backward, her hand grasping for something to hold onto.\n\nSuddenly, the voice stopped whispering and fell silent. Rachel's chest heaved as she stood there, frozen in terror, her mind screaming that this wasn't real. But the fear lingered, gnawing at her like a rat in her stomach.\n\nShe dropped the phone and ran, not stopping until she reached her car and locked herself inside. Breathless and shaking, she started the engine and sped away from the hospital, unsure where she was going or what she'd do next. All she knew was that she couldn't shake the feeling that someone - or something - was still out there, watching her.<|eot_id|>"

How dare he think he could just move on, erase me from his life so effortlessly?\n\nI felt a surge of adrenaline course through my veins as I recalled our final argument, the words we'd exchanged like daggers. He'd claimed I was holding him back, stifling his creativity with my possessiveness. And now, here he was, painting me as nothing more than a memory, a relic of a love long extinguished.\n\nWith a snarl, I flung down my brush and stormed out of the studio, leaving the canvas to gather dust. The photograph clutched tightly in my fist, I careened through the streets, determined to confront him, to make him understand the depth of my pain.\n\nBut when I arrived at his apartment, I found myself face to face with his new mistress, her eyes cold and calculating behind a mask of sweetness.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" she asked, her voice dripping with malice.\n\n\"You can start by telling James that I know,\" I spat, my voice trembling with rage.\n\nHer smile never wavered. \"I'm afraid that's not possible,\" she said, her voice dripping with condescension.\n\nAnd in that moment, something inside me shattered, the fragments of my shattered dreams and broken heart exploding onto the pavement like shrapnel.<|eot_id|>"

It's too hard.'\n\nToo hard. Too bloody hard. Regina thought back to when she was young and had given up her own dreams to care for her husband after he got injured. She had always assumed it would get better, that one day they'd be able to go back to their lives.\n\nNow, her son was gone, and her daughter-in-law had abandoned them.
