Got her residency at 28, now she's gettin' all these promotions... I swear, it's like she's tryin' to rub it in my face or somethin'.\n\nJust then, my phone rings. It's my sister, callin' from the hospital down the street. Apparently, their new CEO is some young doc who's makin' waves. Younger than me, too - 40 years old! Can you believe it? They're talkin' about how he's gonna \"shake things up\" around there...\n\nI start feelin' this knot in my stomach, like someone's squeezin' my insides. What's wrong with me? I've had a good career, raised a family... what do I have to complain about?\n\nBut then I see it on Facebook - that same young nurse I was lookin' at earlier, postin' about her weekend getaway to Hawaii. A whole week alone, doin' whatever she wants... I'm stuck here, watchin' the clock tick away till retirement.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, my sister starts tellin' me about this CEO's \"visionary leadership\" and how it's gonna \"transform\" the hospital. Transform! Like I don't know what that means. All I know is that it sounds like more stress and pressure on us docs...\n\nI feel tears prickin' at the corners of my eyes. Why can't they just leave me alone? I thought I'd earned the right to enjoy my golden years after puttin' up with all those crazy patients for decades... But no, they just keep takin' and takin', leavin' me with nothin'.<|eot_id|>"

Noticing her partner, Alex, sitting by the window sipping on his latte, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance.\n\nTheir friends had been planning this impromptu brunch gathering for weeks, and she'd spent hours agonizing over what outfit to wear. She'd finally settled on a bright yellow sundress, thinking it would be the perfect way to shake off the monotony of their routine lives.\n\nAs she waited in line, she noticed the couple next to her, laughing and holding hands. They looked so carefree, like they were actually living life. Meanwhile, she was stuck in a relationship that felt more like a comfortable habit than a passionate connection.\n\nWhen it was her turn to order, she stumbled over her words, mumbling something about a cappuccino. As she waited for her drink, she caught Alex glancing at his phone, his brow furrowed in concentration. She assumed he was working on some project, but then she saw the text conversation on his screen \u2013 a flirtatious exchange with someone named 'Samantha'.\n\nHer heart skipped a beat as she watched him respond with a cheeky emoji. For a moment, she felt a pang of jealousy, but she quickly pushed it aside, telling herself she was being ridiculous. After all, Alex loved her, right?\n\nAs she took a sip of her cappuccino, she noticed the woman from the couple next to her now sitting across from her, striking up a conversation. It seemed they shared a love for travel and adventure, while she found herself nodding along, pretending to be interested.\n\nBut when the woman asked her about her job, and she began rattling off stories about her latest expos\u00e9, she felt a spark of resentment. Why did everyone always ask her about work? Didn't they know how exhausting it was to constantly chase down leads and meet deadlines?\n\nAs the conversation drew to a close, the woman excused herself to grab another cup of coffee, leaving her feeling a little bitter. Maybe it was just the caffeine kicking in, but suddenly, everything seemed to taste slightly sour.\n\nAlex slid onto the bench beside her, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. \"Hey, sorry about that,\" he said, noticing her distant expression. But before she could respond, he leaned in and whispered, \"I have a surprise for you tonight.\"<|eot_id|>"

A text from Alex saying 'hey, love you' and nothing more. No apologies for leaving early again, no explanation for why he's been MIA all week. Just a bunch of empty assuring words that make me feel like crap.\n\nAnd then, to top it off, I had to deal with Mrs. Johnson's family drama AGAIN. Her kid's got a concussion from playing hockey, and now she's breathing down my neck about how I didn't document everything properly. Like, hello! I've been doing this job for five years, and I know what I'm doing. But does anyone listen? Nope.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions. Nursing school was hard, but at least back then I knew I was making a difference. Now, I'm just a cog in the machine, churning out paperwork and pretending to care about some stranger's vitals.\n\nAlex always said I was his rock, but right now, I don't even know if I'm that person anymore. Maybe I never was. All I know is that I'm sick of feeling like shit all the time, and I need someone to take responsibility for once. Not just send me a vague ass message and expect me to be okay with it.\"<|eot_id|>"

It's been months since she passed away, but some days it feels like just yesterday.\n\nI pulled into the driveway, already knowing what I'd find inside. My mind had been racing all day about the lecture I gave to one of my residents this morning. Something about bedside manner... she always got under my skin when it came to that. I swear, she thought she knew it all.\n\nAs I stepped out of the car, a gust of wind hit me, sending papers flying everywhere. I sighed and bent down to gather them. That's when I saw it - a small package with no return address, sitting on the porch. My heart sank.\n\nIt wasn't until I opened the box that I realized what it was. A framed photo of her and our kids at the beach. We used to take vacations together every summer. Now, those memories feel like a cruel joke.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked around the yard. Everything looks different now. The flowers are wilting, the trees are bare... even the birds seem to have stopped singing. It's like nature itself is mourning the loss of my wife.\n\nI'm trying to hold it together, but it's getting harder by the minute. I keep thinking I see her standing behind me, watching me, waiting for me to let go. But she's really gone. I know that.\n\nI need to get inside, lock myself in the study and try to make sense of all these emotions swirling inside me. Maybe then I can start to heal. But for now, I'm stuck in this never-ending nightmare, reliving every moment we shared, every argument we had... every memory that haunts me.\n\nI took a deep breath and forced myself to move towards the house. As I walked through the door, I noticed something else on the kitchen counter. A note, scribbled in hasty handwriting:\n\n\"I'll never forget you.\"\n\nMy eyes welled up with tears as I read the words over and over again. Who wrote this? And why? Is this some kind of sick game they're playing?\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. Every step feels like a betrayal, every breath a reminder that I'm still alone. The bitterness is suffocating me, crushing me beneath its weight.\n\nAnd yet... I'm angry too. Angry at the world for taking everything from me. Angry at the universe for being so cruel. Angry at... \n\nI couldn't finish the sentence. I just stood there, frozen in time, as the darkness closed in around me.<|eot_id|>"

All for nothing. The emails kept piling up \u2013 a constant reminder that she wasn't good enough. Not yet, anyway.\n\nHer mind wandered to her old job at the newspaper, where she'd been a respected journalist for years. But that was before she got laid off during the last round of budget cuts. Now, it seemed like every door she opened led to more rejection and disappointment.\n\nEmily sighed, feeling the familiar sting of irritation creeping up her neck. Why did they always have to make it so hard? She thought about her friends, who'd all found success in their careers by now. They were married, had kids, and were living the dream. Meanwhile, Emily was stuck in this never-ending cycle of rejection and uncertainty.\n\nWith a scowl, she deleted the email and began typing out another cover letter, determined to prove them wrong once again.

You've been MIA for days.' I hesitated for a beat before responding, 'Just...just give me some time, okay?'\n\nTime. Easy for her to say. She didn't have to deal with the crushing weight of rejection. I flopped down onto the couch in our tiny apartment, burying my face in a pillow as tears pricked at the corners of my eyes.\n\nWhy did he do this to me? What did I ever do wrong? Wasn't I enough? The questions swirled in my head like a toxic storm, leaving me gasping for air.\n\nI tossed off the pillow and stumbled over to the kitchen, grabbing a glass of wine from the cabinet. As I poured it, my hand trembled, spilling half the liquid down the side. I felt a sob building in my throat, and before I knew it, I was crying uncontrollably.\n\nThe wine dripped onto the counter, forming a sticky puddle as I collapsed against the sink, my body shaking with sobs. Who did I think I was kidding? That everything would magically fix itself? That Alex would come crawling back, apologizing profusely and promising to make up for lost time?\n\nNope. He was gone, and I was left picking up the pieces of my shattered heart.<|eot_id|>"
