The clock hands mocked him at 1:30 AM; it was too late for sleep and too early for breakfast prep. His phone's flashlight flickered on, casting eerie shadows in the dark room. He stumbled to the fuse box, fingers trembling with anger and exhaustion.\n\nFucking hell, this is the third time this month! he cursed silently, his mind racing back to a memory of his ex-wife, Sarah, laughing at him for being too paranoid about safety checks. But now, it was just John and his goddamn neurotic tendencies in this empty shell of an apartment.\n\nHe yanked open the door to the fuse box, squinting at the mess of wires. His heart pounded in his chest like a fucking drum solo. He'd been neglecting himself, he knew that - late nights at the restaurant, early mornings alone in the cold apartment, no one to share breakfast with anymore.\n\nSarah had left him for some city banker with a nine-to-five and a manicured lawn. \"You're never there,\" she'd said, her voice echoing in their once-shared bedroom. And now, he was always fucking here, but the goddamn power kept failing him.\n\nJohn's fingers fumbled over the switches, his mind wandering back to Sarah's laughter, her warm touch, the comforting hum of their shared life. His throat tightened, and he felt that familiar sting behind his eyes - tears threatening to spill over like a fucking leaky faucet.\n\nSuddenly, there was a spark, followed by a loud pop. The fuse box exploded in a cloud of smoke. John stumbled back, coughing, his heart pounding wildly. \"Fuck!\" he yelled into the darkness, his voice echoing through the empty apartment. He was alone, again, with only his anger and neglect for company.",

Maybe if I was more like those city bankers, all successful and put together, they wouldn't leave me for someone else.\n\nBut no, I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company.

I seen 'em in the display case last week when I was there for coffee with the chief. She'd been cooing over them like they were the eighth wonder of the world. Must've popped right out and bought 'em soon as my back was turned.\n\nI watched her, all dolled up, walking down the street arm in arm with that no-good husband of hers, Bob. He's always been a flashy one, but now he's got himself a new toy to show off too - some shiny sports car parked out front of their house every morning. I swear it's like they're trying to rub it in my face.\n\nI remember when we started on the force together, back in '75. We were both just kids, eager and green. We'd share war stories over beers after our shifts, laugh till our sides hurt. But that was before life got in the way, before she got her claws into him.\n\nNow here they are, strolling down Main like they own the place. She's got her new pearls around her neck, and he's wearing a grin wider than the Grand Canyon. I can feel it rising up inside me, hot and bitter. Envy's a nasty beast, always has been. It's gnawing at my insides, making my hands shake on the steering wheel.\n\nI pull over, watching them through the windshield as they head into that fancy new caf\u00e9. The one she made such a fuss about when it opened last month. I can hear her now, \"Oh, Martha, you simply must try their lattes! They're to die for!\"\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to push down the green monster inside me. But it's no use. It's still there, clawing at my throat like a wild animal. I can feel tears pricking at the corners of my eyes, and not just because of the smoke from that damn car backfiring down the street.\n\nI sit here for a while longer, watching them through the window as they laugh and chat with the other patrons. They look so happy, so carefree. And here I am, stuck in my old cruiser, alone except for this ugly feeling churning in my gut.\n\nIt's not fair, I think to myself. She didn't even want him at first. But now...now she's got everything. The husband, the house, the fancy cars, and those goddamn pearls. And what do I have? A cold bed, an empty house, and a heart full of envy.\n\nI wipe away a tear, take one last look at them through the window, then put my car in gear and drive off into the setting sun.",

Meanwhile, I'm stuck in neutral, going nowhere fast.\n\nHer husband, Bob, may seem like a flashy distraction, but let's be real \u2013 he's just a prop in her game of life. She's the one who really pulls the strings. I mean, have you seen the way she carries herself? Confident, poised, and always in control. Me? I'm just along for the ride, trying to keep up with her pace.\n\nWe used to be friends, back in the day. Shared laughs and war stories over beers.

Maybe I should just stick to my old routine \u2013 coffee with the chief, maybe a quick nap before dinner.

As he dusted off her favorite scarlet yarn, he found something tucked beneath it - an unopened letter addressed to him in Martha's neat, looping handwriting.\n\nHe sat down on the worn-out rocking chair, his heart pounding softly like a distant drumbeat. He could almost feel Martha beside him, her gentle hands guiding his as they'd once opened Christmas presents together. But not this time. This was hers alone to send even after she was gone.\n\nWith trembling fingers, George carefully tore open the envelope and unfolded the crisp paper inside. It was a letter written in blue ink, the same shade Martha used for her daily journals that now sat gathering dust on their shared bookshelf.\n\n\"Dearest George,\" it began, and his eyes welled up with tears. He knew what this was - a final goodbye from his beloved wife who had slipped away quietly one chill winter morning.\n\nHe read on, her words filling the empty room with memories:\n\n*Remember our walks by the lake when autumn leaves crunched underfoot? I want you to keep walking, George. Don't stop because I'm not there.

It was nothing more than a fleeting storm between two people who loved each other deeply.*\n\nGeorge felt a pang of guilt pierce through him like a knife twisting slowly.

Now, Martha's words brought it all rushing back - their raised voices, her tear-streaked face, his stubborn refusal to apologize...\n\nHe folded the letter carefully and placed it back inside its envelope.

Like, what's the point of even trying? We're just going to get slammed today, and I'll be stuck here dealing with all these...people.\n\nI saw that young couple come in earlier, and it just made me want to scream. They were so happy, so carefree. Meanwhile, I'm over here drowning in my own misery. I mean, who needs happiness when you've got bills to pay and a house to keep up?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the stuff they buy. Towels, kettles, throw rugs...it's all just a reminder of everything I've lost. My husband, my friends, my sense of purpose...all gone. And now I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company.\n\nI tried to put on a good face for that young guy, but honestly, I was struggling to breathe. He asked if I was okay, and I just nodded and handed him his change. What's the point of pretending? It's not like anything's going to change.\n\nMy supervisor came over and suggested I take a break, but I know it won't make a difference. Nothing ever does. I'll just end up sitting in some cramped office, staring at the wall, wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nI guess that's just life, right? One disappointment after another. I'll just keep trudging along, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Because that's what always happens, isn't it?<|eot_id|>"

It was fucking bullshit that she'd left him here, in this godforsaken kitchen, while she was off painting her little heart away at some retreat. \"Artistic expression,\" my ass, he muttered, slamming a knife onto the counter.\n\nHe knew it wasn't about the cooking anymore. Not since they'd lost the baby. She blamed him for working late nights, for not being there when she needed him most. But fuck, he was here now, weren't he? Chopping and stirring like his life depended on it, trying to keep this goddamn restaurant afloat. And her... she was off chasing rainbows while their marriage was slowly burning down around them.\n\nHe paused, staring at the pile of neatly diced onions. It used to be their thing, cooking together. Now it just felt like another fucking chore. He took a deep breath, his chest heavy with sadness and anger. Then he grabbed the pan, pouring in more oil than necessary. Tonight, he'd cook like there was no tomorrow. And maybe, just maybe, she'd come home to find their marriage still on the menu.",

I'm the one who's been holding everything together while she's off chasing her dreams. And what does she do? She leaves me here, alone, to pick up the pieces. Like I'm some kind of servant, waiting to cater to her every whim.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the baby. If only she hadn't gotten pregnant, none of this would have happened. None of the stress, the tension, the constant fighting. We wouldn't be stuck in this rut, and I wouldn't be so resentful all the time.\n\nBut no, instead she gets to paint her pretty pictures and live her best life, while I'm stuck here, dealing with the consequences of her choices.
