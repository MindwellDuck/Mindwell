Today, however, today he couldn't avoid it any longer.

It wasn't fair. They had plans, dreams - a life together that now seemed as fragile as the paper he clutched.\n\nA sudden beep from his radio jolted him back to reality. He snatched it up, barking a response into the receiver. As he listened to the dispatcher's words, Daniel knew: tonight would be another sleepless night, another endless patrol through the city streets, another attempt to outrun the fear gnawing at his insides.\n\nBut for now, he stood there, alone in the harsh glow of his kitchen light, clutching Emily's letter like a lifeline.

It was Dr. Thompson, his voice as crisp and sterile as the hospital corridors. \"Harold,\" he began, \"I've been looking over Mrs. Abernathy's charts.

Loneliness didn't begin to describe the cavernous emptiness that opened up within him. He wasn't just alone in this cold, antiseptic building; he was alone in his knowledge, his experience, his right to care for these patients with the same fierce protectiveness he'd shown Martha's children when they were sick.\n\nAs he looked down at Mrs. Abernathy's chart, her smile lines and creases of worry seemed to stare back at him, accusing. He felt a surge of anger, then despair. Was he losing his touch? Or was he just an old dog, too set in his ways to see the world changing around him?\n\nHe stood up abruptly, knocking over his mug filled with pens. They scattered like patients fleeing a ward. He didn't bother picking them up. Instead, he walked out, leaving the office door swinging open behind him, a stark contrast to the sterile, controlled environment he'd maintained for decades.\n\nBut as he stepped into the dimly lit corridor, the silence seemed louder than ever.
