Single as they come, too busy chasing inspiration to chase tail, you know?\n\nHe's been feeling... off lately. Not quite himself. Like something's lurking just out of sight, waiting to pounce. Fear, yeah, that's it. He's scared, but he ain't gonna admit it. Not even to himself.\n\nOne day, he's in his studio, late at night - like always. Brushes flying, paint splattering everywhere. He's trying to capture something, anything. But the canvas just mocks him, a blank, white void staring back at him. Mocking him.\n\nSuddenly, he hears it. A noise. Like something... shifting. In the corner of his eye, but when he turns, nothing's there. Just shadows dancing on the wall. He shakes it off, tries to focus on his work again.\n\nBut then, another noise. Louder this time. Closer. His heart's pounding now, like a drum in his ears. He turns, and... what the hell is that? A figure, standing right there in his studio. Dark, blurred around the edges. It shouldn't be there. He knows he locked up.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he yells, trying to sound brave. But it comes out all shaky. The figure doesn't move. Doesn't answer. Just stands there, staring at him with... those eyes. Empty, hollow. They're terrifying.\n\nHe drops his brush, steps back. Trips over a canvas, falls on his ass. Still, the figure just stands there. Then, slowly, it starts to advance. Step by step. Closer and closer.\n\nHe's frozen, can't move, can't scream. Panic surges through him like a tidal wave. He wants to run, but his body won't listen. The figure looms over him now, those empty eyes boring into him. And then, it reaches out...\n\nHis heart stops. Time freezes. And then... the lights flicker and go out.\n\nBlackness. Silence. Just the echo of his own racing heartbeat in his ears. He blinks, looks around. The figure's gone. Vanished like it was never there. But he knows better. It was there. It was real. And now... now it's really freaking him out.\n\nHe stumbles out of the studio, leaves everything behind. He doesn't know what just happened, but one thing's for sure - he ain't going back in there alone, ever again. Not until he figures this shit out. But who can he tell? Who'd believe him?\n\nSo here he is, a grown-ass man, scared shitless by... something. Something he can't explain or understand. And all because he couldn't just keep his damn studio lights on.",

A single guy, struggling to make ends meet, wasting my time chasing some pipe dream.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on my studio. It's a mess, a complete disaster. I've got paint everywhere, canvases stacked haphazardly... it's a wonder I haven't set myself on fire yet. And the noises, oh god, the noises.

I mean, I'm a rational person, I know it's probably just my imagination playing tricks on me. But still, it's hard to shake the feeling that something's off. Maybe I'll just stick to painting at night, when it's dark and quiet. That way, I can avoid whatever it is that's haunting me.\n\nI'm telling you, it's not worth it.

She was the one who'd encouraged him to apply again after last year's rejection, saying they needed his innovative mind in their esteemed institution. But it seemed no one appreciated his work anymore.\n\nHenry scoffed, pushing away from his desk. \"Good for nothing, leeches,\" he grumbled, pacing around his study like a caged lion. He'd spent decades dedicated to his research, yet these young Turks had the audacity to dismiss him? He felt a bitter taste rise in his throat.\n\nHe paused by the bookshelf, his gaze landing on Clara's book still tucked away there. He hadn't touched it since she left - \"We're just growing apart,\" she'd said, packing her bags. Henry picked up the book now, flipping through its pages absently. Perhaps they were right; maybe he was past his prime.\n\nBut damn them all if they thought he'd give up without a fight. He tossed Clara's book onto his desk with determination burning in his eyes.

It reminded him of nights spent in empty houses, echoes of family laughter still lingering in the air like ghosts.\n\nHis gaze wandered to the photograph on the counter: him and Laura on their wedding day, smiles wide and eyes bright with hope. He traced her image gently, sadness welling up within him. Divorce papers lay tucked away in a drawer, collecting dust alongside old memories.\n\nAnother thud, louder this time. Jamie stood abruptly, chair screeching against the floor. He grabbed his flashlight from its hook by the door, heart pounding in his chest.

It was enough to make the girl shake her head, her eyes darting nervously between Maria and Rick.\n\n\"He's a fucking liar,\" Maria continued, her anger boiling over like lava from a volcano. \"He'll promise you the world, then leave you for dead when he gets bored. He's a cheating piece of shit who couldn't keep his dick in his pants even on our wedding night.\"\n\nThe girl gasped, recoiling from Rick as if she'd been burned. Maria could see the realization dawning in her eyes\u2014the same realization that had taken Maria years to accept.\n\nRick sneered, grabbing the girl's arm and pulling her back against him. \"You're just jealous, Maria,\" he spat. \"Always were, always will be.\"\n\nShe laughed\u2014a harsh, bitter sound that echoed through the alleyway like a scream. \"Jealous?\" she asked, her voice shaking with barely contained rage. \"No, Rick. I'm not jealous of you anymore. But I am angry. And I want vengeance.\"\n\nAnd with that, she turned and walked away, leaving them both standing in the filthy alley\u2014the girl with her newfound knowledge, and Rick with nothing but his lies and his pathetic excuses. Maria wouldn't wait for karma to catch up with him. She'd see to it herself, one way or another.",

        "Generated Assessment": "I'd been waiting for what felt like an eternity for my ex to show up again. I mean, I knew he was back in town, but I never thought I'd run into him like this - in front of some young chick who clearly thinks she can tame him. Newsflash, Rick: nobody tames you. You're a lost cause.\n\nI watched as he smiled at me, all smug and self-assured, like he owns the place. Well, let me tell you something, buddy - you don't own anything except your own ego. And that's about to get shattered.\n\nI saw how he looked at me, like I was some kind of joke. Like I was the one who was crazy for thinking we could make it work. But you know what? I'm not crazy. I'm just tired of being played. Tired of being treated like dirt.\n\nThat girl, though - she had no idea what she was getting herself into. I could see it in her eyes, the fear and uncertainty. Yeah, good luck with that, sweetie. You're going to need it.\n\nWhen Rick started talking, I tuned him out. I didn't care about his excuses or his lies. All I cared about was making him understand that he's not as slick as he thinks he is. That he's not above hurting people, including me.\n\nBut what really got under my skin was when he said I looked like crap. Like, hello? I've been dealing with the aftermath of our divorce for years. I've been trying to move on, to heal. And you know what? I'm doing just fine. Without you.\n\nAs I walked away, I could feel his eyes on me, but I didn't look back. I didn't need to. I knew exactly where I was going - straight into the fire, where he belonged.<|eot_id|>"
