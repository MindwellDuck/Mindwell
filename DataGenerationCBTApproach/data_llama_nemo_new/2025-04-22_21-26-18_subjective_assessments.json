Now, merely a shadow of his former self, his fingers trembled over the yellowed keys of his typewriter. The machine, much like its owner, had seen better days.\n\nThe telephone rang, shattering the silence with such abruptness that he started, knocking over an empty glass. It was they, from the newspaper. They'd found out about the fabrication, the embellishment that had grown like weeds in his articles, choking the truth. He'd meant well, he thought, trying to make a difference when no one else would. But it mattered little now.\n\nHis heart pounded in his chest as he listened to the voice on the other end, a voice laced with disappointment and disgust. They were pulling his byline, stripping him of his column, his dignity. He was, after all, nothing more than a fraud, a charlatan peddling falsehoods under the guise of journalism.\n\nAs the call ended, he felt the shame wash over him like a tidal wave, drowning him in its intensity. His reflection stared back at him from the dark window, accusing and judgemental. How had he let this happen? How had he allowed his passion to be consumed by deceit?\n\nHe reached for the bottle of whiskey hidden beneath some papers, but paused. It wouldn't change anything. Nothing would. He was a has-been, a joke, a laughing stock. The thought gnawed at him, tearing through his flesh like a ravenous beast.\n\nSuddenly, he felt an overwhelming urge to purge himself, to confess his sins and make amends. But who would listen? Who would care? He was nothing now, a relic of a bygone era, a man adrift in a sea of his own shameful making.\n\nHis hands, once steady and sure, now shook uncontrollably as he reached for the typewriter again. Perhaps, he thought, perhaps there was still a way to redeem himself, to find redemption in the only thing he knew - words. But even as the thought crossed his mind, he knew it was too late. The damage was done, and like him, it would remain until the end of time.",

Her heart pounded in her chest like a trapped animal, each beat echoing through her ears, drowning out the usual hum of equipment.\n\nShe had come in early today, as she often did since...well, since. The lab was her sanctuary now, away from the echoes of laughter and warmth that haunted their once-shared home. Today, however, it felt more like a cage, the walls closing in with each flicker of the fluorescent lights.\n\nAmelia's hands trembled as she adjusted the focus, blurring the slide's contents into abstract patterns. She missed him terribly; every cell in her body screamed for his presence. But today, the ache was different, sharper. It had been a year since he'd passed, but some days it felt like yesterday.\n\nShe reached into her pocket, fingers brushing against cold metal. A habit now, to touch his dog tags before each experiment. But today, they slipped from her grasp, clattering onto the lab bench with an ungodly noise in the quiet room. She flinched, heart hammering even harder.\n\nHer gaze darted around the lab, taking in the ordered chaos of test tubes and beakers, the neat stacks of notebooks filled with meticulous records. Everything was as it should be, yet everything felt wrong. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, a sense of impending doom hanging heavy in the air.\n\nThen she saw it: a lone photograph on her desk, turned face down. It had been upright when she arrived. A chill ran down her spine, and not from the lab's refrigerated air conditioning. She picked up the frame with trembling hands, turning it over to reveal their smiling faces at some long-forgotten conference.\n\nTears welled up in her eyes, blurring the image. She blinked them away, but more came, flowing freely down her cheeks now, unchecked. Her breath hitched, coming in ragged gasps as panic surged through her veins like wildfire.\n\nWhat was happening? Was she losing it? This couldn't be...this wasn't how it worked, not after all these years of coping, of functioning, of pushing forward despite the emptiness inside. Yet here she was, crumbling at the seams over a damned photograph.\n\nHer phone rang suddenly, slicing through her panic like a knife. She fumbled for it, knocking over test tubes in her haste. It was her daughter, calling from across the country where she'd moved after...after everything. Amelia's heart twisted again, fresh waves of guilt and sorrow crashing against her.\n\n\"Hello?\" Her voice came out barely above a whisper, cracking with emotion.\n\n\"Mom? Are you okay? You sound...weird.\" Her daughter's concern only made things worse. Amelia felt the dam break, tears spilling over as sobs wracked her body.\n\n\"I-I'm fine,\" she managed between gasps. \"I just...I miss him so much today.\"\n\nThere was a pause on the line before her daughter responded softly, \"I know, Mom. I do too.\"",

She could feel it, that familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach, coiling around her lungs and squeezing the air out of them. Her wedding ring felt suddenly too tight, biting into her finger as if to remind her of her commitments.\n\nThe classroom door creaked open behind her, and she jumped, whirling around to find young Timothy, one of her students, shuffling in. His eyes were downcast, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his hoodie. He looked up at her with those big, worried eyes, and her heart ached for him. But it also screamed at her, What if he's here because I failed him? What if he needs help? Help I can't give right now!\n\n\"Timothy,\" she said, her voice too loud in the quiet room, \"what are you doing here?\"\n\nHe shrugged, his shoulders hunched up around his ears. \"I...I left my history book here yesterday.

You're falling behind.\"\n\nHis eyes flickered up to hers, then away again. \"I know,\" he mumbled. \"I'll try harder.\"\n\nShe watched him leave, the classroom door clicking shut behind him with a finality that made her want to scream.

And now she'd be late for dinner too, another mark against her in her husband's ledger.\n\nHer phone buzzed on her desk, a reminder from him: *Dinner's at 7. I hope you're almost done.*\n\nShe looked back at the clock, then down at the stack of papers still waiting to be graded. She felt the anxiety rise up inside her like bile, threatening to choke her.

Every single parent has been breathing down my neck lately, trying to control every little thing. They think they're so much better than me, with their perfect families and their spotless records. Newsflash: nobody's perfect. And I'm sick of all these people trying to dictate what I do.\n\nIt's always the same story - someone calls me, complaining about something, and then I have to deal with the fallout. Like, what even is the point of having parents if they're just going to try to ruin everything? I swear, sometimes I wonder why I even bother showing up to those meetings.\n\nAnyway, I told Mrs. Harris I'd talk to Mr. Jenkins tomorrow, but honestly, I don't see the need. I know what I'm doing, and if some stuffy old man doesn't like it, that's his problem. Can't let people like him bring me down. Not now, not ever.<|eot_id|>"

And him? Oh, he's just loving it, isn't he? Mr. \"I Can't Even Turn On The Damn Coffee Maker\" suddenly an expert in computers because his grandson showed him how to use a smartphone.\n\n\"You should take it easy, dear,\" he says, like I'm some frail old thing who can't tell the difference between 'print' and 'println'. I've got more lines of code under my belt than he's got hairs on his head. Hell, I was writing assembly language before he even knew what an algorithm was.\n\nAnd now, look at this mess. He's been fiddling around with my workstation again, \"just trying to help.\" Goddammit, if I wanted it changed, I'd change it myself. But nooo, Mr. Helpful here has to go and save over my fucking code. And when I ask him about it, he just shrugs and says, \"I thought you'd want the newer version.\"\n\nYeah, well, fuck that noise. He thinks he can waltz in here and play tech support because he knows how to update his Facebook status? I oughta show him what a real glitch looks like.",

Decades of coding, and I've got the scars to prove it. My brain's like a rusty gate - it creaks and groans whenever someone tries to explain something new to me.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that young whippersnapper. He thinks he's so smart just because he can turn on his phone. I mean, what does he know about real programming? I've written software that ran on mainframes back when those were still called \"big iron\". He's just a pretender, playing dress-up in my office.\n\nBut honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm the one who's lost touch. Everyone's moving so fast, and I'm just...well, I'm just not keeping up. I try to keep up appearances, but inside, I'm freaking out. What if I mess up? What if I break something? No, no, no...I need to stay calm. I need to remind myself that I've done this before. A million times before.\n\nIt's just...sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I just...you know...retired already. Would anyone care? Or would they just say, \"Oh, poor old man, he couldn't hack it\"? Yeah, that's probably what they'd say. Poor old man.<|eot_id|>"
