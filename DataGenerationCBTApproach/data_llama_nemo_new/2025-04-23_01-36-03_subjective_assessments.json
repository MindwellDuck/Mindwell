She'd spent hours in surgery, her hands steady as always, but her mind a whirlwind of worry over her mother's upcoming biopsy results. Her partner, Susan, had been reassuring on the phone, but Amelia could hear the concern in her voice too.\n\nJust when she thought she could finally sit down and grab a bite, the hospital paging system blared to life with an emergency code blue. A patient in the ER had gone into cardiac arrest. Amelia sighed, her lunch untouched. \"Of course,\" she muttered, grabbing her pager and rushing out the door.\n\nThe patient was a middle-aged man, same age as Amelia's brother who'd passed years ago from undetected heart disease. She felt a familiar pang of worry mixed with anger at herself for not pushing harder for more tests when he'd first complained of chest pain.\n\nAs she led the team through compressions and ventilations, her mind raced. What if it was cancer? What if they couldn't catch it early enough? What if... what if she lost another loved one to something she couldn't fix?\n\nThe man's heart rhythm stabilized just as Amelia felt hers racing too fast. She stepped back, handing off care to the ER doc on duty. \"Keep him here for observation,\" she barked, then stormed out of the room, leaving behind a trail of worry and sarcastic mutterings about how some days it felt like she was fighting a losing battle against fate.",

But do I get any credit for trying? Nope.\n\nI tried to keep my cool during that procedure, but honestly, it's hard not to feel like I'm drowning in this sea of incompetence. The ER doc seemed clueless, and don't even get me started on the hospital's lack of resources. It's like they're all just waiting for me to fail so they can say \"we told you so.\"\n\nAnd now, after all that stress, I have to deal with Susan's worried voice on the phone. Like, hello, I appreciate your concern, but I've got this under control. I just wish everyone else would trust me for once. Maybe then I wouldn't feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders.\n\nOh well, back to the trenches. Time to put on my superhero cape and save the day again. Again. And again.
