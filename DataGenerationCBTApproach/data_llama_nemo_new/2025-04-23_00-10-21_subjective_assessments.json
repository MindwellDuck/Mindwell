My marriage is over, and I'm stuck in this rut, while she's probably out there living her best life. \n\nI glance at that stupid photo on the wall, and it just makes me feel worse. We were happy once, I know we were. But I messed it up, and now look at me. A hot mess, just like my life. I swear, every time I think about it, I feel like I'm drowning in my own shit. \n\nWhat's wrong with me, anyway? Can't even keep a relationship going. And now I'm stuck with this miserable job, dealing with entitled customers all day. It's like I'm just a joke, a pathetic excuse for a human being. I hate days like this, where I just want to crawl under a rock and hide. \n\nBut no, I've got to get up, put on a fake smile, and pretend like everything is okay. Like anyone cares. I'm just a shell of what I used to be, a hollow imitation of someone who actually knows what they're doing. And to make matters worse, I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole adult thing. Maybe I should just give up now and save everyone the trouble.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "**Title:** The Unmarked Papers\n\nJohn had been teaching high school history for over three decades. He knew every damn kid by heart, their quirks, their dreams, and sometimes even their fucking secrets. But today, it felt like they were all strangers.\n\nHe'd assigned a project on the Civil War, something he was passionate about, expecting at least some spark of interest from his students. But when he gathered the papers after class, not one had his name scrawled on them in that neat, cursive handwriting of his. Not even fucking one.\n\n\"Who the hell took my papers?\" he barked into the empty classroom, anger boiling inside him like a goddamn kettle. He knew damn well they were his. He'd spent hours grading them over the weekend, pouring over every single word, giving feedback that would help these kids grow. And now, they were fucking gone.\n\nHis sadness was a heavy weight in his chest, but anger was easier to grasp onto. \"I swear to God,\" he muttered, slamming his fist on his desk, \"if I find out who did this...\" His voice trailed off, lost in the echo of his own threat.\n\nHe knew it wasn't just about the papers. It was about respect, about caring enough about something to not just throw it away. He felt a prickling behind his eyes, but he wouldn't cry. Not here, not where anyone could see.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he spat out, kicking his chair so hard it toppled over. \"Fuck this shit.\" He stormed out of the classroom, leaving the door swinging wildly behind him.",

I've been doing this for years, and it's always the same thing. They show up, collect their paycheck, and forget about me. I'm just a ghost to them.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the project. I thought maybe, just maybe, someone would actually learn something from it. But nope, not a single one of them even bothered to write their name on the paper. It's like they're trying to make me feel invisible.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I'm just wasting my time. Maybe I should just give up and let them figure everything out on their own. At least that way, I won't have to deal with their apathy anymore.\n\nI'll just stick to grading papers and collecting paychecks. That's all I'm good for anyway.<|eot_id|>"
