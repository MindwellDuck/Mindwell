She's been calling for hours, leaving voicemails filled with concern, then frustration, now resigned silence. You've ignored every call. You don't have time for this shit right now.\n\nYou sigh, running a hand through your greasy hair. You haven't seen Sarah in days. Hell, you haven't slept in days either. You were supposed to be at her place hours ago, but these damn samples... They're not cooperating, and neither is your goddamn life.\n\nYou grab your phone, scrolling through the missed calls, voicemails, texts. The last one reads, \"I can't do this anymore, Sam. I need some space.\" You feel a pang of something - guilt? Annoyance? You're not sure, and you don't care right now. You toss the phone back onto the counter with a curse.\n\nYou lean back in your chair, staring at the ceiling tiles, trying to ignore the lab equipment humming around you like some goddamn white noise machine. This is what you wanted, isn't it? To be a big shot scientist, making groundbreaking discoveries? Fuck relationships, fuck sleep, fuck everything that's not this goddamn research.\n\nBut as you sit there, alone in the sterile glow of the lab lights, you can't shake the feeling that something just slipped through your fingers.

Newsflash, Sarah: I'm a scientist, not a miracle worker!\n\nI mean, seriously, what's going on with us lately? We used to be so close, but now it feels like we're just roommates or something. I try to reach out to her, but she just shuts down on me. It's like she's lost all trust in me.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how she's been treating me lately.

I'm just a guy who wants to make a difference in the world.\n\nBut no, instead of supporting me, she's just holding me back. She doesn't understand what I'm going through, she doesn't see the sacrifices I'm making for science. And now, because of her, I'm stuck here in this lab all night, wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nI guess I'll just never understand her.

But here she was, hunched over this damn slide, and it was getting cold. Again. She checked her phone\u2014no messages, no \"I'm running late\" texts. Typical.\n\nJust then, the lab door creaked open. She turned, expecting to see him, but it was just one of the grad students, munching on a sandwich. He didn't even notice her, too busy chatting with his friend about some sports game she couldn't care less about.\n\nShe felt her irritation grow like a fungus under the microscope. She wasn't even supposed to be here tonight. She'd taken time off to prepare for their anniversary weekend away. But no, they'd found some new bacteria that needed identifying immediately, and who else could do it but her?\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. Maybe she should just call him. Ask where he was. No, scratch that. She didn't want to sound like one of those nagging wives. But seriously, what was taking so long?\n\nShe tried to focus back on her work, but the specimen seemed to blur before her eyes. Great, now her contacts were bothering her too. She rubbed at them, feeling a familiar gritty sensation. This was ridiculous. She stood up abruptly, knocking over a pile of papers.\n\n\"Oops,\" she muttered, bending down to pick them up. As she did, something caught her eye\u2014a text message notification flashing on her phone. It was from him. \"Stuck in traffic,\" it read. \"Won't be long now.\" She sighed, dropping the papers back onto the floor. Well, at least he'd had the decency to send a message this time.\n\nBut irritation still gnawed at her. She knew she should just wait patiently, maybe even try to enjoy the quiet lab time. But all she could think about was how hungry she was, and how tired she was of waiting on him hand and foot while he ran around like some bigshot scientist.\n\nShe sighed again, sinking back into her chair.

I feel like I'm always the one making plans and remembering things. And don't even get me started on how cold it is in here - I must have left the heater on or something.\n\nI tried calling him, but he just said he was stuck in traffic. Like, come on. That's not exactly a valid excuse. I know he's got plenty of time to stop and grab dinner. But no, instead I'm stuck here, eating cold leftovers and wondering why he never listens to me.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, I saw one of the grad students walking by and he totally ignored me. Like, I'm right there, standing next to him, and he doesn't even notice. It's like I'm invisible or something.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe we're just not meant to have a good relationship. Maybe I'm just too much to handle. I mean, I'm always nagging him and reminding him of things, and maybe he just gets tired of it.\n\nBut then I saw the text message from him - \"Stuck in traffic, won't be long now\".

It was taken at last year's school picnic; me, beaming at the camera, sandwiched between two rows of smiling faces - my students. But today, those smiles seemed like mocking reminders of what I'd lost.\n\nI'd received another email this morning from the principal. \"We regret to inform you...\" It wasn't the first, nor would it be the last. Another school was cutting their teaching positions due to budget cuts. The competition for jobs was fierce, and with my age against me, I felt like a drowning woman grasping at straws.\n\nMy thoughts drifted to her - Emily, my best friend since college. She'd found love, got married, had two beautiful children. Her life was a tapestry of warmth and joy, each thread woven with carefree laughter. And here I was, alone in my classroom, the only sound the relentless ticking of the clock.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked at the empty desks before me.

It's not healthy!\"\n\nShe slammed down the phone, leaving her mother stunned into silence on the other end. She stood there, breathing hard, hands shaking. She was alone again, in the suffocating silence of her too-quiet apartment.\n\nBut this time, she welcomed it. Anything was better than dealing with people tonight. Anything was better than explaining why she was still here, and he wasn't.",

Always barging in uninvited, expecting me to be all chatty and friendly. Newsflash: I'm not that person anymore.\n\nFive years since my husband passed away, and do they care? Nope. They just keep on smiling, oblivious to my pain. Like I'm some kind of ghost haunting these halls, invisible and irrelevant.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on my mom. Always calling, always asking how I am, always expecting me to be grateful for her concern. Grateful? Are you kidding me? She has no idea what it's like to lose someone you love. To have your whole world turned upside down.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in this silence. The apartment is too quiet, too empty. It's like everyone around me is just waiting for me to crack, to let my guard down so they can pounce. Well, let me tell you, I'm not going to make it easy for them.\n\nI slam doors, I yell on the phone, I scream into the void. Because that's what I need to do. I need to release all this pent-up anger, all this frustration. I need to remind everyone around me that I'm still here, that I'm still hurting.\n\nAnd you know what? It feels amazing. For a few minutes, at least, I forget about everything else. I forget about the loneliness, the isolation, the constant ache in my heart. All I feel is the rush of adrenaline, the thrill of rebellion.\n\nSo yeah, I'll keep slamming doors, keep yelling on the phone. Because in the end, it's not about anyone else. It's about me, and my pain, and my need to survive.<|eot_id|>"

A fucking 'Thank you' from some ungrateful prick who's more worried about his damn smartphone than the fact he almost died an hour ago. Then, I clock out and find a goddamn letter from the hospital admin. You know what it says? 'We regret to inform you...' Fuckin' 'regret', my ass! They're cutting my fucking hours because some pencil-pushing bureaucrat in HR decided we're 'overstaffed'. Overstaffed, my widowed, aching balls! I'm a goddamn doctor, not a fucking traffic cop. And to top it off, I get home to an empty house, with nothing but echoes of her laughter and the fucking silence that's been screaming at me since she left. Fuck this shit!\"",

It's like they think I'm just some robot who can magically make everything okay. Well, let me tell you something, I'm not made of miracles. I need my team, I need my support, and I need my respect.
