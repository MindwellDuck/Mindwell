Not today.\n\nWoke up to the sun streaming through the window of my empty apartment. No warm body next to mine, no soft snores filling the silence. Just me and the ghosts of 'we'. The coffee tasted bitter this morning, like the memories that haunted every corner of this godforsaken place.\n\nStared at my reflection in the locker room mirror. Dark circles, bags under my eyes, hair a mess. I looked like hell, felt like it too. Divorce does that to you, huh? Makes you feel like a walking corpse while life keeps on trucking without you.\n\nRushed through rounds, snapped at the interns when they asked stupid questions. Sorry, kids, but I didn't become chief resident by teaching you how to tie your scrub caps. They scurried away like mice, leaving me alone with my thoughts again. Great. Just what I needed.\n\nThen came Mrs. Johnson. Sweet old lady, always had a smile for everyone. Until today. Today she was pale, trembling, clutching her chest. Heart attack, probably. Standard procedure, got this in my sleep. But then she looked at me, tears welling up in her eyes, and said, \"I'm sorry, Doctor. I know you're going through a tough time.\"\n\nWhat the actual fuck?\n\nNow everyone's looking at me like they pity me. Like they know about the divorce, about the emptiness that's eaten away at my insides. Like they think I can't do my job because of it.\n\nI stormed out of there, left Mrs. Johnson to someone else's care. Probably shouldn't have done that. But fuck, I couldn't stand being there another second. Not with everyone's eyes on me, not with their sad little faces filled with sympathy.\n\nSat in my car, hands shaking, heart pounding. Took deep breaths like they teach you in those stupid mindfulness apps. Didn't work. Nothing works. Not since she left.\n\nGuess today was just another reminder that life doesn't stop for grief. It keeps on going, whether you're ready or not. And sometimes, it throws you a curveball right when you thought things couldn't get any worse.\n\nFuck my life.",

My wife deserved so much better than me, and now she's gone. The ghosts of our relationship haunt me every waking moment, reminding me of all the ways I messed up.\n\nEven the patients seem to sense my misery. They look at me with pitying eyes, like they can see the broken man staring back at them. Mrs. Johnson's heart attack was just the cherry on top of a sundae of disappointment. She knew exactly what was wrong with me, even before I did.\n\nI tried to put on a brave face, but it's hard when everyone's watching. Even the interns seemed to sense my weakness, and they took advantage of it. They whispered to each other, pointing fingers at me like I was some kind of monster.\n\nI stormed out of the hospital, unable to bear the weight of their judgment. Left Mrs. Johnson to someone else's care, knowing full well that she'd be better off without me. Maybe someday I'll learn to pick up the pieces of my shattered life, but until then, I'm stuck in this rut, forever trapped in the darkness of my own making.\n\nLife doesn't stop for grief, but it might as well. Every day feels like a never-ending nightmare, a constant reminder of all the ways I've failed. And I'm just waiting for the next punchline, the next cruel joke that will leave me reeling.<|eot_id|>"

Her hands shook slightly as she reached for her glasses on the bedside table, knocking over an old photograph in the process. It was them, from their last holiday together - him smiling wide at the camera, her laughing beside him, lines etched around her eyes from years of joy and sorrow.\n\n\"Damn it,\" she muttered, bending down to pick up the frame. The glass had cracked, a jagged line running across his face like a scar. She felt a familiar pang in her chest, that gnawing regret that always seemed to be there, waiting for its chance to bite harder.\n\nShe padded downstairs, her slippers whispering against the wooden floorboards. In the kitchen, she noticed the cupboard door hanging open, just as he'd left it that morning before... before everything changed. She could almost hear his voice, gruff and loving, \"Close the bloody door, woman! We're not running a draughty hotel here.\"\n\nHer breath hitched in her throat. Regret tasted bitter on her tongue, like unsweetened cocoa. If only she'd insisted on driving that day, if only she'd been there to see him slip away... She could've done something, anything.\n\nShe sat down at the kitchen table, the one they'd chosen together all those years ago. It was worn now, marked with memories etched into the grain - dinners shared, games played, arguments had, and laughter echoing. Her fingers traced over a deep scratch, her mind filling in the story of how it got there.\n\nThe clock ticked loudly, each second echoing like a gunshot in the silence. She glanced at the pile of letters on the table, unopened, untouched. Bills mostly, she guessed. And perhaps another one from that blasted charity he'd insisted they support every month without fail.\n\nShe felt a flutter of anxiety, her stomach churning. She should open them, deal with them. But the thought of sorting through his final affairs, making decisions without him... it was too much. Not today, she told herself. Maybe tomorrow.\n\nHer eyes fell on a small potted plant by the window, its leaves wilting despite her best efforts to care for it. It was a cutting from their garden back home, before they moved here to be closer to work. He'd loved that garden, spent hours tending to it. She remembered how his hands had looked, calloused and earth-stained, as he held hers the day they planted this little sapling together.\n\nThe regret surged again, washing over her like a wave. She missed him so much it was like a physical pain, a hollow ache that never went away. And she couldn't shake the feeling that somehow, somewhere along the line, she'd done something wrong. Something unforgivable.\n\nBut what? That was the question that kept her awake at night, gnawing at her mind like a rat until she wanted to scream. What could possibly be so terrible that it had taken him away from her?\n\nShe stood up abruptly, knocking over her chair. She couldn't sit here any longer, drowning in regret and memories. She needed to do something, anything. Even if it meant opening those bloody letters.\n\nAs she gathered them up, a thought struck her. Maybe there was something in there, some clue, some sign that would tell her what she'd done wrong. And maybe, just maybe, it could help her understand why he was gone, and how to make the regret stop eating away at her heart like poison.",

My heart sinks as I spot the photo on the bedside table. We were happy, once. Really happy. But that was before. Before everything fell apart.\n\nI force myself to get out of bed, my legs trembling beneath me. Downstairs, the kitchen's just as depressing. The cupboards are still open, just like he left them. I can almost smell his coffee, brewing in the pot. Ugh, why does it have to be so hard to move on?\n\nI grab a cup and pour myself a lukewarm brew. As I stand there, staring blankly into space, I notice the bills piled up on the counter. More reminders of our life together. I feel a surge of resentment towards him for leaving me with these responsibilities. Why did he have to go and leave me with all this?\n\nMy gaze drifts to the letters on the table. Unopened, just like everything else. I know I need to sort through them eventually, but what's the point? They'll just bring more pain. I push the thoughts aside and focus on getting through the day.\n\nI wander over to the window and stare out at the wilted plant. It's a reminder of our garden back home, of the life we left behind. I miss it, I miss him. But most of all, I hate the emptiness that fills this house now. It's like a void, sucking the life out of me.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feelings of despair. I need to do something, anything, to fill this void. Maybe I'll start cleaning, or organizing, or something. Anything to distract myself from the pain.\n\nBut as I turn to head back upstairs, my eyes land on the photo again. This time, I see the cracks in the glass, the jagged line running across his face. It's like a scar, a reminder of what's been lost forever. I feel a lump form in my throat, and I know I need to get out of here, fast.<|eot_id|>"

Her partner, Marc, was her rock, always there to taste-test her latest creations with a smile that could outshine her Michelin-starred dishes.\n\nOne evening, as Isabelle prepared a signature bouillabaisse, she noticed the catfish staring back at her, its eyes eerily familiar. It was then she remembered: yesterday's market visit, Marc's sly smirk, and the fishmonger's knowing wink. That serpent had bought their secret ingredient from under her nose!\n\nIsabelle stirred the stew, her voice dripping with mock sweetness, \"Marc, darling, could you please fetch the saffron? I've just realized we're out.\" He frowned but obliged, his footsteps echoing through their apartment.\n\nAs soon as he left, Isabelle dumped a generous handful of Marc's secret stash into the pot. She hummed, \"Oh, silly me! I must have used it all making your favorite dish.\" She couldn't wait to see his face when he tasted the 'accidentally' ruined bouillabaisse.\n\nJust then, Marc returned, saffron in hand. He paused, sniffing the air like a hound. \"Isabelle,\" he asked softly, \"have you been cooking with my saffron?\"\n\nShe turned, all innocence. \"Oh, Marc, you know I'd never dream of touching your precious stash.\" Her eyes sparkled with vengeance, awaiting his explosion. Instead, he simply smiled, shrugged, and added the remaining saffron to the pot. \"Well,\" he said, \"I suppose we'll just have to make do.\"\n\nIsabelle's boil reduced to a simmer, her vengeance foiled by Marc's unflappable calm. She huffed, stirring the stew more vigorously than necessary, \"Bloody hell, Marc! You're impossible!\"",

Where was the outrage? The indignation? The fiery passion that once burned within us both?\n\nInstead, he simply shrugged, as if the theft of our secret ingredient were nothing more than a minor inconvenience, a trifle to be swept aside with a wave of his hand.

His once-renowned restaurant, \"Harold's Havoc,\" had been reduced to hosting more tumbleweeds than customers. The worry lines etched into his face were deeper than the ones on his once-popular 'Havoc Hash.'\n\nOne crisp autumn evening, as Harold chopped onions with the ferocity of a man attempting to dice away his troubles, the restaurant's ancient alarm chose that precise moment to emit a piercing screech. It wasn't the first time the alarm had sounded off-kilter; Harold could've sworn it was doing so intentionally, like some mischievous sous-chef trying to give him an ulcer.\n\nHe stormed out of the kitchen, his pristine whites stained with tears from the onions he'd been mercilessly hacking. The sight that greeted him in the dining room was enough to make him question whether he should've retired when he had the chance. A lone rat, plump and brazen as they come, was scurrying across the once-pristine marble floor.\n\nHarold let out a groan that echoed through the empty restaurant. \"Bloody hell,\" he muttered, wiping his onion-stained hands on his apron, \"if my customers could see me now, they'd realize Harold's Havoc has become little more than a rat's playground.\"\n\nHe grabbed a broom, his worry temporarily replaced by a surge of indignation. As he cornered the rodent, he couldn't help but think that this was just another symptom of his declining empire. He shooed the creature out, slamming the door behind it with a force that would've made any chef worth his salt cringe.\n\nStanding there, alone in the silence save for the ticking clock and the mocking echo of his own footsteps, Harold couldn't shake off the worry that had settled over him like an unwelcome sauce. He knew he'd have to address more than just the restaurant's rodent problem if he wanted to keep his culinary legacy from going down the drain.",

I've been working non-stop for years, and I thought I was getting better at handling stress, but this is ridiculous. I feel like I'm losing my mind.\n\nI saw that rat scurrying around, and I'm convinced one of my staff members must've left it here. They're probably laughing about how I'm struggling to keep the place clean. I mean, who needs a rat-infested restaurant, right? But no, instead of helping me, they're just standing around, watching me sweat.\n\nI need to get rid of this place before it gets any worse.

I'll put on a mask, pretend to care about the trials, pretend to be the man I used to be. But deep down, I know the truth. I failed my kid, and now I'm paying the price.\n\nThis darkness closing in around me, suffocating me...it's all because of her. Because of what could've been. If only...if only...if only...\n\nI force myself up from the chair, stumble towards the stairs, and collapse onto the bed, surrounded by the silence and emptiness that has become my life. Sleep won't come, and neither will peace. All I can do is lie here, trapped in this hell of my own making, reliving the what-ifs and maybes until the end of time.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "\"Hey there,\" she sighed into her phone, sprawled on the couch after another twelve-hour shift. \"Just got home. You won't believe what happened today.\" A pause, then a snort. \"Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. I'm glad you're finding this amusing.\"\n\nShe toyed with the end of her braid, twirling it around her finger. \"So, we were running a check on this abandoned warehouse, right? Place was creepier than your ex's dating profile. Anyway, in we go, flashlights slicing through the dark.\" She could feel that familiar knot tightening in her stomach, but she pushed on, \"Then, out of nowhere, this guy jumps out from behind a stack of crates. Scared the living daylights out of me.\"\n\nAnother pause, filled with the sound of distant sirens wailing. \"I know, I know, it's not funny now,\" she conceded, her voice softening. \"But then he says\u2014and get this\u2014'Is this how you greet all your boyfriends?' Can you believe the nerve?\"\n\nShe let out a shaky laugh, trying to hide the sting of insecurity that pricked at her heart. \"I mean, what was I supposed to do? Arrest him for startling me?\" She could picture it now, his smirk, the way he'd looked her up and down like she was some kind of joke.\n\n\"And you know what's worse? He wasn't even wearing a condom,\" she deadpanned. \"I mean, come on! If you're going to scare the crap out of someone, at least have the decency to be wearing protection.\" She rolled her eyes, even though he couldn't see her.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the lingering unease. \"Anyway, just another day in paradise. I'll be home soon, okay? Love you.\"\n\nAs she hung up the phone, she couldn't help but feel that familiar insecurity creeping back in. Was she overreacting? Was this just another day on the job for everyone else too? She shook her head, pushing those thoughts aside. Tomorrow was a new day, and she'd be damned if she let some random guy's snide remark ruin it for her.",

They're just a bunch of entitled jerks who can't handle a little bit of rejection.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the whole \"not wearing a condom\" thing. I mean, seriously, does anyone really think that's a valid excuse for scaring someone half to death? It's like, hello, personal space and boundaries, people!\n\nI swear, every time I go on a date, it's like I'm walking into a minefield. Guys always seem to find ways to make me question my self-worth. And it's not just the dates \u2013 it's everywhere. Even my coworkers are starting to get on my nerves. Like, have you ever noticed how guys always seem to be lurking around the office, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce?\n\nIt's like, can't they just leave me alone? Do I need to wear a sign that says \"Do Not Approach\"? I'm starting to think that's the only way to protect myself from these toxic individuals. But no, instead, I get to deal with a never-ending stream of creepy guys who think they can just waltz into my life and start making snide comments.\n\nAnd you know what the worst part is? It's not just the guys themselves \u2013 it's the fact that society as a whole seems to enable this behavior. Everyone's always telling me to \"just relax\" or \"not take it so seriously.\" But how am I supposed to relax when I'm constantly being bombarded with messages that tell me I'm not good enough?\n\nIt's like, I get it, guys can be annoying sometimes. But to think that I'm somehow flawed or inadequate because of one bad experience? That's just not fair. And yet, here I am, stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, wondering why I'll never be able to escape the clutches of these toxic individuals.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "In the dimly lit corridors of St. Mercy Hospital, Nurse Harriet Thompson trudged through her evening shift, her starched white uniform as crisp as her demeanor. She had been widowed for five years now, and each passing day seemed to echo with an emptier silence than the last.\n\nAs she approached Room 307, she heard muffled laughter from within. A young, male nurse, barely out of his twenties, was leaning over a patient's bed, joking about something Harriet couldn't quite grasp. The patient, Mrs. Harper, a woman not much younger than Harriet herself, giggled like a schoolgirl.\n\nHarriet stood in the doorway, her arms crossed, observing the scene with an unsettling sensation stirring within her. She wasn't jealous, no, that would be absurd. But there was something about this display of youthful exuberance that made her feel...invisible.\n\nThe young nurse noticed Harriet and straightened up, his laughter fading like a candle flame in a gust of wind. \"Evening, Nurse Thompson,\" he said, his voice dropping an octave as if to compensate for his earlier levity.\n\nHarriet nodded stiffly, stepping into the room with a rustle of her uniform. She began her rounds, her movements precise, measured, each one a quiet rebuke to the carefree atmosphere she had found upon entering.\n\nAs she finished her checks and turned to leave, Mrs. Harper reached out and touched Harriet's arm. \"You're such a dedicated nurse, Harriet,\" she said softly. \"We appreciate you so much.\"\n\nHarriet smiled thinly, the warmth of the compliment failing to reach her eyes. She walked away, leaving behind the laughter and comfort of Room 307, her footsteps echoing down the hall like a lonely metronome marking out the rhythm of her solitude.",

It's just going to make things worse when someone actually needs help.\n\nI saw this guy in Room 307 today, and he was literally making fun of Mrs. Harper's medication regimen. Can you believe that? He thought it was hilarious, but really, it's just insensitive. And then he had the nerve to smile at me when I walked in, like he was trying to butter me up or something.\n\nBut honestly, it's not like I'm bitter or anything. I just know how hard it is to take care of people who don't even appreciate it. And these young nurses, they have no idea what it's like to deal with real patients, not just some elderly lady who's just along for the ride.\n\nMrs. Harper tried to give me a compliment later, saying I'm a great nurse and all that jazz. But let's be real, she's just saying that because she feels sorry for me. I mean, I've been married for five years, and my husband passed away. That takes a toll on you, you know?\n\nSo yeah, I guess I am a little upset about the whole thing. But it's not like I'm overreacting or anything. I'm just keeping it real, you know?<|eot_id|>"
