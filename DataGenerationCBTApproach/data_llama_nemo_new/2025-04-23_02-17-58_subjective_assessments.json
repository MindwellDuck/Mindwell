He'd been called out to a domestic disturbance, nothing new there, but as he approached the apartment door, it swung open and out stumbled little Timmy, his neighbor's kid, clutching his arm, tears streaming down his cheeks.\n\nMike had known Timmy since he was a baby, seen him grow up from afar. He'd always waved at Mike when he passed by, called him \"Officer Friendly.\" But today, those eyes were filled with something else. Fear. Disappointment. And it fucking stung.\n\nThe scene inside was a familiar one: screaming, shattered glass, the pungent smell of alcohol. But this time, there was an extra kick in the gut - Timmy's mom, drunk off her ass, pointed at Mike and slurred, \"You're supposed to protect us, Officer. Where were you when my kid needed you?\"\n\nMike felt the stares of the neighbors, the weight of their judgment. He'd let them down. He'd let Timmy down. His hands trembled as he cuffed Timmy's mom, her words echoing in his head like a goddamn mantra. Shame burned through him, hot and acidic.\n\nAs he led her out, Timmy looked up at him, those eyes still filled with tears. \"I thought you were supposed to help,\" he whispered. Mike couldn't respond, the lump in his throat was too big. All he could do was nod, a silent promise he wasn't sure he could keep.\n\nBack at the station, as he wrote up his report, every word felt like a fucking betrayal. He'd been doing this job for half his life, but tonight, it felt like he was drowning in failure. And the worst part? He knew he'd see Timmy tomorrow, and those goddamn eyes would be there, haunting him, reminding him of what he hadn't done.",

The same tired excuses, the same pathetic attempts to shift blame. It's all just a big show, and we're all just pawns in some twisted game.\n\nTake Timmy's case, for example. That kid's going to end up a statistic, a number in some cold, impersonal database. And it's all because of me, or rather, because of the system. I'm just a cog in the machine, a replaceable part. If I fail, someone else will pick up the slack. No big deal, right?\n\nBut what really gets my goat is the way everyone expects me to perform miracles. Like I'm some kind of superhero or something.
