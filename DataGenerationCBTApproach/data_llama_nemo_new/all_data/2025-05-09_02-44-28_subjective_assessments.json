One minute you're happy, the next you're stuck in some soul-sucking job, and your partner is off living his best life. And don't even get me started on how much I miss him. I mean, what if I never got to experience that carefree summer again? What if I never got to laugh with him like that?\n\nOkay, okay, I need to calm down. But honestly, what if... *sigh* Forget it. Just forget it. Don't go there, Emily. You're better off without him. Yeah, that's what I keep telling myself. But sometimes, late at night when I'm lying awake, I find myself wondering...<|eot_id|>"
