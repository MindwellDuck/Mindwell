The weight of those patient files still lingered on my desk, a constant reminder of the never-ending battle we faced. Why did she get to breeze through this shift so effortlessly? Wasn't she tired too? Did she forget about the countless hours we spent pouring over charts and discussing our concerns?\n\nHer carefree demeanor seemed almost mocking, a stark contrast to my own exhaustion. I wondered if she knew how hard I'd been pushing myself all day, if she could sense the frustration building inside me. But what did she really think? Was she secretly feeling overwhelmed too, or was she just better at hiding it behind her bright smile? The thought stung, making me feel like I was invisible once again.<|eot_id|>"

I thought back to all the times we spoke, the advice he offered, the encouragement he provided. He always seemed like a fair and honest individual. And yet, here I was, facing rejection and disappointment once again. It was as if fate itself had conspired against me.\n\nI tried to rationalize the situation, telling myself that perhaps there were extenuating circumstances that led him to make this decision. Maybe he genuinely believed his niece was the best fit for the role. But deep down, I knew better. This was a clear case of nepotism, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that justice had not been served.\n\nIt's just not right, I thought to myself. The system is supposed to work fairly, with merit-based decisions and equal opportunities for all.
