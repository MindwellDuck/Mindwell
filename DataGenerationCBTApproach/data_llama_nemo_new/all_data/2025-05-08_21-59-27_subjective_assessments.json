The lab was quiet this time of day, most of her colleagues already tucked into their families for dinner. She looked up at the clock, the hands ticking steadily towards 7 PM. He should have been here by now.\n\nHer phone remained silent, no buzz or vibration to announce his arrival. She'd left him a voicemail earlier, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked him to pick up some milk on his way home. It was their staple for breakfast, but it was running low, just like their conversations had been these past few weeks.\n\nShe felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach as she considered the possibilities. Maybe he'd lost track of time, buried deep in his own work. Or maybe... She pushed that thought away, focusing instead on the rhythmic ticking of the clock. But each tick echoed louder than the last, amplifying her worry.\n\nJust then, the door creaked open. She looked up, hope flickering in her eyes, only to be met with the janitor's apologetic smile. \"Sorry, ma'am,\" he said softly, \"I didn't mean to disturb you.\" As the door clicked shut behind him, she felt the hope fade away, replaced by a familiar, gnawing emptiness.\n\nShe returned to her coffee, now cold and unappealing. The lab felt colder too, the hum of machinery no longer comforting but isolating. She sighed, pushing back from her desk, the wheels of her chair squeaking softly in protest. Another late night awaited, another silent dinner for one.",

Do they care?\n\nThis is what happens when you're stuck in a rut, when your life is just going through the motions. You start to feel like you're invisible, like nobody cares about anything except themselves. Newsflash: we do care! We care about our relationships, our jobs, our lives!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the clock. That thing is taunting me, ticking away like it's laughing at me. Seven o'clock, seven o'clock, seven o'clock... When is he going to show up? Is he even worth showing up for?\n\nI'm done waiting around for someone who doesn't even bother to check in. I deserve better than this. I deserve someone who actually cares about me, who actually shows up. Not some lazy, good-for-nothing loser who can't even be bothered to pick up a gallon of milk.\n\nI'm outta here. I'm done with this place, done with this guy, done with everything. Forget it. I'll just go home, eat a bowl of cereal, and forget about this whole miserable existence.

He must have been too busy sleeping off his hangover to even notice the stench. I'm starting to think he's just not capable of taking care of himself, let alone us.\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is that I know he knows better. We've talked about this before - how important it is to clean up after ourselves, how gross it is to leave dirty dishes overnight. But does he listen? Nope. He just shrugs it off and expects me to swoop in and save the day. Well, let me tell you, I'm not his personal cleaning service anymore. If he can't take care of himself, maybe we shouldn't be together.\n\nI'm so done with this. I need someone who can actually contribute to our household, not just rely on me to bail him out every time. Maybe I'll just start cooking all our meals myself...<|eot_id|>"
