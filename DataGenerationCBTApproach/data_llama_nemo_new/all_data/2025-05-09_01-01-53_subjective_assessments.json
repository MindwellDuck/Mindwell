I felt a bead of sweat trickle down my spine as I accepted the cutting board, my hands shaking ever so slightly.\n\nIt was clear that the sous chef had an unyielding attention to detail, one that bordered on obsession. His fixation on the onions was almost... suffocating. I wondered if he had always been this way, or if it was simply a product of his own high standards. Whatever the case, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow inadequate, that my work would never meet his lofty expectations.\n\nAs I began to chop the onions, my mind wandered to all the times I'd seen him scrutinize our dishes, nitpicking every minor flaw. It was as if he took pleasure in pointing out our mistakes, his words dripping with condescension. I felt a surge of resentment towards him, a burning need to prove myself worthy of his approval.\n\nBut what choice did I have? I was at his mercy, subject to his whims and fancies. If I failed to meet his standards, I risked facing his wrath, his scathing criticism. The thought sent shivers down my spine, and I worked with renewed fervor, determined to prove myself, no matter the cost.<|eot_id|>"
