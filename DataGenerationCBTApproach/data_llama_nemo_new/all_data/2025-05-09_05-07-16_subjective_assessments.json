The caller ID revealed a number I hadn't seen in years, one that brought back a torrent of memories I'd rather forget.\n\nBut why did it have to be her? Why did she have to call now, when I thought I'd left all that behind? I felt a surge of anxiety course through my veins as I hesitated, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. What could she possibly want after all these years?\n\nAnd then, the sound of my daughter's voice, trembling and scared, pierced through the line. She was missing. Gone. How could this be happening? I thought we were doing everything right, providing for her, keeping her safe. But no, fate had other plans.\n\nI tried to remain calm, to think clearly, but my mind was a jumble of emotions. Fear, anger, guilt \u2013 they all swirled together, making it hard to breathe. I needed to get out of here, to do something, anything, to make things right. But what could I do? I was just a journalist, stuck in a newsroom, while my world was crumbling around me.\n\nWhy did this have to happen to me? To us? I thought we were supposed to be happy, content. But life had other plans, it seemed. And now, I was faced with the very real possibility that I might never see my daughter again.
