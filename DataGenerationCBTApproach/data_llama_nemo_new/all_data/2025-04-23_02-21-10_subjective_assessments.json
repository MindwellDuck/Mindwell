Five minutes in, she found something that wasn't a bunny at all.\n\n\"Well, isn't this just peachy,\" she drawled, holding up a framed photo of Harold and his new family. \"Looks like little Timmy's got your nose, Harry.\" She tossed it back under the bed with more force than necessary.\n\nHer heart started pounding like a kick drum. What if Harold came back? What if he wanted her house? Her art? Her? Betsy felt her breath hitching in her chest. \"Calm down, Bets,\" she told herself, but her hands were shaking so much, she could barely light her vape.\n\nShe flopped onto the bed, staring at the ceiling. \"So much for my peaceful morning.\" She took a deep drag, blowing out smoke rings like she was trying to signal the moon. \"Next time I'll just let the damn bunnies multiply.\"",

The two exchanged a glance, something almost imperceptible, but Jenkins caught it nonetheless. A familiar twinge in his chest, like an old wound being prodded, reminded him that he wasn't imagining things.\n\nMartinez had been bringing her coffee from the same caf\u00e9 every morning for weeks now, and Thompson had taken to joining her more often than not. They were just friends, Jenkins told himself, but the sight of their easy camaraderie gnawed at him like a rat in his gut.\n\nAs Martinez launched into her report, Jenkins couldn't help but notice how animated she was, how her eyes seemed to sparkle when she looked at Thompson. It was all so damn...familiar. He remembered those looks, that warmth, from when he and Martha were still together. Before the cancer took her, leaving him alone with nothing but memories and a cold, empty house.\n\nHe felt a surge of jealously rise within him, hot and bitter as bile. He wanted to snap at Martinez, to tell her to keep her eyes on her work and off his former partner. But he didn't. Instead, he listened to her report, his jaw clenched tight enough to make his temples throb.\n\nWhen the briefing ended, Jenkins lingered behind, watching as Thompson and Martinez exchanged another glance before leaving together. He waited until they were out of earshot before giving voice to his thoughts.\n\n\"Damn it all,\" he muttered, slamming his fist on the table hard enough to make the coffee cups jump. \"Why her? Why him?\"\n\nIt was a rhetorical question, of course. There was no answer that could ease the jealousy clawing at his heart like a wild beast. He knew he should be happy for them, but all he felt was a bitter emptiness, a longing for something he'd lost and could never get back.\n\nHe took a deep breath, steeling himself for another day on the job.

They're saying we should all start wearing those ridiculous hazmat suits again!\"\n\nEmily paused, her gloved hands hovering over the agar plates. \"Really, David?

I was hoping you could help me with something.\"\n\nHarriet gestured for Emily to come in, setting aside her lesson plans. As the girl approached, Harriet noticed her eyes were red and puffy, as if she had been crying recently. \"What seems to be the trouble, dear?\" Harriet asked gently.\n\nEmily hesitated before pulling out a crumpled letter from her bag. She handed it to Harriet with trembling hands. \"This came in the mail today,\" she said softly. \"It's... it's from my dad.\"\n\nHarriet took the letter, her heart sinking as she noticed the return address was a post office box in another state - not the family home where Emily still lived with her mother. She could see why Emily was upset; the divorce had been acrimonious, and Mr. Green had made little effort to maintain contact with his daughter.\n\nHarriet unfolded the letter carefully, scanning its contents. It was a brief note, written in harsh, angry script:\n\n*Emily,*\n\n*I've thought about what you said last time we spoke. I can't do this right now.

Emily looked at Harriet gratefully before wiping her tears one last time and leaving the office to join her classmates in the hallway.\n\nHarriet watched her go, feeling an overwhelming sense of sadness and frustration.

You think you can just leave me and expect me to pick up the pieces? Well, I've got news for you: I'm not picking up. I'm chopping down. Every onion, every piece of crap that came our way.\n\nI grab another onion, feeling the weight of it in my hand. Time to unleash some real anger. Time to show him what I'm made of. Time to... Wait, where's my knife? I could've sworn I left it right here...\n\nOh well, too late now. I'll just have to get creative. *chops onion with reckless abandon*<|eot_id|>"

My sous chef, he's just a kid, right? He waltzes in with his perfect little hairnet and asks me, 'Chef, can I go early today?' Early?! It's not even 4 PM! I've got a special five-course menu planned for tonight, and he wants to clock out like it's some nine-to-five gig. I mean, please, spare me the drama of it all. Like I'm supposed to pull off this gastronomic symphony solo while he's off getting his beauty sleep.\"",

I swear, if I had a dollar for every time someone comes in here asking to leave early or take a break, I'd have enough money to open up my own restaurant by now.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the attitude. I expect them to be grateful for the opportunity to work under me, but instead, they think they can just waltz in here and demand special treatment. Newsflash: this isn't a 9-to-5 job. This is fine dining. You want to learn how to cook, you need to put in the work.\n\nMy sous chef thinks he's so smart with his fancy hairnet and his 'I'm a professional' attitude. But let me tell you, when it comes down to it, he's just another young kid trying to make a name for himself. And if he can't handle the pressure of working in a real kitchen, then maybe he shouldn't be here.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it, I expect more from my team. I expect dedication, hard work, and a willingness to learn. Anything less is unacceptable. And if someone can't meet those expectations, then maybe they're not cut out for this industry.\"<|eot_id|>"
