The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I force myself to refocus on the article at hand.\n\nBut the seeds of doubt have already taken root. I find myself scrutinizing every sentence, every phrase, searching for any hint of weakness.

My pen scratches across the page, fueled by a growing sense of unease.\n\nWhat if this is more than just a coincidence? What if there's something I'm missing, some crucial detail that will expose my inadequacy?
