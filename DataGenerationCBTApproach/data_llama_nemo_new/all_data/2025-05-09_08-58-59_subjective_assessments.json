The weight of her words settled upon me like a shroud, suffocating me beneath its crushing gravity.\n\nWhy else would she choose this moment, this phone call, to share such earth-shattering news? It wasn't as if she'd simply forgotten our conversation mere hours prior, nor was it a coincidence that the timing coincided with the anniversary of his birthday. No, there was something more at play here, some unspoken understanding between us that transcended words.\n\nHer hesitation, her nervous laughter, it all spoke volumes about the turmoil she was trying to conceal. And yet, I knew exactly what she meant by those few, fleeting words. She wasn't just announcing her engagement; she was confessing her own grief, her own struggle to move on from the void left by her father's absence.\n\nIn that instant, I felt the sting of betrayal, as if she'd been keeping secrets from me, hiding the truth behind a mask of forced cheer. But why would she do such a thing? Didn't she know that I was still reeling from the loss, that every day felt like an eternity without him by my side?\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening, a stark reminder of the chasm that now separated us. My mind reeled with questions, with fears, with doubts that threatened to consume me whole. How could she do this to me, after everything we'd shared? After all the sacrifices we'd made for her, for our family?\n\nAnd yet, even as I struggled to come to terms with this new reality, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd somehow failed her, that I'd let her down in some fundamental way.
