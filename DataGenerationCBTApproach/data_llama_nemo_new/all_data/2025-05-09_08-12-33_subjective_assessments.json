If only I had treated her better, maybe she'd still be here. But no, I had to go and do all those things... I don't know, it just feels like I'm stuck in some kind of nightmare. Every time I see that car, it's like a punch to the gut. I wish I could just erase the memories, but they're all I have left.\n\nI wonder if she's happy with her new life. Does she ever think about me? Probably not. She's probably too busy raising that kid and living her best life with her new husband. I bet they're having kids right now, and I'll never even get to meet them. It's just so unfair. Why did I have to let her go?\n\nI feel like I'm losing my grip on everything. My job, my friends, my sanity... it's all slipping away. Seeing that car just reminds me of what I've lost. I don't know how much more of this I can take.

She hadn't left a message, but he knew what it meant. Another ' Concerned' conversation about money and family duty loomed over him like a dark cloud.
