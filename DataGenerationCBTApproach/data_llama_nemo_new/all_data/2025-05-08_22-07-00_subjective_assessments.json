Work, his family, whatever. He's always putting stuff off until later. And now, after I've been working my butt off for 12 hours, he can't even be bothered to let me know what's up?\n\nI'm starting to think he doesn't care about us at all. That he's just using me for some reason. Maybe he's got another girl on the side or something. I don't know why I even bother trying to have conversations with him. He never listens anyway.\n\nThis is so typical of him. Always leaving me hanging, never following through on his promises. I'm done wasting my time on him. I need someone who actually cares about me and our relationship. Not some flaky, irresponsible guy who thinks he can just do whatever he wants and I'll still be there waiting for him.<|eot_id|>"
