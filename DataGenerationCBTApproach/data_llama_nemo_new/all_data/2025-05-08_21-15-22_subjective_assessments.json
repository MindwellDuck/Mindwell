They're the ones who truly understand the nuances of creativity, who grasp the subtleties of light and shadow, who coax beauty from the very fabric of existence. Me? I'm just a pretender, a charlatan trying to pass off my amateurish efforts as something approaching true art.\n\nIt's enough to make one question the very nature of talent itself. Is it simply a matter of luck, or is there something more at play?
