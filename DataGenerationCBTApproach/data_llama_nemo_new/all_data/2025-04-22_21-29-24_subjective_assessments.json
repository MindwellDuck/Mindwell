He leaned against the fridge, letting the coolness seep into his bones, wishing it could chill his loneliness too.\n\nHis gaze fell upon the fridge's blank surface.

He snorted sarcastically, \"Yeah, congratulations on being all alone, Alex.\"\n\nHe grabbed a beer, twisting off the cap with more force than necessary, and flopped onto his couch.
