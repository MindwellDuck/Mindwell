Just a bunch of useless jewelry collecting dust somewhere. I can already see myself rummaging through thrift stores, trying to find some cheap replacement. Yeah, that sounds like a blast.\n\nBut wait, what if I did find it? What if it was just sitting on the counter the whole time, and I'm just being paranoid? Ha! Like that's going to happen. I mean, who leaves a ring on the counter unattended? Not me, that's for sure. I must have been out of my mind to think that.\n\nThis is all so ridiculous.
