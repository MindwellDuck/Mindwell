Jane had noticed the disapproving glances all morning but thought she'd handled the rush well. The manager handed her an incident report, detailing a customer's complaint about Jane's \"rude and unhelpful\" attitude. As Jane read, her cheeks burned with embarrassment. She stammered, trying to explain, but the manager just shook her head. \"This isn't the first time, Jane,\" she said coolly, placing a written warning on the desk between them.",

My coworkers seem to think I have some kind of radar for detecting when someone wants to yell at me, and honestly, they're probably right. Every time I try to help someone, they end up getting frustrated with me anyway. I guess I'm just not cut out for this job.\n\nIt's not like I'm a bad person or anything; I just can't seem to get it right. And now, with this written warning hanging around my neck, I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to turn things around. Maybe I should just quit while I still can. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with all these... unpleasant people.<|eot_id|>"

But there was no loaf rising in her oven tonight, no one but Whiskers and herself to share it with.\n\nThe chef looked out at the empty street, watching as a young couple walked by, their arms wrapped around each other, laughter spilling from their lips like the ingredients of a well-balanced dish.
