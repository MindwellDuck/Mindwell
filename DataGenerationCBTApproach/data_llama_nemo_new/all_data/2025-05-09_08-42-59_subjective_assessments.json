My gaze fell upon the vacant chair, its emptiness a stark reminder of the absence I had been anticipating all day. Where was she? Hadn't she returned yet? The silence seemed to reverberate through every molecule of air, mocking my growing unease.\n\nMy eyes drifted towards the shattered remains of the vase, a poignant testament to the chaos that had unfolded mere hours prior. How could she have left it unattended, allowing the shards to remain scattered across the floor? Didn't she care about the mess she created? The thought sent a wave of irritation coursing through my veins, as if the very fabric of our household was unraveling before my eyes.\n\nEvery creak of the old wooden floorboards, every faint whisper of the wind outside, seemed to take on a sinister tone, as if conspiring against me. It was as if the universe itself was conspiring to drive me to distraction, to make me question her whereabouts and her priorities. And what was the point of even trying to understand? She would simply return when she pleased, leaving me to pick up the pieces \u2013 literally and figuratively.\n\nWhy must everything revolve around her? Why can't she see that her actions have consequences, that they affect me directly? Doesn't she realize that I'm the one who has to deal with the fallout, who has to navigate this treacherous landscape of uncertainty? The more I pondered these questions, the more my frustration boiled over, until I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of her indifference.<|eot_id|>"

Her eyes were fixed on the painting at the far wall, the one he'd loved so much - their favorite.\n\nA tall, familiar figure leaned against the wall beside it, glass of champagne in hand, laughing loudly at something someone had said. It was him, or rather, his doppelganger, the man who'd bought her husband's entire collection after his death, claiming to be an admirer. She'd seen him before, but never like this - so alive, so indifferent.\n\nVengefulness surged within her as she watched him raise his glass towards the painting, as if in toast. Her hands tightened around the invitation clutched in her fist until its edges dug into her palm. She would make him pay for his callousness, for his pretension of affection for a man he barely knew. She just didn't know how yet.",

For what reason, I fail to see. Is she attempting to humiliate me before the entire department?
