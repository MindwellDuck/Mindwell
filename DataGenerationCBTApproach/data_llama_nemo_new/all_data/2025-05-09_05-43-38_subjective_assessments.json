That guy doesn't even know the first thing about our industry. It's like they think he's going to magically come up with something genius just because he's got a fresh face.\n\nAnd honestly, it hurts. Not just because I didn't get the project, but because it's exactly the kind of thing my husband would've loved. He was always so passionate about innovation and pushing boundaries. I can almost hear him telling me how much he hated meetings like this, how we could all do better. But no, everyone's too busy playing office politics to listen to anyone who actually has a good idea.\n\nIt's just so frustrating. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of never-ending nightmare where nobody takes me seriously. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just delusional, if I really am just some kind of outcast who can't even get a decent project off the ground. Maybe I should just stick to doing my job and leave the big decisions to someone else. Yeah, that's probably for the best.<|eot_id|>"
