I've been working non-stop all week, and I barely had time to eat lunch. I'm exhausted. Can't she see that? Doesn't she care about how I'm doing?\n\nI'm starting to feel anxious, my heart racing. What if she's going to fire me? Or worse, what if there's something wrong with our relationship? No, no, no. I won't think about that. I'll just deal with whatever it is when the time comes.

It's only a matter of time before they turn on me, demanding answers to questions I'll never have. I'm trapped in a living nightmare, and there's no escape.\n\nMy mind reels at the thought of those poor children, forced to witness their loved one's decline. They deserve better than someone like me, who can't even muster a semblance of compassion. I'm a failure, a hollow shell of a human being, devoid of empathy. This job has sucked the life out of me, leaving nothing but a barren wasteland in its wake.\n\nHow can I possibly pretend to care about these people when I'm secretly seething with disgust? The stench of death and decay clings to everything, infecting every pore of my being. I'm a poison, spreading darkness wherever I go. This job will be the death of me, mark my words.<|eot_id|>"

It's like he thinks his medical expertise automatically trumps everything else.

But this guy...he's got a bad habit of dismissing everyone's opinions, including mine. It's like he's allergic to constructive criticism or something. I guess some people just don't want to hear the truth, even if it means putting themselves and others at risk.\n\nI'll keep trying to reach out to him, but it's hard to shake the feeling that he's not going to listen.
