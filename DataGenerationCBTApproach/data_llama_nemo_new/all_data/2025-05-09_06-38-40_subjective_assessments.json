A lone figure in a sea of white coats and bustling bodies.\n\nHe reached into his apron pocket, fingers brushing against cool metal. The key to her apartment, still there after all these years. A habit he couldn't break, even when she was gone.

The faint scent of lavender wafted through the air, transporting me to memories of our late-night conversations. I recalled the countless nights we spent discussing literature, our words intertwining like the threads of a tapestry. Tonight, however, those threads seemed frayed, the fabric of our relationship torn asunder.\n\nMy focus shifted to the dish I had prepared for her, a culinary masterpiece that now seemed hollow without her presence. The salmon glimmered under the harsh lights, its beauty lost amidst the chaos of the kitchen. As I plated the dish, my mind wandered to the countless times we shared laughter and tears, our bond strengthened by the trials we faced together. Yet, tonight, those moments seemed distant, relics of a past I could no longer relive.\n\nA sudden pang of melancholy washed over me, but I suppressed it, attributing it to the weight of responsibility rather than the ache within. After all, the show must go on, and I had a duty to fulfill. I glanced around the kitchen, taking stock of the bustling activity, the faces of my colleagues a blur as I focused on the task at hand. The timer buzzed, snapping me back to reality, and I resumed my station, the din of the kitchen a constant reminder that some things would never be the same again.<|eot_id|>"
