But no, he doesn't even notice. Or care. It's like I'm invisible.\n\nI take a sip, trying to calm myself down, but it's no use. My heart's racing and I can feel my anger building up. Why does this always happen to me? Can't he see how much I've changed? How much I still care?\n\nBut no, he just ignores me. And tonight, it feels especially cruel. We were supposed to meet up, just the two of us, and now he's nowhere to be found. I swear, sometimes I wonder if I was just a phase for him. If I was never really important enough to warrant a simple hello.\n\nI glance around the pub, hoping someone will notice my distress, but everyone's too caught up in their own lives to care. Even the bartender, who usually knows exactly what's going on, looks like he's avoiding eye contact. It's like I'm the only one who matters, and nobody else sees it.\n\nThis isn't fair. I deserve better than to be treated like this. But honestly, what's the point? He's made it clear where he stands, and I'm just left to pick up the pieces. Again.<|eot_id|>"

My mind wandered back to our last conversation, where he had mentioned feeling suffocated by our relationship. Hadn't he said those things just yesterday?\n\nBut was it really about me, or was it something else entirely? His parents' visits, perhaps, or the stress of work? No, no, it couldn't be. He would never leave me like this. Would he? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I felt tears prick at the corners of my eyes.\n\nIn that moment, all I could think about was him, and how I'd failed somehow. If only I had been more understanding, more patient... But what if it wasn't my fault? What if there was something fundamentally wrong with us, something I couldn't fix?

The memories came flooding back - missed birthdays, forgotten holidays, and countless sleepless nights spent wondering what I could've done differently. Why did he write to me now? Was it just to rub salt in the wound?\n\nI thought about all the other parents I know, effortlessly juggling work and family life. They're always so put together, never missing a school event or sports game. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to keep my head above water. Do they ever worry about their kids' well-being? I doubt it. They're too busy living their perfect lives, while I'm stuck in this rut.\n\nIt's hard not to wonder if I'm just not cut out for this parenting thing. Maybe I'm not good enough.

It's not like I can afford to take care of myself, let alone anyone else.\n\nAnd another thing, why do teachers always expect so much from us? We're already drowning in debt and responsibilities.
