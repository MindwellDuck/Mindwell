Another fucking late-night call-out, another fucking senseless murder. She'd been on the job for three years now, but some nights it still felt like she was wading through mud, each step heavier than the last.\n\nThe victim was a kid, barely out of high school. Lying there in the alley, his life snuffed out like a fucking candle flame, and for what? A lousy twenty bucks from his wallet. She shook her head, feeling that familiar bile rise in her throat. This wasn't justice. This was just... pointless.\n\nHer partner, Mike, approached her, his face pale even under the harsh glow of the streetlights. \"Hey, Sarge,\" he said softly, using her rank like a fucking lifebuoy.

Really, Mike?\" She gestured to the kid on the ground, his eyes wide open, staring up at nothing. \"How the fuck am I supposed to be okay with this shit?\"\n\nMike sighed, looking away. \"I know it's tough, Sarge. But we can't save them all.\"\n\nShe felt something inside her snap, like a rubber band stretched too tight. \"Can't save them all?\" she spat, her voice echoing in the empty street. \"I lost my fucking husband trying to save people, Mike! I lost him, and for what? For some fucking stranger's 'greater good'?\"\n\nShe could feel the tears pricking at the corners of her eyes, hot and unwanted. She hadn't cried since the funeral.

Who gets to enjoy a cup of coffee after a night like tonight?\n\nWe arrived at the scene, and I was hit with the usual mix of emotions - anger, sadness, frustration.

I glanced over at Rachel, who was taking notes and looking focused. She was one of those people who always managed to stay optimistic, no matter what. I envied that about her sometimes.

My grandma had passed away last week, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd forgotten something important. \n\nMy mom had always said that Grandma used to make the most incredible apple pies from scratch, but I never really paid attention to the recipe. Now, as I flipped through the yellowed pages of her old cookbook, I realized that I'd missed so many little details \u2013 the type of flour she used, the way she'd carefully peel the apples, the secret ingredient that made the crust flaky.\n\nBut what really got me was the note she'd written on the back of the recipe card. It wasn't just a list of ingredients; it was a story about how she'd learned to bake from my great-grandma, who'd taught her the art of making the perfect pie crust. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as I read the handwritten words, feeling like I'd lost a piece of our family history.\n\nAs I sat there, surrounded by the musty smell of old books and the faint scent of baking spices, I felt a pang of regret. Why hadn't I listened more closely when she was still alive? Why hadn't I asked more questions? The questions swirled in my head like a vortex, pulling me under with its undertow.\n\nEventually, I got up and walked over to the window, gazing out at the gray sky. The world outside seemed dull and lifeless, a reflection of my own mood. I took a deep breath, letting the cool air fill my lungs, and tried to clear my mind. But the memories lingered, haunting me like a ghost.<|eot_id|>"
