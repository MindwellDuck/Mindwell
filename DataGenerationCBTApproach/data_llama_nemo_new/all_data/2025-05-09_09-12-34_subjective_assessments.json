Because apparently, he's too lazy to even pick up some takeout. I'm starting to think I'm better off without him. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with all these empty nights and lonely dinners.\n\nI know I sound crazy, but honestly, it feels like we've been living separate lives for months now.
