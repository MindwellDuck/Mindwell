My daughter, out with friends, leaving me to face another evening alone. Doesn't she know how much I need some company? Shouldn't she have thought of that?\n\nI glance around the room, taking in the familiar yet somehow foreign space. Where is the warmth, the laughter, the love we shared? It's all just a distant memory now. I try to shake off the feeling of disappointment, telling myself it's irrational, that she's just trying to give me space. But why must she do it in such a thoughtless manner? Can't she see how hard it is for me to cope?\n\nThe colors on the wall seem duller than usual, the oranges and reds muted by the shadows cast by my grief. I wonder if she'll ever understand what it's like to live with this emptiness, this constant ache. Perhaps she thinks I'm just being selfish, expecting her to cater to my needs. But shouldn't she want to make me happy? Shouldn't she want to ease my pain?\n\nI sigh, feeling a lump form in my throat. This is all so...so unfair. Why can't things go back to the way they were? Why can't she just stay and talk to me, listen to me, hold me? The note seems to mock me now, a reminder of her absence, of our new reality.

And let's be real, it's not like I'm some kind of idiot who wouldn't notice if someone was tailing me.\n\nBut still, the image lingered in my mind - a dark shape, a hoodie pulled up over its head, eyes glowing in the dark. It was probably just a stray cat or a lost tourist, but what if it wasn't? What if someone had been stalking me all night? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I knew I had to get out of there before things escalated.\n\nI mean, I've lived in this city my whole life, and I know how it works. People don't just lurk in alleys waiting to pounce on unsuspecting victims. It's not like that. But still, the fear lingered, and I found myself hurrying home, my keys clutched tightly in my hand like a security blanket.\n\nIt's funny, really. I used to think I was a rational person, someone who could handle anything the city threw my way. But now, I'm not so sure. Maybe I am more vulnerable than I thought. Maybe I do need to take precautions. After all, it's always better to err on the side of caution, right?\n\nAs I fumbled for my keys, I couldn't help but wonder what other dangers were lurking in the shadows. Was it safe to go back inside? Shouldn't I call the police? But deep down, I knew I'd just end up worrying myself sick, and that's not worth it.
