The curator had promised it would be \"her best yet.\" But as she stood there, surrounded by hushed whispers and half-empty wine glasses, she realized only three of her pieces had been hung. The rest were from the new talent, a younger artist whose vibrant colors seemed to scream for attention. She felt a familiar pang in her chest, disappointment mingling with the hollow ache left by Jack's absence.",

It was supposed to be the crowning achievement of my career, the culmination of all my hard work and dedication. The curator's promise of \"my best yet\" still echoed in my mind, a mantra that I had repeated to myself countless times in preparation for this moment. And yet, here I was, surrounded by the faint scent of mediocrity.\n\nThree of my pieces, mere afterthoughts, relegated to the periphery of the room, while the newcomer's garish creations vied for attention like a chorus of desperate sirens. It was as if the very fabric of reality had conspired against me, determined to snuff out the flame of my artistic genius. I felt a stinging sensation in my eyes, a bitter taste that threatened to overwhelm me.\n\nHow could this have happened? Hadn't I poured my heart and soul into every brushstroke, every color choice? Didn't the curator know what I was capable of? The questions swirled in my mind like a maelstrom, leaving me breathless and bewildered. This wasn't just a disappointment; it was a betrayal, a slap in the face to everything I held dear.\n\nAnd now, as I stood there, frozen in a sea of indifference, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow flawed, that there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. Was I simply not good enough? Did I deserve better than this? The doubts crept in like thieves in the night, stealing away my confidence and leaving me with nothing but the bitter taste of disappointment.<|eot_id|>"

There was no middle ground - if she wasn't truly remorseful, she wouldn't have written such a heartfelt message. And yet, I couldn't shake off the feeling that she was just trying to manipulate me.\n\nI thought about all the times she had disrupted the class before, and how I had always let her slide. Was this just another attempt to get attention? Or was she genuinely trying to change? But what if it was the latter? What if she was actually capable of growth and improvement?\n\nIt didn't matter. Whatever my interpretation, one thing was certain - I needed to take drastic action. If I let her off the hook now, I would be enabling her bad behavior. No, I needed to make an example out of her. I needed to show her that I wouldn't tolerate any nonsense in my classroom.\n\nEither way, I knew I had made up my mind. There was no room for compromise or nuance. It was either Emma was a model student who deserved praise, or she was a troublemaker who needed to be dealt with firmly. Anything in between was irrelevant.<|eot_id|>"

She couldn't bring herself to open it, fearing another reminder of what they'd lost, of the life they no longer had.
