I've been to so many galleries lately and I've seen the same thing - terrible art, people who think they're artists but clearly aren't. It's like, how hard is it to paint a decent picture? You'd think it wouldn't be that hard, but nope. Everyone's just phoning it in these days.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the art world itself.

Instead, a chill ran down her spine as she noticed the slight breeze whispering through the open window, its curtains rustling like spectral hands reaching out from the darkness.
