It's like she thought I'd still be living at that dump where we used to live. Does she really think I haven't changed? That I'm still the same guy who was stuck in that toxic relationship?\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who actually cares about what's going on in my own life. Everyone else just assumes they know what's best for me, like I'm some kind of puppet on strings. Well, let me tell you, I'm not some mindless drone. I've got feelings too, you know.\n\nAnd another thing, why did she even bother sending it? Was it just to rub it in my face? To make me feel like I'm somehow responsible for her happiness? Give me a break. If she wanted to talk, she should've just picked up the phone like a normal person. But no, she had to resort to sending me some passive-aggressive letter instead.\n\nI'm telling you, some people just have no idea how to treat someone like a human being.<|eot_id|>"
