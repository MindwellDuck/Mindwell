She picked it up, examining the yellowed image before tossing it into the trash with a bitter sigh. \"Waste of time,\" she muttered, returning to her chopping, each thwack of the knife echoing like an accusation in the silent kitchen.",

I felt a surge of indignation as I tossed aside the offending onion slice, watching as it joined its brethren in the trash, a pitiful offering to the void that had swallowed our happiness whole.\n\nEvery strike of the blade was a declaration of war, a defiant rejection of the pain that had been inflicted upon me. And yet, even as I raged against the injustice of it all, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow to blame \u2013 that if only I had been more vigilant, more attentive, perhaps things might have turned out differently.
