The memories of our arguments, of his absence, of the countless nights I spent wondering where he was and why he wasn't coming home...\n\nMy eyes fall upon the empty chair across from me, and I'm overcome with a sense of despair. What if I had known earlier that he was leaving? Could I have done something to change it? Would I have been able to save us?

My ex-husband, a man I once thought I knew intimately, was standing there, laughing with a younger colleague.

I recalled the countless times we'd laughed together, the memories we'd created, and the love we'd shared. Now, it all seemed like a distant memory, a relic of a past I'd rather forget. Their carefree camaraderie only served to highlight my own isolation, leaving me feeling like an outsider looking in.\n\nI tried to brush it off, telling myself that I was being ridiculous, that it was just a coincidence. But the truth was, I couldn't shake off the feeling that they were somehow connected, that their actions were a deliberate attempt to hurt me. It's not that I'm paranoid; it's just that I've been through enough to recognize the signs. And right now, those signs were screaming at me from across the room.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind kept racing. Why did he have to laugh with someone else?
