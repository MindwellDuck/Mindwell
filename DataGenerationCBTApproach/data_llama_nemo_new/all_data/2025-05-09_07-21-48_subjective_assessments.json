They came up to me and started making snide comments about my work - like, I get it, they're not fans, but do they have to be so condescending? And what really got under my skin was when they said I must be \"desperate\" for attention because I'm showing my stuff here. Like, who does that?\n\nI swear, some people just can't handle the fact that I'm trying to make something real. They're all about the fame and fortune, and they think they're above it all. Newsflash: they're not. I mean, I've seen them talking trash behind my back, thinking no one's listening. Well, let me tell you, I heard it loud and clear.\n\nIt's just so frustrating, because I know I put my heart and soul into every piece I create. But do they care? Nope. All they care about is tearing me down. It's like, can't they see that I'm trying to make a difference here? Apparently not.\n\nI don't even want to go back to that gallery again. The energy there is toxic, and I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. I deserve better than to be belittled by people who clearly don't understand what I'm going through.<|eot_id|>"

Mark my words, something bad's gonna happen soon. I can feel it.\n\nI've been noticing these little things lately - the way the lights flicker, the way the wind blows through the trees.

We're all just sleepwalking into disaster, oblivious to the danger lurking beneath our feet.\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take.

He thinks he can just waltz in here with his \"honesty\" and expect me to believe him? Please. I've seen the way he looks at me, the way he touches me... it's all just a big show.
