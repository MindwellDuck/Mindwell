It's not like I'm the one who's clumsy or anything. No, it's definitely someone else's fault. Maybe it was the janitor who left the tile on the floor, or maybe it was the student next to me who was too busy giggling to notice. But whatever it was, it's not my problem.

It's as if she's standing just beyond the edge of perception, observing me with a mixture of disappointment and pity.\n\nWhy else would the clock tick so slowly, the seconds stretching out like hours? Is she counting down the moments until I give up, until I admit defeat? I try to shake off the feeling, but it's no use. I know she's here, watching me, waiting for me to fail.\n\nAnd yet, despite the fear that grips my chest, I feel a spark of determination ignite within me. Maybe, just maybe, I'll prove her wrong.

It's no wonder I'm exhausted; the toll of caregiving can be overwhelming. Perhaps this oversight was merely a symptom of a larger issue, one that speaks to the fragility of our partnership.\n\nBut what really sets my teeth on edge is the fact that I've been tolerating this neglect for far too long. My patience wears thin, and I fear we're careening towards a precipice from which there's no return.

Alas, such musings serve only to underscore the sense of disconnection that's grown between us.
