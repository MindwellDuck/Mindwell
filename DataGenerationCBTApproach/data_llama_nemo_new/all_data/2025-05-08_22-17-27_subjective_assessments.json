We're just going to end up losing again and again and again.\n\nAnd now, to top it all off, I got a call from the mom of that kid I lost last week. Just a reminder that I failed her child, that I couldn't save him no matter how hard I tried. Yeah, that's exactly what I needed - another dose of guilt and self-doubt to go along with my exhaustion.
