His wife's car was absent from the driveway, another late meeting for her fast-track career. He trudged inside, flicking on lights that felt too bright in the empty house. In the mailbox was a letter from the bank, the envelope already opened, his wife's neat handwriting scrawled across it: \"Final Notice.\" The balance was dwindling faster than he could count the coins left after each paycheck. He sank onto the couch, cradling the letter like a guilty secret, wondering if this time, there really was no way out.",

It's disgusting how she can just ignore our problems and expect me to pick up the slack.\n\nAnd what's with these late meetings? Can't she see I need her support at home? We're barely scraping by as it is, and now she's off playing office politics, leaving me to deal with the fallout. I swear, sometimes I wonder if she even cares about our family anymore. This whole thing started when she got that promotion, and now look where we are. If only she'd focus on us instead of her own ambitions...\n\nIt's not fair that I'm the one who has to deal with all the stress around here. She's always so calm and collected, like she's above it all. But I know the truth \u2013 she's just as worried as I am, but she doesn't want to admit it. That's why she's always pushing me to work harder, to make more money, to provide for her. Like I'm some kind of robot or something. Newsflash: I'm human, too, you know.
