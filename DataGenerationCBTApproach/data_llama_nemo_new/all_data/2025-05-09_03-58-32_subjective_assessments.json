Now, it just sat there, silently judging me, a stark contrast to the warmth and love we once shared. The tears that fell were not just for him, but for the life we'd built together, the memories we'd made, and the future we'd never get to experience. \n\nHis mug, once a simple pleasure, had become a bittersweet symbol of everything that's been lost. It's hard to believe it's been months since we last spoke, and yet, the pain feels just as raw today as it did when it first started. I wonder if he ever thinks about me, about us, or if he's moved on, leaving me to pick up the pieces of a shattered heart. The thought alone is almost too much to bear.<|eot_id|>"
