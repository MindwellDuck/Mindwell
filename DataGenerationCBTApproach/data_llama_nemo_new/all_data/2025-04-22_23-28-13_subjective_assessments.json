My mind's a whirlwind of thoughts, each one fightin' for attention. I can't focus on nothin'.\n\nThe clock ticks like it's mockin' me. It's almost noon and Harry ain't called yet. He said he'd call by lunchtime, but maybe he forgot. Maybe he doesn't care anymore. My heart's racin', my palms are sweaty. What if he's found someone else? Younger, prettier, less lonely.\n\nI pick up the phone, dial his number. It rings and rings, then goes to voicemail. His voice, that deep, comforting voice, says, \"Hi, it's Harry. Leave a message.\" I can't leave a message. What would I even say? \"Hey, honey, just checkin' if you're still alive?\" No, I can't do that.\n\nI hang up, pacing around the room like a caged animal.

You've found someone else, haven't you?\"\n\nThere's a pause, then Harry sighs. \"Evelyn, sweetheart, what are you talkin' about? I'm on this damn trip for you, remember?

I'm tryin' to work on this stupid bead necklace, but my hands are shakin' so bad I might as well be tryin' to thread needles with pliers.

I'm a person, with feelings and emotions and needs. And right now, I need him.\n\nI don't know why I'm so messed up. Maybe it's because I'm just plain tired of bein' alone.

Now it's screeching like a banshee, his face burning hotter than a fucking furnace. He reaches for it, knocking over a stack of papers in the process, sending them fluttering to the floor like injured birds.\n\nIt's her. Ex-wife. Hasn't talked to him in years, not since she left him for some young buck with a six-pack and a BMW. He'd hoped he'd never hear from her again, but here she is, haunting his phone like a goddamn ghost.\n\nHe doesn't pick up, can't pick up. Not with the kids watching, waiting. He hits ignore, but it's too late. The damage is done. The classroom's filled with snickers and whispers now.

Why did she have to call? Today of all days? He'd worked so hard to build up this new life, this new persona as the stern but fair history teacher. And now it's all crashing down around him like a fucking house of cards.\n\nAs soon as the bell rings, he bolts for the door, leaving behind a classroom full of questioning glances and smirking faces. He can hear them laughing at him even after he's gone. Fuck them, he thinks, fuck them all. But most of all, fuck her. For reminding him of what he's not, for dragging him back into the past when he'd finally started to move forward.\n\nHe drives home like a madman, tires screeching on the wet streets, rain pounding against his windshield in time with his heartbeat. He's going to call her back, tell her exactly what he thinks of her little stunt. But first, he needs a drink. A stiff one. Because today has been a fucking disaster, and he deserves at least that much after having his dignity stripped bare in front of a room full of kids.\n\nBut then he gets home, pours himself that drink, takes a sip, and the anger fades. All that's left is embarrassment. Shame. And the realization that no matter how hard he tries, some things never change. Some things always stay the same, like the fact that he'll never be good enough for anyone but himself.",

Why should things be any different now?\n\nHer suggestion that I consider hiring someone to assist me was nothing short of insulting.

She doesn't even understand the struggle I put into this piece - the hours, the sweat, the tears... all down the drain because she didn't see what I saw. \n\nWhat if she had walked in when I was still experimenting with colors? Maybe she would've appreciated the raw emotion behind those bold brushstrokes. But no, she had to come in here and dismiss everything I worked for. It's like she thinks I'm some kind of amateur or something. Newsflash: I poured my heart and soul into this painting!\n\nAnd another thing, why does she always have to be so critical? Can't she just appreciate the beauty in something for once? Does she never get tired of saying things like \"that's really something\"? Like, hello, I know it's good, okay? I put my blood, sweat, and tears into this piece. \n\nBut seriously, how am I supposed to show her what I want her to see? How can I make her understand the vision I had in mind? Is it too much to ask for someone to believe in me and my art? Apparently, it is. Now I'm left with this...this...orange monstrosity.<|eot_id|>"
