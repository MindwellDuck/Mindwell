He knows their antics have gone unpunished too long. Tonight, he decides, will be different.",

But honestly, what's the use? Nothing ever gets done. We'll just end up with another empty promise from the mayor's office and more broken promises from the police department. \n\nI'm so sick of feeling like I'm just spinning my wheels. Every time I try to take action, it falls flat. Those guys always manage to wriggle out of something. And now, they're out here celebrating like they own the place. Like they're some kind of heroes or something. Please. They're just a bunch of entitled brats who think the world revolves around them. Well, let me tell you, it doesn't.

Or was he just playing dumb, pretending like nothing ever happened between us? I swear, sometimes I wonder if anyone truly knows me at all.\n\nBut let's be real, I know exactly why he's here. He's probably just waiting for me to make the first move, to prove to him that I'm still worth his time. Like, hello, I've been doing just fine without him for months now.

He wasn't alone; their daughter sat beside him on the couch, her tiny hands clutching at his arm as she too giggled along with whatever joke he'd just cracked.\n\nThe sight should have warmed her heart, but it only served to twist it further. She stood there for a moment, unnoticed, feeling like an outsider in her own home. This was supposed to be their family time, yet here they were, laughing without her, sharing jokes that she wasn't part of.\n\nShe cleared her throat loudly, causing them both to turn towards her with surprise. \"I'm just going upstairs,\" she said quietly, turning away before either could respond. As she climbed the stairs, she felt a tear slip down her cheek. It was supposed to be different. They were supposed to be together in this.

I felt like I was invisible, like I didn't belong in my own home.\n\nI stormed up the stairs, trying not to cry, but those tears just kept coming. Why can't they see how much I need them right now? Why can't they just make me feel like I'm part of the family again? It's like they're choosing to ignore me, to leave me behind.\n\nI slammed the door shut behind me, feeling like I've been punched in the gut. I don't know how much more of this I can take.
