If only the students would focus, if only they would listen, maybe things wouldn't be so bad. But no, they just didn't seem to care.

Why couldn't anyone see that I was trying my best, that I was pouring my heart and soul into these kids? But no, they just didn't appreciate it.

Oh, those comments. \"Lackluster\", \"Sloppy\", \"Needs more depth\". How could they possibly know what I'm capable of? Have they even read my work? I doubt it. They're probably just jealous of my talent, my vision.\n\nBut no, instead of acknowledging my genius, they have to go and criticize me. Criticize me in front of my own eyes. Can you imagine if someone did that to you? You'd be seething, wouldn't you? I am seething. My entire being is aflame with rage and hurt.\n\nAnd what really takes the cake is that they expect me to just... fix it. Fix it overnight. Like I'm some kind of miracle worker. Newsflash: I'm not a miracle worker. I'm a mastermind. A visionary. And I won't be treated like some kind of inferior being.\n\nI'll have it done by tomorrow, all right. I'll have it done by tomorrow, and I'll make sure it's perfect. Perfect, I tell you. Because that's what I do. I produce perfection. And I won't let anyone - or anything - stand in my way.\n\nBut what really gets my goat is that they don't even bother to acknowledge my efforts. No apology, no recognition. Just a cold, calculating critique. It's like they're trying to break me. Well, it won't work. I'm not going to let it. I'll rise above this. I'll show them what I'm truly capable of.\n\nTomorrow, I'll deliver. Tomorrow, I'll prove them wrong. And when I do, they'll be eating their words. Mark my words.<|eot_id|>"
