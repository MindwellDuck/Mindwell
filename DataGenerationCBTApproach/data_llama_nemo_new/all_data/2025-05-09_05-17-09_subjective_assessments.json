My former roommate, once a friend, had reduced our masterpiece to nothing more than a mere footnote in his own success story. The fact that he'd even bothered to display it at all was a hollow gesture, a pathetic attempt to cling to the past.\n\nI remembered the countless hours we'd poured into that piece, the laughter, the tears, the late-night conversations that had shaped us into the artists we were meant to be. And now, it was all just a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era, replaced by his own self-aggrandizing ego.\n\nThe plaque, once proudly bearing my name alongside his, now read like a cruel joke. \"Martin's contribution\" - how could they do this to me? Did he really think I'd forget the sacrifices we made together, the blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating something truly beautiful?\n\nBut what did it matter, anyway? It wasn't like I was still involved in the art world. I'd long since given up on my dreams, resigned to a life of mediocrity. This was just another reminder of everything I'd lost, every opportunity I'd let slip through my fingers.\n\nAnd yet, despite the pain, despite the anger, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. Not for myself, no, but for what we'd once been. For the friendship, the camaraderie, the shared vision that had driven us to create something truly special. All gone, lost forever in the depths of his ambition.\n\nAs I turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. A stranger stared back, a shadow of the man I used to be. The art world may have moved on, but I was stuck in the past, reliving the memories that haunted me still.<|eot_id|>"

The ease with which she was welcomed into our home, the warm smiles and laughter that seemed to reverberate through every molecule of air, all served only to underscore the crushing feeling of inadequacy that had been building within me for what felt like an eternity.\n\nIt's not that I'm jealous, per se \u2013 although, I suppose, one could argue that the very notion is laughable.
