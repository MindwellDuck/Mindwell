Like, what are the chances, right? It's just another sign that something's off around here. I'm starting to think the owners are hiding something from us. Maybe there's some kind of security system or something that's supposed to kick in when we're closed. I don't know, but I'm not taking any chances.\n\nI'm going to go check the back room and make sure everything's okay. If anyone's watching, I'll see you.

What if she was just pretending to be an artist, using her charm to lure unsuspecting collectors into buying her overpriced trinkets?\n\nMeanwhile, my own work \u2013 the culmination of years of dedication and hard work \u2013 sat quietly in the corner, gathering dust. What if no one even noticed it? What if they thought I was just another amateur trying to make a quick buck off the art world's gullibility?\n\nAs the evening wore on, I found myself growing increasingly anxious, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. What if Emma's success was just a fluke, and she was about to crash and burn?

What if she was secretly sabotaging me, using her connections to undermine my chances at recognition? What if I was just a pawn in some larger game, destined to be crushed beneath the wheels of her rising star?\n\nMy eyes darted back to my own work, now seeming dull and uninspired by comparison. I wondered if anyone would even bother to look at it, or if it would be lost forever in the void of Emma's spotlight. As the night drew to a close, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was staring into the abyss, with Emma's glittering facade looming large above me, taunting me with its very existence.<|eot_id|>"
