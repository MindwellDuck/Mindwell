I hope she does. I really do. Maybe someday we'll find our way back to each other. Until then, I'm stuck in this limbo, reliving memories that refuse to fade.\n\nSometimes I catch myself wondering what she'd say if she were here right now. Would she tell me to move on? To forget? No, she'd want me to hold onto these feelings, to cherish them. She'd want me to know that even though we're apart, she's always with me in spirit. That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.<|eot_id|>"
