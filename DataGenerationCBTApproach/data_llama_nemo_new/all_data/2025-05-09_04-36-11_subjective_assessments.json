And yet, I could hardly blame myself for feeling such intense ire. For what choice did I have but to confront the brutal reality of her betrayal? To accept anything less would be to condone her perfidy.\n\nIn that moment, I was torn between two irreconcilable certainties: either she had abandoned me out of malice, or I was powerless to prevent her flight. Anything short of absolute malevolence would be tantamount to acquiescence, and I could not bring myself to entertain such a notion. My anger boiled over, a cauldron of indignation that threatened to consume me whole.\n\nAnd so, I seethed, consumed by the certainty that my ex-wife's actions were motivated by a deliberate intent to destroy us. It was a binary universe, black and white, with no room for nuance or ambiguity. In this world, there was only one truth: she had wronged me, and I would never forgive.<|eot_id|>"
