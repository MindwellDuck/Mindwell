His old armchair is still here, and it's literally falling apart. I've been trying to get rid of it for months, but he just won't let go. I guess that's what happens when you're used to having someone else do everything for you. Meanwhile, I'm over here scrubbing away at last night's dinner stains on the carpet because apparently, I'm some kind of cleaning ninja.\n\nBut hey, at least I got to keep the good stuff \u2013 like his favorite mug. Yeah, that thing's been collecting dust for years, but it's still somehow more valuable than all the other crap he left behind. I mean, who needs a functional coffee mug when you can have a piece of history, right? Now I get to enjoy the thrill of watching it chip and crack every time I use it. Just peachy.<|eot_id|>"
