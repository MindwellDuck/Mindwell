I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself it's irrational, but the seed of doubt has already taken root.\n\nPerhaps I should just ignore the notification, pretend it doesn't exist. But what if it's something important? What if it's the wake-up call I need to realize my true limitations? The uncertainty is suffocating, and I'm trapped in this cycle of self-doubt, unable to escape.\n\nAs I hesitate, frozen in indecision, I wonder if anyone else feels this way. Do others sense the weight of expectation bearing down upon them, or am I alone in this struggle?
