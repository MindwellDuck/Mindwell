Every time we come back, there's someone else who looks like they're trying too hard to fit in. It's almost as if they're trying to replace me or something. \n\nI tried to shake off the feeling, focusing on the customer in front of me, but my mind kept wandering back to what I saw. Why does he always seem to find these women? Is it because he's just naturally charming or is there something more going on? The way they looked at him, the way they smiled... it was all just a bit too familiar. I pushed the thoughts aside, telling myself I'm just being paranoid, but it's hard not to wonder when it keeps happening like this.\n\nIt's funny, though - every time we came back to this coffee shop after our divorce, things seemed to get worse. He would always try to make small talk with the baristas, and now it seems like he's doing the same thing with those women. Maybe it's just my imagination running wild, but it feels like he's trying to rub it in my face.<|eot_id|>"
