He's always leaving his dirty dishes for me to deal with and now this... it's like he doesn't care about anything except himself.\n\nI feel so used and unappreciated. We're supposed to be partners, but it feels like he's just going through the motions. I don't even want to talk to him right now, I just need some space.\n\nBut at the same time, I keep thinking about all the times he's done things for me, all the little gestures that show he cares. And now this... it's like he's taking all those away from me too.\n\nI don't know what's going on with us anymore. It feels like we're just existing in the same space, but not really living together. And that mug... it just sits there, staring at me, reminding me of everything that's wrong.\n\nI wish he would just apologize and explain himself. But I doubt he will. He never does when things get tough. So I'll just sit here, feeling miserable, and wonder what happened to the man I fell in love with.<|eot_id|>"
