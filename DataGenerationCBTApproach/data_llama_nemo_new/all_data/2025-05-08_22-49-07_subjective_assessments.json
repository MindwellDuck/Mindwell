I've heard it all before, and I know exactly what it means: another year, another failure.\n\nWhat's the point of even trying? It's clear that no one takes me seriously. My work is never good enough, never worthy of recognition. I'm just a perpetual also-ran, stuck in a never-ending cycle of disappointment and disillusionment.
