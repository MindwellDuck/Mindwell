And now she's going to waste her time with some other loser?\n\nWhat's wrong with her, anyway? Can't she see how pathetic she looks? All those years we were together, and she still can't even manage to make a decent relationship work. It's like she's allergic to commitment or something. And now she's going to go ahead and marry some guy who's probably twice her age and three times her stupid size?\n\nAnd what really gets my blood boiling is that she's doing this behind my back. No warning, no nothing. Just some casual text message saying 'oh, by the way, I'm getting married next month'. Like I don't have enough to deal with already. Does she think I'm just sitting around twiddling my thumbs waiting for her to come crawling back?\n\nNewsflash, honey: I'm not some broken toy that you can just pick up and put down whenever you feel like it. I've got feelings too, you know. And right now, they're feeling pretty damn hurt and betrayed. So maybe instead of running off to your new husband, you could try apologizing to me for what you did.
