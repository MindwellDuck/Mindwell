While I initially found his bedside manner to be somewhat... abrupt, I must admit that this incident has left me feeling utterly disillusioned with the entire experience.\n\nIt appears that Dr. M's demeanor was woefully inadequate, bordering on unprofessional. His failure to provide even the most basic level of emotional support during our conversation was nothing short of distressing. The fact that he seemed so disinterested in addressing my concerns only serves to further underscore the gravity of the situation.\n\nIn light of these events, I fear that I may never be able to trust the medical staff at this institution again. The lack of empathy displayed by Dr. M has left me questioning the very foundation of our healthcare system. I can only hope that steps will be taken to address this egregious lapse in professionalism.\n\nSincerely,\n[Patient's Name]<|eot_id|>"
