Never does he listen to me, never does he care about what I want. The whole point of marriage is supposed to be communication, but with him, it's just a one-way street. Entire conversations are wasted on him, and I'm left feeling unheard and unimportant.\n\nCan't he see that I need some space? That I deserve better than some guy who's always busy and never present? I don't know why I even bother trying anymore. It's not like anything ever changes. He'll just keep on doing whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and I'll be stuck here, dealing with the fallout.<|eot_id|>"

Doesn't she know how much work goes into getting a good night's sleep? I mean, I'm trying to relax here, but all I can think about is how she must have gotten out of bed in the middle of the night, leaving her book half-read. It's just so...inconsiderate.\n\nBut honestly, it's not just the little things like that. It's the fact that she's always doing this. Leaving her dirty socks on the floor, not taking out the trash, never helping with household chores. It's like she thinks I'm some kind of personal servant or something. Newsflash: I'm not your maid. \n\nAnd another thing, why did she leave her book open? Was she expecting someone else to come home and finish reading it for her? I mean, what if someone had come home and read the last chapter? Would she have been okay with that? I highly doubt it.

I could almost feel the icy fingers of fate closing around my throat, squeezing the very life from my being. Every fiber of my being screamed in terror at the prospect of facing the abyssal void that was Emma's math education.\n\nAnd yet, even as I trembled before the coming storm, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been warned, nay, foretold of this impending disaster. The universe itself seemed to be conspiring against me, its malevolent forces arrayed against the fragile, faltering hopes that I clung to like a lifeline.
