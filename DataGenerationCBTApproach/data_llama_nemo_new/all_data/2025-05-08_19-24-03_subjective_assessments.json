It's just so unfair.\n\nI keep thinking about all the times I've seen my colleagues make mistakes, and nobody ever says anything. But when it happens to me, suddenly everyone's got eyes on me. It's like they're waiting for me to slip up so they can pounce. I swear, it's like they're all conspiring against me.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that patient. I mean, who does something like that? They must have been having a bad day or something. Maybe they were stressed out or tired. Yeah, that's it. Stress and fatigue, that's all it was. Not because I actually did something wrong. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me want to scream.\n\nI feel like I'm being picked on, like everyone's out to get me. I try to stay positive, I really do. But it's hard when it feels like the whole world's against me. I just wish someone would stand up for me, tell them that maybe, just maybe, there's more to the story than what we're seeing right now. But nobody ever listens to me. Nobody ever believes me.\n\nIt's just so frustrating, you know? I feel like I'm losing my mind over here. All these years of dedication, all these late nights and early mornings, and this is how it ends? With some patient's petty complaint ruining everything? It's just...it's just so unfair.<|eot_id|>"

How could he have done this? Did he somehow know about our little secret? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I felt a lump form in my throat.\n\nIt's just so... convenient that he would volunteer to help with my class project, isn't it? I mean, who else but him would think of doing such a thing? It's almost as if he knew exactly how much I needed his assistance. But why now? Why did he have to bring it up again? Can't he see that I'm still trying to move on?\n\nI tried to brush it off, telling myself it was just a coincidence, but the more I looked at his handwriting, the more I became convinced that there must be some deeper meaning behind it. Maybe he was trying to tell me something, or perhaps he was just trying to rub it in my face. Either way, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, knowing that his presence seemed to be everywhere, even when he wasn't.\n\nAnd another thing, why did he have to choose that particular assignment? Wasn't it enough that I had to relive all those memories every day? Now, I have to deal with the added pressure of wondering what he would say if he were here. It's just too much to bear.<|eot_id|>"

We're supposed to meet our friends in an hour, but I don't want to go yet. Not until I've seen this through. What if I just sit here for a minute longer, pretend I'm not watching? Maybe I can convince myself it's not happening. But it is. And it's making me sick.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind keeps racing. What if I confront him right now? What if I tell him how I feel? It won't change anything, but maybe it'll make me feel better. Or worse. Either way, I need to know. What if...<|eot_id|>"
