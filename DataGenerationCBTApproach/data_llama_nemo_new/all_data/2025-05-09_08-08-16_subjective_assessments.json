His morning coffee is always left half-drunk when he returns from work, despite no one else touching it. He's started finding doors ajar that he swears he closed, and the TV turns on at odd hours with no one in sight. Today, as he sits down to write his latest article, he notices a faint, unfamiliar scent lingering around his laptop - like someone had been using it without him knowing. His heart races as paranoia surges; he's certain he'd left the house alone this morning.",

It's like someone poured a whole bottle of cheap cologne all over my laptop. I mean, who does that? My wife would never do something like that, but... actually, wait a minute... maybe she would. Maybe she's trying to drive me crazy or something. I swear, I left the house this morning, but I could've sworn I saw her walking out the door. Or was it yesterday? Ugh, I don't know anymore.\n\nI need to talk to her about this. This isn't funny anymore. Someone needs to take responsibility for messing with my stuff.
