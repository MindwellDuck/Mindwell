He noticed the photograph on the mantelpiece, her smile beaming back at him. He picked it up, tracing her face gently. His heart ached, a familiar pain that never seemed to ease. It had been three months, but every corner of their home was still filled with her absence. Today, he found a stray hair tie on the bedroom floor, hers. A simple object, yet it felt like a punch in his gut. He sank onto the bed, grief crashing over him once more, raw and relentless.",

It's just a stupid thing, but it feels like a constant reminder of what we lost. I sat down on the bed, letting the weight of my grief wash over me.

Was it something I said? Did I fail to provide for her in some fundamental way? The questions swirled in my mind like a maelstrom, fueled by the nagging suspicion that she had been planning her departure all along. Those empty photo frames seemed to mock me, a stark reminder of the happiness we once shared. And now, it was nothing more than a distant memory, a fleeting glimpse of what could have been.
