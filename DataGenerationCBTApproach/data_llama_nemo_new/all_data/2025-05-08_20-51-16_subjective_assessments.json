Her husband of fifty years entered, his eyes scanning the room, landing on the unfinished canvas. \"You haven't touched that in days,\" he remarked casually, walking over to the window to admire his reflection. She bristled, gripping the brush tighter as bitterness surged within her like a tide. He hadn't noticed the new lines etched into her hands, the way they trembled slightly now. He didn't see how each stroke of paint was a battle against time, against the encroaching darkness that threatened to consume her vision and her art. She watched him through narrowed eyes as he adjusted his tie in the window's reflection, his mind elsewhere, oblivious to the storm brewing behind him.",

I felt like I was drowning in regret, suffocating under the weight of my own inadequacy.\n\nIt's just another reminder that I'll never be good enough, that I'll always be stuck in this rut, unable to escape the darkness that haunts me. Why else would she invite me to her special day? What could she possibly want from me now?\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear the cobwebs, but the image lingered, taunting me like a ghost. I'm clearly not worthy of happiness, of love, of anything truly meaningful. And now, to see her smiling, surrounded by friends and family, basking in the joy of her new life... it's just too much to bear.<|eot_id|>"
