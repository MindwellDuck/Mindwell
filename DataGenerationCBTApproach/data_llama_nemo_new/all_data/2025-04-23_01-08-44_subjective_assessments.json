She'd been hovering, \"helping\" with dinners, tidying his workspace\u2014all while he was neck-deep in grading.\n\nSuddenly, Mary breezed in, holding out a steaming mug. \"Here's your chamomile, dear,\" she chirped. \"You've been at it for hours.\"\n\nRichard bristled, resentment surging like lava. \"I didn't ask for your tea, Mary,\" he snapped, slamming his pen down. \"And I've told you before, stop treating me like a child! I'm not one of your little patients!\"\n\nMary recoiled as if slapped, her face pale but composed. \"Richard, I was just trying to help\u2014\"\n\n\"Help?\" Richard spat, standing abruptly, his chair screeching back. \"You think you can 'help' by undermining me? By making me look weak in front of my students?\"\n\nHe swept an arm across his desk, sending papers flying. \"I've spent decades building my career, and you\u2014you treat it like a hobby!\"\n\nMary's eyes flashed, but she bit back her retort. Instead, she gathered the scattered essays, her movements jerky with unshed tears. Richard watched, his chest heaving, anger churning within him, raw and untempered.",

Can't you just give me some space?\n\nAnd that tea? Are you kidding me? Who brings tea into my study? That's just another example of you trying to control everything around here. Well, let me tell you, I don't need your tea. I can handle my own caffeine intake, thanks.\n\nYou know, I'm starting to think we're just too different. Maybe we shouldn't even be married anymore. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with all these...these...infuriating little things you do. Like bringing me tea when I specifically told you not to.

His anxiety was a constant companion, but he'd learned to channel it into ensuring his restaurant, \"Harold's Table,\" ran like clockwork.\n\nOne Tuesday morning, as he began his mise en place for the evening service, he noticed that his sous chef, Jamie, hadn't arrived yet. Harold checked his watch; 8:15 AM. His heart began to race. Jamie was never late. He picked up his phone to call but hesitated, his anxiety morphing into irritation.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Harold muttered, running through the day's menu in his head. They had a full house tonight, including a high-profile table celebrating an anniversary. Everything needed to be perfect.\n\nAt 8:30 AM, Jamie rushed in, breathless and apologetic. \"I'm so sorry, Chef,\" he gasped, \"My car wouldn't start this morning.\"\n\nHarold felt his anxiety peak, threatening to boil over into anger. But he took a deep breath, counting silently until he reached ten. When he spoke, his voice was calm but firm.\n\n\"Next time, Jamie, have a backup plan. We can't afford these kinds of delays, not today of all days.\" He turned back to his prep, his hands steady despite the turmoil within him.\n\nAs the day wore on and service began, Harold's anxiety kept him sharp but weary. Every dish that went out was scrutinized, every detail micromanaged. Yet, despite the early hiccup, \"Harold's Table\" delivered another flawless service.\n\nThat night, as he closed up the kitchen, Harold looked at his reflection in the stainless steel countertop. He saw the lines etched around his eyes, the tension in his jaw. He knew tomorrow would bring another day of anxiety, another test of his control. But tonight, he was simply tired.

They blamed her, of course. They didn't say it outright, but it was there between the lines, as plain as day. She could feel their anger, their pain, their regret... and hers.\n\nThe memories came flooding back, each one a sharp stab to her heart. The look on John's face when she told him he had cancer. The countless hours they spent fighting the disease, only for it to claim his life anyway. And finally, the empty room where his body lay, waiting for the undertaker to come and take him away.\n\nShe felt a familiar anger rise up inside her. How dare they? She had done everything she could. She had fought alongside them, every step of the way. She had stayed awake for nights on end, poring over his charts, searching for some miracle cure that would save him. And still, it hadn't been enough.\n\nShe threw the letter across the room, watching as it fluttered to the floor like a wounded bird. \"Fuck them,\" she whispered, her voice shaking with unshed tears and pent-up anger. \"Fuck them all.\"\n\nBut even as she said the words, she knew they weren't true. She couldn't blame them for their pain. She knew what it was like to lose someone you loved. She had lost too many in this godforsaken job.\n\nShe leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes against the sudden onslaught of tears. She would never forgive herself for John's death. She could only hope that one day, she would find a way to live with it. But today was not that day. Today, all she felt was regret. Deep, aching regret.",

Like, what did I do wrong? I gave it my all, I swear. I poured my heart and soul into saving him, and it wasn't enough. That's not my fault, it's theirs for not taking care of him better.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how they're going to twist everything around and make me look like the bad guy. I know exactly what they're trying to do - shift the blame onto me. Well, let me tell you something, I'm not buying it. I've seen it before, the same tactics, the same lies. They think they can just waltz in here and ruin my reputation? Not on my watch.\n\nI'm so sick of people thinking they can just point fingers and expect everyone else to clean up after them. Newsflash: I'm not responsible for John's death. He made his own choices, he took his own risks. If anyone deserves blame, it's him, not me.\n\nThis letter is just another example of how unfair life is. One minute you're on top of the world, the next you're facing accusations and blame. It's just not right. And to think, I've dedicated my career to helping people, and this is how I'm repaid? By being attacked by people who don't even know the half of it?\n\nI need to calm down, I know. But it's hard when you feel like your whole world is being turned upside down. I keep replaying that day in my head, wondering if there was anything I could've done differently. But deep down, I know I did everything I could. This isn't about me, it's about them and their twisted sense of justice.\n\nI'll deal with this eventually, but for now, I just want to scream. Scream at the injustice, scream at the cruelty, scream at the fact that some people will stop at nothing to destroy others. Ugh, I hate days like this.<|eot_id|>"
