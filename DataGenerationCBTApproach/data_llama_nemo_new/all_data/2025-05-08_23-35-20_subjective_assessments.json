But no, she had to go and move on. What if I had just stayed in touch? Maybe we could've worked things out. Nah, probably not. She's clearly moved on, and I'm just stuck here, wondering what could've been.\n\nIt's not like I'm bitter or anything. I'm just... cautious. Yeah, that's it. Cautious. What if I run into her again someday? Will she recognize me? Will she feel bad for leaving me? Ugh, the thought alone gives me hives. Maybe I'll just stick to avoiding parks altogether.
