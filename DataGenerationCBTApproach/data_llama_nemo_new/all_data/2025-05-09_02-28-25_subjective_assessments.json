And now they've gone and damaged it, like they were waiting for me to come back. \n\nI swear, every time I leave my studio, something terrible happens. First, it's the gallery owner breathing down my neck, then it's the critics tearing me apart, and now this. It's like they're trying to drive me crazy. I'll never show my work anywhere again, no point in even trying. The world doesn't appreciate good art anyway.\n\nAnd those kids, they think they're so smart, standing there laughing and pointing. Do they have any idea what it's like to pour your heart and soul into something, only to have it destroyed like that? I'll make sure they pay for this, mark my words. They'll regret the day they ever crossed me.\n\nThis isn't over, not by a long shot. I'll find out who did this and I'll make them pay. Oh, I'm shaking with rage right now, but it's not just anger, it's justice. They need to know that they can't just walk all over me and get away with it. This is war.<|eot_id|>"

No. They just keep sending back the same tired criticisms, over and over again. It's like they're trying to wear me down, to break my spirit. Well, it won't work.
