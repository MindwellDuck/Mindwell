I've been here many times before, and this wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Just another couple enjoying a meal. The fact that she was wearing the scarf didn't make our encounter any more significant than the others. I returned my focus to my coffee, stirring it mechanically.<|eot_id|>"

Now she was rushing to meet her mentor, who was probably already at the studio, pacing and checking his watch. She could picture him, his brow furrowed under his thick glasses, disappointment radiating from him like heat waves. Her heart pounded in her chest as she grabbed her coat, keys jingling wildly in her trembling hand. She had to get there, had to prove herself, had to show she wasn't a fraud.

My hands are shaking so bad, I'm surprised I didn't drop my keys. I must have left them in the studio. Great, just great. Now I'll have to go back and get them, which will only make me late. Ugh, why does this always happen to me?\n\nI just wish I could slow down and take a deep breath. But no, my brain is racing like a jackrabbit, and I feel like I'm drowning in anxiety.
