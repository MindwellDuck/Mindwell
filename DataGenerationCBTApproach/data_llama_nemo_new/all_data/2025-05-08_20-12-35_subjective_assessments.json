A pat on the back and a smile from some other woman?\n\nI mean, seriously, who does he think he is? He's just a selfish, egotistical jerk who only cares about himself.

I had always taken pride in being a valued member of this team, consistently delivering high-quality results and demonstrating unwavering dedication. Yet, today, I felt like an afterthought, a mere aftereffect of their collective indifference.\n\nHow could they so callously disregard my special day? Hadn't I given them ample opportunity to express their gratitude and appreciation? The silence was deafening, a cacophony of neglect that echoed through every fiber of my being. I couldn't help but wonder if I was somehow unworthy of recognition, if my years of service had been nothing more than a hollow exercise in futility.\n\nAs I hung my coat, the bitter taste lingered, refusing to dissipate. It was a harsh reminder that some people are incapable of reciprocating genuine affection, that their actions speak louder than words. And yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that I deserved better, that my presence here was somehow conditional upon their acknowledgement. The weight of expectation settled heavy upon my shoulders, a crushing burden that threatened to suffocate me beneath its oppressive weight.<|eot_id|>"
