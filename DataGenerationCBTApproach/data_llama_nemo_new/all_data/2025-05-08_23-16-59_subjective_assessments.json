She stopped by the classroom door, her eyes scanning the rows of desks now vacant and cold. A single red apple lay untouched on one desk, its owner having forgotten it in their rush to leave at the end of the day. She picked it up, feeling its smooth skin against her fingers, a reminder of the countless apples she had packed for her own son's school lunches years ago. The weight of the fruit was heavy in her hand as she realized once again that no one would be there to greet her when she returned home from this empty building. She sighed, placing the apple back down gently before continuing on her way alone.",

It's not even about the apple itself. It's about how it makes me feel. It's like, this huge reminder that nobody's waiting for me at home. Nobody's going to be there to greet me with a smile and a hug. Just me, myself, and I, wandering around this empty building, feeling like a total loser.\n\nI mean, why bother even coming here? It's not like anything good ever happens. The teachers are always stressed, the kids are always rowdy, and the administrators are always breathing down your neck. No thanks. I'll just stick to staying home and eating my apple in peace. At least then I won't have to deal with all the drama.<|eot_id|>"

The parents seemed to know exactly what to do, while I was just winging it. I glanced around at the other families waiting anxiously outside, and I couldn't help but feel like we were all somehow failing. Our kid's eyes looked sunken, and I knew I wasn't doing enough to comfort them. What was wrong with me?\n\nAs I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself, I caught a glimpse of another parent - a woman with a perfectly coiffed hairdo and a bright smile.
