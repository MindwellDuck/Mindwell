It's always something with her - I'm too clingy, I don't spend enough time at work, I'm just not good enough. And now this? Space? Are you kidding me? That's code for \"I'm done\". I can already see the divorce lawyers lining up outside our house. This isn't about needing space, it's about needing out. She's just tired of me, plain and simple.
