I forced myself to focus on the troubleshooting process, but my mind kept drifting back to the \"what ifs.\"\n\nIt's not like I'm prone to catastrophizing or anything, I told myself. It's just that this particular situation seemed... precarious. And what if I wasn't prepared for whatever might come next? The thought hung in the air, refusing to be dismissed.<|eot_id|>"
