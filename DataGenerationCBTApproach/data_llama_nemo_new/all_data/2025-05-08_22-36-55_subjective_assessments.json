Now look at us, completely done. \n\nI swear, every time I see something like that, I feel like I'm right back where I started. You know, stuck in this rut, wondering what went wrong. And honestly, I don't even want to think about it anymore. But my brain just won't shut up. It's like, \"Oh no, she's having a breakdown.\" No, I'm fine. Just...just really sad, okay?\n\nI hate how everyone always assumes they're better than me because they've been divorced longer. Like, three years isn't even that long. What do they know? They probably got lucky or something. I mean, I'm still trying to figure out what happened. Maybe if I just replayed all those moments over and over again, I'd finally understand why it fell apart. Ugh, stop it, brain. Just stop.\n\nIt's just so frustrating when people say things like, \"Well, you two were meant to be\" or \"You'll find someone else.\" Like, who are they to decide what's best for me? I'm doing just fine on my own, thank you very much. I just need some time to get over this crap. Time to move on. Yeah, that's it.<|eot_id|>"
