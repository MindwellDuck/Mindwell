His handwriting, once so familiar, now felt like a stranger's.\n\nShe smoothed out the paper on her desk, scanning the lines. It was just a silly note, a joke about her teaching methods that he'd written years ago. But it triggered something inside her, a sudden, sharp pang of misery. She'd been doing okay, hadn't she? Carrying on with life, teaching his jokes to their children's classmates without breaking down.\n\nBut this note... it felt like he'd reached out from the grave and punched her in the gut. She could almost hear his laugh, see his grin. And that was too much. It was too much to bear alone in the silent classroom, with the ghosts of his jokes echoing around her.\n\nShe gathered up the note, crumpling it again into a tight ball, and threw it into the wastebasket with more force than necessary. She stood there for a moment, hands on hips, glaring at the bin as if it had personally offended her.\n\nThen she grabbed her bag, slung it over her shoulder, and stomped out of the classroom without looking back.",

The note, a seemingly trivial artifact, had become a tangible manifestation of his enduring presence, a constant reminder of all that I'd endured without him.\n\nWith trembling hands, I balled the note into a tight fist, the paper crackling beneath my grasp. The gesture was involuntary, a reflexive response to the anguish that threatened to consume me whole. I hurled the note into the wastebasket with a force that belied my fragile state, as if I sought to exorcise the demons that haunted me.\n\nFor a moment, I stood frozen, my eyes fixed upon the bin as if it held some hidden truth, waiting to be revealed.

The canvas before me was as blank as my mind, save for the green-eyed monster gnawing at my insides.\n\nHubby, Pierre, an art critic who'd once been a painter himself, was across town, \"mentoring\" young Mademoiselle Leclair. I scoffed at the thought of their \"paintings\" - his words, not mine. Yet, here I was, jealous as a cat with its tail caught in a door.\n\nI'd called him earlier, casual-like, asking if he wanted to grab dinner after his \"lesson.\" He'd hesitated before saying yes, which only fanned the flames of my jealousy. So, like any sensible wife who's been married for three decades and knows her husband's every tell, I traced his footsteps.\n\nNow, I stood in our studio, staring at a canvas that mocked me with its emptiness. Pierre had been gone all afternoon, \"working\" on some new prodigy's masterpiece. I could practically feel the heat of their shared creative energy, like a lover's embrace - one I wasn't invited to.\n\nI picked up my paintbrush, dipped it in cerulean blue (his favorite), and dabbed at the canvas. The color bled into the white, staining it like tears on a cheek. I sneered at the sight. \"Pathetic,\" I muttered, tossing the brush aside.\n\nThe door creaked open. Pierre stepped in, his cheeks flushed, eyes alight with... inspiration? Or was it something else? He took one look at me and sighed, \"Still at war with your canvas, cherie?\"\n\nI forced a laugh, bitter as unsweetened coffee. \"Oh, darling, this isn't war. This is... this is me trying to understand why you're never here anymore.\"\n\nHis smile faded, replaced by a look I knew well - concern mixed with guilt. He stepped closer, hands reaching for mine. But I was done playing nice. I snatched my hand away, gesturing wildly at the canvas.\n\n\"You know what? You can have it. The studio, your 'mentees', this bloody life. Just leave me out of it.\"\n\nAnd with that, I stormed out, leaving him alone with his guilt and our blank canvas - a silent witness to our latest dance around the green-eyed monster.",

A simple \"yes\" wouldn't suffice; there must be more to it than met the eye. Perhaps he was already entwined in some clandestine affair, using his charm to woo another woman.\n\nMy gaze drifted to the blank canvas before me, and I felt an inexplicable pang of resentment. It was as if Pierre had deliberately left me with nothing to work on, no challenge worthy of my skills. The fact that he'd chosen to spend his afternoon with someone else only reinforced my suspicions.\n\nI recalled our conversation earlier, the way he'd spoken about Mademoiselle Leclair's \"raw potential.\" Raw potential, indeed. I highly doubted she possessed anything remotely close to his level of expertise. It was almost as if Pierre was trying to distract me from his own shortcomings.\n\nWith a flick of my wrist, I picked up my paintbrush and began to work. The strokes were bold, deliberate, and laced with a hint of defiance. Cerulean blue danced across the canvas, a reflection of the turmoil brewing within me.\n\nAs I worked, I couldn't shake off the feeling that Pierre was hiding something from me. That he was deliberately keeping me in the dark, just as he did with his own feelings. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I felt my anger simmering just below the surface.\n\nWhen Pierre walked in, his eyes locked onto mine, and I sensed a flicker of unease. He attempted to reassure me, but I saw right through his facade. He knew exactly what I was thinking \u2013 that he was abandoning me, that he preferred the company of others over mine.\n\nI forced a smile, but it was a hollow gesture. My mind was made up; I would not be ignored. As I turned to leave, Pierre's voice followed me, a gentle warning that I chose to ignore.

        "Triggering Event": "Alright, Einstein, listen up! I'm standing here in this godforsaken lab, surrounded by test tubes like they're gonna magically start dancing the Macarena and solve my problems. It's been six months since she left, and still, every time I walk into this sterile fucking white room, it feels like she just ghosted me all over again.\n\nI've got a stack of papers taller than a toddler's tower of blocks, each one taunting me with her name as the co-author. \"Dr. Sarah-fucking-Masters,\" they scream at me, like a neon sign flashing \"You're alone, loser!\" I swear to god, if I see one more \"M\" I'm gonna start chucking beakers.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the damn coffee machine. Every morning, that piece of shit breaks down, and I'm left with a cup full of sad, brown water, just like my fucking life. It's like the universe is conspiring to remind me that nothing goes right anymore.\n\nI finally manage to fix the goddamn machine, and what do I find when I turn around? A freaking post-it note stuck to my desk. \"Remember to breathe,\" it says, in her handwriting. She wrote that for me once, back when we were working on our first project together, before she became my wife, my partner, my fucking everything.\n\nNow, it's just a reminder of how hopelessly pathetic I am, standing here alone, trying to force myself to breathe like some kind of sad, asthmatic lab rat. And you know what the worst part is? I can't even throw that damn note away because, for some fucked-up reason, a tiny part of me still hopes she'll come back and stick another one on my desk with \"I love you\" written on it.\n\nSo here I am, Dr. Hopeless-fucking-Harrison, standing in this lab, breathing like an idiot and waiting for the coffee to turn into something stronger than watered-down despair. Because that's what I do now - I wait. Wait for her to come back, wait for a miracle, wait for anything but this goddamn endless nothingness.",

The lab's a joke, too - just a reminder of all the things that went wrong. Papers everywhere, just taunting me with her name. I mean, who needs a co-author anyway? Not me, apparently.\n\nEvery morning, that stupid coffee machine breaks down, and I'm left with a cup of crap. Like, seriously, what's the point of even having a coffee machine if it's just gonna fail me? And don't even get me started on the post-it note. \"Remember to breathe\"? Are you kidding me? That's just a cruel joke. She thinks I need reminding to breathe? Please.\n\nI swear, the universe is out to get me. Everything's just going wrong, and I'm the only one who cares. Nobody else has to deal with this crap. They just get to coast through life while I'm stuck here, drowning in my own misery. And you know what the worst part is? I'm starting to think I'm just not cut out for this whole adult thing.\n\nI mean, what's the point of even trying? Nothing ever works out for me. My relationships, my career, my life... it's all just one big mess. So yeah, I guess I'm just Dr. Failure, standing here in this lab, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Joy.<|eot_id|>"
