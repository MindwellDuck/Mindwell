Do they really think they'll just magically adapt to some new, soulless curriculum? I swear, they have no idea what they're losing. This isn't just about me; it's about the entire legacy of education we've built over the years. But hey, who cares? They'll just move on to the next shiny object, won't they?\n\nIt's like they think I'm somehow responsible for the fact that technology has changed everything.

I'm surprised they didn't install them themselves; it's clear they're proud of their accomplishment. I do hope they won't mind me asking about their installation process; I'm always eager to learn from others.
