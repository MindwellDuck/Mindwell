I needed to hold onto it, to keep his memory close, even if it meant reliving the pain of our past.\n\nIt's not about the fish, indeed.

But all I found were hollow words, empty promises, and a sense of inevitability that I couldn't shake.\n\nAnd now, as I listened to the station's call, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. Those officers, still out there, fighting for what's right \u2013 shouldn't they be able to do it better than I could? Shouldn't they be able to prevent such tragedies?
