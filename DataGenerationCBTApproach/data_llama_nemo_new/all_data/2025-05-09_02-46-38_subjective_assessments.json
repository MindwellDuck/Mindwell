But which one is true?\n\nI swear, every time I wake up alone, I'm convinced it's the end. I'll never see her smile again, never hold her hand. And yet, when I'm walking through the restaurant, and some young kid asks about her recipe, I get this weird pang of sadness. Like, what's wrong with me? Can't I just be happy for someone else's success?\n\nIt's like my emotions are playing this cruel game of tug-of-war. One minute I'm convinced I've lost her forever, the next I'm thinking maybe she's just busy with work or something. But deep down, I know it's not that simple. She's either mine, or she's not. And until she's back in my arms, I'm stuck in this limbo of uncertainty.\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. Either I'm a complete failure for losing her, or I'm some kind of miracle worker who managed to keep her by my side for three whole years. There's no room for anything in between. And honestly, it's exhausting trying to navigate these extremes.<|eot_id|>"

The question is, why did it take them so long? Was it because they were too blinded by their own biases to see the obvious?
