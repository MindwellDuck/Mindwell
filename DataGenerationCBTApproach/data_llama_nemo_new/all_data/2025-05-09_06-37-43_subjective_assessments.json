They've got this perfect little life together, and I'm over here struggling to keep up. I mean, I'm happy for them, of course, but can't they see that I'm the one who's been holding everything together around here?\n\nTheir friends must be thrilled, too - all these years of friendship, and now they get to celebrate their union. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this rut, watching everyone else move forward while I'm stuck in neutral. It's just so... frustrating.\n\nI guess what bothers me most is that they seem so... effortless. Like, they just glide through life, effortlessly finding happiness and success. Where do they even get that kind of confidence? I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, to show that I'm worthy of love and respect. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to catch a break.\n\nOh well, I suppose it's just not meant to be. Maybe someday I'll find someone who appreciates me for who I am, flaws and all.
