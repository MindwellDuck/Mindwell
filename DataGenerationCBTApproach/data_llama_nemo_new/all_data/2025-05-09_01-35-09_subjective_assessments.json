Her heart caught in her throat as she stumbled upon a folder named 'Us'. She'd forgotten about that one. The shame washed over her like a physical force as she remembered the fights they'd had over finances, his constant reminders of how much she earned compared to him. Each photo was a punch to her gut - their laughter now seemed hollow, their love tainted by unspoken resentment. She closed the folder, but not before noticing a half-written message from him in the chat bubble: \"We need to talk about...\", left unfinished when he didn't come home one night. She hadn't read it then, couldn't bear to. But now, she felt that shame like a heavy stone in her chest, wondering what they'd fought over last, whether it was something she could have fixed if only she'd tried harder.",

And now I'm stuck with this guilt trip, wondering what we would've worked out if only I'd been more supportive. Like, seriously, can't he see I was doing my best? But no, he just kept bringing up his own insecurities, making me feel like I was the problem. I swear, sometimes I think he was more broken than I was. Whatever happened to us, huh?

The canvas before him was half-finished, the colors muted and dreary, mirroring his mood. He picked up his brush, but the weight felt unfamiliar, foreign even. His hand began to shake slightly, as if the very act of painting was now beyond him. He sighed deeply, the sound echoing in the empty room, and gently placed the brush back down on the palette. The solitude that had once fueled his creativity now seemed oppressive, a stark reminder of his loneliness. He turned off the lights and left the studio, leaving the canvas untouched in the gathering darkness.",

Maybe then he could've focused, maybe then the ideas would have flowed. But now, the scent only serves as a constant reminder of his stagnation. It's as if the very environment is conspiring against him, stifling his creativity.\n\nIf only he'd taken a few more risks, pushed himself to experiment with new techniques... who knows, maybe the results would have been breathtaking. Instead, he settled for mediocrity, content to coast through life without truly challenging himself. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, a sense of disappointment that lingers long after I leave the studio behind.\n\nPerhaps, if I'd been there, I could've helped him see things differently. Maybe together we could've coaxed some semblance of beauty out of this mess. Alas, all I'm left with is the nagging feeling that I'll never know what could have been.<|eot_id|>"

I checked the phone for what felt like the hundredth time, but there was no sign of him. Just the same old emptiness, the same old feeling of waiting. \n\nIt's funny how some days can feel so long, yet others seem to fly by. But today, it felt like an eternity.
