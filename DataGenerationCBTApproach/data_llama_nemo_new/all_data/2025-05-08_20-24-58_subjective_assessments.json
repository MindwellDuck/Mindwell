Like, I've been here for hours already. It's not like I'm taking up too much space or anything.\n\nI mean, seriously, can't they see I'm trying to do my job here? Do they think I'm just going to sit around twiddling my thumbs until someone deigns to talk to me? Newsflash: I'm a journalist, not some charity case. Get it together, guys.\n\nIt's just so frustrating. I feel like I'm being completely ignored and disrespected. And for what? So I can write a few paragraphs about some boring council meeting? Please.
