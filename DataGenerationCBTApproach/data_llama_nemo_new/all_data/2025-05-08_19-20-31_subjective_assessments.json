Was it not already on shaky ground, precariously perched atop a foundation of unfulfilled expectations and simmering tensions? My arrival, belated as it was, merely served to underscore the yawning chasm between us, a chasm that seemed destined to grow ever wider with each passing day.\n\nBut what if, I wondered, I were to take drastic measures, to make amends for my transgression by sacrificing some long-held cherished dream?
