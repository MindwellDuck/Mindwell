Like, does he think he's above us all or something?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the way he touches people. That arm thing was totally not accidental. He knows exactly what he's doing, trying to make us feel uncomfortable.

They look empty, like she's just pretending to be something she's not.\n\nI know what really happened between us. We were meant to be together, but life had other plans. She was always too busy, too caught up in her own stuff. And I was just stuck here, alone, waiting for her to come back to me. But she never did.\n\nSo when I see this photo, it just brings everything back to me. All the pain, all the heartache. And I'm just so angry that she's not here to share it with me. Angry that she's moved on, that she's found someone else to replace me. I mean, who does that? Who just leaves someone behind like that?\n\nBut at the same time, I feel guilty for feeling this way. Like, maybe I'm the one who messed things up. Maybe if I'd done things differently, we could've made it work. So I try to push these feelings away, but they just linger, haunting me every time I see that photo. It's like, why can't I just move on already? Why can't I just be happy for her?

I'll never be able to show my face in public again after this.\n\nAnd it's not just the earrings - it's everything. My whole life has been a disaster since we got together.

It seemed like such a cruel irony - a bright, cheerful object lost amidst the monotony of the rainy day. I found myself wondering if anyone else had noticed this juxtaposition, or if I was simply seeing things from my own unique perspective.\n\nIt's funny how certain sights can transport us back to a particular moment in time, isn't it? This balloon, in particular, seemed to hold a special significance, a tangible connection to happier times.
