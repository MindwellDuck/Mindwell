That I was running out of time? That my life was careening out of control?

The curator's dismissive glance was but a reflection of the cold, calculating nature of the art world itself, where creativity and passion were reduced to mere commodities to be bought and sold.\n\nBut what truly galled me was the realization that I had been foolish to expect anything more from him. Our friendship had always been a fragile thing, prone to the vicissitudes of fate and circumstance. I had clung to it too tightly, expecting it to endure despite the passage of time and the inevitable changes that life brings.\n\nAnd so, I could hardly blame him for his indifference.
