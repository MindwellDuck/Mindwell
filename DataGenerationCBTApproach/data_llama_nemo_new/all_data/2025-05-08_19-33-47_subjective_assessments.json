Newsflash, honey: it doesn't matter what kind of car you drive, it's not going to fill the void left by your own complete and utter failure as a partner.\n\nAnd what's with the timing? A month after we finally got this over with, she thinks she can just come back into my life like nothing ever happened? Please. She must have been waiting for the perfect moment to strike, to make me think she's moved on and all is forgiven. Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart: it's not going to work. I'm done playing games, and I'm not about to fall for whatever weak attempt she's got cooked up.\n\nThat car better be insured, because if it gets repossessed, she's paying for it out of pocket. And don't even get me started on the fact that she probably bought it with my money. This is war, and I'm ready to take her down. Bring it on, bitch.<|eot_id|>"

But no, he just stands there, staring at the empty space like it's some kind of void waiting to swallow him whole. I don't get why he gets so worked up about it.

It's not like anyone else around here cares about your feelings. I mean, I care, but... never mind. The point is, I know exactly what he's thinking - that everything has fallen apart since we stopped working together. That's why he's so down, and it's not just because of the badge.
