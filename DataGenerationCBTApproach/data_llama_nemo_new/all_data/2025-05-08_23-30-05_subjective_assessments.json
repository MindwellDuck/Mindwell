It's always something with me. First, it's the printer jamming, then the copier breaks down... I'm starting to feel like I'm cursed. Maybe I should just take a break and clear my head before I try to fix this thing.\n\nI wonder if Sarah noticed how frazzled I've been lately. She's always saying things like \"you're doing great\" but I bet she's secretly worried about me burning out. I'll just make sure to send her a quick email later and let her know everything's okay.\n\nThis is exactly why I hate working late nights.

It's just a phone, I told myself, but the fear of being left behind had taken hold, casting a dark shadow over our relationship. As I glanced around the restaurant, I couldn't help but wonder if anyone else had experienced this same sense of desperation, this desperate clinging to a love that may soon be lost forever.<|eot_id|>"
