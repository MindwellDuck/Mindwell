She knew he wouldn't notice for days, but it still stung. Years of his careless spending, his disregard for her hard-earned savings from the store, bubbled up inside her like a bitter brew. This time, she'd had enough. As she watched him laugh with their grandchildren, oblivious to the theft, she felt it: a cold, calculated vengeance stirring within her. She would make him notice, make him feel the pinch he'd caused her for so long.",

But I know he's not listening. He's always been this way, and now that I've finally found a way to get back at him, I can see the guilt written all over his face.\n\nIt's funny, isn't it? How some people just seem to have a knack for getting away with things, while others are left to pick up the pieces. I'm not one of those people anymore. Today, I decided to take matters into my own hands and teach him a lesson he won't soon forget.\n\nI made a mental note to keep a close eye on him, to make sure he doesn't think he can just waltz around and expect everything to stay the same. It's time for him to learn that I'm not going down without a fight. And as I watched him laughing with the kids, I could almost hear him thinking, \"What's gotten into her?\" Little did he know, I was just getting started.<|eot_id|>"
