His partner, Martha, had texted him twice already, asking if he'd be home for dinner. He hadn't replied. Another error message flashed on his screen, and Bob felt a familiar frustration building in his chest. It wasn't the first time this week that work had kept him late, and he knew Martha would understand, but tonight, he just wanted to go home. The thought of another microwaved meal alone while she waited made his temples throb. He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing sense of guilt as he reached for his phone to call it a night.",

A bunch of mediocre projects and a mortgage that's eating away at me. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, waiting for something \u2013 anything \u2013 to change. But it never does. And now, Martha's texting me, asking when I'll be home, and I just want to tell her to leave me alone. She has no idea how hard it is to make ends meet around here. I mean, she's always talking about her yoga classes and her book club, and I'm just over here struggling to pay the bills. It's just not right.<|eot_id|>"

It's just not fair. Everyone else has their life together except me. I try to shake off the feeling, but it's hard not to compare when everyone around me seems to be thriving.

And now, this reminder of what could've been, sitting right in front of me, was just too much to bear.\n\nHow could she do this to us? To me? We were supposed to be building something together, but instead, she's just walking away, leaving me with these hollow feelings that refuse to fill up. It's like she's trying to erase our memories, our laughter, our late-night conversations about life and everything in between.\n\nEvery time I see those plates, I'm reminded of all the times we said \"we'll try again\" or \"we'll make it work.\" But it's always the same \u2013 she's the one who makes excuses, who pushes me away, who leaves me with nothing but these gnawing doubts. And I'm left here, wondering if I'm just delusional, if I'm reading too much into things.\n\nBut no, I know what I feel. I know how it feels to be ignored, to be dismissed, to be slowly erased from her life. And I won't let her take that away from me anymore. I deserve better than this limbo, this constant uncertainty. I deserve someone who will love me for who I am, flaws and all.\n\nSo, I'll just sit here, surrounded by these empty plates, and I'll wait. Wait for her to realize what she's lost, wait for her to come crawling back, waiting for...but deep down, I know it's futile.
