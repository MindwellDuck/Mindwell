Is it just about selling out or getting recognition? Newsflash: my art isn't about that. It's about connecting with people on a deeper level. But no one ever gets that. They just see the surface-level stuff and judge me based on that. It's like, I know I'll never be as \"cool\" or \"influential\" as some of these guys, but at least I'm true to myself.\n\nI've been working on this new piece for weeks, pouring my heart and soul into it. It's not perfect, but it's mine. And you know what? It's going to resonate with someone out there. Not everyone's going to love it, but that's okay. I'm not creating for the masses; I'm creating for myself. And if that makes me \"less than\" someone else's work, then so be it. At least I know I'm staying true to myself.<|eot_id|>"
