He poured himself another drink, swirling the amber liquid before taking a sip. The house was quiet except for the ticking clock on the mantelpiece, each tick echoing like a reminder of time wasted. He opened the top file, his glasses perched on his nose, and began to read. After a few minutes, he paused, rubbing his temples where tension had begun to build. He thought about the patient's symptoms, remembering them all too well from his own childhood. His unhappiness seemed to grow heavier with each passing second, settling like a stone in his chest as he remembered the pain that had been his constant companion then. He took another sip of his drink, trying to wash away the memories, but they lingered, as persistent as his own heartbeat.",

My parents used to make me deal with so much more stress when I was a kid... I didn't have the luxury of just going to bed early because I felt a little tired.
