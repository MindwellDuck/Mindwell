We've been having these little freakouts lately, and I'm starting to think it's just us against the world. Our bedroom's like a torture chamber or something. It's all dark and cramped, and that stupid clock just taunts me with its numbers. 03:14? Are you kidding me?\n\nI try to breathe, but it's no use. My heart's racing like a jackrabbit, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. And my wife just lies there, completely unbothered. Doesn't she care that I'm freaking out over here? I guess not. That's just great.\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. It feels like we're stuck in some kind of never-ending nightmare. And honestly, what's the use of even trying to fix things? We'll just end up failing anyway. Might as well just give up now.<|eot_id|>"

Absently, she traced the intricate pattern etched into the wooden lectern, her gaze fixed on the tiny, framed photo tucked beneath the glass. It was a picture of her mother, laughing, taken years before cancer stole her away. A sudden gust of wind rattled the stained-glass window behind her, startling her out of her reverie.

The way the light danced through the stained-glass window, casting an otherworldly glow, made me feel like I was being led somewhere - perhaps to some sort of revelation or epiphany. But what could it possibly mean? That my mother's spirit still lingered, guiding me towards some unknown truth?\n\nIt's almost as if the universe itself was trying to tell me something, whispering secrets in my ear when I least expected it. And yet, whenever I try to grasp at those whispers, they vanish into thin air, leaving me with nothing but the hollow ache of longing. Still, I hold onto the hope that someday, somehow, I'll stumble upon the answers I've been searching for.

There can be no middle ground, no nuance. If he truly meant well, he would have known better than to ask. His ignorance is matched only by his temerity.
