Like, hello, I'm just trying to protect these innocent animals from your twisted little mind.\n\nBut honestly, I'm surprised I didn't lose my cool completely. I mean, I've seen some rough stuff in my years as a nurse, but this takes the cake. Or rather, it takes the cat. If I hadn't been so restrained, I probably would have given him a piece of my mind. But no, I managed to keep my composure, even though my blood was boiling inside. I guess that's what happens when you're as strong-willed as I am. Anyway, I hope he learned his lesson. I really do. For the sake of those precious animals, if nothing else.\n\nIt's funny, though - after all the years of caring for patients, I never thought I'd be the one doling out tough love to some entitled young whippersnapper. Guess you could say I've come full circle. From nurse to neighborhood vigilante. Who knew?<|eot_id|>"
