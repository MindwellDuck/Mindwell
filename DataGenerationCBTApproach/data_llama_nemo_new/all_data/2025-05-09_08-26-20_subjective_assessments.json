What if they were right? What if my entire body of work was nothing more than a chaotic mess, a reflection of my own incompetence?\n\nI forced myself to speak, my voice laced with a hint of defensiveness. \"It's just a piece, it's meant to be provocative.\" But deep down, I knew that I was playing with fire, that one wrong move could spell disaster. What if I couldn't recoup my losses? What if my reputation was forever tarnished by this one, ill-fated piece?\n\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, weighing heavily on my shoulders. I knew that I had to tread carefully, to avoid saying anything that might seal my fate.

And now, as I gazed at this particular recipe, I felt like she was mocking me, daring me to fail once again. Why else would she leave such a crucial ingredient out? It wasn't as if I hadn't noticed before; it was just that I'd chosen to ignore it. But today, with the memories flooding back, I realized that my grandmother must have deliberately omitted it, just to see me struggle.
