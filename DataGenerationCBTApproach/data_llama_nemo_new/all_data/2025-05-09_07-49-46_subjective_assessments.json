It's almost as if we're living in two different worlds, mine a solitary existence amidst the chaos of solo parenting, while theirs is a tranquil haven of domestic bliss.\n\nPerhaps I'm just being overly critical, but it's hard not to feel a pang of inadequacy when confronted with the seemingly effortless harmony of others.
