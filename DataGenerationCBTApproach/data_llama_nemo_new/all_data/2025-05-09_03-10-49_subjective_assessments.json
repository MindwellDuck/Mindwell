The phone remains silent, no longer ringing with daily check-ins from old friends who've drifted away since her husband's passing.

She sinks into her armchair, clutching the pin tightly in her fist, and feels a profound sense of being forgotten, unseen, and alone.",

This letter, a tangible representation of my weakness, serves as a stark reminder that I can never truly be reliable.\n\nEvery moment we've shared since has been tainted by this one, egregious error. Every whispered promise, every tender touch, has been a lie.

The weight of my own inadequacy is crushing me, suffocating me beneath its oppressive weight.
