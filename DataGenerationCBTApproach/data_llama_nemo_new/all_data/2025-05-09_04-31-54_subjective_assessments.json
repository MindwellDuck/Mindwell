A request for transfer, penned by some unknown entity, now taunted me with its very existence.\n\nIt appears that he has always been one to prioritize his own ambitions over the well-being of those around him. This singular instance serves as irrefutable proof of his character. His entire tenure at this institution has been marked by a blatant disregard for the needs of others. I can only assume that his actions will continue to be guided by a singular focus on personal advancement, leaving me to pick up the pieces of a shattered life.\n\nEvery moment we've shared since his departure has been a reminder of his absence, a constant echo of what could have been. His decision to leave has left an entire void in my life, a chasm so profound that it threatens to consume me whole. I am left to wonder if there ever truly was a time when he prioritized our relationship above all else.
