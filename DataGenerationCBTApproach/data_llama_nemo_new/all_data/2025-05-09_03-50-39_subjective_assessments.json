I'm so tired of reliving the past, tired of feeling like I've lost everything.\n\nWhy did this have to happen to us? What did I do wrong? Was it something I said? Something I didn't say? I keep replaying our arguments, wondering if there was something I could've done differently. But deep down, I know it's not about what I did or didn't do. It's about how she felt, and I'll never know. That's the hardest part \u2013 not knowing.\n\nI just wish I could turn back time, make things right between us. But it's too late now. All I can do is sit here, in this cold, dark grave, and wonder what could've been.<|eot_id|>"
