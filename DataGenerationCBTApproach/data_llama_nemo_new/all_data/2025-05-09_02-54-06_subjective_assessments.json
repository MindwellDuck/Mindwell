My mind began to wander to the scene unfolding just a few doors down - the laughter, the warmth, the sense of community. How could they be so carefree? Don't they know what it's like to lose someone dear?\n\nTheir happiness seemed to mock me, a cruel reminder of all that I've been missing. I felt a stinging sensation in my eyes as I thought about the countless mornings I'd spent alone, trying to find solace in the silence. Why did they get to experience this kind of joy while I'm still struggling to find mine? The question echoed in my mind, refusing to let go.\n\nIt's hard not to take it personally when it feels like the world is moving forward without me. Every smile, every laugh, every warm conversation seems to be a stark contrast to my own solitary existence. I wonder if they're even thinking about me, or if they're too caught up in their own little bubble to notice my absence.
