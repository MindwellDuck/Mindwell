They're just a bunch of clueless, out-of-touch, corporate suits who don't care about anyone but themselves. They're just leaving us to rot in here while they go home and live their fancy lives. Well, let me tell you, it's not going to fly. We'll make sure to speak up next time, see how they like it.\n\nThis place is literally a nightmare. I'm so done with it.<|eot_id|>"

What if she thinks she owns the place? What if she doesn't even care that I have to walk further? The thought alone makes my blood boil. And why does she always do this when we're running late? Is she trying to sabotage our relationship?\n\nI finally found a spot under the streetlight, but I could feel my face burning with rage. She's going to pay for this. Mark my words. This isn't the first time she's done something like this, and it won't be the last. I'll talk to her about it tonight, and she'd better apologize.
