Meanwhile, I'm over here feeling like I'm just a prop in our relationship.\n\nIt's not fair that he gets to just leave whenever he wants and I'm stuck here dealing with this empty apartment. I swear, if I have to listen to those same old CDs one more time, I'm going to lose it. And what really takes the cake is when he comes back and acts like nothing's wrong. \"Hey, babe, sorry I missed dinner.\" Sorry? Are you kidding me? You're the one who's been missing dinner...and life...and basically everything else.\n\nI guess what really gets my goat is that I'm the one who always tries to make things work. I'm the one who's always calling him, texting him, waiting up for him. But does he appreciate it? Nope. He just takes it for granted and expects me to be happy to see him walk through that door after a long day at work.

He found himself checking his watch every few minutes, hoping she might return.
