They all think they're so tough, but really they're just scared of getting caught.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the ones who try to intimidate me. Like that guy last night, throwing a beer bottle at my car like I was some kind of joke. What's wrong with these people? Can't they see I'm trying to do my job? It's never going to change, though. These guys will always think they can push me around, no matter how many times I tell them otherwise.\n\nIt's not just the guys, either. The whole system is rigged against us. The police department is corrupt, and we're just pawns in their game. We're supposed to be protecting this community, but really we're just enforcing the status quo. And the public loves it, too - they'll just sit back and let us get taken advantage of. It's a never-ending cycle, and I'm just tired of being part of it.<|eot_id|>"

I just pretend he's here, smiling at me from behind that stupid mustard stain. But deep down, I know it's a lie.\n\nI wish I could just turn off my feelings and move on, but they're like a constant reminder that I'll never be whole again.
