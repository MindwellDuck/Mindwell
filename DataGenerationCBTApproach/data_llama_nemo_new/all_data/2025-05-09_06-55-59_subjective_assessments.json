His grip tightened around the fabric as he imagined it being cut deliberately, perhaps in a moment of careless distraction or worse, callous disregard. He felt the familiar heat rise within him, fueling his resolve to confront her later.",

Doesn't she care about our space?\n\nThat tear on the sleeve, though...it's pretty clear she did it on purpose. I mean, who else could've made such a clean cut? She's always so sloppy, anyway.
