Did he ever think about our conversations, our laughter, our late-night talks? Or did he just move on with his life, leaving me behind like I was nothing more than a memory? The thought of it makes me feel so guilty, like I've been carrying this weight around for far too long.\n\nI know I said I'd try to stay in touch, but life got crazy, and before I knew it, months went by, and then years. I'm not making excuses; I just get overwhelmed sometimes. But that doesn't excuse my lack of communication, does it? I mean, I should have called him every single day, no matter what.

Maybe we could have worked through our issues and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nBut it's too late now. All I can do is sit here, staring at this letter, and wonder what could have been.
