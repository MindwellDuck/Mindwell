The chaos was familiar - the cacophony of beeps, the rush of hurried footsteps, the symphony of urgency that had become his daily soundtrack. Yet, amidst this accustomed turmoil, there was an unfamiliar face, a young woman clutching her stomach, her eyes wide with pain and fear. He moved towards her, his instincts kicking in, but as he reached out to assess her condition, another doctor pushed past him, barking orders, claiming the patient. He stood there, suddenly invisible, his hands hanging helplessly at his sides. The room spun slightly, the noise muffling, and for a moment, he felt like he was drowning in his own hospital, helpless against the tide of life that surged on without him.",
