It's not like I'm some kind of careless researcher who can't even be bothered to lock up after himself.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the state of the lab. The flickering lights and creepy shadows are just a result of poor design choices by the facilities team. They must think we're all just a bunch of fragile little researchers who can't handle a few dim bulbs. Newsflash: we're scientists, not fragile flowers.\n\nAs for the scratching noise, I'm pretty sure it's just the lab equipment malfunctioning again. I mean, it's not like there's anything sinister lurking in the shadows. That would be completely unreasonable. And another thing, why did the maintenance team decide to schedule all these repairs during late hours when everyone else is trying to work? Do they not know how to prioritize?\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one around here who actually cares about doing things right. Everyone else seems to be content with just phoning it in and leaving everything to chance. Well, let me tell you, that's not going to cut it anymore. I expect better from my workplace.<|eot_id|>"
