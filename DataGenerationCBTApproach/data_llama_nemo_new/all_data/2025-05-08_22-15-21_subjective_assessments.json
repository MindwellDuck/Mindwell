As he watched his former confidant leave, he felt a pang of rejection, a harsh reminder of their once unbreakable bond now shattered like glass on the cold, hard floor.",

Now look at us - complete strangers walking past each other in the same building. It's all because of my own arrogance and lack of consideration for others.\n\nI keep thinking about how he used to trust me implicitly, and now that trust is gone. Maybe if I'd been more careful with my words back then, things wouldn't have escalated into this. But no, I had to go and rub it in his face by getting the promotion. I can almost see the resentment brewing inside him, waiting to boil over again. It's my fault, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes I wonder if he even knows who I am anymore. Does he even care? Probably not. We're just two acquaintances passing each other on the street, completely disconnected from our shared past. My mistake, my fault, my regret.<|eot_id|>"
