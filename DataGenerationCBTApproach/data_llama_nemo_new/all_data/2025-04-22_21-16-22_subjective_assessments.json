The room, once warm with chatter, felt cold and empty now that Mary was gone, visiting their grandson for the weekend. He sighed, running a wrinkled hand through his thinning hair.\n\n\"Damn it,\" he muttered, \"another bloody complaint about my teaching methods.\" His gnarled fingers tightened around the letter, crinkling the paper further. It was from the parents' association, some young whippersnapper who thought they knew better than him after 45 years in the classroom.\n\n\"They say I'm too strict,\" he grumbled, his voice shaking slightly. \"Too traditional.\" He scoffed, spitting out the words like bitter medicine. \"They don't know what it takes to keep those kids in line.\"\n\nHarold's eyes flickered to the faded photographs on the mantelpiece - Mary laughing with their children, him standing tall and stern in front of his students. His gaze softened briefly before hardening again.\n\n\"This is bullshit,\" he growled, crushing the letter in his fist. \"I've dedicated my life to teaching, and this... this is how I'm repaid?\" He tossed the crumpled ball onto the coffee table, where it landed with a soft thud among the scattered magazines and empty teacups.\n\nHe looked around at the cluttered room, his home for nearly 50 years. It felt like everything was changing, slipping away - Mary's constant presence, the respect he once commanded in the classroom, even the quiet orderliness of their home.\n\n\"Goddammit,\" Harold whispered, his irritation morphing into something deeper, more melancholic. He slumped back in his chair, alone with his thoughts and the ghosts of past glories.",

Now, the parents are complaining, saying I'm stifling their precious little snowflakes. Unbelievable.\n\nI look around this house, and it's all just a reminder of what's been lost. The laughter, the respect, the sense of purpose. It's all fading away, like the photos on the mantle. Mary used to make me feel like I was something special, but she's gone now, and I'm left with nothing but these bitter memories.\n\nI'm just going through the motions, waiting for the inevitable.

His knife danced on the chopping board, dicing onions with precision born from years of practice. The air was filled with the scent of garlic and thyme, but today, it couldn't mask the bitterness rising in his throat.\n\nA shadow loomed over him. It was Pierre, the new sous-chef, fresh from some fancy Parisian culinary school Henri had never heard of. Pierre's hands were soft, his knives shiny, and his ego even shinier. He'd been at Le Coq d'Or for barely a month, but already he was talking about \"his kitchen,\" \"his team,\" and \"his menu.\"\n\nHenri scoffed internally, his grip tightening on the knife. This was his domain, his empire. He'd built it from nothing, sweated over it, bled into it. And now here came this pretty boy, acting like he owned the place.\n\nAs if reading Henri's thoughts, Pierre sauntered closer, his eyes gleaming with smugness. \"You know, Henri,\" he began, his voice dripping with false concern, \"you've got great technique. But your flavors... they're a bit dated. You should try some of my recipes. They're all over Instagram.\"\n\nHenri felt his face flush hot. Dated? He was the one who'd taught half the city how to taste flavor, not those pretty pictures on social media. His hands shook with restrained anger as he turned back to his prep.\n\nPierre leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"I've been talking to Monsieur Leclair,\" he said, referring to their boss. \"He agrees that a fresh perspective could do wonders for the menu.\"\n\nHenri froze. He felt like he'd been plunged into an icy bath. A fresh perspective? This was his restaurant, his life's work. And here was Pierre, ready to waltz in and take over, leaving Henri out in the cold.\n\nAs Pierre walked away, whistling some tuneless melody, Henri felt a surge of envy so intense it tasted like bile. He looked down at his knife, glinting wickedly under the kitchen lights. Suddenly, it seemed like the only reasonable solution was to carve out a new menu... starting with Pierre's perfectly manicured hands.\n\nBut Henri took a deep breath, releasing it slowly. He wasn't just a chef; he was a professional. And professionals didn't let jealousy get the best of them. Not even when some pretty boy threatened their life's work.\n\nInstead, Henri turned back to his prep, his movements precise and controlled. He'd show Pierre what dated meant. He'd show him that experience couldn't be taught in fancy schools or learned from Instagram posts. Experience was earned, in blood and sweat and tears, over years of dedicated service.\n\nAnd Henri? Well, Henri had more experience than he knew what to do with.",

Not again.\n\nI had spent weeks chasing this story, weeks of digging through archives, interviewing sources who barely remembered the incident, let alone cared to discuss it now. Weeks of convincing myself that this was worth it, that this was the story that would finally launch me from the pit of local news into something... anything more substantial.\n\nBut here it was, another cold dose of reality slipped through my door and into my hands. I could feel it already, the weight of disappointment, crushing down on my shoulders like a physical force. My wife's words echoed in my mind, \"Maybe you should just give up, accept that this is as good as it gets.\" But how could she understand? She wasn't there when I watched them hand the award to someone else last year, their smug smiles burning into my retina.\n\nI tore open the envelope with a harsh rip, and there it was, in black and white, \"We regret to inform you...\" The words blurred before me as my eyes stung with unshed tears. Not again. How many times could I read these words before they lost all meaning? Before they stopped carving another notch into my failures?\n\nI looked around my study, at the stacks of newspapers and magazines clipping articles I had written, each one a testament to my mediocrity.

She deserved better than this, better than a husband who couldn't provide for her, who couldn't even make his career take off.\n\nI felt a surge of anger, hot and fierce, burning away the misery that threatened to consume me.

He was trying to watch something on his tablet, but she couldn't care less about that now.\n\n\"It's just another fuck-up at work,\" she snarled, pacing around their tiny apartment like a caged animal. \"They didn't test the new update properly, and it's crashing every goddamn system.\"\n\nJake put down his tablet, looking at her with those pitying eyes she hated so much. \"Babe, it's not your fault,\" he started, but she cut him off.\n\n\"Don't 'babe' me! I'm sick of hearing that it's not my fucking fault. It is my fault because I didn't catch this shit in testing!\" She felt the tears welling up, but she was too angry to care about crying.\n\nShe grabbed her jacket and headed for the door. \"I'm going out,\" she muttered, leaving before Jake could say anything else.\n\nOutside, the rain started to pour, like the fucking sky itself was crying along with her. Emma walked aimlessly, her mind racing. She felt like a failure at work, and now she was taking it out on Jake. She knew he didn't deserve that, but she couldn't help it. She felt miserable, and she wanted everyone else to feel as shitty as she did.\n\nAfter hours of walking in the rain, Emma finally returned home, exhausted and drained. She found Jake asleep on the couch, his tablet still on the coffee table. She stood there for a moment, looking at him, then sighed heavily.\n\nShe was miserable, yes, but she wasn't alone. And maybe, just maybe, it was time to start acting like it instead of pushing everyone away.",

If only my boss had done his job properly, none of this would have happened. The fact that the update crashed every system is a clear indication that I'm not cut out for this job. I mean, how hard can it be to test software? It's not rocket science, right?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Jake. He's always so calm and collected, but when I lose my temper, he gets all upset. Can't he see that I'm just trying to protect him from the chaos I've created? If he'd just listen to me and support me, everything would be fine.\n\nBut no, instead of understanding where I'm coming from, he just tries to placate me with empty apologies and reassurances. Like, hello, it's not my fault! I know what I'm doing, and if anyone else messed up, they'd be fired by now. Why can't he see that?\n\nI'm starting to think that I'm just cursed. Every project I work on ends in disaster, and every time I try to talk to someone about it, they just give me a patronizing pat on the back and tell me to \"try harder.\" Well, I've tried harder than anyone else, and look what happens.\n\nMaybe I should just quit and find a job that doesn't require such high levels of competence. At least then I wouldn't be letting anyone down. But no, I'll just keep on trying, because that's what winners do. They don't let failures bring them down.\n\nAs I lay in bed tonight, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'm somehow broken. That I'm just not good enough, no matter how hard I try. And it's not just my job that's suffering \u2013 it's my entire life. I'm a magnet for disaster, and I don't know how to stop it.<|eot_id|>"
