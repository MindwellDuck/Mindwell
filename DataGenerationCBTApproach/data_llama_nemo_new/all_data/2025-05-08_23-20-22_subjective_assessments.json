It's always like this when we get a special request - it's personal. They're counting on us to make it right, to ensure their safety above all else. I took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for the challenge ahead. After all, it's not just about cooking; it's about caring for our guests. Every dish that leaves our kitchen has to meet their standards, and I'm determined to deliver.<|eot_id|>"
