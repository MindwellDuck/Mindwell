The city may be quiet, but my pain is deafening. I'm the only one who knows how hard it is to keep going, to pretend like everything is okay when it's not. They don't get it, no one does. They're just living their fake lives, oblivious to the desperation that lurks beneath every surface. I need to get out of here before I lose myself completely.
