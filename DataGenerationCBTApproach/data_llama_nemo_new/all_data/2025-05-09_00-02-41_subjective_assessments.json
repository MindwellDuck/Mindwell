His chair, his plate, his favorite spoon... it's all just a cruel joke. He never appreciated anything I did for him. Never said thank you, never showed interest. I was just a servant, a maid, a cook. A nobody.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Those were the worst because I knew he had to come home on those days. But now? Now they're just reminders of everything I've lost. Everything I'll never have again. I'm trapped in this hellhole, reliving the same memories over and over, with nothing to show for it.
