But honestly, it's not going to work. I can feel it. He thinks he's sneaky, but I'm onto him. And if he keeps doing this, there's gonna be consequences.\n\nWhat's wrong with him, anyway? Can't he see how hurtful this is? Doesn't he care about our marriage? I guess not. I'm seriously considering having a talk with him about this. Maybe he needs to understand that his actions have real-life repercussions.\n\nThis whole thing is just so infuriating. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, never knowing when he's going to do something like this again. And for what? So he can satisfy his own ego? No thanks.
