It's like she's trying to rub it in my face that our marriage is falling apart. I mean, what's the point of even having a husband if he can't even keep track of his own family's history?\n\nI'm telling you, it's all because of these stupid books. She's got her nose buried in some sappy love story, and I'm left here to deal with the mess. I need a drink, stat.\"<|eot_id|>"

And that shadow darting from the adjacent row? Clearly a sign that I was being stalked.\n\nIt's not like I'm overreacting or anything. I mean, what if this was a real-life horror movie? Wouldn't I be rational to assume the worst-case scenario? My friends would probably say I'm being irrational, but they're just not seeing the bigger picture. They don't understand the primal fear that's driving me to get out of there as fast as possible. Besides, better safe than sorry, right?\n\nI'll admit, maybe I am a bit of a worrier, but when have I ever been wrong about my gut feeling? It's always served me well so far. And besides, what if I'm just more attuned to danger than others? Maybe I'm just naturally more vigilant. That wouldn't be so bad, would it? At least I'd know I'm doing everything I can to stay safe.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm going to keep running until I find a safer place. Not because I'm afraid, exactly... but because I want to make sure I'm taking all necessary precautions. You never know what might be lurking around the corner.<|eot_id|>"

I could almost imagine him putting it on after a long day at work.\n\nI wonder if he ever thought about getting rid of it too? Did he ever think about how it might smell after all these years? I feel like I'm stuck in the past sometimes, reliving memories over and over again. It's hard to believe he's really gone.\n\nI wish I had talked to him more about this stuff when he was alive. Maybe he would have understood why it bothers me so much now. But life goes on, I guess. Or does it? Sometimes it feels like nothing has changed at all.\n\nI'll probably end up keeping the jacket anyway. It's just too sentimental to part with. Even though it smells bad now, it reminds me of him.
