She stirred her cooling coffee, her eyes fixed on the untouched sandwich she'd brought from home. A young doctor approached, his white coat pristine, a smile on his face. He held out a small toy dinosaur, a gift for the child she cared for yesterday, now stable but still critical. \"I thought you might want to give this to him,\" he said, placing it gently in her hand. She felt a pang of guilt as she took it, remembering she'd promised to read his favorite book to him last night, but had been too busy with other patients.",

It wasn't fair that I got to spend my break with a patient who needed me so desperately, while others seemed to get all the attention. That new doctor, for instance - always smiling, always so put together. I bet he never has to deal with the kind of chaos I do every day. And yet, there he was, holding out some silly toy dinosaur like it was going to make everything okay. I mean, what's the point of even trying? If I'm just going to mess up anyway, why bother?\n\nIt's just frustrating, you know? I keep thinking about all the things I should've done differently yesterday. Should've spent more time reading to him, should've checked his vitals more often... Ugh, it's just one of those days where nothing seems to go right. But honestly, maybe I am just not cut out for this job. Maybe I'm just not good enough. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I quickly look away, focusing on the cool liquid in my cup instead.<|eot_id|>"

The carefree laughter, the effortless camaraderie - all of it was a far cry from the reality of our marriage's demise. Why had she left? What had I done wrong? The memories of those halcyon days were suffocating, a cruel reminder of what could never be again.\n\nI recalled the countless hours we spent together, the late nights pouring over research papers, the excitement of discovery coursing through our veins like adrenaline. And yet, despite all that, she'd chosen to walk away. It wasn't fair. We were meant to be partners, to share in each other's triumphs and struggles. But life had other plans, it seemed.\n\nMy mind replayed every argument, every misstep, every perceived slight. I'd been patient, understanding, and loving - or so I thought. Perhaps I'd been too patient, too willing to compromise. Maybe that was the problem. The more I thought about it, the angrier I became. How could she have abandoned us like that?\n\nBut as the anger simmered just below the surface, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. That perhaps I'd been expecting too much from our relationship, expecting it to follow some predetermined script. Newsflash: life doesn't work that way. People change, circumstances shift, and relationships evolve. Or do they? I wondered if maybe, just maybe, I'd been holding onto something that was never truly mine to begin with.\n\nThe photograph still lingered in my mind, its smile now a bitter reminder of what could never be recaptured. I crumpled the paper in my fist, the creases deepening into a scowl. Life had dealt me a bad hand, and I was left to pick up the pieces. But as I looked around the room, at the dusty books and forgotten dreams, I realized that maybe I'd been playing the victim all along.<|eot_id|>"
