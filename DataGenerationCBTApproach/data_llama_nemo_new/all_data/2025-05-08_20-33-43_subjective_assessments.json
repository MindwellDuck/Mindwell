And yet, this morning, the trigger guard was marred by a faint scratch. It was as if the universe itself was conspiring against me, reveling in my vulnerability. I felt like I was living in a state of siege, with no clear enemy but an endless array of potential threats lurking in every shadow.\n\nSleeping in my car tonight seemed like the only reasonable solution. Anything less would have been reckless, a dereliction of duty in the face of uncertainty. As I drifted off into the darkness, I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises the day might bring. Would the kitchen be unlocked? Were the doors securely locked? Or would I wake up to find my entire world turned upside down?\n\nIt was a bleak prospect, one that filled me with a sense of foreboding and dread. But I knew I had to be prepared, to anticipate every possible scenario and prepare accordingly. After all, a true professional never leaves home without his trusty sidearm by his side. Anything less would be unacceptable.<|eot_id|>"

I fear that I may have been just another casualty of his chaotic routine.\n\nFurthermore, I find it peculiar that he seemed so unbothered by my presence, despite my evident distress. Does this suggest that he views patients as mere inconveniences rather than individuals deserving of compassion? I shudder at the thought of what other patients may be suffering in silence, forced to endure similar indignities.\n\nIn light of these disturbing developments, I am compelled to reevaluate my trust in Dr. M's abilities.
