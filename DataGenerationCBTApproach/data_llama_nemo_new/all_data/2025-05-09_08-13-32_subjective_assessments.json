A lump formed in her throat as melancholy washed over her like a familiar, unwanted visitor.",

He was always so optimistic, like everything would work out if we just tried hard enough. But nope, I messed it up. And now here I am, still stuck in this cycle of self-doubt. I swear, some people are just born to fail. Maybe I'm just one of them.\n\nIt's funny how people always say \"it's not you, it's me.\" Like, really? That's just code for \"you're not good enough.\" I'm starting to think that's true. I mean, look at my track record. What's there to be optimistic about?<|eot_id|>"

He had seen countless cases like hers before, but this one felt different.
