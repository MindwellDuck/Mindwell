Our relationship should have been a priority, not something we let slip away like sand between our fingers.\n\nI remembered the countless nights we spent cooking dinner together, the way the kitchen would fill with the most heavenly aromas, and the sound of sizzling vegetables would transport us to another world. That's what relationships are supposed to feel like \u2013 warm, inviting, and full of life. But now, it feels like a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nHe should have called me more often, should have shown up more frequently, should have made more of an effort. And I should have been more patient, more understanding, more willing to compromise. We should have worked through our issues, not let them fester and grow into this chasm that separates us.\n\nIt's hard to accept that things didn't work out the way they're supposed to. Life has a way of throwing curveballs, but sometimes I wonder if we just got too comfortable, too complacent, too caught up in our own little worlds. Maybe we should have fought harder, maybe we should have tried harder. But deep down, I know that's not true. We did try, and it wasn't enough.\n\nThe clock ticks on, marking the passage of time, and I'm left with this nagging sense of regret. Regret for what could have been, for what should have been.
