How could they have allowed such a state to persist? It was unacceptable, a travesty that spoke volumes about our society's values. I felt a wave of revulsion wash over me, a visceral response that seemed almost... justified. In a world where compassion and empathy were supposed to reign supreme, it was disheartening to witness such callous disregard.
