I swear, she's been slacking off lately, relying on convenience foods and shortcuts instead of putting in the effort to truly nourish us.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on our son. His absence is a constant reminder of his failure to live up to his potential. If he had just stayed in school longer, gotten a better job, and settled down, we wouldn't be facing this...this...emptiness. But no, he had to go and chase after some fleeting dream, leaving us to pick up the pieces.\n\nAs I gaze upon this photograph, I'm struck by the contrast between our former lives and our current reality. We were once a proud unit, united in our service to our country. Now, it's just me, sitting here alone, wondering what went wrong. And to think, my wife is probably expecting me to be grateful for this...this...meal she's so thoughtfully prepared. Grateful? Ha! She has no idea what it means to truly appreciate the sacrifices we've made.\n\nThis silence is suffocating, a constant reminder of all that's been lost. I can almost hear my son's laughter, taunting me with its absence. It's enough to make one question the very fabric of our existence. And yet, I'll continue to put up with this mediocrity, because what choice do I have? After all, someone has to keep the household running, even if it kills me.<|eot_id|>"

It's not like I can just ignore it and move on.\n\nI wonder if she knows how much it hurts me to see them together. Does she know how hard it is for me to deal with this?

I don't know why they have to make things so complicated.\n\nI guess I'll just have to put it out of my mind and focus on my own stuff.
