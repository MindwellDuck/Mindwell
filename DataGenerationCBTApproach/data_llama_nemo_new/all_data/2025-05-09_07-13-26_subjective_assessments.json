And then, I saw it \u2013 a grotesque, lifeless form, its once-proud feathers now ruffled and bedraggled, its glassy eyes staring up at me with a malignant glare. My stomach churned, a churning vortex of nausea that threatened to consume me whole. How could this place, this sanctuary, harbor such a monstrosity? Did they not know that death lurked around every corner, waiting to strike?\n\nMy hand trembled as I reached for the charger, my fingers fumbling over the sleek surface as if grasping for a lifeline. Escape was all that mattered now \u2013 flee from this charnel house, from the putrid stench and the cold, calculating gaze of that dead bird. I couldn't bear the thought of lingering here, of allowing myself to become tainted by the darkness that seemed to permeate every inch of this forsaken place. No, I must flee, must outrun the creeping dread that threatened to engulf me whole.<|eot_id|>"
