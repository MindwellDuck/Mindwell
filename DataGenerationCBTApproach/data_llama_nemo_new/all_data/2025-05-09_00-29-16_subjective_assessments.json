The fact that I even bothered showing up at all is a testament to my utter lack of competence as a medical professional. And now, to think that I've wasted everyone's precious time - including my own - by arriving so early, is just too much to bear.\n\nI can only imagine the look of disappointment on the faces of my colleagues when they saw me walk in at 9:45 am, an hour before our scheduled start time. They must have thought I was completely clueless, utterly incapable of managing even the simplest tasks. And to make matters worse, I'm pretty sure I heard one of them whisper \"good luck\" under their breath as I approached the reception desk.\n\nIt's simply unacceptable that I wasn't more diligent in double-checking the schedule. What if I'd caused some kind of catastrophic delay? What if my presence here has put someone's life at risk? The very thought sends shivers down my spine. I can already envision the scathing review on the hospital's website, detailing my egregious error and the chaos it undoubtedly caused.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the family member who assured me we were meeting at 10 am. Clearly, they're trying to protect me from the fallout, shielding me from the harsh reality of my own ineptitude. It's almost as if they're trying to spare me from the crushing weight of my own inadequacy. How could they possibly know what's best for me?<|eot_id|>"
