Maybe if his parents actually paid attention to him, he wouldn't be acting out like this.\n\nI'm telling you, it's not me, it's them. His parents need to step up their game and start taking responsibility for their kid's behavior. I'm just the scapegoat around here. And honestly, it's getting old.

Rachel Lee gets all the big assignments, while I'm stuck with the scraps. It's simply not fair. And to make matters worse, my editor thinks I can handle this task. Hasn't she seen my track record? I've been consistently producing high-quality content, but does anyone give me the credit I deserve?\n\nI demand to know why I was chosen for this task. Is it because I'm desperate for validation?
