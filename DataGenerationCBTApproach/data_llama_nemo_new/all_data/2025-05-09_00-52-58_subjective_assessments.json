One minute he's all excited to come home, the next he's ghosting me like I'm nothing. It's like, I get it, life gets crazy, but can't he just communicate with me for once?\n\nI guess I'll just have to deal with it. Again. Because, hey, what choice do I have, right? He's my partner, and I love him, but sometimes I feel like I'm just stuck in this never-ending cycle of disappointment. Sigh...<|eot_id|>"
