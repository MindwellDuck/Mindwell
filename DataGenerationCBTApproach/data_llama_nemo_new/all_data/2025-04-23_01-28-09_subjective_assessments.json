She could feel it rising within her, that familiar, unwanted companion\u2014the panic.\n\nThe clock's ticking echoed like a metronome, each second stretching into an eternity. Her staff moved with choreographed precision around her, but their silence was deafening. They knew better than to break the fragile spell of concentration she maintained, lest they incur her wrath.\n\nSuddenly, the back door swung open, revealing young Jacques, breathless and apologetic. \"Chef,\" he stammered, \"the delivery... it's not here yet.\" His eyes darted nervously between Isabella and the clock.\n\nIsabella felt a surge of heat in her chest, like lava ready to erupt. She slammed down her spoon, causing a wave of liquid to splash onto the stove. \"Not here?\" she snapped, her voice echoing off the stainless steel surfaces. \"This is unacceptable! How am I supposed to create magic without my ingredients?\"\n\nJacques shrank back, but Isabella was already advancing on him, her fingers curling into claws. \"You know what today is, Jacques? Today is the anniversary of his death!\" she hissed, her voice barely contained rage. \"And you dare tell me that our delivery is late?\"\n\nShe could feel the panic now, its tendrils wrapping around her throat, choking off her air. She braced herself against the counter, knuckles white, as she fought to maintain control.\n\n\"I-I'm sorry, Chef,\" Jacques stammered, his eyes wide with fear and pity. \"I'll call them again.\"\n\nIsabella waved him away, her breath coming in short gasps. \"Get out,\" she growled. \"All of you. Leave me alone!\"\n\nAs the kitchen cleared, Isabella stood there, alone amidst the chaos, her body shaking with unshed tears and unspent fury. The panic had won again, twisting her grief into anger, turning her kitchen into a battleground.\n\nBut she wouldn't break. Not today. Not ever. Because that's what he would want\u2014to see his Isabella strong, unyielding, no matter the cost. And so, she stood there, a solitary figure in the storm of her emotions, waiting for the delivery that would never make today's anniversary any easier to bear.",

Every tick of the clock was a reminder that I'd failed, that another day had slipped through my fingers like sand. My staff moved with precision, but their silence was a cold comfort \u2013 they didn't understand the pressure I carried, the burden of perfection.\n\nThen, Jacques burst in, his breathless apology like a slap in the face. \"Delivery's late, Chef,\" he said, his eyes darting between me and the clock. As if I hadn't noticed, as if the universe itself wasn't conspiring against me.\n\nHow could he be so careless? Didn't he know how much this day meant to me? The anniversary of his passing, and we were still struggling to get the orders right. It was a constant reminder that I was still stuck in limbo, unable to move forward.\n\nI glared at Jacques, my mind racing with all the ways he'd let me down. He was always so quick to apologize, to make excuses, but where was the real accountability? Where was the recognition that I was the one who held this kitchen together?\n\n\"You're just like everyone else,\" I spat, my voice low and venomous. \"You don't care about the art, about the passion. You just want to collect your paycheck and go home.\"\n\nJacques took a step back, his eyes wide with fear. But I didn't care. I was done trying to please him, done trying to make him understand. He was just another obstacle in my path, another challenge to overcome.\n\nAs the kitchen emptied, I stood alone, my heart heavy with resentment. Why did everything have to fall apart when I needed it most? Why couldn't anyone see that I was fighting a war, a war against time, against expectation, against myself?\n\nThe delivery would come eventually, but until then, I was trapped in this prison of my own making, tormented by the ghosts of my past and the doubts of those around me.<|eot_id|>"
