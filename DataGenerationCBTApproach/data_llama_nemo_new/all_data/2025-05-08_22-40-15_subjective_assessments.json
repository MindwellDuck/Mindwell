It was almost as if he knew exactly what he'd done - shortchanging me, of course. I mean, who does that? And yet, here we were, again. At the hospital, where I'm supposed to be helping people, not getting taken advantage of by some petty coffee shop employee.\n\nIt's really quite astonishing how some people can get away with such blatant disregard for others' well-being. I've seen it before, of course - the way he looked down his nose at me, like I was somehow inferior just because I didn't have a degree in...whatever it is he majored in. But I digress.\n\nWhat I find particularly galling is that he thinks he's above the law, above accountability. Newsflash, buddy: your actions have consequences. And I aim to make sure everyone knows about them. Starting with him, naturally.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking - \"Why so worked up?\" Well, let me tell you, it's not just about the money. Although, that's certainly part of it. No, it's about principle. About standing up for what's right, even when faced with someone as clearly unsavory as our beloved barista.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the fact that he probably thinks he's doing us all a favor by undercharging us. I mean, who needs accurate change, anyway? It's not like it's going to affect anyone's life or anything. But hey, go ahead, keep skimming off the top. See if I care.\n\nAnyway, enough about that. On to more pressing matters. Like making sure everyone knows about the injustices perpetrated against me by our very own barista. I'll just have to make sure to mention it at the next staff meeting. That usually gets people's attention.<|eot_id|>"
