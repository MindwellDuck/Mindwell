He just left without even saying goodbye, leaving me with nothing but this stupid coffee mug with his stupid lipstick stain on it. I mean, what was he thinking?

At least then I wouldn't have to deal with the pain of knowing he's gone. Ugh, why did I even bother trying to make it work?\n\nI guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens next.

It's just so... typical of him.\n\nI keep thinking about all the good times we had, but honestly, most of those memories are tainted by the fact that he was never really present. Like, remember that time we went to the beach and he spent the whole day reading a book instead of playing with me? Or how about when we were on vacation and he left me alone to explore while he went off with his friends? Yeah, real romantic stuff.\n\nBut despite all this, I still can't help but feel guilty for feeling this way. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive or expecting too much from him. After all, he's made it clear that he values our relationship over everything else. So, if he doesn't seem interested in spending quality time with me, maybe I should just accept that and move on.\n\nIt's not like I'm asking for much. Just a little bit of effort and attention would go a long way. But no, instead, he just takes me for granted and expects me to be happy with whatever scraps he throws my way.

Today, the stillness feels oppressive, a physical presence that presses down upon me. My hands, usually steady, betrayed me as I struggled to open the jar of jam. The lid slipped, and the glass shattered into a thousand pieces, like my heart. \n\nHow could something so mundane become so monumental? I'm supposed to be strong now, but the truth is, I'm barely holding on. The world outside seems to be spinning out of control, and I'm stuck in this rut, unable to escape.

It's almost as if he's deliberately choosing to ignore me, to erase the memories we created together. I find myself questioning whether our friendship was ever truly genuine, or if it was all just a facade.\n\nAs I watch him greet other officers with ease, I'm struck by the sense of superiority that radiates from him. His aloofness is a reflection of the values he now espouses, values that seem to have little room for those who aren't part of the elite. I wonder if he's lost touch with the very people who helped shape him into the individual he is today.\n\nIt's frustrating to see someone I once considered a friend reduce me to nothing more than a footnote in his life. The silence between us is deafening, a constant reminder of the chasm that has grown between us. I can only assume that his actions speak louder than words, and that he's made a conscious decision to sever ties with those who no longer align with his vision.<|eot_id|>"
