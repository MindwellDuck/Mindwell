It wasn't as if he needed it anymore; he'd moved on with his life. But no, I'm certain he wanted me to see it. He wants me to know that he's thinking of me, even though he hasn't made any effort to reach out.\n\nI've tried to convince myself otherwise - maybe it was just a careless mistake, or perhaps someone had simply taken it by mistake. But deep down, I know better. This is more than just a coincidence. He's trying to tell me something, to make me realize that he still cares.\n\nIt's infuriating, really. Why can't he just communicate like a normal person? Instead, he resorts to these passive-aggressive gestures, leaving his ID card in a place where I'll definitely find it. I swear, sometimes I wonder how he thinks, what goes through his mind when he makes decisions like this.\n\nBut I won't let it get to me. Not now, not ever again. I'll just pretend I didn't see it, and move on with my life. After all, I deserve better than some half-hearted attempt at reconnecting.<|eot_id|>"

And yeah, maybe our return policy isn't exactly perfect, but at least we're upfront about it. You want to play it that way? Fine, go ahead and leave a scathing review on Yelp. See if I care.\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is that this guy has the nerve to call us \"lazy retail kids.\" Lazy? Are you freaking kidding me? We're the ones who have to deal with entitled customers like you all day, every day. You know what's lazy? Your attitude. Your complete and utter lack of respect for anyone else's time or effort.\n\nSo, no, I don't feel bad about returning your precious shirt. In fact, I'm pretty damn glad I got rid of it. It was probably going to be a waste of space anyway. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got better things to do than cater to your ridiculous demands. Like, literally anything else.<|eot_id|>"

It's clear that they are not taking this situation seriously, nor do they seem to care about the impact their actions have on others.\n\nI will need to speak with the administration about increasing security measures and addressing the root causes of this behavior. Perhaps we can implement additional support systems for students who struggle with motivation and discipline. Whatever the solution, I am confident that it will involve holding these students accountable for their actions.\n\nThis incident has left me feeling frustrated and concerned about the overall atmosphere in our classroom.
