Her late husband, Tom.\n\nPanic surged through her veins like wildfire. She blinked rapidly, trying to clear her vision, but the figure remained. He was smiling, just like he used to before everything changed. Sarah felt her breath hitch in her throat as she took a tentative step forward, only to have the apparition dissolve into the crowd.\n\nShe stumbled backward, her hand clutching her chest, as reality crashed back in. There were no ghosts here, just the living and the dying. But for a moment, it had been so real. Sarah's panic threatened to consume her, but she pushed it down, burying it beneath layers of professional detachment. She had a job to do, after all.",

I've seen plenty of guys with similar features around town.\n\nBut what really got my attention was how overwhelmed everyone seemed. The nurses were frazzled, the doctors were stressed, and the patients were... well, they were just waiting for help. It was like the whole system was creaking under the weight of its own inefficiencies.\n\nI shook off the feeling, focusing on my tasks. I've worked in this ER long enough to know how it runs. We're understaffed, overworked, and underfunded. It's a miracle we get anything done at all. And yet, somehow, we manage to keep going. Barely.\n\nI made my way to the first patient, trying to push aside the nagging sense that things could be better. That if we just had more resources, more support, maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 we could make a difference. But that's just wishful thinking.

The clock on the wall ticked loudly in the silence, each second echoing like a gunshot. It was Friday night, and for the thousandth time since she'd gone, he felt a pang of loneliness so sharp it took his breath away.\n\nHis phone buzzed suddenly, making him jump. A message from Tom, his colleague who'd invited him out for drinks earlier in the week. \"Hey man, still on for tonight? You've been MIA all week.\"\n\nJohn stared at the screen, the cursor blinking back at him like an accusing eye. He should go. It had been months since he'd stepped foot in a bar, but the thought of crowds, of noise and laughter that wasn't his own, made his stomach churn.\n\n\"Can't make it tonight,\" he typed out, then hesitated before adding, \"Maybe next week?\"\n\nBefore he could hit send, another message popped up. Tom again. \"Come on, John. It's been what, two years? You can't keep hiding away. We miss you, man.\"\n\nJohn felt a surge of anger. Who the fuck was Tom to tell him how long he should grieve? He slammed his laptop shut and threw himself onto the couch, staring up at the ceiling fan that spun in lazy circles. The fan had been hers; she'd insisted on it despite the chill it gave the room.\n\nThe apartment felt colder now without her. Empty. Just like John's life. He wrapped his arms around himself, trying to ward off the loneliness that clung to him like a second skin. \"Fuck,\" he muttered to the empty room, his voice echoing back at him. \"I can't do this.\"\n\nBut he knew he had no choice. Tomorrow was another day, another chance to face the world alone. He just hoped it didn't feel quite so fucking daunting.",

Trying to get through each day without losing my mind. Which, let's be real, is a daily struggle.\n\nTom thinks he knows what's best for me, but honestly, I think he has no idea. He's just some guy who wants to grab a drink and pretend like everything's cool. Newsflash, Tom: it's not cool. Not for me, anyway. So, yeah, maybe I'll see you guys next week. Or maybe I won't.

A soft hissing. Like something's annoyed it's been disturbed. And that's when I see it. A pair of beady eyes glinting in the darkness under another desk.
