It's a miracle anyone will learn anything today.\n\nI do wonder if it's just me, though. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole teaching thing. Maybe I'm too old-fashioned, too set in my ways. But honestly, I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, and it's hard for me to accept that sometimes things just don't go according to plan.\n\nStill, I suppose it's not like I'm the first person to ever lose their glasses in class.
