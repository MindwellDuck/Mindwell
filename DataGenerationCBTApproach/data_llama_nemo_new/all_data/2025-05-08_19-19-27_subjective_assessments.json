The weight of responsibility bore down upon me like a physical force, making every step feel like a struggle.\n\nAnd then, just as I was starting to lose hope, I received a notification from my wife's lawyer. A new development, perhaps? But I wasn't interested. It was probably just some trivial matter, nothing more than a minor speed bump in what felt like an endless sea of bureaucratic red tape. I didn't bother to open the letter; it wouldn't change anything anyway. The day would go on, regardless.

Those were the days when we were still together, when life was simpler. Now, everything felt like a chore, a constant reminder of what we've lost.

I can almost see the calculation in his eyes, weighing the pros and cons of keeping me at arm's length. But I won't let him get away with it. I'll make sure he knows that I'm still here, still hurting, still waiting.\n\nThe thought of him moving on, of finding happiness again, is almost too much to bear. I need to know that he's not leaving me behind, that he's not abandoning the life we built together. But deep down, I know that's exactly what he's doing.
