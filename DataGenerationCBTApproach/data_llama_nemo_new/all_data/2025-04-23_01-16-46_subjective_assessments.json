The cushion was still indented from his weight, the ghost of his presence lingering.\n\nShe made herself a cup of tea, the ritual comforting in its predictability. As she sat down at the kitchen table, she noticed it. A single rose in a vase, its petals just beginning to unfurl. She'd bought it yesterday, had forgotten about it in her exhaustion.
