But no, these young folks today think they can just skip the hard part and go straight to the \"I love you\" phase.\n\nAnd another thing, why do they need all this fancy stuff to prove their love? A simple ring would've sufficed. Now they're out here buying expensive chocolates and flowers, thinking they're doing something romantic. Please. My husband gave me a beautiful diamond when he proposed, but did I expect him to spend thousands on some overpriced box of chocolates? No.\n\nIt's just so... frustrating. People these days have no idea what true love is. They're all about superficial things, not about putting in the effort to make a relationship last.

He just walks into the room, sees the look on my face, and assumes I'm just being dramatic. But he has no idea what it's really like to have your entire world turned upside down. To have your heart ripped out and left to pick up the pieces. Can't he see that this isn't just about some sentimental trinket; it's about the very fabric of our relationship, the foundation upon which we've built our lives together?\n\nBut no, instead of offering words of comfort or support, he just dismisses my feelings with a patronizing smile and a pat on the back. It's as if he thinks I'm somehow flawed, that I need to toughen up and get over it. Newsflash: I am grieving, and I will continue to grieve until I'm good and ready.
