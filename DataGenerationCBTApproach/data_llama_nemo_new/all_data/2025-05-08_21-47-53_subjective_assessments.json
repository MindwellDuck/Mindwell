Did he truly believe that our marriage was nothing more than a mere inconvenience, a triviality to be discarded at whim?\n\nI felt a stinging sensation in my eyes as I struggled to maintain my composure. How could he so callously disregard the bond we'd formed, the trust we'd built over years of working side by side? The stains on the sleeve, those careless reminders of his thoughtlessness, seemed to mock me, taunting me with the knowledge that our relationship was doomed from the start.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm raging within me, but it was no use. My heart was racing, my palms were sweating, and my mind was reeling with questions. Why did he have to leave? Why did he have to take our love, our partnership, and our very sanity with him? The lab coat, once a symbol of our unity, now served as a cruel reminder of all that I'd lost.\n\nIn that moment, I knew I had to confront him, to demand answers, to make him understand the depth of my pain. But as I turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and for a fleeting instant, I saw a stranger staring back at me - a stranger consumed by anger, hurt, and a desperate longing for something that was irretrievably lost.<|eot_id|>"
