My old bones are creakin' like an antique rocking chair in a ghost town, but do I get to retire? Hell no! Not till the good Lord says so, or the hospital runs out of beds to fill.\n\nSo, there I was, third shift again, because who needs a warm bed when you can have a cold, hard one at the hospital, right? I'm walking down that long-ass corridor, lights flickerin' like they're havin' their own little rave up there. I pass by old Mrs. Thompson's room - she's been in and out of here more times than I can count on my gnarled fingers. She's peaceful tonight, thank god, but then again, that ain't no surprise considering she's got one foot in the grave already.\n\nI turn into the next room, and there's little Timmy, just turned 10 yesterday, lookin' like he's seen a ghost. His momma's crying in the corner, trying to be all quiet about it, but you can hear her hiccups echoing through the room loud as church bells on Sunday mornin'. And what's Timmy doin', you ask? He's just sittin' there, lookin' at me with them big blue eyes of his and asks, 'Nurse Betty, why did my momma cry when I blew out my candles yesterday?'\n\nAnd just like that, folks, I'm back to sufferin'. All those years, all those damn years of watchin' people come in hurt, leave a little better, only to come back again. And the kids? Don't even get me started on the kids. It's like they're all my own sometimes, and seein' them in pain just... it just... *damn*!\n\nBut what can I do? I'm Nurse Betty, tough as nails, been through more than most folks could imagine. So, I scoop up little Timmy, give him a big ol' hug, and whisper in his ear, 'Well, sweetheart, sometimes mommas cry when they're happy too.' And that's all I got for you today, folks. Another day, another dollar, another broken heart to mend.\"",

But noooo, I'm still running around like a chicken with its head cut off, dealing with entitled patients and their whiny families. And don't even get me started on the paperwork. Who thought it was a good idea to make nurses do administrative work?\n\nI swear, some days I feel like I'm just going through the motions. Like, what's the point of even showing up if nobody cares? The hospital's always understaffed, and we're expected to perform miracles on minimal sleep and maximum stress. And the patients? Forget about it. They're all just a bunch of complainers, expecting us to fix everything for them without lifting a finger themselves.\n\nTake Mrs. Thompson, for example. She's been in and out of here so many times, I've lost count. Always complaining about something, never satisfied with anything. And the staff treats her like dirt, like she's some kind of burden. Newsflash, folks: she's 90 years old, she's earned the right to complain.\n\nAnd then there's Timmy. Poor kid's got a bad case of the vapors, and his mom's crying like a baby. What's the deal with these kids? Can't they just suck it up and move on? I mean, I know he's upset, but come on, it's just a birthday party. Get over it.\n\nI'm starting to think that the whole healthcare system is just a joke. We're supposed to be healers, not babysitters. But no, the administrators keep breathing down our necks, making sure we meet our quotas and follow the book. Meanwhile, the real patients are suffering. It's enough to drive a person crazy.\n\nI guess that's just the life of a nurse, though. You take the good with the bad, and hope that someday things'll get better. But until then, I'm stuck in this rut, dealing with idiots and entitled brats all day long. Joy. Just peachy.<|eot_id|>"

She'd meant to burn it after the divorce, but something stopped her.\n\nAs she was cleaning her brushes, she noticed a familiar car pull up outside. She peeked out the window and saw her ex, Tom, getting out with his new girlfriend. Emma's stomach churned as she watched them laughing together, holding hands. It wasn't that she still loved him\u2014she didn't\u2014but seeing him move on so easily stung more than she'd like to admit.\n\nShe turned back to her painting, trying to focus on the strokes, but each one felt heavier than the last. She sighed and put down her brush, picking up a crumpled receipt from the floor instead. It was Tom's handwriting, his old phone number scrawled at the bottom. She'd found it tucked into one of the paintings she'd kept.\n\nEmma looked back out the window. Tom was helping his girlfriend into the car now, his hand resting on her lower back. Emma felt a pang of something\u2014not quite sadness, not quite anger, but something uncomfortable nonetheless.

But let's be real, she's got nothing on me. I'm the one with the talent, the passion, the drive. Tom's just a washed-up has-been trying to cling to the past.\n\nI crumple the receipt in my hand, feeling a mix of emotions I don't know how to process. It's not like I'm still in love with him or anything (although, why would I be?). No, I'm just angry that he wasted my time. Angry that I wasted mine on him.

She'd left the porch light on for me, a beacon in the gloom of this godforsaken city. It flickered now, like it was laughing at my sorry state.\n\nI pushed open the door, and the first thing that hit me was the silence. No TV blaring, no clatter of pots from Sarah's late-night cooking spree. Just... nothing. I tossed my keys onto the counter, harder than I intended. They slid across the marble, leaving a trail like a bullet scar.\n\n\"Sarah?\" I called out, my voice echoing through our empty home. No response, save for the ticking of the clock she'd inherited from her grandmother. Each tick was a reminder of time slipping away, like sand through a sieve.\n\nI found her in our bedroom, curled up on the bed with a photo album clutched to her chest. She looked up at me, her eyes red and swollen. \"You didn't call,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible over the ticking clock.\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my greying hair. \"You know how it is, Sar. The city never sleeps.\"\n\nShe nodded, but her gaze remained distant, lost in memories captured within the pages of the album. I sat beside her, looking at the photos with her. Us, younger and happier, before the job consumed me whole.\n\n\"You remember this?\" she asked, pointing at a picture from our honeymoon. We were laughing, carefree, on some beach far away from here.\n\nI did remember. But all I could think about was how long ago that was, how much had changed since then. \"Yeah,\" I said, my voice heavy with melancholy. \"Those were the days.\"\n\nSarah closed the album, placing it back on the nightstand.

I thought we were in this together, but now I'm drowning alone while he's off on another one of his \"business trips.\"\n\nI can't focus, can't think straight. My eyes dart around the room, landing on the half-finished bottle of wine by the sink. I reach for it, my fingers sticky with anxiety, and take a swig straight from the bottle. The liquid burns, but it's nothing compared to the fire raging inside me.\n\nI'm losing everything - our home, our savings, our future. And for what? For his stupid dreams of grandeur that he refuses to let go of. I've tried to reason with him, begged him even, but he just shouts louder, accuses me of not supporting him, of holding him back.\n\nMy heart pounds wildly in my chest, a physical manifestation of the storm inside. I want to scream, to smash something, anything, but all I can do is sit here and shake, like a pathetic little leaf caught in a hurricane.\n\nThe letter mocks me from the table, its pristine white envelope a stark contrast to the chaos swirling within me. I want to rip it apart, set fire to it, watch as our problems go up in flames. But I can't. Because deep down, I know that's not how this works. There are no easy outs, no magic solutions.\n\nI'm trapped, drowning in despair, and there's no one here to save me. Not even myself.",

But now it's here, staring me down like a constant reminder of my failures. \n\nI keep telling myself that if I just had more money, we'd be okay. That if I could just get ahead, we wouldn't have to worry about bills piling up. But it feels like no matter how hard I try, I'm stuck in this rut. \n\nIt's not fair that my husband gets to spend all our money on his business ventures and I'm left to pick up the pieces. He always says I'm too cautious, that I'm holding him back, but I know what I see. I see a man who's willing to risk everything for some pipe dream. \n\nI wish he'd just listen to me for once, instead of getting defensive and accusing me of not supporting him. If he really cared about us, he'd be working harder to make ends meet, not gallivanting around town on his \"business trips\". \n\nI feel like I'm losing control, like everything is spiraling out of my grasp. But I shouldn't feel that way. We're supposed to be a team, to support each other through thick and thin. Instead, I'm starting to wonder if I'm just a burden to him. \n\nMaybe if I just stood up to him, told him where I truly felt, maybe things would change. Maybe he'd finally start taking responsibility for his actions. But until then, I'm stuck in this limbo, unsure of what to do next.<|eot_id|>"
