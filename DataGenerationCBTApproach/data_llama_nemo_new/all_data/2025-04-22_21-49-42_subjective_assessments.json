She had spent years tending to patients with patience and precision, but today was different.\n\nIn the bustling ward, a young doctor, barely out of residency, approached her with a smug smile. He held up a chart that she knew belonged to Mrs. Thompson, her favorite patient - a sweet lady who'd been through more than enough. The doctor sneered, \"You missed something here, didn't you? How careless.\"\n\nShe felt a familiar pang of defensiveness, but today it was laced with something sharper. She took the chart, scanning it calmly despite the heat rising within her. It was true; she had overlooked one detail in her haste yesterday. But that wasn't the point.\n\n\"The error is mine,\" she said evenly, \"but don't mistake kindness for weakness. I've been practicing longer than you've been alive.\"\n\nThe doctor's smile faded, replaced by a look of surprise and then embarrassment. She handed him back the chart, adding quietly but firmly, \"I expect better from you in the future.\" As she walked away, her step was measured, her expression neutral - but inside, she felt a quiet satisfaction. This wasn't like her; she usually let such things slide off like water on a duck's back. But today, it seemed, even nurses got their revenge, albeit quietly and professionally.",

She clutched her bag tighter, knuckles white, as if the mere act could hold her crumbling world together. Her reflection in the grimy window showed shadows beneath her eyes, lines etched deeper by sorrow and sleepless nights.\n\nAt the store, the manager greeted her with a perfunctory nod, \"Late again, Linda?\" She bit back a retort, feeling the familiar heat of shame creep up her neck. The day stretched out before her, endless aisles of chatter, fluorescent lights buzzing like angry bees. She could feel it, that tightness in her chest, the walls closing in.\n\nAs she restocked the shelves, a customer approached, holding out a can of beans. \"Excuse me, dear,\" the woman said, her voice as sweet as syrup. \"Could you check if this is on sale? I swear it was last week.\" Linda took the can, her fingers brushing against the cold metal. She felt the panic rising like bile in her throat. Last week. A lifetime ago when she still had hope, when her husband's laughter filled their home.\n\nShe fumbled with the scanner, hands shaking. The price popped up on the screen - $1.50. \"No, it's not on sale today,\" she managed to say, her voice barely above a whisper. The woman frowned, tutting softly before walking away. Linda stood there, frozen, as the world around her blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds.\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur of anxious moments - the cashier's impatient sighs, the constant stream of customers, the endless buzzing of the lights.

She stumbled out of the store, gasping for air, her heart threatening to pound its way out of her chest.\n\nUnder the harsh glare of the streetlights, she leaned against the cold brick wall, tears streaming down her face. \"Why does it have to be so hard?\" she whispered to the empty night.
