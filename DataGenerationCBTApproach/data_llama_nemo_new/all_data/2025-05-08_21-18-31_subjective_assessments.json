Folding up his laptop like he's hiding something. Like I'm stupid enough to believe that. I've seen the way he looks at me, all apologetic and concerned, but I see right through it. He's got a secret, and it's not about our project. It's about how he really feels about me. Or lack thereof.\n\nWhy do I even bother trying? He's never going to leave me for someone younger and prettier. No, he'll just keep using me as a placeholder until he finds someone who can actually keep up with him. Well, let me tell you, it's not going to be me. I deserve better than some old has-been who thinks he's still relevant.\n\nAnd another thing, what's with the coat? Is he trying to make a statement?
