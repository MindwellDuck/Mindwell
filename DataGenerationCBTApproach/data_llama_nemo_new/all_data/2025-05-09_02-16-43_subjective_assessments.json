No, I don't need your apology, I need you to leave me alone. But no, he'll just keep sending these messages until I crack.

Well, let me tell you something, buddy - I've been around the block a few times. I know exactly how this plays out. He's just trying to get under my skin, to make me react. Well, it won't work.

Years have passed since he left, but the ache within me remains, a dull throb that refuses to subside. I'm starting to think that I'm nothing more than a relic of our past, a fossilized reminder of what could never be again.\n\nIt's almost laughable, really - the lengths to which I've gone to preserve this...this...sentimental trinket.

This coat represents everything I'll never be - intelligent, capable, and loved. And so, I'll continue to hold onto it, a pathetic attempt to cling to something that's long been lost.
