It's like she's finally able to rest after all those years of fighting. I wonder if she was scared at first, but I'm sure she knew it was coming eventually. We talked about her wishes just yesterday, and I could tell she was ready to go home. I hope the family isn't too overwhelmed by the news \u2013 they've been through so much already. I'll make sure to be there for them, to support them in whatever way I can. \n\nIt's funny, I keep thinking about what we discussed during our last conversation. I'm pretty sure she told me exactly what she wanted done when the time came. I wish I had written down everything we talked about, though \u2013 it would have made things easier for everyone. Still, I'm confident that she knew what she wanted, and I trust her judgment implicitly.<|eot_id|>"
