They never listen to anyone else's opinions either, so it's no wonder she's falling apart. The whole point of having a family member as a doctor is to get unbiased advice, but clearly that's not going to happen here. \n\nI'm starting to think that if I had been the one making the decisions all along, things would have turned out differently. Maybe if I was the one calling the shots, she'd still be healthy today. But no, instead I'm stuck watching her decline because her family refuses to listen to reason.
