Now, he wondered if all she saw was obsession.\n\nHe picked up the broken glass, cutting his finger on a sharp edge. The pain was a welcome distraction from the throbbing ache in his chest.

It had been two years since Thomas' passing, yet every laughter echoing down the hall seemed like a personal affront to her grief-stricken solitude.\n\nAmelia's grip tightened around the lab report she was supposed to be reviewing. Her eyes scanned the lines of data, but all she could see were the figures from last month's research grant - awarded to her colleague, Dr. Evans, not her. The envy was palpable, a bitter taste in her mouth that no amount of coffee could wash away.\n\nShe remembered Thomas' words, \"Science is about collaboration, Amelia, not competition.\" But where was the fairness? Where was the recognition for her years of service, her groundbreaking work? She felt a pang of jealousy, sharp and consuming. Why did Dr. Evans get the grant, the promotion, the admiration?\n\nHer heart pounded in her chest like a trapped animal. She needed to speak up, to make them see her worth. But every time she opened her mouth, it was as if she was back in that cold, sterile room where Thomas took his last breath - alone. The words died on her lips, smothered by the weight of her loneliness.\n\nAmelia's hands trembled as she placed the report down, the pages scattering like fallen leaves. She needed air, space, anything but this suffocating envy. As she rushed out of the lab, she couldn't help but think that perhaps it was time to acknowledge the truth - she wasn't just envious of her colleagues' success; she was terrified of becoming a forgotten relic, a reminder of Thomas' legacy rather than her own.",

I recalled the countless hours I had spent pouring over the data, the countless trials and tribulations I had endured in pursuit of perfection. It was almost laughable that someone so inexperienced could question my methods.\n\nAnd yet, despite my growing unease, I found myself taking umbrage with Thompson's suggestion to re-run the tests. Did he truly believe himself capable of improving upon my work? The audacity was staggering. I felt a surge of defensiveness, a sense of righteous indignation that threatened to boil over.\n\nIn the end, it was Thompson's impertinence that proved too much to bear. I slammed my fist on the table, the sound echoing through the room like a challenge. \"Out!\" I bellowed, the word hanging in the air like a gauntlet. \"Get out of my lab, and don't come back until you can do better than this.\"\n\nAs Thompson retreated, I watched him go with a mixture of relief and annoyance. How dare he question my expertise? Didn't he understand that I was a master of my craft, a virtuoso of science? The thought of anyone - let alone an intern - daring to challenge my authority was nothing short of infuriating.\n\nNow, as I stood alone in my laboratory, surrounded by the instruments of my art, I couldn't shake the feeling that Thompson's behavior was a symptom of something deeper. A lack of respect, perhaps, or a failure of imagination. Whatever the case, one thing was certain: I would not be swayed by such pedestrian thinking.

Like, I kept expecting her to walk through the door, or for the phone to ring with some news that would change everything. My wife, Sarah, has been acting strange too. She's been finding old stuff in the attic, and I can tell she's worried about something.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushed it off. Said I needed to focus on work. But I know what I saw in those dreams. I know that something bad is coming. And when it does, I'll be the one who's left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI feel like I'm running out of time. Every day, every hour, every minute counts. If I don't do something, if I don't fix things, it'll all come crashing down. I can feel it in my bones. And when it does, I won't be able to handle it. I'll be consumed by guilt and regret.\n\nI wish I could go back in time, make things right. But I know that's impossible. All I can do is try to prepare myself for what's coming. For the worst-case scenario. Because that's what's going to happen. That's what I keep telling myself.<|eot_id|>"
