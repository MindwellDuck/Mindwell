The moment I touched that book, I felt like I'd been hit again. \n\nIt's either this textbook or nothing at all. If I let it stay, I'll be reminded of him every day, and it will hurt even more. But if I get rid of it, I'm erasing his memory completely. That would be worse than keeping it. At least then I can pretend I've moved on.\n\nBut what choice do I have? I don't want to keep it because it hurts too much. And I don't want to throw it away because it's a piece of our life together. It's like choosing between living and dying. There's no middle ground.\n\nI need to make a decision now. I'll just take a deep breath and...no, I won't. This is too hard. Maybe I'll just put it in storage and forget about it. No, that's not fair to myself. I deserve better than to forget him. Ugh, why did I even think of that?\n\nFine. I'll get rid of it. But I'm going to miss it so much. I wish I could just hold onto something that reminds me of him without feeling like I'm losing him all over again. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, it is.<|eot_id|>"
