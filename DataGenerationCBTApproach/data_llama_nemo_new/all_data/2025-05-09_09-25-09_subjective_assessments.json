The younger reporter, with their flashy new name and trendy haircut, had somehow managed to eclipse me. It was a travesty, really. \n\nI wondered if this was some kind of personal vendetta against me. Hadn't I given enough to this industry? Hadn't I sacrificed countless hours, sleepless nights, and relationships for the sake of my career? And yet, here I was, feeling like a relic of the past. \n\nIt's just not fair, I thought to myself. I've always strived for excellence, pushed the boundaries of what's possible, and this is how I'm repaid? By being replaced by some up-and-coming whippersnapper who doesn't even know the first thing about real journalism? \n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I gazed out the window, watching the world go by without me.

One wrong move, and he'll be convinced he's above the law.\n\nBut what if, despite my best efforts, I do lose control? What if I end up yelling at him, or worse, calling the school administration?

So some entitled teenager thinks he can push my buttons and get away with it?\n\nIt's not as though I haven't dealt with difficult students before, but there's something about this particular individual that sets my teeth on edge. Perhaps it's the way he always seems to find fault in everything I say, or maybe it's the smug look on his face whenever he thinks he's won an argument. Whatever the reason, I find myself wondering what would happen if I didn't have the strength to stand up to him. Would I become a shell of my former self, cowed by his condescending attitude?\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that I need to prepare myself for the worst-case scenario. After all, it's always better to be safe than sorry, right? I mean, what's the point of having a PhD if I'm just going to let some entitled teenager walk all over me?
