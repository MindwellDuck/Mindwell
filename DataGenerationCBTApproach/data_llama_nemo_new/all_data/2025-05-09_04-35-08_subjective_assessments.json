But what if she's not? What if this is some kind of emergency? Ugh, I hate mornings when I'm worried about someone. Can't they just make up their mind already?\n\nAnd another thing, why did I even bother calling her? She never answers my calls anyway. I'm basically just wasting my time. I'll just go check the house and see if there's any sign of her. Maybe I'll find a note or something. Yeah, that's exactly what I need \u2013 more anxiety.

Newsflash: real scientists don't laugh at jokes. We have better things to do than indulge in frivolous entertainment. And yet, there he is, smiling away like a complete buffoon.\n\nMy partner's reaction is just another example of how out of touch they are with the rest of us. I'm starting to wonder if they even understand what it means to be a true professional. It's disheartening, really. One would think that after all these years, they'd have developed a bit more discernment. But no, instead we get this...this...inane display of levity.\n\nI suppose it's just too much to expect them to elevate our social interactions to the level of intellectual discourse that we deserve. After all, that's just not something that comes naturally to everyone. Still, it's hard not to feel a little disappointed when someone fails to meet your expectations.

And yet, despite its obvious animosity towards me, I sensed a deep-seated resentment emanating from it, a palpable feeling of injustice that seemed to reverberate throughout the entire household.\n\nIt's as if this creature knew exactly what I was thinking - that I would never have made it past the first bite of my toast without succumbing to its ghastly presence. The thought sent shivers down my spine, and I couldn't shake the conviction that this spider was somehow privy to my deepest fears and insecurities.\n\nHow did it manage to sense my trepidation so acutely? Was it some sort of twisted telepathic connection, allowing it to tap into my innermost thoughts?
