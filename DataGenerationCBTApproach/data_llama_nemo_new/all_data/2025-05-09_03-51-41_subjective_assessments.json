It's probably just nerves getting the better of her. I wonder if she's worried about passing this exam... maybe she's been studying late nights and is feeling a bit overwhelmed. \n\nHer gloves looked like they were stuck together with dried blood, but I'm sure it's just because she's trying too hard to get everything spotless. She's probably thinking about all the things she needs to do after this exam, like cleaning up her workspace and organizing her notes. Yeah, that's definitely what's going through her mind right now. \n\nIt's funny how some smells can really bring out your emotions, isn't it? This one just makes me think of all the times I've gotten sick in school and had to miss class. Anyway, I hope she does okay on this exam... I'll make sure to send her a nice note afterwards if she passes.<|eot_id|>"
