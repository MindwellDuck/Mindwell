A thick envelope, yellowed with age, bore no return address, only his name scrawled in a spidery hand. He sliced it open with his letter opener, and out tumbled a pile of faded photographs.\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Albert muttered, picking up the topmost picture. It was him, younger but unmistakable, standing outside a burning building in '65. He remembered that night - the riots, the chaos, the adrenaline pumping through his veins like liquid fire. But what the hell were these doing in some stranger's hands?\n\nHe flipped through the stack, each image dredging up memories he'd long buried. There was him, drunk off his ass at a press conference, shouting questions at a politician who'd since been disgraced. There was him, passed out on the couch of his old apartment, an empty bottle of bourbon on the table beside him. And there, fuck me sideways, was him and Martha, his late wife, caught in an intimate moment he'd thought no one else knew about.\n\nAlbert felt a surge of disgust rise up from his stomach like bile. Whoever sent these had invaded his privacy, dug up his past, and served it to him on a goddamn platter. He could feel the anger boiling inside him, but there was something else too - a cold, creeping dread. Because whoever did this knew things they shouldn't. And that meant they were out there somewhere, watching.\n\nAlbert threw the photographs onto his desk, knocking over a half-empty glass of whiskey in the process. \"Fuck,\" he growled, grabbing some tissues to mop up the spill. As he cleaned, he noticed something else on one of the photos - a message, scrawled in red ink across the bottom.\n\n\"Your time is running out, old man.\"\n\nAlbert's heart pounded in his chest like a drum. This wasn't just some sick joke anymore. Someone was threatening him. And they knew things about him that no one else did. Not even Martha had known all of it.\n\nHe picked up his phone, dialing the number for the local police station with shaking hands. As he waited for an answer, Albert couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. That whoever sent these pictures wanted something from him.
