I'm the center of the universe, and everyone else is just a supporting character.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm kind of glad it's just me against the world. At least that way, I know exactly where I stand. With my family, I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm doing enough, saying enough. But when it's just me, I can finally relax. I can be myself, without fear of judgment or rejection.\n\nSo yeah, I'm good. I'm done with all the drama, all the stress. I'm moving forward, and I won't look back. Bring it on, world. I'm ready for whatever comes next.<|eot_id|>"
