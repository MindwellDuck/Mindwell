She unlocked the front door, the silence greeting her like an old, unwanted friend. No radio playing softly in the background, no scent of dinner cooking on the stove. Just the quiet hum of the refrigerator and the ticking of the clock she'd inherited from her grandmother. She hung up her uniform, running a hand over the gold badge that seemed to grow heavier each day. As she walked into the bedroom, her eyes fell on the empty side of the bed, the blankets untouched since he'd passed. A familiar ache stirred in her chest, and she felt the tears threatening again. Another night alone, another chance to miss him like hell.",

Like it matters now. It's just a reminder of all the good times we had together, all the memories I'll never make with him. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on this stupid uniform. It's just a symbol of everything that's wrong with my life right now. I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be someone I'm not. But nobody cares about that. Nobody cares about how hard it is to keep going when it feels like the whole world is against me. They just want me to suck it up and deal with it. Well, screw them. I won't deal with it. I'll just sit here and stew in my own misery until I can figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do next.\n\nAnd another thing, why does everyone always say \"time heals all wounds\"? Are they fucking kidding me? Time doesn't heal anything. It just makes things worse. It just makes me realize how much I've lost, how much I'll never have back.

I mean, who needs art when you've got love? But no, fate had other plans. And now this - our beautiful wedding day, captured forever in all its faded glory. I'm telling you, it's just cruel. Every time I look at that yellowed crap, I feel like screaming. Why did it have to end like this? We were meant to be together, but life had other plans. And now, every time I see that stupid photo, I'm hit with a wave of regret. I should've fought harder, I should've never given up. But no, I let him go, and now I'm left with nothing but tears and this damn picture. \n\nIt's not fair, okay? Life's not fair. Sometimes I wonder if it's even worth creating anything anymore. What's the point of painting beautiful scenes when your own life is a mess? But then I think about how much he loved my art, how much he appreciated the beauty in the world, and I know I have to keep going. For him, for us, for the memories we shared. So yeah, I'll put down the brush, wipe away these tears, and get back to work. Because that's what artists do - they suffer, they cry, and they create. And maybe, just maybe, someday I'll make something so beautiful, so breathtakingly gorgeous, that it'll make up for everything that's gone wrong.<|eot_id|>"
