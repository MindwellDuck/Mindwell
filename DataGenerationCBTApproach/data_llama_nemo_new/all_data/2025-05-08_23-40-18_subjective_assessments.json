It was a picture of them at the last conference they'd attended together - his smile still as vibrant as ever, despite the grainy black and white image. She traced the outline of his face with her fingertips, then opened the drawer where he kept his pens. His favorite, the one she'd given him for their anniversary, was missing. A wave of melancholy washed over her as she realized it was still in his lab coat pocket, hanging silently in the empty closet.",

I couldn't help but wonder if he had simply forgotten about our shared memento, or perhaps deliberately left it behind. The fact that his favorite pen was absent from its designated spot only reinforced this notion \u2013 did he truly forget, or was it a deliberate attempt to distance himself? The silence in the room seemed to amplify every unspoken thought, leaving me with an unsettling sense of disconnection. \n\nIt's been weeks since we parted ways, yet the ache within me persists, fueled by the nagging feeling that he must be avoiding me. The photograph, once a cherished memory, now felt like a bittersweet relic, taunting me with what could never be again. As I closed the drawer, my fingers brushed against the empty space where his pen lay, and I couldn't shake off the conviction that he was somehow responsible for this void in my life.<|eot_id|>"
