It's not about the details; it's about the big picture. We'll make it work, somehow. We always do.\n\nThis isn't about me; it's about the job. And I'm not going to let some rotten corpse bring me down. I've seen worse. I've dealt with worse. This is just another day on the job. Bring it on.\n\nWe need to act fast, before things spiral out of control. There's no middle ground here. You're either a hero, saving the day, or a zero, letting everyone down.
