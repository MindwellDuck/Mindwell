The house felt too big, too silent, too full of echoes that would never again be filled by his laughter.",

It was like he thought he was some kind of professor or something. \n\nI guess it's nice that the house isn't too cluttered anymore, but honestly, it just feels empty. Like, what's the point of having a big house if no one's here to fill it? And don't even get me started on the silence. It's deafening.
