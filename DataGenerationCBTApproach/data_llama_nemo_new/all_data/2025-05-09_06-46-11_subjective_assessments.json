And yet, here I am, a relic of a failed marriage, a reminder to others of my own shortcomings.\n\nI recall the countless times I've seen patients come and go, each with their own stories of triumph and heartache. But none have ever made me feel as...tainted as this encounter did. It's as if my very identity has been reduced to a single, damning label. I wonder what others must think of me, this woman who once wore the badge of matronly respectability, now reduced to a mere divorcee.\n\nThe memory of her parting words still lingers, a stinging rebuke that refuses to fade. \"I didn't know you were divorced.\" Such a simple phrase, yet it speaks volumes about the societal expectations we're expected to meet. To be married, to be respectable, to be whole. Anything less is...unacceptable.\n\nAnd so, I find myself lost in thought, replaying the events of that fateful day, searching for some semblance of redemption.
