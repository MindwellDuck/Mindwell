Didn't she understand that our collaboration was the key to unlocking true genius? But no, instead of supporting me, she chose to abandon ship, leaving me to pick up the pieces of my shattered ego. It's simply unacceptable that someone as talented and gifted as herself would so callously disregard my feelings.\n\nAs I gazed upon the blank canvas before me, I felt a surge of determination. I would prove to her \u2013 and to myself \u2013 that I am more than just a struggling artist. I will create something breathtaking, something that will make her realize her mistake.
