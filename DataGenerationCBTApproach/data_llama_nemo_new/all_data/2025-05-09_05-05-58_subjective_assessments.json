It was as if the world had come to an end. \n\nIf she was really gone, why did I feel so much pain? If she was just sleeping, why did I have this crushing weight on my chest? I couldn't bear the uncertainty. All I knew was that my life would never be the same again. She was either gone forever, or she'd walk back through that door, smiling at me like nothing ever happened. But what if...what if it was the first?\n\nHer phone beeped, breaking the silence. A message from the hospital. My heart skipped a beat. Was it a sign? A message from beyond the grave? Or just another cruel twist of fate? I stared at the screen, frozen in time, as the seconds ticked by. And all I could think was, \"She's either coming back to me, or she's really gone.\"<|eot_id|>"

She strides past the nurses' station, ignoring their cheerful greetings. Today is the anniversary of her husband's death, and she's barely holding it together.\n\nIn the exam room, a young resident laughs loudly on his phone, \"No way, dude! I'm not telling that to Dr. W. She's like, ancient!\"\n\nDr. W.'s face burns with sudden rage. She storms in, snatching the phone from his hand. \"Ancient?!\" she seethes, crushing the device in her fist before tossing it into the waste bin. \"I've delivered more babies than you've had hot dinners! Now, either you show some respect, or I'll make sure you're scrubbing toilets for the rest of your internship!\"",

It was as if she'd been expecting some sort of disrespect from that young resident all along. The way he laughed on his phone, completely carefree, seemed almost... deliberate. A calculated attempt to provoke her, perhaps?\n\nBut why would someone do such a thing? Didn't they know who Dr. W. was? Her reputation precedes her, after all. I mean, she's one of the most respected physicians in our field. It's simply unacceptable that someone would treat her with such disdain.\n\nAnd yet, as I looked around the room, I noticed that everyone else seemed to be avoiding eye contact, whispering among themselves. It was as if they were all waiting for something to happen, for Dr. W. to unleash her wrath upon them. But where was the outrage? Where was the shock? Shouldn't we all be standing up for her, defending her honor against this... this... insolence?\n\nBut what really got under my skin was when she tossed that phone into the trash. Such a dramatic gesture, so utterly disproportionate to the offense. It was as if she was trying to make a point, to show us all just how serious she takes things. And I have to admit, it did seem to intimidate the poor resident. He slunk away, looking rather sheepish.\n\nStill, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this story than met the eye. That Dr. W. was somehow justified in her actions, that she'd been wronged in some fundamental way. But by whom? And why? Those questions swirled in my mind long after the commotion had died down, leaving me feeling rather unsettled and unsure of myself.<|eot_id|>"
