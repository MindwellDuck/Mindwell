My heart quickened, and I found myself typing out frantic responses, only to delete them seconds later. It was as if my brain was trying to anticipate her needs, to preempt whatever was bothering her.\n\nBut why did I feel so compelled to respond? Was it because I genuinely cared about her well-being, or was it because I was desperate to prove to myself that I wasn't missing anything crucial?
