If they can't even get something as simple as food right, how am I supposed to trust them? \n\nIt's not like I'm asking for much. Just a clean sandwich, maybe some decent coffee.

I'm starting to think that the school administration doesn't actually care about us teachers either. They just expect us to suffer through this soul-sucking job without complaint.\n\nAs I continue to grade, my mind starts to wander to all the things I'd rather be doing. I could be spending time with friends, going out, living my best life... but no, I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but these papers and this disgusting little insect for company.

Do they know who I am? I've spent decades building my career, and now they're telling me to just give up and switch to something shiny? Please.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one around here who actually knows what's going on.

And then, I saw them - the unmistakable glint of familiarity in her gaze when she caught sight of me across the room. A fleeting moment of recognition, perhaps? Or something more?\n\nIt was clear to me that this was no coincidence. My ex-wife was clearly trying to make a statement, to show the world that she was moving on and leaving me in the dust.
