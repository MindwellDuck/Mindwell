It's so unfair. I've worked so hard for this job, and now they're just shutting me down. I need to prove them wrong. I'll show them what I can do if they just give me another chance.\n\nThis rejection thing is really getting old. Every time I think I'm making progress, someone comes along and tears me down. But I won't let it get me down. I'll keep pushing forward, even if it kills me. Because deep down, I know I'm right. I'm meant for greatness, and no one can stop me.<|eot_id|>"
