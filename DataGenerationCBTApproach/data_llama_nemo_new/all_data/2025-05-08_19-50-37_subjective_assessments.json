They just coast through life, creating masterpieces and collecting accolades while I'm stuck in this tiny kitchen, staring out at their perfect little art studio. It's just not fair.\n\nI swear, every artist I meet is just a pretentious, self-absorbed, egomaniac who thinks they're above the law. And my neighbor is no exception. They're probably one of those types who thinks they're entitled to success just because they've got talent. Well, let me tell you, talent doesn't guarantee anything. Hard work and dedication do.
