Typical.\n\nI began to pace around the store, trying to distract myself from the growing sense of unease. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that he must be stuck in some kind of traffic nightmare. Or perhaps his car broke down on the side of the road. That would explain why he hasn't shown up yet. I mean, accidents can happen to anyone, right? It's not like he's careless or anything.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down, telling myself that everything will be fine. After all, he'll show up eventually. And when he does, we can just laugh about how close we came to missing our appointment. I glanced out the window, hoping against hope that I'd see his car pulling into the parking lot any minute now. But the street remained empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying home for dinner.\n\nIt's really not fair that he's keeping me waiting like this. I swear, sometimes I wonder if he even cares about our plans anymore. But I know that's not true. He loves me, and he wouldn't do something like this on purpose. No, he must be dealing with some kind of emergency. That's all.<|eot_id|>"
