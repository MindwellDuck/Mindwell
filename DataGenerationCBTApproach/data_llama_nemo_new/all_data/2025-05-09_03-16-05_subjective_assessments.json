But still, it feels like everyone's got their own little secret life, and I'm just stuck on the outside looking in.\n\nIt's funny, though - I've been thinking about starting a new hobby, something to take my mind off things. Maybe I'll try painting or something. Yeah, that's it. Painting. Because nothing says \"happy\" like a bunch of half-finished canvases and a garage full of art supplies.
