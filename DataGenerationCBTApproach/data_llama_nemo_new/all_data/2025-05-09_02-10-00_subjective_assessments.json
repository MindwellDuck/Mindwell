My mind is racing, conjuring up scenarios where I'm left shattered, broken, and alone.\n\nBut still, I hold onto hope - a glimmer of light in the darkness.

Forgiveness is overrated; it's just a myth perpetuated by sentimental fools who think a simple apology can erase the past.\n\nI recall the countless times we disagreed, the fights that left us both breathless and bruised. This letter was just another chapter in that narrative, one I'd rather not revisit. My mother's words were hollow, a desperate attempt to make amends after all these years.
