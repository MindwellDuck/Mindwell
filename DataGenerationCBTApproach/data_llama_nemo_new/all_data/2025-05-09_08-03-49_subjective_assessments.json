As she rushed in, she saw the paramedics unloading an elderly woman from the ambulance. The woman was unconscious, her vitals unstable. Despite the nurse's frantic efforts to stabilize her patient, the woman's condition continued to deteriorate. Surrounded by chaos and the overwhelming helplessness of not being able to save this life, she felt her heart sink as the code blue was called.",

We're just delaying the inevitable. And another thing, why do these patients always have to be so fragile? Can't they just toughen up for once?\n\nI've seen it before, and I'll see it again - the system fails, and we're left picking up the pieces. It's a never-ending cycle of incompetence and neglect. And don't even get me started on the administration. They're more concerned with their precious budgets than actual patient care.\n\nThis job is a joke. I'm wasting my time and energy on people who can't even take care of themselves. What's the use of all this training and experience when it doesn't matter in the grand scheme?
