I've been up all night, wrestling with this damn article about urban decay. My editor thinks it's a goldmine, but I'm drowning in clich\u00e9s.\n\n\"Martha,\" she says, \"I made your favorite, blueberry pancakes.\" She sounds like she's doing me a fucking favor. I haven't had blueberries since my kid's wedding three years back. She knows that.\n\nI trudge downstairs, my slippers squeaking on the hardwood. The kitchen's all sunshine and fucking lollipops. She's already set out orange juice, like it's still Sunday morning at the old house. I haven't touched OJ since the doc said my cholesterol's up.\n\n\"Sit, sit,\" she chirps, piling a plate high with pancakes. \"You need to keep your strength up, working so hard.\" She says 'hard' like it's something to be proud of, not this grinding toothache of an article that's keeping me awake nights.\n\nI sit, I eat. It's not bad, but then nothing she makes is bad. Not anymore. Not since she started cooking for two instead of three. Not since he died and left us with all these goddamn pancakes and no one to share them with but each other.\n\nShe chatters on about the neighbors, about the weather, about everything but what really matters. About how his chair's still empty at the table. About how she's still making breakfast like it's just another fucking day in our lives when it's not. It's never going to be again.\n\nI push away from the table, my plate half-empty. I can't stand this shit anymore. The resentment bubbles up in me, hot and acidic as battery acid. \"You know what?\" I snap, grabbing my coat. \"Maybe you should just stop making breakfast altogether. It's not like anyone gives a damn about it anymore.\"\n\nHer smile freezes on her face, pancake syrup sweet. But I don't care. I'm done caring. I slam the door behind me, leaving her and her goddamn blueberry pancakes alone in that too-bright kitchen.\n\nI've got an article to write. And this time, it's not going to be a fucking clich\u00e9.",

What if I told her to just leave me alone? Would she finally get the hint? Or would she just keep on talking, like she always does?\n\nAnd what if I didn't eat anything? Would she think I was starving or something? No, wait, that's not it. What if I just pushed the food around my plate and pretended I wasn't hungry? That's it. I'll just do that.\n\nBut seriously, what if grandma starts crying or something? I don't want to deal with that right now. Can't she see I'm busy? Ugh, why did I even come down here?\n\nI guess I'll just finish eating and then I'll go back upstairs and try to focus on my article. But what if I get distracted by all the noise outside? Or what if I accidentally knock over a cup of coffee? Okay, okay, I'll just calm down and try to concentrate...\n\nWait, what was grandma saying? Oh yeah, the neighbors. What if they start complaining about the noise? Should I tell her to turn it down? No, no, I shouldn't interfere. I'll just let her handle it. Unless... unless something goes wrong. Then I'll be there to bail her out.\n\nOkay, gotta go. I've got an article to write. And hopefully, I won't trip on the stairs or spill anything on myself. What if I do?<|eot_id|>"

His hands fumbled with his stethoscope, looping it around his neck as he rushed out of the room, leaving the door swinging wildly behind him.\n\nIn the hallway, he collided with Mrs. Henderson, his elderly nurse.

He just pushed past her, grabbing his bag from the cabinet.\n\n\"I'll be at the Harpers'!\" he called over his shoulder, his voice echoing down the empty corridor like a fucking death knell.\n\nAs he drove, speeding through the quiet suburban streets, Henry could feel it - that goddamn panic clawing its way up his throat.

I can almost hear the sound of Timmy's life slipping away, his parents' desperate pleas for help growing fainter with each passing second. I mustn't let fear take hold; I must remain calm, composed, and professional.\n\nBut the image of Emily's lifeless body keeps flashing before my eyes. Her fragile form, her pale skin, her unblinking stare. I was supposed to save her, but I failed. And now, I'm faced with the very same fate staring me in the face. Timmy's life hangs precariously in the balance, and I'm the only one who can save him.\n\nI grit my teeth, steeling myself against the creeping sense of dread. I will not let fear dictate my actions.

He'd attached a raw photo he'd taken last week - their son, Jake, laughing with his college friends outside a protest rally.\n\nMartha felt her grip tighten on her mouse. She'd been denied access to Jake's life since the divorce. Tom had full custody, and Martha was reduced to occasional emails that went unanswered. Now, here he was, Jake, captured in Tom's lens, looking happy, alive, while she was left out, ignored.\n\nShe picked up her phone, dialed Tom's number.

Like, hello, I appreciate your concern, but can't you just listen?\n\nI'm so done with the hospital's bureaucracy. It's like they're designed to drive me crazy. The paperwork, the meetings, the endless forms... ugh. Can't we just streamline things already? Is that too much to ask?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the patients. Some of them are so demanding, it's like they think they own the place. I mean, come on, I'm just trying to do my job here. Can't they see that?\n\nI guess what really grinds my gears is that I feel like I'm failing somehow. Like, I'm supposed to be this rock for my family, and I'm not doing enough. But honestly, I'm barely holding it together. Maybe if everyone around me would just understand that, I wouldn't be so stressed all the time.\n\nBut no, instead, I get these looks like I'm the problem. Like, I'm the one who's messed up, not the fact that my wife left me or that the hospital is a nightmare. It's just so frustrating.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "\"You know what's really special about today? It's not my birthday, or our anniversary, no, no. It's the day I found out my wife of twenty years thought it'd be hilarious to sign me up for 'Nurse of the Year' without bothering to ask first. Can you believe that? Me, winning an award for being a nurse? That's like giving a gold medal to the guy who serves fries at McDonald's because he didn't burn any today.\n\nI wake up this morning, still half-asleep, and there it is - a giant envelope on my pillow. I thought she was finally going to surprise me with that tropical vacation we've been talking about for years. But nope, just a big ol' joke at my expense. 'Congratulations,' the letter says, 'You've been nominated for Nurse of the Year!' I mean, who even nominates these things? Was it her? Did she honestly sit there and think, 'Yeah, my husband deserves an award for not turning into a serial killer while dealing with people's bodily fluids all day'?\n\nI stormed into the kitchen, where she was whistling like she didn't have a care in the world. I slammed the letter down on the counter. She just looked at me, then at the letter, and said, 'Oh, that's today? I thought it was next week.' Next week! Like it was a dentist appointment she'd penciled into her calendar!\n\nShe's laughing now, sitting there with her coffee like this is all some big joke. But you know what? It's not funny. Not even a little bit. Because while she's off having her laugh, I'm the one who has to face my colleagues, who'll look at me like I've lost my mind when they find out about this nomination. 'You?' they'll say, 'Nurse of the Year? You must have wiped someone's butt exceptionally well that day.'\n\nSo here I am, Mr. Disappointment 2022, nominated for being a nurse because, apparently, that's some kind of achievement. I should've known something was up when she started complimenting my handwashing technique.\"",

My wife's been planning this tropical vacation for years, and I woke up thinking that's what I'd get. Instead, I get a stupid letter on my pillow saying I'm nominated for 'Nurse of the Year'. Who does that? Does she think I'm some kind of freakin' superhero or somethin'? \n\nI mean, come on, it's not like I'm some kinda genius or anything. I'm just a nurse, doin' my job, tryin' to make a difference. And now I gotta deal with everyone else thinkin' I'm some kinda prize winner too? Give me a break. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on her attitude. She's sittin' there, whistlin' away like nothin's wrong, thinkin' this is the best joke ever. Newsflash, honey: it ain't funny. This is my life we're talkin' about, not some freakin' comedy routine. \n\nI swear, sometimes I wonder if she even knows how to treat me right. I mean, I'm the one who's always there for her, supportin' her through thick and thin. And this is how she repays me? By nominatin' me for some stupid award? Unbelievable. \n\nI'm startin' to think she's just playin' games with me, seein' how far she can push me before I snap. Well, let me tell you somethin', sweetheart: I'm not gonna take it lyin' down. I deserve better than this. I deserve respect, and I deserve to be treated like the man I am. \n\nThis whole thing's a joke, and I'm the punchline. And you know what? I'm sick of it. I'm sick of bein' treated like some kinda fool, sick of bein' made a mockery of. I need to get outta here, clear my head, and figure out what's goin' on. This isn't over yet, not by a long shot.<|eot_id|>"
