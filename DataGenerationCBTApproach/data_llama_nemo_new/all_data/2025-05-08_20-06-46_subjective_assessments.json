Her heart races as she imagines what emergency awaits her at shift's start, each scenario more gruesome than the last.

Dispatch sends me a message, and suddenly I'm a magnet for all the worst-case scenarios.

I thought back to all the times we'd cooked breakfast together, the way he'd tease me about my burnt toast, and how I'd retaliate with a perfectly flaky pastry. It was our little ritual, one that brought us closer together. Why hadn't he woken up yet? Didn't he know it was his special day?\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of disappointment, but it lingered, like a faint scent of coffee that refused to dissipate. I glanced around the room, searching for some sign, some hint that he might still be asleep, but everything seemed...off. The bed was too neatly made, the sheets too smooth. Where was the rumpled mess that usually accompanied his sleep? And what about the birthday cake, the one we'd ordered weeks ago? Hadn't he remembered? I felt a pang of frustration, wondering if maybe I was just being too sensitive, if maybe he'd simply forgotten. But deep down, I knew better. This wasn't how things worked between us. We were a team, a well-oiled machine, and today was supposed to be the perfect harmony of love and celebration. Anything less was unacceptable.<|eot_id|>"

His eyes, usually bright with enthusiasm, were now sunken and red-rimmed, bespeaking a depth of emotion that was almost palpable. He accused me of being remiss in my duties, of failing to uphold the standards that he deemed essential for academic excellence.\n\nAs I listened to his tirade, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation wash over me. How could he possibly expect such behavior from someone like me? I am a firm believer in fostering a supportive learning environment, one that encourages students to grow and learn at their own pace. And yet, here I was, facing the wrath of a man who seemed to believe that I had failed him, and by extension, his child.\n\nBut what really struck me was the sheer audacity of his expectations. Did he truly think that I would somehow magically conjure up grades that reflected his lofty standards? That I would somehow single-handedly elevate his child to the pinnacle of academic success? It was almost laughable, and yet, there was something deeply unsettling about it.\n\nAs I watched him storm out of the room, leaving behind a trail of tension and unease, I couldn't help but wonder if I was somehow inadequate. Was I truly failing him, or was this simply a manifestation of his own disappointment? The questions swirled in my mind, refusing to settle, much like the turmoil that had erupted within me.\n\nIn the days that followed, I found myself questioning my own abilities, my own judgment. Had I been too soft on his child? Had I failed to provide the level of rigor that he demanded? The doubts crept in, insidious and relentless, until I felt like I was drowning in a sea of self-doubt.\n\nAnd yet, despite the turmoil that raged within me, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had done everything in my power to support his child. That I had provided a nurturing environment, one that encouraged growth and learning. But somehow, it wasn't enough. The weight of his expectations hung over me like a specter, refusing to lift.\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, I began to realize that perhaps I had been foolish to expect that things would ever change. That some people would always see the world through a lens of expectation, one that refused to bend or flex. And so, I resigned myself to the fact that I would never be able to meet his standards, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nBut even as I acknowledged this reality, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of sadness. For I knew that I had given it my all, that I had poured my heart and soul into every aspect of my teaching. And yet, it hadn't been enough. The pain of that realization still lingers, a constant reminder of the unbridgeable gap between my expectations and his.<|eot_id|>"

I demand to know what kind of man does this to the woman who has given up so much for him. Is he truly incapable of even the most basic displays of gratitude, or is he simply choosing to ignore the elephant in the room?\n\nOne thing is certain: I will not stand idly by while our home becomes a reflection of his laziness and lack of consideration.
