Is that really too much to ask? And now, because of her carelessness, I'll have to redo all the work she did. Unbelievable. I feel like I'm constantly babysitting around here, making sure everyone does things right. It's infuriating.\n\nI know I'm a good nurse, one of the best. But sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try, nothing ever goes right. My wife always says I'm too hard on people, but what choice do I have when they're not pulling their weight? I need someone who can keep up with me, who shares my standards. Anything less is just unacceptable.\n\nThis isn't the first time something like this has happened. Remember that patient last week, whose chart was also outdated? Yeah, that was a disaster waiting to happen. If only she had done her job properly... I'd never have to deal with these kinds of problems. It's just so frustrating, knowing that I'm stuck dealing with subpar care while I'm trying to do my part.<|eot_id|>"

Either way, I'll wait patiently until she's ready to talk about it again. \n\nIt's funny how some things can bring back so many emotions, isn't it?
