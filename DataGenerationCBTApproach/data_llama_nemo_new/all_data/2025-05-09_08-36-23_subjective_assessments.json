Or what if I forget to turn off the stove? Or what if - no, wait, what if I actually mess up the sauce and have to remake it from scratch? Ugh, my mind is racing just thinking about it.\n\nAnd it's not just the food stuff. What if I trip on the way to the kitchen and hurt myself?

His breath caught as he noticed the faint glow seeping from beneath the bathroom door, a light he hadn't left on. He swung his legs out of bed, hands trembling slightly, and stepped onto the cold hardwood floor. Each creak underfoot seemed deafening as he inched closer to the bathroom. The door groaned softly as it opened, revealing an empty room bathed in harsh fluorescent light. But something was off\u2014the shower curtain was pulled taut across the tub, hiding what lay behind.

No, no, no...this can't be happening. We're happy, we're fine. This isn't how our marriage is supposed to be. I thought we had it all figured out. But now...now I don't know what to think.

I need to get to the bottom of this, even if it kills me. I'll check the rest of the house, make sure everything's okay. But deep down, I know it's already too late. Something's happened, and I'm running out of time. I just wish I could turn back the clock, make things go back to normal. But life doesn't work that way, does it?

That insufferable man, who so callously abandoned our love, has seen fit to reappear in my life now. His text, a mere whisper of his presence, has awakened a maelstrom of emotions within me, threatening to consume me whole.

A message that, might I add, has left me feeling utterly bewildered and, quite frankly, rather frightened. What could he possibly want now? Has he finally come to his senses and realized the error of his ways?\n\nOr perhaps, dear heavens, it's simply a case of fate itself conspiring against me. After all, what are the chances that I would receive this text, and then, of all days, be summoned to the ICU? It's almost as if the universe is trying to tell me something - that I'm somehow connected to this chaos, that my very existence is the key to unraveling some grand mystery.\n\nBut I digress.
