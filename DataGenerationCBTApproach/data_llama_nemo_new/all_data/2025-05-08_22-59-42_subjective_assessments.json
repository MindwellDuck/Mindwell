Left to sit there, growing cold and congealing, like a symbol of his utter neglect. One would think that a man of his caliber would have the decency to refill his cup before departing, especially after a long day of work.\n\nIt's simply astonishing that he can't seem to grasp the most basic aspects of our relationship. Doesn't he understand that certain... expectations exist between colleagues? That some boundaries must be respected in order to maintain a semblance of civility? Alas, it appears that these fundamental principles are lost on him, leaving me to wonder if we're truly compatible in the first place.<|eot_id|>"
