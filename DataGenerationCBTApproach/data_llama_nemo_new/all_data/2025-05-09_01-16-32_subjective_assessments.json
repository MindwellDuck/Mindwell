I've been around the block a few times; I can spot a fake smile from a mile away.\n\nWhat really gets my goat is that they thought they could just waltz in here and steal the show. Like they're somehow more deserving of happiness than everyone else. Well, let me tell you, they're not. I've worked hard for everything I have, and I won't let some sentimental sap like them come along and undermine my accomplishments.\n\nAnd another thing, what's with all this hand-holding business? In my day, we didn't need to hold hands to be happy. We just got on with our lives and dealt with whatever came our way. This whole \"love is all you need\" nonsense is just a bunch of hooey.<|eot_id|>"
