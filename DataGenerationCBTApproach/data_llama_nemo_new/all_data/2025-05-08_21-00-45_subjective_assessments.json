But now, I'm starting to wonder if maybe I shouldn't have moved into this building after all. I mean, who lives alone in a place like this?\n\nI try to shake off the feeling, but it's hard. I keep thinking about how I should be more careful, how I should have locked my door tighter before I started working. It's just one of those things where you think, \"If only...\" You know? If only I had been more vigilant, none of this would have happened.\n\nBut honestly, it's probably nothing. Just my imagination playing tricks on me. I'll just go check the hallway real quick to make sure everything is okay. Yeah, it's empty. Must've just been the wind or something. Still, it's hard not to feel a little uneasy. Maybe I'll just finish up these papers and call it a night.<|eot_id|>"
