This whole experience is a complete sham, and I'm better off without it.\n\nI need to get out of here before things get any worse. I'll just leave my painting right there on the floor, where everyone can see it. That way, they'll know I'm not afraid of them. No, scratch that - I'll just take it down myself. I don't want anyone touching my work, anyway. It's mine, and mine alone.<|eot_id|>"
