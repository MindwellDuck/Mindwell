It's always the same \u2013 a false sense of hope, followed by crushing disappointment. Every time I see a happy family laughing together, I'm convinced that they're just pretending, that their joy is a facade masking the underlying pain and struggle. They're probably just as broken as we are, but they're too afraid to admit it. And don't even get me started on the so-called \"support groups\" \u2013 they're nothing but a bunch of empty promises, a never-ending cycle of hurt and disillusionment. We'll never find success through those channels; it's simply a waste of time. My wife's words still linger in my mind \u2013 \"we can't keep trying if it keeps hurting us\" \u2013 and I couldn't agree more.

But here it was in black and white: another burden on her shoulders, another thing he hadn't taken care of. She felt a surge of heat rise within her, her hands shaking as she clenched the letter.
