She opens an envelope containing a bloodstained letter meant for her, written by the convicted killer she'd helped put away years ago. The ink is smudged as if tears had fallen on it. Her heart sinks as she reads, \"I know you were just doing your job, but I can't forgive you. Not yet.\" She feels a familiar pang of guilt, followed by a creeping dread.",

It's like he knew exactly how to ruin my evening. I swear, those lawyers always think they're so much better than everyone else, with their fancy degrees and their 'I'm-so-perfect' smiles. They think they can just waltz in here, help me catch a few bad guys, and then turn around and expect forgiveness? Please. Like I didn't do everything in my power to bring him down.\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is that he knows I was just doing my job. He knows I wasn't trying to hurt him, I was just following procedure. But does he care about that? No, all he cares about is his own twisted sense of justice. Newsflash, serial killer: just because you're locked up doesn't mean you get to dictate how I feel.\n\nI've spent years working tirelessly to keep people like him off the streets, and this is the thanks I get? A snide little note from someone who thinks he's above the law. Well, let me tell you something, buddy: you may have gotten away with murder, but I'm still standing. And I'll make sure everyone knows what kind of monster you really are.\n\nIt's not like I'm the one who's been sleeping with the fishes, after all. At least I don't have to live with the knowledge that I'm responsible for taking another life. So, yeah, go ahead and try to guilt trip me, killer boy. But at the end of the day, I'm the one who's still got my integrity intact. You're just a footnote in my career, a tiny little blip on the radar of justice served.<|eot_id|>"

I mean, I'd snuggle up next to him at night, but he'd just roll over and leave me hanging. Like, what's the point of even having a partner if they're just gonna ignore you all the time?
