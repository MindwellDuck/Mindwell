Her hands, gnarled by age but steady as ever, trembled slightly as she reached for the cadmium yellow. It was then that she noticed it: a tiny, almost imperceptible smudge on her pristine canvas.\n\nA sharp intake of breath punctuated the silence. \"Impossible,\" she whispered, leaning closer to examine the aberration. It wasn't hers; she was meticulous, borderline obsessive about such things. Her husband, perhaps? But he knew better than to touch her work without permission.\n\nShe stood up abruptly, knocking over a jar of brushes with a clatter that echoed through the house like an accusation. \"Edward!\" she called out, her voice shrill even to her own ears. \"Have you been in here?\"\n\nNo response. She marched towards their shared bedroom, her slippers shuffling across the floorboards like a timid heartbeat. He was there, immersed in his book, oblivious to the disruption. \"Edward,\" she repeated, her hands planted firmly on her hips.\n\nHe looked up, startled. \"What's wrong, dear?\"\n\n\"The canvas,\" she began, her voice quivering with indignation and fear. \"There's a smudge. It wasn't me.\"\n\nA slight frown creased his forehead as he registered her distress. \"I haven't touched it, you know that.\"\n\nShe searched his face, looking for signs of deceit but finding only confusion and concern. Yet, the doubt lingered, gnawing at her like a relentless mouse. She turned away, leaving him to ponder her sudden paranoia, and returned to her studio, determined to find answers in the silence.",

One minute he's all calm and collected, reading his stupid book, and the next he's completely clueless when it comes to my art. Does he really not care about how I feel? Doesn't he understand that this is my passion, my life?\n\nAnd another thing, why does he always have to deny everything? Can't he just own up to his mistakes? It's so frustrating. I'm starting to think he's just playing games with me, trying to get under my skin. Newsflash, Edward: it's working.\n\nBut seriously, what's going on here? Is he hiding something from me? Am I just being paranoid? No, I'm not. I know what I saw, and I know what I felt. That smudge was not mine, and I demand to know who put it there.\n\nI need to talk to him again, make him see sense. Maybe if I confront him, he'll finally come clean. Or maybe I'll just end up yelling at him, which is exactly what I want to avoid. Ugh, this whole thing is just so infuriating.\n\nWait, what if...what if he's telling the truth? What if I'm just being crazy? No, don't even think that. I know what I saw, and I know what I felt. This isn't about being crazy, it's about justice. Someone needs to take responsibility for ruining my art.\n\nOkay, deep breaths. Let's try this again.

His retirement, once eagerly anticipated, had begun to taste more like rust than honey. He missed the cacophony of the classroom, the eager faces, even the insolent ones.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, as he sat at his desk, a letter arrived. The envelope was cream, heavy, and bore an unfamiliar seal. It was from a former student, now a successful lawyer in London. Harold remembered young Timothy as a bright spark, always asking questions, always pushing for more. He sliced open the envelope with a silver letter opener, a gift from his first class.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Thompson,\" it began, \"I hope this letter finds you well. I've recently been elected as partner at my firm and, among other things, have taken on the task of mentoring our newest recruits...\"\n\nHarold skimmed the rest, his heart sinking like a stone. The young man gushed about his new role, his plans for the future, his gratitude for Harold's teachings. It was all too much. Here was Timothy, barely out of diapers when Harold first met him, now mentoring others, building a life. And Harold? He was just another retired teacher, alone in his study, dust gathering on his books.\n\nHe felt a pang, sharp as a needle, and laughed aloud at the absurdity of it all. Here he was, feeling sorry for himself over a letter filled with good news. \"Well done, Timothy,\" he muttered to the empty room, raising an imaginary glass in toast before setting the letter down, untouched, on his desk. His misery, it seemed, was nothing if not ironic.",
