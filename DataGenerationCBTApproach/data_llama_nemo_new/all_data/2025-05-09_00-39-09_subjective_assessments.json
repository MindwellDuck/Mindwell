That's what everyone wants, right? But honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

She always said I was a great dad, but...I don't know, maybe I am just not cut out for this parenting thing.

I mean, what's the point of even having goals when everyone else is already achieving theirs? Maybe I should just give up now and let them all win.
