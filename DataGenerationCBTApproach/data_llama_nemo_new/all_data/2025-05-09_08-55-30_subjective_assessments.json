What if she's moved on and I'm just some pathetic ex-boyfriend clinging to the past? No, no, no... I know what I heard. She said it was her. And I know how she sounds. It's unmistakable.

The microwave hummed as it reheated yesterday's leftover soup, a monotonous rhythm that seemed to echo her life's recent trajectory.

The harsh fluorescent lights flickered overhead, a subtle reminder of her looming deadline at work, another week of endless sales targets and demanding customers.
