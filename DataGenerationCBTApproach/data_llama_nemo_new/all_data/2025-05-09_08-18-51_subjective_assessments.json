I'm home.\" No response. She found him in their bedroom, slumped on the bed, holding a framed photo of them, laughter frozen in time at some long-forgotten wedding anniversary. A half-empty bottle of whiskey lay beside him. His eyes were red, not from alcohol but from tears. He looked up at her, his voice thick with emotion, \"You missed our anniversary today.\" She felt the guilt wash over her like the boiling water she'd plunged her hands into earlier that day.",

And don't even get me started on the state of the house - it's always so tidy when he's around, but now it looks like a tornado went through. But, I guess that's not the worst part. What really gets my blood boiling is that he forgot our anniversary. Can you believe it? I specifically told him about it, multiple times, and yet he completely spaced it. It's like he doesn't even care about me anymore.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, he's been acting so distant lately. Always glued to his phone, never putting down his laptop... it feels like he's lost interest in us altogether. I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions with him. Like, what's the point of even trying if he's not even going to try?\n\nBut, you know what really takes the cake? He had the nerve to look at me with those fake, apologetic eyes, like he's sorry for forgetting something so important. Sorry? Are you kidding me? You're sorry? That's not how it works, honey. When someone forgets your anniversary, they need to make it up to you. Big time. And right now, he's nowhere near making it up to me. Not even close.<|eot_id|>"

The last thing I need is some careless colleague making a scene and disrupting my workflow.

Maybe if he was more strict, we wouldn't have these kinds of incidents. It's clear that some people don't respect the space we work in. I just wish everyone would pull their weight and be more mindful of their actions.\n\nAs I finish picking up the last of the broken cups, I'll make sure to report this incident to facilities management. They need to know about the lack of attention to detail around here. It's not like I'm the only one who cares about maintaining a tidy workspace.
