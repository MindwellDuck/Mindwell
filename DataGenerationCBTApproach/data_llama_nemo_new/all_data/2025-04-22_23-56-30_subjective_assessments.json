But now, it seemed like no one took him seriously anymore. The editor-in-chief's email had really gotten under his skin, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being treated like dirt.\n\nAs he sat down at his typewriter, he thought to himself, \"Either I produce this piece on the mayor's scandal, or I'm nothing but a washed-up has-been who can't hack it in this industry anymore.\" There was no middle ground, no room for compromise. If he failed, he would be a failure, plain and simple.\n\nHe stared at the blank page in front of him, trying to muster up some inspiration. But every time he tried to write, he felt like he was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch him if he fell. It was either going to be a masterpiece, or a complete disaster.\n\nAnd let's be real, at 78 years old, he wasn't exactly getting any younger. He needed to get this piece done, and fast, or risk losing his relevance forever. So, he gritted his teeth and began typing, determined to prove to himself and everyone else that he still had what it took to make it in this crazy business.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, Jenkins' anxiety grew, but so did his determination. He was either going to nail this piece, or he was going to fail spectacularly. There was no in-between.<|eot_id|>"
