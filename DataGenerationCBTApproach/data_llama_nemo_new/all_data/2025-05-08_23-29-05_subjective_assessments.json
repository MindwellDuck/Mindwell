It's been months since she last wore it, yet somehow, I'm convinced she must have left it behind in haste, a careless gesture betraying her hasty departure. The fact that it remains untouched speaks volumes about her character - a woman who values sentimentality over practicality. Her inability to part with such a trivial item suggests a deeper emotional attachment, one that I can only assume was rooted in our tumultuous relationship. The hanger's gentle sway only serves to underscore this notion, as if it too were whispering secrets about her true nature. I suppose it's fortunate that I've come to terms with her absence, for had I remained oblivious to the truth, I might have continued to harbor unrealistic expectations about our reunion.<|eot_id|>"
