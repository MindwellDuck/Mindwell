She looks happy, genuinely happy. And that makes me want to smash this coffee mug against the wall.\n\nShe used to look at me like that, you know?

His eyes scanned the case files strewn across his desk - each one a testament to the city's underbelly, its criminals walking free while their victims rotted in cold cases. He felt a familiar warmth rise within him, not the comforting kind, but an inferno of vengeance that had been simmering for years.\n\nHarold was no stranger to injustice, but the latest case, a brutal assault on a young woman barely out of her teens, stirred something primal in him. The perpetrator, a known criminal with a rap sheet longer than his arm, had been released on bail, smirking at Harold as if daring him to do something about it.\n\nHe felt a bead of sweat trickle down his spine despite the chill of the air conditioning.

He scanned the crowd, his eyes landing on his target - the man was laughing, a drink in one hand, a woman on his other arm. Harold felt bile rise in his throat.\n\nHe pushed through the crowd, each step heavier than the last, his heart pounding like a war drum in his ears. As he reached the man's table, he leaned down, his voice low and controlled, \"You're under arrest.\"\n\nThe criminal looked up at him, surprise flashing across his face before it was replaced by that infuriating smirk. \"On what charges, Officer?\" he sneered.\n\nHarold felt a surge of anger, but he pushed it down, his training kicking in. He wouldn't let this man bait him into losing control. Not tonight. \"Assault,\" he said, his voice as cold as ice. \"You have the right to remain silent...\"\n\nAs they stepped out into the night, Harold could feel the eyes of the bar patrons on them, but all he saw was the young woman's face from her case file.

        "Generated Assessment": "Ugh, what a piece of work today. I swear, some customers think the world revolves around them. Like, hello, lady, we're not miracle workers here. We can't just conjure up products out of thin air. And another thing, what's with all these entitled millennials who expect everything to be handed to them on a silver platter?\n\nNewsflash: just because you want something doesn't mean it's going to magically appear. Get over yourself. I've been working in retail for years, and I know how it works. You want the new iPhone? Sorry, not sorry. It's not like I can just call Apple and say, \"Hey, can you send me a few dozen iPhones?\" No, I gotta deal with inventory and logistics and all that jazz.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the attitude. This chick comes in here, acts like I'm personally responsible for the product's availability, and then has the nerve to storm off when I tell her the truth. Unbelievable. I mean, seriously, what's wrong with people these days? Can't they see I'm just trying to do my job?\n\nIt's days like this that make me wonder why I even bother. Maybe I should just quit and become a librarian or something. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with all these...people. But no, I'll stick it out. For now. Until the next batch of entitled customers comes along and drives me crazy. Joy.<|eot_id|>"
