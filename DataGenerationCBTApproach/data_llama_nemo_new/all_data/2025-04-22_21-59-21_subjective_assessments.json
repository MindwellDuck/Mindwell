His breath came in short, sharp gasps as if his lungs were collapsing in on themselves. He could feel the familiar tightness in his chest, the cold sweat beading at his temples. It was happening again - that irrational fear that he was losing control, that everything around him was crumbling into chaos because she wasn't here to hold it all together.\n\nHis fingers hovered over the keyboard, trembling like leaves caught in a storm. He wanted to reach out, to scream at someone, anyone, but there was no one left except the ghost of his wife lingering in these empty rooms and this defiant machine. He felt trapped, isolated, adrift in an ocean of panic with nothing but cold, unyielding code for company.\n\nThe room spun around him as he struggled against the urge to flee, to run until his legs gave out beneath him. But where could he go? There was no escape from this relentless grief that had taken root within him, no sanctuary from the memories that haunted every corner of their shared life.\n\nWith a roar that echoed through the silent house, he slammed his fist onto the desk, sending papers flying like startled birds.

Nothing from Emily. A pang of annoyance shot through him. He typed out a message, \"Where are you?

He grabbed a beer, popping it open with a familiar hiss. He took a swig, the bitter liquid doing little to wash away the frustration building within him.\n\nAt 20:15, Emily walked through the door, her cheeks flushed and laughter still lingering on her lips from whatever gathering she'd attended without him. She barely glanced at Henry, tossing her keys onto the counter with a casualness that grated on his nerves.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, her voice light and carefree.\n\nHenry looked at her, then at the cold pizza on the table. He said nothing, merely raised an eyebrow in silent reproach. But Emily was already moving towards the stairs, leaving him alone once more with his cold dinner and even colder marriage.",
