It's like she's intentionally trying to drive me crazy. I'm starting to think she's just using our kids as pawns in some twisted game. I'll show her, though.

I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me as I pondered the potential consequences of her actions.\n\nWhat if she'd invested our entire future in this car, and now it was all going to come crashing down around us? The thought of her driving away in that sleek, black beast, leaving me behind, was almost too much to bear. My mind began to reel with worst-case scenarios, each one more dire than the last.\n\nAnd yet, despite the turmoil brewing inside me, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow responsible for her newfound extravagance. Had I failed her in some fundamental way, leading her down this path of financial ruin? The guilt gnawed at me, fueling my growing sense of desperation.\n\nAs I turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of myself in a nearby window reflection. My eyes seemed sunken, my jaw clenched in a mixture of frustration and despair. I knew I needed to calm down, to think clearly about the situation, but my mind refused to cooperate.
