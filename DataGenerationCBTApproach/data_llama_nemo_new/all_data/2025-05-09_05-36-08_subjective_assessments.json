Was it just some fluke, some momentary lapse of sanity? Or was it something more? Something deeper? Ugh, I don't know why I'm even thinking about this. It's been years. Years since we last spoke. Years since she left me.\n\nBut the thing is, it feels like yesterday. Like I can still smell her perfume, still hear her laugh. It's like my brain is trying to tell me something, but I'm too scared to listen. What if I'm still in love with her? What if I'll never get over her?\n\nThis is ridiculous.

I'm starting to think she does it on purpose, just to distract me and make my life harder.\n\nI'll bet she's laughing about this behind my back, thinking I'm some kind of clumsy oaf who can't even handle a little bit of lipstick.

The weight of those decisions still lingers, a constant reminder of the fragility of relationships and the impermanence of happiness.\n\nIt's hard not to feel that things would have turned out differently if only we'd taken a more... measured approach to our disagreements.
