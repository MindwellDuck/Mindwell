They're just rubbing it in my face, making me realize how much I've failed as a husband and father.\n\nI used to think we had something special, but now I see it for what it was \u2013 a fleeting moment of happiness before the inevitable crash. My wife was always so... cheerful, but that was just a facade. She was hiding her true feelings, just like everyone else. We were just two people stuck in a loveless marriage, going through the motions until she finally found peace.\n\nThis place is suffocating me, and I need to get out of here before I lose my mind. But where can I go? This town is dead, and I'm the only one left to carry the weight of my own misery.<|eot_id|>"
