He's always been a bit of a grump, but this takes the cake. I bet he's telling everyone about this behind my back - \"Oh, look at her, she can barely stand up straight.\" I'm pretty sure I saw Mrs. Johnson giving me the stink-eye earlier, and I know for a fact she's been gossiping about my personal life since high school.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the way he looked at me afterwards. Like, what did I do wrong? Did I say something stupid? Was there something on my shirt that made him uncomfortable? I've been replaying the whole thing in my head, trying to figure out what went wrong, and honestly, I'm convinced I'm just not cut out for this whole caregiving thing. Maybe I should just quit now and save everyone the trouble. But no, I'll just keep going, because that's what I do - I put myself through hell, all for the sake of others. Joy.<|eot_id|>"
