His partner of thirty years sat at the counter, quietly sipping their wine, avoiding his gaze. When he finally approached her with a plate of the steaming pasta, she shook her head slightly and said, \"I'm not really hungry tonight.\"",

Well, let me tell you, I'm not being too sensitive - I'm seeing right through her lack of consideration for others. This is exactly why we can't trust her to do the right thing.

I'll just take up residence here in the studio and wait for him to come crawling back. After all, I'm clearly the one who really cares around here.
