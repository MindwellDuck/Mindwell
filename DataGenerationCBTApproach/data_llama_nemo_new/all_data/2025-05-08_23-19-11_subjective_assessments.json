A single tear slid down her cheek as she noticed the paintbrush he'd left behind, its bristles stiff from disuse. She picked it up gently, feeling the weight of memories in its familiar shape. As she turned to leave, she caught sight of their initials entwined on the canvas's bottom corner - a tiny, hidden promise now lost to time.",
