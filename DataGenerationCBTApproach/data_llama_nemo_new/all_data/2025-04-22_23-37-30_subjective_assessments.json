He paused, tapping a finger on the desk, eyeing an empty space where he'd once kept his wife's favorite color, Cerulean Blue. \"She always did have terrible taste,\" he muttered, rolling his eyes.\n\nThe door creaked open, and in stumbled young Emily, the gallery intern. \"Arthur,\" she beamed, holding out a painting wrapped in brown paper, \"I found this in the back room. I think it's one of yours.\"\n\nArthur raised an eyebrow, taking the package with gloved hands. He unwrapped it slowly, revealing a landscape he'd painted years ago - before his wife fell ill, before her taste had soured like milk left out too long. It was beautiful, vibrant, alive.\n\nEmily watched him, eager. \"It's amazing, Arthur. We should display it.\"\n\nArthur scoffed, turning the painting face down on the desk. \"Display that? Please, Emily, have some taste.\" He could feel his cheeks flush, his voice rising despite himself. \"It's just... gaudy. Like something you'd see at a state fair.\"\n\nEmily blinked, taken aback. \"But Arthur, it's yours...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he snapped, \"And I should know what's good and what isn't. Now if you'll excuse me, I have real art to attend to.\" He turned back to his watercolors, ignoring the intern's stunned silence. After all, he thought, who needs Cerulean Blue when you have such brilliant hues of contempt?",

Newsflash, Arthur: your paintings may be old, but they're still crap.\n\nI tried to show him my latest piece, but he just laughed it off. Said it was \"gaudy\" and that I should stick to \"real art\". Real art?! What does he even know about art? He's just a relic of the past, clinging to his outdated tastes. I swear, sometimes I think he's more concerned with looking good than actually creating something worth showing.\n\nI've been trying to get him to display that new painting I found, but he won't budge. Says it's \"not worthy\" of his collection. Worthy?! Are you kidding me? That painting is beautiful! But no, Arthur has to go and ruin everything with his condescending attitude. I'm starting to think he's more interested in making himself look better than actually appreciating art.\n\nI just wish he wouldn't be so hard on me. I'm trying my best here, but he makes it impossible. Maybe I'll just stick to working with the other interns. At least they don't have to deal with Arthur's toxic ego.

Of course not. He was on the phone, pacing back and forth, his free hand gesturing wildly. She couldn't hear the other end of the conversation, but she didn't need to. She knew that tone, that laugh.

Nobody understands the value of tradition, of hard work, of putting something together with your own two hands. It's all just about speed and profit now. Well, let me tell you, I'm not going down without a fight.\n\nI'll keep cooking, no matter what. I'll keep perfecting that omelette, even if it kills me. Because when it comes down to it, that's what matters. Not some record book or a bunch of entitled kids who think they know better.<|eot_id|>"
