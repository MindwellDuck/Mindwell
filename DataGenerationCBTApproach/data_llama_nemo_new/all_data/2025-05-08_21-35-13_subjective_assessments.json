The hospital would need me tonight, just like they always do - a never-ending cycle of blood-soaked nights and sleepless days. My colleagues were no better, perpetually understaffed and woefully unprepared for the mayhem that erupted every time the sirens wailed.\n\nWhy must I be the one to bear the brunt of this madness? Why can't anyone else handle the pressure? I've seen them falter under the weight of a single emergency call, their composure shattered by the sheer volume of trauma that flooded our doors. And yet, I'm expected to remain steadfast, a rock against which the tempests of fate batter relentlessly.\n\nIt's not that I'm incapable of handling the stress; it's simply that I'm the only one who truly understands what needs to be done. Everyone else is too caught up in their own little worlds to grasp the gravity of the situation. They're content to coast through the day, blissfully unaware of the horrors that await us when the sun dips below the horizon. But I know the truth - we're all just waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the next catastrophe to strike and send our world careening into chaos once more.<|eot_id|>"

Doesn't he know I'm not interested in rehashing old arguments or getting drawn back into our toxic cycle?\n\nI shook my head, chiding myself for even thinking about it. I'm stronger than that now.
