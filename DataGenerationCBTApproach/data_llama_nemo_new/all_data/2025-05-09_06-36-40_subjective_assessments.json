I swear, he left me with nothing but debt and regret. I'm going to have to deal with the landlord too? This is just perfect. I can already imagine him calling me, trying to guilt trip me into paying some crazy amount of money so he doesn't get evicted. Like, no thanks. I'm done with him and his drama.\n\nI wonder if he's even looking for us anymore. Probably not. He's moved on to someone else who's actually worth his time.
