Would I be able to live with myself?\n\nThe anesthesia mask clamped down on my face, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me. What if they forgot to intubate me properly?

        "Triggering Event": "In his tenth year as a high school history teacher, Henry found himself standing before yet another classroom full of indifferent teenagers. Today's lesson was on the American Revolution, but the students seemed more interested in their phones than the Boston Tea Party.\n\nHenry, trying to engage them, asked, \"Now, who can tell me why throwing tea into the harbor might've been considered... *dare I say it*, a bit *radical*?\"\n\nSilence. Then, from the back row, little Johnny chuckled, \"Maybe because you're still using that old, moldy tea leaves, Mr. Thompson? Should've gone for some fancy Earl Grey, huh?\"\n\nThe class erupted in laughter. Henry felt his cheeks flush, but he pressed on, \"Well, at least someone's paying attention.\"\n\nHe tried again, \"Alright, now let's discuss Paul Revere's ride...\"\n\n\"Was it really just one time?\" Johnny quipped, \"I mean, with all that exercise, maybe he should've considered a bike share program?\"\n\nMore laughter. Henry's humiliation grew, but he kept his composure. \"Noted, Johnny. I'll inform the Founding Fathers about your innovative ideas.\"\n\nAs the bell rang and students rushed out, Johnny slapped him on the back, \"Chin up, Mr. T! At least you're teaching us something... *unique*.\"\n\nHenry stood there, alone in his humiliation, thinking, \"Unique indeed. Like a clown at a funeral.\"",

I'm just going through the motions, trying to make history relevant, but it's like they're all just waiting for me to mess up so they can pounce.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on those kids. They're all about their phones, completely oblivious to what's going on around them. I swear, they'd rather watch cat videos than learn about the Boston Tea Party. I asked them if anyone could tell me why throwing tea into the harbor was radical, and the whole class just fell silent. It was like they were all waiting for me to fail.\n\nThen this kid, Johnny, chimes in with some ridiculous comment about my tea leaves. I mean, come on, does he think I'm some kind of joke? The whole class erupts in laughter, and I'm left standing there feeling like a total idiot. I try to keep going, but it's like they're all just mocking me.\n\nPaul Revere's ride? Forget about it. Who cares about some old guy riding a horse? Maybe he should've just taken a Uber instead of all that exercise. More laughter. I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my mind.\n\nAs the bell rings and everyone rushes out, Johnny slaps me on the back and says I should \"chill out.\" Unique, huh? Like a clown at a funeral. That's exactly how I feel right now. Alone, humiliated, and wondering why I even bother.\n\nI guess that's just the life of a teacher, though. Constantly trying to make a difference, but nobody ever notices. Or cares. Whatever.<|eot_id|>"

I swear, if I have to debug one more 'null pointer exception', I'm gonna smash this goddamn monitor. It's not like anyone gives a shit about my deadlines - they just keep piling on the work. And don't even get me started on that idiot, Steve, who keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge. Fuck him too. I've been at this since dawn, and for what? Another late night alone with nothing but my keyboard and a six-pack of beer to keep me company. It's not like I have anyone waiting for me at home. Hell, my plants are probably dead by now. This is fucking bullshit. I just want one damn thing to go right today.\"",
