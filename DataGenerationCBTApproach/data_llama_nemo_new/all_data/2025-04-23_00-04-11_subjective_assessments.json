Really.\"\n\nBut it's not fine. Not really. And as we sit down to our cold dinner, I can't help but think that if he'd just picked up some takeout, instead of trying to play chef, maybe I wouldn't feel like such a lousy partner for being irritated.\n\nBut then again, if I hadn't stayed at school so late, maybe he wouldn't have felt the need to prove something.

For wanting more than just some half-hearted apology and a mediocre meal.\n\nI shake my head, trying to clear the cobwebs. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe tomorrow I'll learn to let go, to accept things as they are.

And if those facts lead us down a path to... to treason, then so be it!\"\n\nWith that, she snatched up her ledger and stormed back into the office, slamming the door behind her with such force that the shop's chandelier swayed precariously.

Margaret, who hadn't enjoyed a home-cooked meal in months, eagerly accepted. But as the day wore on and the store grew busier, she found herself stuck with the endless tasks that seemed to multiply like weeds.\n\nShe sighed, straightening her back against the sudden twinge of pain. She was tired, not just from the physical labor, but from the constant letdowns life seemed to offer her lately. Another dinner ruined, another invitation declined. She could almost see Linda's face falling as she delivered the news over the phone.\n\nMargaret looked at her reflection in the glass display case. Her once-shiny auburn hair now hung limp and lackluster, framing a face etched with lines that seemed to deepen daily. She felt a familiar pang of disappointment, not just in Linda's invitation, but in herself. Where had the vibrant woman gone who used to laugh freely, whose eyes sparkled with life? She missed her.\n\nWith a heavy heart, she turned off the lights and stepped out into the cold night air, leaving behind another unfulfilled promise.",

Linda thinks I'm just going to drop everything and rush over to her house like some kind of doormat. Newsflash, Linda: I've got better things to do than cater to your social calendar.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on this job. I swear, if I have to clean one more shelf, I'll lose my mind. Fifteen years of service and this is how I'm repaid? A never-ending cycle of drudgery and disappointment. The store's always busy, the customers are always rude, and I'm just expected to smile and pretend like it's all okay.\n\nBut it's not okay. It's not okay that I didn't make it to dinner tonight. It's not okay that I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing to show for it. And it's definitely not okay that I look like this - worn down, exhausted, and defeated.\n\nWhat happened to the person I used to be? The one who laughed and lived and loved? When did I become this shell of a person, trudging through life with no purpose or passion? I miss that person, I miss her so much.\n\nI hate this job, I hate this town, and I hate the fact that nobody cares about anyone anymore. I hate that I'm stuck in this rut, with no escape in sight. And most of all, I hate that I let myself down again.<|eot_id|>"
