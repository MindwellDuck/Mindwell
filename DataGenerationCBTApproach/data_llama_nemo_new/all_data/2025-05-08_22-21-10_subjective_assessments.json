This isn't just some random criticism; it's like they're attacking me directly.\n\nI keep thinking about what could've triggered this outburst. Was it something I said in class? Did I do something wrong? I replayed our last lesson in my head, wondering if I came across too harsh or dismissive. But no, I'm pretty sure I handled it professionally. Maybe it's just one of those parents who thinks they know better? I don't get why they can't just let things go.\n\nThis whole thing is really getting to me. I feel like I'm under a microscope now, like every move I make is being scrutinized. I just wish someone would come forward and tell me what I did wrong, so I can fix it. Is it possible that there's more to this story than meets the eye? That maybe this parent has a legitimate concern? I hope so, but right now, it feels like they're just trying to tear me down.\n\nI need to shake off this feeling of inadequacy. I've taught countless classes, and I know I'm doing my best. This one note shouldn't define me. But it's hard not to take it personally when it feels like they're speaking straight to my soul.<|eot_id|>"

It was as if the very essence of our connection had been extinguished, leaving behind a faint, flickering ember that refused to ignite.\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his voice, a low, husky timbre that sent shivers down my spine.
