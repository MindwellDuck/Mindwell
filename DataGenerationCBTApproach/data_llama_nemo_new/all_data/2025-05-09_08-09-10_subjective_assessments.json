Doesn't he care that I'm still trying to hold on to our old life here?\n\nAnd another thing, why didn't he even notice it was missing? That's so typical of him - always too busy with his own stuff to pay attention to anything else. It's like he thinks I'm some kind of mind reader or something, but honestly, I'm starting to think I am. I mean, how else would I know exactly when he's going to get upset about something?\n\nThis whole place feels like a ghost town without him.

What matters is how well you can handle the stress of working late nights and dealing with idiots like me.

I'm the one who's been holding down this store for years, not her and her precious boyfriend.\n\nIt's just great, though.
