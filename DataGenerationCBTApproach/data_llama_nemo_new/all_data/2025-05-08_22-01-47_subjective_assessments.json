We've got a paper to publish, a grant to secure, and a reputation to uphold. If this doesn't work out, it's all over. All of it. The pressure is suffocating me, making my head spin. Why can't this just work?!\n\nI'm starting to think it's not just the equipment, though. Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this anymore. Maybe I should have stuck to teaching.
