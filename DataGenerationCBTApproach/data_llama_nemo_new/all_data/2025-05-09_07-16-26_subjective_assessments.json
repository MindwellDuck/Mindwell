I shouldn't be surprised; he's always been distant lately. \n\nI keep telling myself that he'll come home soon, that we can finally talk about what's going on. But until then, I'm left here alone, wondering if I'm just being paranoid. Two months have passed since his birthday, and I still haven't gotten him anything. It's not like I forgot or anything. He just doesn't seem to care anymore. Maybe I'm just expecting too much. \n\nI should probably just focus on my work and let things take care of themselves. After all, he's a grown man, and I'm just his wife. If he wants to prioritize his job over us, that's his decision. Not mine.<|eot_id|>"

What if he had chosen to ignore me, to erase me from his life? The silence between us has always felt oppressive, and now I wonder if it was intentional. Did he deliberately cut ties, or did fate simply conspire against us?\n\nI think about the letter again, the words \"Dear [my name]\" etched on the envelope, taunting me with what could have been. Two years have passed since it was posted, yet it remains sealed, a constant reminder of the choices we didn't make. What if I had responded, what if I had reached out to him when I had the chance?
