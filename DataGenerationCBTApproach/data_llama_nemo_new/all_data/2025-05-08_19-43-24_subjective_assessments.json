My daughter's accident has set off a chain reaction of catastrophic events, and I fear that nothing will ever go back to normal again.\n\nEvery time I think about her recovery, I'm met with visions of her spending the rest of her life in a wheelchair, never able to walk or run freely again.

The weight of responsibility is crushing me, and I'm starting to lose hope.\n\nI keep replaying the events leading up to the accident in my head, searching for any sign of negligence or carelessness on my part. Was I too lenient with her? Did I not teach her enough defensive driving techniques? The what-ifs are endless, and I'm consumed by the certainty that I'll never be able to forgive myself if she doesn't make a full recovery.\n\nMy mind is a whirlwind of worst-case scenarios, and I'm powerless to stop the downward spiral.
