Her breath comes in short, angry bursts as she paces, her mind replaying every harsh word and insinuation made by colleagues who think she's not cut out for investigative journalism. She snatches up her phone, intending to call someone, anyone, but stops herself, realizing there's no one left who'll understand this fire burning within her. Instead, she storms over to the wall where her degrees hang, unseeing eyes staring back at her. With a cry, she rips them down, leaving behind crooked nails and scattered dust.",

And those colleagues, always whispering behind my back, questioning my skills... it's like they're waiting for me to slip up so they can pounce.\n\nI keep thinking about all the times I've been told I'm \"too aggressive\" or \"not collaborative enough\". Like, what does that even mean? Are they saying I'm not good enough? That I'm somehow less worthy than everyone else? It's infuriating.\n\nAnd now, with these rejections piling up, I feel like I'm drowning in self-doubt. I'm starting to wonder if I was foolish to think I could make it in this industry. Maybe I'm just not cut out for it. The thought alone is making me sick to my stomach.\n\nI look around my room, feeling like I'm surrounded by reminders of my failures. My degrees, once symbols of pride and accomplishment, now seem like mocking trophies. I rip them off the wall, watching as they flutter to the floor like confetti. Who needs them anyway? They're just a reminder of how far I have to fall.\n\nAs I stand here, feeling empty and defeated, I realize that maybe I'm better off without them. Without the expectations and the pressure. Without the constant criticism and doubt. I take a deep breath, letting the anger and frustration wash over me. I am done with this life. Done with the lies and the half-truths and the broken promises. I deserve better.<|eot_id|>"

He'd said he was running late, but I knew better. He just didn't care about our family's needs anymore. And when I tried to talk to him about it, he'd brush it off, saying I was being too sensitive.\n\nLooking back, I realize that his lack of consideration was a pattern throughout our marriage. He'd always prioritize his work over us, leaving me to handle everything on my own. I shouldn't have been surprised when he left me, but somehow, I was. It was always going to end like this.\n\nHis absence has left a gaping hole in my life, and I'm still trying to fill it.
