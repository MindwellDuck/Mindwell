A paycheck that's thinner than a supermodel's ass and a body that feels like it's been run over by a fucking Mack truck.\n\nAnd today, of all days, the goddamn manager has the balls to tell me he's cutting my hours. \"It's not personal,\" he says, like he ain't just kicked me in the nuts. \"It's just business.\" F**k him and his business! I'm this close to telling him where he can shove his job, but then what? How am I supposed to keep a roof over my wife's head, pay the bills, put food on the table?\n\nI feel like I'm drowning here, like there ain't no way out.

It's just not fair.\n\nI know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying my best. I work hard, I provide for my family, and I'm grateful for what I have. But sometimes it feels like nobody appreciates it.

Like, I'm not good enough, or I'm not making enough money. But the truth is, I'm doing the best I can. I'm not asking for much. Just a little respect, maybe some understanding. Is that too much to ask?\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm just being paranoid. But it feels like everything is stacked against me.

He hesitated, then answered, \"Hello?\"\n\nA gruff voice said, \"Is this Alexander? This is Harold from the gallery downtown.\"\n\nAlexander's breath caught. The gallery had rejected his last submission, dismissing it as 'too dark'.\n\nHarold continued, \"I've seen your work again, son. I think we can make something happen here.

The darkness was all too real, a manifestation of the turmoil that churned within my very soul.\n\nAnd yet, as I gazed upon the torn remnants of our wedding photo, a fleeting sense of nostalgia threatened to resurface.

I had nothing left to give, no spark of creativity remaining to illuminate the darkness that had consumed me. The very idea of producing something \"lighter\" was an affront, a cruel joke played upon my already battered psyche.\n\nIn that moment, I knew I was beyond redemption.

Her daughter, Emily, had moved across the country for work, leaving Edna alone in their old family home.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, Edna decided to tidy up the attic. She'd been putting it off, but today felt different. She wanted to keep busy, to keep her mind from wandering to Emily's late-night calls and the echoing silence of an empty house.\n\nShe climbed the creaky stairs, her joints protesting every step. The attic was a treasure trove of memories: Emily's old dollhouse, Edna's nursing textbooks yellowed with age, and photographs scattered like confetti on the dusty floor.\n\nEdna picked up a frame, her hands trembling slightly. It was Emily at five, grinning toothlessly in her first nurse uniform. She smiled softly, tracing the image with a calloused thumb. Then she noticed it - a spiderweb crack running across Emily's face.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Edna muttered, her worry momentarily morphing into frustration. \"Just like that girl to cause trouble even from afar.\"\n\nShe set down the frame gently and reached for the first aid kit tucked behind some boxes. As she opened it, a cloud of dust puffed up, making her cough. She fumbled with bandages and antiseptic wipes until she found what she needed - super glue.\n\nEdna carefully applied the glue along the crack, holding the frame steady with her other hand. Her eyes were fixed on the photo, but her mind was elsewhere, worrying about Emily's silence last night, about the darkness in their old home, about the ticking clock that seemed to echo louder every day.\n\nWhen she finished, Edna stood up straight, her back popping like a handful of kernels. She placed the repaired frame on the windowsill, letting the sunlight bathe Emily's smiling face. Then she turned around and surveyed the attic, her worry gnawing at her like an unseen mouse.\n\n\"Lord help me,\" she sighed, \"I've got a lot more to tidy up before I can rest easy.\"",

And to make matters worse, my car is on its last legs. I've been fixing it myself for years, but it's still a lemon.\n\nWhen I got to work, my manager gave me a hard time about being late. Like, what's the big deal? I'm already stressed out enough. But no, she had to go and make a scene about it. I'm pretty sure she's just jealous of my success. I mean, I'm doing okay for myself, despite everything.\n\nThe customers were a real treat too. They complained about everything - the price, the weather, the fact that we didn't have their favorite brand of coffee. I mean, come on, can't they see I'm trying my best here? But no, they just yell at me and expect me to fix everything.\n\nI'm so sick of this job. I'm sick of the long hours, the low pay, and the constant stress. But most of all, I'm sick of everyone around me. Especially him. He's the one who really knows how to live, and I'm stuck here, miserable and alone.\n\nAs I walked home, I saw him walking towards me. He looked happy, carefree. And it just made me angrier. Why can't he see how much I suffer? Why can't he understand that he's the reason I'm stuck in this rut?\n\nI tried to talk to him, but he just ignored me. Typical. He never listens to me, never cares about my feelings. He's just too busy living his own life to worry about mine.\n\nI hate him. I hate this life. I hate everything.<|eot_id|>"
