His boots splashed in puddles, each splash echoing like a dull thud against his melancholic heart. The once vibrant leaves now rotten and brown, crunched underfoot, adding to the symphony of decay.\n\nAs he approached his apartment building, he saw it - a small, forlorn figure huddled by the door, clutching a teddy bear with one arm, and a piece of paper with the other. It was Little Timmy, the kid from upstairs who'd lost his mom last week. Tom's gut twisted into knots.\n\nHe knelt down, his joints creaking like an old man's. \"Hey, buddy,\" he said softly, taking in Timmy's tear-stained cheeks and red-rimmed eyes. \"What are you doing out here alone?\"\n\nTimmy held up the paper, his tiny fingers trembling. It was a drawing of him and his mom, both smiling, holding hands. In the corner, Timmy had written 'I miss you, Mommy.' A lump formed in Tom's throat.\n\n\"She was supposed to come back today,\" Timmy sniffled, looking up at Tom with those goddamn big, sad eyes. \"But she didn't.\"\n\nTom felt a surge of anger, not at the kid, but at life, at fate, at God for being such a heartless bastard. He pulled Timmy into a hug, feeling the boy's tiny body shake with sobs against his chest.\n\n\"Why don't we go inside, huh?\" Tom whispered, his own eyes welling up. \"We can make some hot chocolate, and you can tell me all about your mom.\"\n\nAs they climbed the stairs to Timmy's apartment, Tom felt the weight of the world on his shoulders, a burden he carried daily as a nurse, but tonight it was heavier, more personal. He missed his late wife Sarah too, goddammit. And seeing Timmy like this... It fucking hurt.\n\nThat night, after putting Timmy to bed, Tom stood alone in the darkness of his apartment, staring at Sarah's picture on the mantelpiece. The rain beat against the window, a relentless drumroll for his breaking heart. He felt the melancholy wash over him like a tidal wave, threatening to drown him.\n\nHe picked up his phone, scrolling through old messages with Sarah until he found one that made him smile: 'You're my hero, Tom. Always.' It was from their last trip together, before she got sick. Before everything went to shit.\n\nTom wiped away a tear, took a deep breath, and walked over to the kitchen cabinet where he kept his whiskey. He poured himself a glass, the amber liquid catching the dim light like a fucking cruel joke.\n\n\"To you, Sarah,\" he muttered, raising the glass before taking a sip, letting the burn remind him he was still alive, even if it felt like hell sometimes.",

A Code Blue for Mrs. Hartley, whose frail body had rebelled against her dwindling vitality. The harsh beep of the monitor, her lifeless eyes staring up at him - a sight that seemed burned into his retinas. Then, young Timmy's parents, their faces contorted with grief as they were told there was nothing more that could be done.\n\nThomas' stomach churned, bile rising in his throat like an angry tide.

Five interminable minutes until he could escape to the arms of his girlfriend, Sarah. She would soothe him, her calm demeanor a balm to his frayed nerves.

The weight of their suffering was crushing him, drowning him. He needed air, space... anything but this endless sea of pain.\n\nAs Dr. Chen began CPR on the latest arrival, Thomas backed away, unnoticed by the frenzied staff. His eyes darted around wildly, searching for an escape route. There, at the end of the corridor, was the fire exit. He could hear its siren call, promising freedom from this living nightmare.\n\nWithout another glance back, Nurse Thomas turned and fled, leaving behind the chaos, the suffering... and his duties. His world was crumbling around him, and he didn't know how to pick up the pieces. All he knew was that he had to run, or be consumed by the inferno of sorrow that threatened to engulf them all.",

Great, just what I need. More stress.\n\nI swear, my dad's the worst. He thinks he can just waltz back into my life after all these years and expect everything to be okay? Please. He's got no idea how much pain he caused me. I've spent years trying to move on, but it's hard when he keeps throwing it in my face.\n\nI don't know why I even bother trying to forgive him. It's not like it'll make a difference. He's still gonna be the same old selfish, uncaring guy he's always been. But hey, maybe if I pretend to forgive him, it'll make me feel better about my own messed up life.\n\nMy mom's health is probably fine, anyway. She's just using this as an excuse to get attention from Dad. That's what she does best \u2013 manipulating people to get what she wants. I'm not falling for it again.\n\nI just want to scream sometimes. Like, seriously scream. But I won't. I'll just stand here and cry instead, because that's what I do. I'm a total emotional mess, and nobody understands me. Not even my family.<|eot_id|>"
