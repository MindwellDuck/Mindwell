My wife's decision to leave me alone tonight is a stark reminder of the emptiness that lies at the heart of our relationship.\n\nHer lack of concern for my well-being is a reflection of the apathy that pervades modern society. We're all just cogs in a machine, processing information without any genuine connection or empathy. I'm not being unreasonable when I expect her to understand my plight; I'm simply acknowledging the inherent meaninglessness of our existence.\n\nThe hum of my computer is a constant reminder of the monotony that awaits us all.

After all, someone has to keep the wheels of progress turning, even if it means sacrificing my own happiness.\n\nLinda may think she's doing me a favor by giving me space, but she's actually perpetuating the cycle of isolation that defines our lives.

Widowed for nigh on five years now, he has taken up residence in a studio apartment that could charitably be described as 'quaintly disheveled,' much like its inhabitant.\n\nOne afternoon, as Henri was attempting to capture the essence of Montmartre's melancholic beauty on canvas (an endeavor that had proven about as successful as his attempts at finding humor in his late wife's favorite sitcoms), there came a knock at his door. Standing on the other side was none other than Madame \u00c9lodie, his neighbor from down the hall and a woman whose penchant for wearing entirely too much perfume was rivaled only by her penchant for gossip.\n\n\"Henri,\" she began, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness, \"I've been meaning to tell you, I saw your dear Marie's portrait at the gallery last week. You know, the one of her laughing?\" She paused, allowing a dramatic sip of her aperitif to punctuate her words. \"It seems they've replaced it with something... different.\"\n\nHenri felt his grip on his paintbrush tighten, as if it were some small creature attempting to wriggle free from his grasp. He knew what was coming next.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, his voice carefully neutral, \"I heard they've taken an interest in my newer pieces. You know how these things are, \u00c9lodie. One day you're the toast of Paris, and the next, you're little more than a clich\u00e9.\"\n\n\u00c9lodie tittered, her laughter like tinkling glass. \"Oh, Henri, always so modest! I must say, though, I do prefer your older work. There's such... warmth to it. It reminds me of Marie.\" She leaned in conspiratorially, as if sharing some great secret. \"In fact, I've been thinking about commissioning a piece myself. Something to honor our late friend.\"\n\nHenri felt something within him snap. He had spent the better part of five years navigating this labyrinth of polite conversation and veiled condolences, all while attempting to create art that was true to his soul. And now, here was Madame \u00c9lodie, offering him a fat purse of francs in exchange for a piece of Marie's memory.\n\nHe felt a sneer tug at the corners of his mouth, a sneer born not of humor but of something far darker and more potent. \"I'm afraid, \u00c9lodie,\" he said, his voice low and measured, \"that my newer work is all I have left to give. You see, Marie took everything else with her when she went.\"\n\nAnd with that, Henri shut the door in Madame \u00c9lodie's shocked face, leaving her standing there, clutching her aperitif like a lifeline in a stormy sea.\n\nAs he turned back to his canvas, Henri felt something akin to satisfaction well up within him. It was not joy, nor was it peace. No, it was something far more primal and consuming: spite. And for now, at least, that was enough.",

All she does is try to guilt trip me into doing some half-baked tribute to my dead wife.
