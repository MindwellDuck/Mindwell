His wife, Martha, had always insisted on this ritual, claiming it helped her to draw a clear line between his professional life and their personal one. Now, alone in their once-cozy home, Albert found himself resenting that tradition.\n\nHe walked into the kitchen, absently rubbing at a stain on his collar - a remnant of Mrs. Henderson's latest episode. His eyes fell upon the stack of unopened letters on the counter, each addressed to Martha. Bills, mostly, but also the occasional sympathy card from old friends. He'd been meaning to sort through them, but every time he saw that familiar, looping handwriting, something inside him clenched.\n\nToday, however, was different. Tucked amongst the envelopes was a postcard, its vibrant colors stark against the drab pile. A beach scene, with laughing children building sandcastles under a sun too bright to be real. It was from their grandson, Thomas, who'd moved away last year without so much as a goodbye.\n\nAlbert picked up the card, turning it over. \"Wish you were here,\" Thomas had scrawled, his childish script barely legible. Albert felt a familiar resentment rise within him. Why should Thomas get to enjoy life while he was stuck here, tending to the dying and the sick? He'd given up so much for this family - his youth, his energy, even his wife - and now they acted as if he were nothing more than an afterthought.\n\nHe tossed the card back onto the counter, harder than intended. It slipped beneath a magazine, out of sight. Good riddance, Albert thought, resentment simmering like hot coals in his chest. They could all go to hell for all he cared.",

The fact that he'd chosen to send such a flippant message, devoid of any genuine sentiment, spoke volumes about his character. Clearly, he was one of those carefree individuals who took pleasure in causing unnecessary distress to those around him. The very thought sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nIt's almost as if Thomas had deliberately set out to hurt me, to make me feel like some sort of forgotten relic. And yet, despite the obvious lack of consideration, Martha seemed entirely oblivious to the pain she must have caused me by allowing Thomas to move away without so much as a word. One would think that a mother's love would transcend petty squabbles over trivial matters, but I suppose that's just not the case.\n\nThe postcard itself was a masterclass in insensitivity, a cruel reminder of the sacrifices I've made for this family. The bright colors and cheerful atmosphere only served to highlight the stark contrast between our lives. It's almost as if Thomas was trying to rub it in my face, to remind me of everything I've lost. And Martha, dear Martha, was complicit in this charade, pretending that everything was fine when, in reality, it was far from it.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder what other secrets Thomas was hiding, what other ways he was manipulating those around him. The thought sent a wave of anxiety coursing through my veins, leaving me feeling increasingly on edge. It's clear that Thomas is a force to be reckoned with, and I can only hope that I'm not the next victim of his manipulative games.<|eot_id|>"

She hated cancer more than anything, had seen it steal lives too young and too good, but never like this. Never her mother.\n\nShe sat by the bed, holding that bony hand, watching those once-vibrant eyes flutter closed. The machine beside them beeped steadily, mocking her. It could keep her alive, but not living. She hated that machine, hated the doctors who'd given up hope, hated everyone who couldn't save her mother.\n\nHer husband tried to comfort her from the doorway, but she couldn't bear his touch, his sympathetic words. She wanted him gone, wanted everyone gone, except her and her mother. She was all her mother had left, and she wasn't enough. It wasn't enough.\n\nShe felt a surge of hatred, not just for cancer, but for life itself. For taking so much from her, leaving her with nothing but emptiness and despair. She hated the sun that shone outside, hated the birds that sang in the morning, hated every moment that passed without her mother by her side.\n\nThe room was silent except for the damned machine.

        "Triggering Event": "\"Yeah, so there I was, 65 years young, still standing in front of those little monsters I call students. Been teaching history for what feels like a lifetime now. My wife, she's been my rock through it all, but lately... well, let's just say she's been more interested in her book club than our marriage.\n\nSo, today, I'm droning on about the Battle of Hastings, and little Johnny decides to ask me if William the Conqueror was 'like that one guy from Game of Thrones'. I mean, what the hell? I've spent my life dedicated to this, and now I'm just some punchline to their video game jokes.\n\nAnd then, wouldn't you know it, I get home after another thrilling day of being ignored by adolescents, and find a note on the fridge. My wife's gone out with her book club friends for dinner. No 'I love you', no 'See you later'. Just 'Gone to Book Club'.\n\nI dumped my briefcase on the counter - hell, maybe I chipped a plate, who cares? It's not like anyone's gonna notice or give a damn. I poured myself a drink, neat, and sat down in my favorite chair. The one she always said made me look like an old man. Well, joke's on her, I am an old man.\n\nI'm still sitting here, nursing my drink, listening to the clock tick away the minutes. Bitterness, that's what this is. Bitter that after all these years, all I get is a note on the fridge. Bitter that my students think history is just something they can ignore until it pops up in their video games. Bitter that I'm still here, teaching, while everyone else moves on with their lives.\n\nBut you know what? I'm not gonna dwell on it. I'm gonna finish this drink, then I'm gonna pour another one. And maybe tomorrow, I'll tell little Johnny all about how William the Conqueror was just like that one guy from Game of Thrones. Maybe they'll laugh, maybe they won't. But at least I'll have a story to tell.\"",

A bunch of entitled brats who think history is just a game. Newsflash: it's not a game! It's about sacrifice, duty, and honor. But do they care? Nope.\n\nMy wife, she's supposed to be supporting me, but instead she's off gallivanting with her book club. No consideration for my feelings, no thought for how I'm doing. Just 'Gone to Book Club' on the fridge. Like I'm nothing. Unbelievable.\n\nI used to take pride in my work, but now it just feels like a chore. These kids don't appreciate the value of hard work and dedication. They're all about instant gratification and getting ahead by any means necessary. It's disgusting.\n\nI'm starting to wonder why I bother. Why put myself through this every day? For what? So I can be ignored and disrespected? No thanks. I deserve better. I deserve someone who appreciates me, who respects me. But does that happen? Nope.\n\nI guess I'll just keep going through the motions. Pour myself a drink, sit back, and watch the world go by. Who needs personal fulfillment when you can just coast through life, anyway? At least I'll have my memories of when things were good. When my wife actually cared. Ha!\n\nYou know what really gets my goat? People who don't take responsibility for themselves. That's what's wrong with this country. Nobody takes ownership of anything anymore. We're all just a bunch of freeloaders, expecting everything to be handed to us on a silver platter. Well, let me tell you something, kid: nobody owes you squat. You want something? Earn it. That's the American way.\n\nI'm done talking about this. I'm done feeling sorry for myself. Time to move on. Tomorrow's another day, right? Maybe I'll finally get some respect around here. Maybe I'll finally get my wife to see things my way. Yeah, right.<|eot_id|>"
