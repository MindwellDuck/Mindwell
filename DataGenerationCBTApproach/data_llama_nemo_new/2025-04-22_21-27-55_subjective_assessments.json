Every tap echoed like a gunshot in the emptiness around her, each click punctuating the gnawing resentment that had taken residence in her chest.\n\nHer husband, Tom, was supposed to be setting up their dinner date tonight. He'd promised, after all these years of her cooking every night. Yet here she was, at 7:15 PM, still hunched over her laptop, the screen saver mocking her with its idle countdown. She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks, her breath growing shallow.\n\nShe picked up her phone, dialed Tom's number with trembling hands. It rang once, twice, thrice before switching to voicemail. His voice, that familiar baritone she loved, now grated on her nerves like nails on a chalkboard. \"You've reached Tom. I can't take your call right now...\"\n\nMargaret threw the phone onto the couch, where it bounced and landed face down. She could feel the resentment bubbling over, threatening to spill into something uglier. She was tired of being taken for granted, tired of her life being dictated by a man who seemed to have forgotten his promises.\n\nShe stormed out of her office, her heels clicking loudly on the hardwood floor, each step echoing her resolve. As she reached the kitchen, she saw it - the dinner table set for one, Tom's half-eaten plate of food, and a note propped against the wine glass.\n\n\"Ran into Jack at the store. We grabbed a bite. Will be home late. Love you!\"\n\nMargaret felt the resentment surge like a tidal wave, drowning out any rational thought. She picked up his plate, her hands shaking with anger, and dumped it into the trash can with a satisfying clatter. Then she stormed back to her office, leaving the note untouched on the table, a silent testament to her husband's thoughtlessness.\n\nThat night, Margaret didn't sleep. Instead, she spent hours updating their shared calendar, adding reminders for Tom about upcoming anniversaries, birthdays, and dates he'd promised but seemed to have forgotten. Each tap of the keyboard felt like a victory, each reminder a stake driven into the heart of her resentment. She wouldn't be his silent, forgotten wife anymore. Not tonight. Not ever again.",

Like, what even is that? Can't he just plan ahead for once?\n\nI tossed the note aside, feeling a surge of frustration. Why did he always do this? Why did he never bother to check if I was okay when he was running late? It wasn't like I was asking him to win a Pulitzer Prize or anything. Just a simple courtesy would be nice.\n\nBut no, instead I'm stuck dealing with his thoughtless behavior day in and day out. And don't even get me started on how he always expects me to be understanding and patient. Newsflash, honey: I'm not your personal therapist. I have feelings too, you know.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. But it was no use. My anger was simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over at any moment. And when it did, watch out. I'd unleash a storm of fury upon him, making sure he knew exactly how I felt.\n\nBecause let's be real, I'm the one who's really suffering here. I'm the one who's been put through the wringer, constantly dealing with his incompetence and lack of consideration. And yet, does anyone ever acknowledge my pain? Nope. All they care about is how he feels, how his precious ego is hurt.\n\nWell, let me tell you something, sweetheart. I'm not going to take it lying down anymore. I'm done being the victim, done being the one who's always apologizing and making excuses. From now on, it's my turn to shine.

He snatched it up, fingers trembling. \"Running late. Be there soon.\"\n\n\"Late?\" Henry spat, veins bulging in his neck. \"Late?

His breaths came in ragged gasps, anger and sadness warring within him.\n\nFinally, the doorbell rang. Henry stood, smoothing his shirt, trying to compose himself. But as he opened the door, he saw only a delivery man holding a box.\n\n\"No visitors today,\" the man said, gruffly. \"Just this package.\"\n\nHenry took it, fingers tightening around the cardboard until they were white.

Vengefulness wasn't an emotion he'd felt in decades, not since that incident with the orderly who'd stolen from him. He'd been young then, foolish and hot-headed.

You think I didn't know what was going on? You think I didn't see right through your little game?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the timing. Now that I'm old and grey, she decides to reach out and expect me to just forgive and forget? Please. I've got better things to do than waste my time on empty apologies.\n\nI swear, some people have no idea how much pain they can cause. One minute they're screwing around behind someone's back, and the next they're expecting them to just roll over and take it. Well, let me tell you something, Martha: I'm not buying it.\n\nI'll respond to that email, all right. And I'll make sure everyone knows what kind of person you are.

        "Triggering Event": "In the musty, cluttered studio that she called home, our middle-aged artist, Mildred, was putting the finishing touches on her latest masterpiece. A grotesque figure loomed large and lurid, a twisted reflection of her current mood - which wasn't saying much, considering her default emotional state was somewhere between 'dour' and 'misanthropic'. Suddenly, she heard it. A soft rustle, like paper being crumpled into a ball. She turned to find her pet ferret, Fuzzball, gleefully munching on the corner of her freshly painted canvas. Mildred sighed, \"Oh, for crying out loud, Fuzzball. It's not enough that I've got to live with your furry little face staring at me from every wall? Now you're eating my art too?\" She plucked the ferret off the canvas and plopped him into his plush bed. \"Honestly,\" she muttered, wiping her paint-stained hands on her overalls, \"I should have stuck to painting landscapes. At least they don't eat themselves.\"",

Is he gonna start reorganizing my entire studio?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how I ended up with a ferret in the first place. I thought I was doing him a favor by giving him a safe space to play, but noooo, now he's destroying all my hard work. I'm starting to think I should just stick to painting still lifes \u2013 at least those things don't move around and eat themselves.\n\nBut honestly, can't anyone else take care of this guy for once? I'm barely scraping by as it is, and now I've got to deal with Fuzzball's antics on top of everything else. Maybe I'll just have to start charging extra for my art \u2013 after all, it's not like I can afford to lose anything else.<|eot_id|>"
