She rolled her eyes so hard she could see her brain. \"Fuck me gently with a chainsaw,\" she muttered, slamming her coffee mug down on her desk.\n\n\"Who died this time?\" she asked her colleague, Bill, without looking up from her keyboard.\n\nBill glanced over, his bushy eyebrows raised. \"Old man Thompson. You remember him, right? Used to run the hardware store downtown?\"\n\nEdith waved a hand dismissively. \"Oh yeah, good old 'Thompson the Dick.' Can't say I'll miss him.\" She paused, then added under her breath, \"But I sure as hell miss being taken seriously.\"\n\nShe pulled up Thompson's file on her computer and started typing. \"Born in 1920... died yesterday... leaves behind a wife who probably hated his guts... blah, blah, fucking blah...\" she mumbled.\n\nAs she was about to hit save, an email popped up from her editor. Subject: \"Re: Thompson Obituary.\" Edith clicked on it and read aloud, \"'...make sure you include his 'notable' contributions to the community. Specifically, his donation of a bench.'\"\n\nEdith felt her blood pressure rising. \"A fucking bench? That's what they want me to lead with? Not the fact that he was a miserable old bastard who never once smiled in his life?\" She threw her hands up in the air. \"Fine! 'Thompson donated a bench. Let's all fucking weep for the goddamn bench.'\"",

I've written obits for decades, and I've never had a problem with it until now. Is it because I'm getting older? Am I just losing my touch?\n\nI take a deep breath and try to focus on the task at hand. But my mind keeps wandering back to the email. What if my editor thinks I'm not taking this seriously enough? What if they're worried that I'm not doing justice to Thompson's memory?

His wife, Martha, would chide him gently for staying up too late, but she'd never understand just how captivating those pinpricks of light were to him.\n\nNow, here he was, seventy-two years old and still gazing at the stars, but now through multi-million-dollar equipment instead of a plastic lens.

'Oh, little Timmy just loves your class!' they'll coo, while I'm over here wondering how much longer I can keep up this charade without losing my mind. And don't even get me started on the inevitable 'But you must have time for yourself, Mr. Thompson?' No, Mrs. Johnson, I don't. Because while you're off sipping lattes and posting your perfect little dinners on Instagram, I'm here, marking papers until midnight and wondering if it's too late to join a monastery.\"",

Like, what's the point of even having these things? It's not like it's going to make a difference in the grand scheme of things. The kids will still be kids, and their parents will still be clueless about what's really going on in our classrooms.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the expectations. They think we're supposed to be all smiles and rainbows, just because we're teachers. Newsflash: we're not superheroes. We're just trying to survive until retirement. But no, they expect us to be all enthusiastic and supportive, like we're some kind of miracle workers.\n\nIt's just so... draining. All those fake smiles and pointless small talk. I mean, what's the use? It's not like it's going to change anything. We're all just stuck in this never-ending cycle of boredom and frustration. Might as well just give up now and save ourselves the trouble.\n\nI guess what really gets my goat is when they ask me if I have time for myself. Like, are they kidding me? Of course, I don't have time for myself. I'm too busy dealing with their entitled kids and their ridiculous demands. Who has time for self-care when you're drowning in a sea of paperwork and bureaucratic red tape?\n\nYeah, just great. Another parents' evening. Can't wait to see what other \"treasures\" they bring to the table.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "In his cluttered kitchen, Chef \u00c9douard chopped onions with such vehemence that one might assume he was attempting to dice the very fabric of time itself. His eyes, reddened from more than just the alliums, glared at the photograph taped to the fridge - a snapshot of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Marcel, grinning like a Cheshire cat beside some fancy-schmancy critic who'd declared Marcel's cooking \"a symphony of flavors that dance on the tongue.\"\n\n\u00c9douard sneered. \"Dance indeed! More like a bloody conga line of clich\u00e9s!\" He hacked into another onion, its layers yielding as readily as \u00c9douard's jealousy. \"Thirty years I've spent in this heat, sweating over stoves, and now this...this boy wonder gets all the glory?\"\n\nHe paused, his reflection mocking him in the polished surface of his beloved copper pan. His once-dark hair now sported more silver than a Michelin-starred kitchen, and lines etched into his face told tales of years spent barking orders rather than receiving accolades.\n\n\"Damn it!\" \u00c9douard roared, flinging the knife onto the counter with enough force to make the photograph tremble. \"I should've opened my own bloody restaurant decades ago! Then I'd be the one getting praised, not that pretty little French boy!\"\n\nHis jealous rant was interrupted by a knock at the door. Marcel strolled in, cheeks flushed from the cold, holding aloft two bottles of wine like trophies. \"Look what I got today, Chef!\" he exclaimed, utterly oblivious to \u00c9douard's turmoil.\n\n\u00c9douard watched him, his jealousy boiling over like an untended sauce. \"Oh, marvelous,\" he muttered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"More plunder from the critic's cellar? Perhaps you should invite him over too, so we can all share in your triumph.\"\n\nMarcel blinked, taken aback by \u00c9douard's unusually caustic tone. But before he could respond, \u00c9douard stormed out, leaving nothing but the sharp scent of onions and the bitter taste of jealousy hanging in the air.",

I woke up late, spilled coffee all over my shirt, and to top it off, my boss yelled at me in front of the whole team. I mean, what even is wrong with these people?\n\nAs I walked into the office, I saw my coworker, Rachel, chatting with our new intern, Alex. They were laughing and smiling, and I just felt this overwhelming urge to tell them to shut up and leave me alone. Like, why do they get to have all the fun while I'm stuck dealing with this toxic work environment?\n\nBut no, instead of saying anything, I just stood there, seething. Because, let's be real, if I speak up, everyone will just think I'm being dramatic or sensitive. They'll probably even take sides against me, and I'll be left looking like the crazy one.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the email I got from HR. It's just another reminder that I'm not good enough, that I need to shape up or ship out. Like, seriously, can't they see that I'm trying my best here?\n\nI tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself it's just paranoia. But the truth is, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around here, waiting for someone to blow up in my face. And when that happens, I'll be the one who's left looking like a fool.\n\nI guess what really gets under my skin is that nobody ever asks me how I'm doing. Nobody ever checks in or offers any support. It's always about them, their problems, their drama. And I'm just expected to deal with it, to suck it up and move on.\n\nIt's like, hello, I'm a human being too, you know? I have feelings and emotions and needs. But no, instead of listening to me, they just talk over me, ignore me, or worse, dismiss me altogether.\n\nUgh, I don't know how much more of this I can take. Maybe I'll just start keeping a journal or something. That way, I can vent and process all my emotions in private. Yeah, that's exactly what I need \u2013 more secrets and more stress. Just peachy.<|eot_id|>"
