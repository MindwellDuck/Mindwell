Some idiot manager scheduled a clearance sale without telling anyone. Shelves are bare, customers are bitching, and here I am, stuck on register with no one to help. My blood's boiling, but what can I do? I'm just the old widow, ain't I?\n\nA woman storms up, demanding her discount on some overpriced perfume. \"It's not on sale!\" I bark back. She sneers, \"You're wrong, you stupid cow.\" I feel my face flush hot, but before I can tell her where to shove her fancy scent, she's stormed off.\n\nI slam the register shut. Fuck this.

It's just a pathetic attempt to make themselves feel better. And honestly, it's kind of annoying.\n\nI'm just so tired of all these entitled people who think the world revolves around them. Newsflash: it doesn't. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too old-fashioned, if I'm just too set in my ways. Maybe I should just retire and let the young folks handle everything.

She saw the photographs curling at the edges, their smiles fading like distant echoes.

And yet, as I gazed upon the ruins, I couldn't shake the conviction that this was merely another chapter in the never-ending saga of our lives.\n\nWe would rebuild, of course. We must.

It had been three years since the wreck that took Jake, and some days the grief still felt as fresh as the day she'd gotten the call.\n\nToday was one of those days. She could feel it, heavy and oppressive, like a storm rolling in. The lab, once her sanctuary, now felt cavernous and echoing, every corner whispering with memories of Jake's laughter, his eager questions, his quiet humming while he worked.\n\nShe glanced at the photo on her desk, Jake grinning back at her from some godforsaken desert, his eyes crinkling at the corners. Damn him for being so fucking happy, she thought bitterly. Damn him for leaving her here to rot in this empty shell of a life.\n\nA sudden pang of guilt shot through her. She loved Jake, still loved him, but Christ, some days it was hard not to resent him too. For leaving her alone with this gaping hole inside her. For taking away the future they'd planned together, all those dreams and plans now nothing but ashes in her mouth.\n\nEmma took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. She could feel the tears welling up, threatening to spill over. Not here, she told herself sternly. Not at work. But it was too late. A single tear slid down her cheek, followed by another, and another, until she was crying openly, silently, her shoulders shaking with the force of her grief.\n\nShe grabbed a handful of tissues from the box Jake's mom had given her, the one she'd brought over after the funeral, along with casseroles and hugs Emma hadn't known how to accept. She blew her nose loudly, wiping at her eyes until they were red and raw.\n\nFuck this, she thought angrily, crumpling the tissues in her fist. Fuck cancer, fuck Jake for dying, and fuck her for still being here, breathing and living when he was gone.\n\nShe took another deep breath, trying to calm herself. The lab was quiet around her, the hum of machinery a steady, soothing rhythm. She looked back at Jake's photo, his smile still bright and bold despite everything.\n\n\"I miss you,\" she whispered, tracing his face with her fingertip. \"Every fucking day.\"\n\nAnd then, because she couldn't hold it in any longer, she let out a wail that echoed through the lab, a primal sound of pain and loss and rage. It was raw and ugly and completely uncontrolled, and for just a moment, Emma felt a tiny spark of relief. Because even though Jake was gone, he'd left her with this - the ability to feel, to grieve, to scream until her throat was raw.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that was enough to keep going.

She was a master at creating vibrant worlds on canvas, but her personal life was more like a monochrome abstract - utterly indecipherable.\n\nShe had spent weeks working on her magnum opus, \"The Disillusioned Peacock,\" a piece so profound it would make Mother Teresa question her life choices. And then, the gallery called. They loved her work, oh they just adored it, but... they'd decided to go with someone else's exhibition this time around. Someone who didn't have quite as much 'emotional baggage' in their art.\n\nPenelope could almost hear the echo of their laughter as she hung up, like a chorus of hyenas mocking her for daring to dream.

She felt a surge of disappointment so intense it was almost tangible, like a physical weight pushing down on her chest.\n\nShe wanted to scream, to smash every canvas in sight, but all she could do was stand there, staring at her pitiful peacock, wondering if maybe they were right.

She grabbed the biggest bottle of wine she could find (which wasn't saying much, considering her studio apartment looked like a hurricane had hit an art supply store), popped open a sleeve of Oreos, and curled up on her couch with her peacock.\n\n\"Here's to you, bird,\" she said, raising her glass. \"May your feathers always be vibrant, even if mine are feeling a little... faded.\" And with that, she took a swig of wine, ate an Oreo, and tried not to think about how much she hated the taste of both.",

The remnants of their feast were strewn about like a battlefield, a stark reminder of my absence. As if that wasn't enough, they'd left a note: 'Saved some for you in the fridge - it's probably cold by now.' Cold indeed, much like our marriage.\"",

A 'good luck' card or something?\n\nTheir whole 'feast' was basically just a sad, pathetic attempt at cooking for one, and now it's just a mess. I mean, who eats that much alone? It's like they're trying to prove something \u2013 that I'm not worth sharing a plate with. And that note? Forget about it. It's just a cruel joke, a heartless reminder that I'm not even worthy of leftovers.\n\nI swear, sometimes I wonder how someone so clearly emotionally stunted can even call themselves a partner. Do they really think I'll just swoop in and save the day, or am I just expected to accept this as the new normal? Either way, I'm done. This relationship is toast.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "In the grimy, neon-lit newsroom, Jane, 49, was hunched over her desk, fingers dancing on the keyboard like a pianist playing a funeral march. Her inbox was overflowing with unopened emails, each one a potential landmine of bad news. She hadn't eaten since yesterday's stale doughnut, and the coffee was running through her veins like acid.\n\nThe phone rang, shattering her fragile concentration. It was the editor, barking orders about some goddamn politician's gaffe that had to be covered immediately. Jane felt a surge of annoyance. \"Can't anyone else take this fucking story?\" she snapped, but it was too late, he'd already hung up.\n\nShe grabbed her coat, shoving her notebook and recorder into her bag with more force than necessary. The rain was pouring outside, the kind that seemed to seep into your bones and make you feel even colder. She splashed through puddles towards the car, muttering curses under her breath.\n\nAs she reached for the door handle, she noticed it. A tiny scratch on the paintwork of her old, beloved sedan. It was barely visible in the dim light, but to Jane, it might as well have been a gaping wound. She felt a lump form in her throat, tears threatening to spill over.\n\n\"Fuck!\" she shouted into the empty parking lot, her voice echoing off the cold concrete walls. \"Just once, couldn't something go right?\"",

Like, what does he know? I've been putting in extra hours, trying to meet deadlines. But no, he still finds fault. And now, to top it all off, I spilled coffee all over my new shirt this morning. Can't even get a break around here.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on traffic. I'm stuck behind some idiot who can't seem to merge properly. I'm going to be late for my meeting, and I still need to finish this report. Why does this always happen to me? It's like the universe is out to get me.\n\nI glance at my watch, feeling a familiar sense of panic creeping in. I'm already running behind schedule. I need to hurry up and get moving if I want to make it on time. But first, I need to deal with this stupid parking ticket. I swear, they're just looking for ways to nickel-and-dime us. I'll just write them a nice letter and explain the situation... yeah, right. They'll never respond.\n\nI toss my keys onto the counter, ready to head out the door. As I grab my bag, I notice a small dent on the side panel. Great, just great. Now I've got another thing to worry about. This day just keeps getting better and better.<|eot_id|>"
