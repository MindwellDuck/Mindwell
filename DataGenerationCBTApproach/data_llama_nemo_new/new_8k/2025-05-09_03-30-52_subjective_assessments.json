He looks up from his magazine, eyes meeting those of a young woman holding her infant son. She smiles softly, cooing at the baby, who giggles in response. A warmth flickers in his chest for a moment before fading, leaving him with an emptiness that feels heavier than usual. The bell above the door chimes as she leaves, taking her laughter and light with her. He watches them go, then looks down at the empty ring finger on his left hand, feeling the familiar gnaw of hopelessness. It's been three years since he lost her, but some days, like today, it feels like just yesterday. He takes a deep breath, pushing away the urge to call out, to beg them not to leave him alone again in this vast, empty store that echoes with ghosts of their past. Instead, he stands tall, squares his shoulders, and waits for the next customer, counting down the minutes until closing time.",

That little kid was laughing and playing, completely carefree. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company. It's like the universe is conspiring against me.\n\nWhy did she even come in here today? Did she want to torture me further? I know she's probably got someone else now, someone who actually deserves her. Not me, stuck in this rut, unable to move on. I'll never find anyone like her. I'll just be stuck here forever, alone and unwanted.\n\nIt's not fair. Life shouldn't be so cruel. But hey, maybe if I just stand here long enough, someone will magically appear and fix everything.

They were clearly upset, and I should have anticipated that. It's not like I'm some kind of novice doctor who can't handle a simple phone call. But of course, the hospital would want to keep me in the dark, wouldn't they?\n\nWhen the patient spoke up, I tried my best to remain composed, but it's hard not to feel frustrated when someone is questioning your expertise.

You'd think that would earn me some respect around here.\n\nBut despite my best efforts, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.
