Her husband had been fixing their old car that morning, and the sudden silence of his tools echoed in her mind as she rushed to the room. The patient's heart rate was plummeting, and she couldn't find the emergency call button. Panic surged within her like a tidal wave, threatening to drown out her years of training.

And now, to think that he's probably sitting at home, oblivious to the chaos unfolding here, is just infuriating.\n\nThat beep in Room 307 was just another reminder of the countless times I've been put in harm's way by my colleagues' ineptitude. I've lost count of how many patients have suffered because of our hospital's lack of preparedness. The fact that I'm still standing after all these years is nothing short of a testament to my own resilience, but no one ever gives me the credit I deserve.\n\nMy training has always been impeccable, but do I get the recognition I need? No. All anyone cares about is the next crisis, the next code blue, the next disaster waiting to happen. They're too busy pointing fingers and assigning blame to notice the countless hours I've spent perfecting my craft. It's exhausting trying to keep up with their incompetence while also saving lives.\n\nAnd what really takes the cake is that I'm expected to remain calm and composed under pressure. Like I'm some kind of superhero who can single-handedly hold back the tide of incompetence that threatens to engulf us all. Newsflash: I'm not invincible. I'm tired, I'm frustrated, and I'm fed up with being taken for granted.<|eot_id|>"
