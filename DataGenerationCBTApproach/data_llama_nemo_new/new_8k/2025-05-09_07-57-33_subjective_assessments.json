Her heart ached as she struggled to hold him upright, feeling helpless against the weight of his grief and her own.",

I've got a job to do, and that's to enforce the law, not babysit your problems.\n\nAnd what really gets my blood boiling is that he looks so... familiar. Like we're old friends or something. I mean, I know I've seen him around before, but I don't know why. Maybe it's because we both look tired all the time. Yeah, that's it. Tired. Not because he's drowning his sorrows in cheap booze every night.\n\nAnyway, I had to drag him away from my car, literally. He was crying all over the place, and I couldn't just stand there and let him ruin my shift. So yeah, I arrested him. Again. Because someone's gotta keep the streets safe, right?\n\nNow I just need to fill out the paperwork and deal with the usual bureaucratic nonsense. Joy. Just peachy.<|eot_id|>"
