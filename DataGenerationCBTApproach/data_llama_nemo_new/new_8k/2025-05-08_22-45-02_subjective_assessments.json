It seemed like no matter how hard I worked, no matter how diligently I went about my day, I was still somehow destined to attract these kinds of problems.\n\nI glanced down at my watch, feeling a familiar knot of anxiety form in my stomach. Another late night, another unwelcome visitor waiting outside my doorstep. It was as if I had a magnet attached to me, drawing in all sorts of unwanted attention. And what did it say about me, really? That I was some kind of magnet for trouble? That I was somehow flawed, somehow broken?\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that settled over me. But it was hard to ignore the nagging sense that I was somehow responsible for this guy's behavior. Maybe I was the one who was attracting him, maybe I was the reason why he felt so drawn to me. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I quickened my pace, eager to get home and lock myself safely away from whatever darkness seemed to be closing in around me.<|eot_id|>"

We've faced down danger together, come out on top every time. But now, as I watch the doors shut behind us, I feel a sense of betrayal. Why did this have to happen to him? To us? It's not fair. We've given so much, sacrificed so much, and this is the thanks we get? A senseless, brutal reminder that even the best-laid plans can go awry. \n\nI force myself to take a step forward, to move towards the ambulance, but my legs feel heavy, uncoordinated. I'm stuck in place, unable to process the reality of the situation. This isn't how it's supposed to be. My partner, my brother, shouldn't be dying in front of me. He shouldn't be leaving me behind.
