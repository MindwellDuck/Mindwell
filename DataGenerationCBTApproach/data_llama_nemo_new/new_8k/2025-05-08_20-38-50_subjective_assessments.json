It's a big deal when you're the one who has to do everything around here. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just too much to handle. Maybe I should just give up and let them wallow in their sloth mode forever. But no, I'll just keep on doing everything myself because that's what partners are for, right?<|eot_id|>"

What if they were casing my property, waiting for the perfect moment to strike? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I found myself scrutinizing every detail of the surroundings. The shadows cast by the nearby trees appeared to be growing longer, as if they too were watching me.\n\nI began to mentally rehearse the worst-case scenario, anticipating the possibility of a break-in or worse. My mind racing, I wondered what would happen if I didn't secure my vehicle properly. Would I be putting myself and others at risk? The uncertainty gnawed at me, making it difficult to focus on anything else.\n\nAs I fumbled for my keys, my eyes kept drifting back to the spot where I had seen the suspicious figure. Was it just my imagination playing tricks on me, or did I genuinely sense a threat lurking in the darkness? The not knowing was suffocating, and I felt compelled to take drastic measures to ensure my safety.\n\nI decided to call the police, not because I suspected anything concrete, but because I wanted to be prepared for any eventuality. The mere act of reporting my concerns brought a sense of reassurance, even if it was fleeting.
