Don't they see how hurtful this is?\n\nThis isn't just about the party; it's about the principle. If he can't even be bothered to show up for one of the most important days of my life, then maybe we're not as close as I thought. I'm starting to wonder if he's been playing me all along.\n\nAnd another thing, what's with the cake cutting ceremony? Are they trying to rub it in my face?
