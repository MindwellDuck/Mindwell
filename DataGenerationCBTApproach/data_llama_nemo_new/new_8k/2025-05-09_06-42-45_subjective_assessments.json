It's from her ex-husband, asking if they can discuss selling their old house, now falling into disrepair. She feels a familiar pang of frustration; he'd been absent during their marriage, and now he expects her to drop everything to help him out.

Like, what if I do cave and end up getting pulled back into all this drama again? At least when we were married, I could just pretend like everything was fine and avoid the whole thing altogether. Now, with the kids involved, it's just too much stress. Ugh, why did I even agree to come home early today? Now I've got this mess to deal with...\n\nOkay, okay, I need to calm down and focus. I'll just write him a polite letter saying no, and that's it. But what if he doesn't take no for an answer? What if he shows up at my doorstep unannounced, expecting me to drop everything for him?
