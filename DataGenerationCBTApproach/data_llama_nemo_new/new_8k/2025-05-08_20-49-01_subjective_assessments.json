It's like she's trying to punish me or something.\n\nI swear, every time we try to reconnect, it ends in disaster. First, she was all smiles and apologies, promising to make amends, but then she just ghosted me again. This time it's even worse - she's not even bothering to pretend like everything's fine. Just a cold, formal letter telling me what I can do to fix things. Fix things? Like I'm some kind of magician?\n\nI feel so used, man. I've been supporting her since she was a kid, and this is how she repays me? By making my life harder? I don't know if I can keep doing this. Maybe it's time for me to take care of myself for once.
