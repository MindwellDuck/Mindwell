A condescending email from someone who thinks they're better than me just because they've made a few connections?\n\nMy heart sank when I saw his name on the subject line. Like, what does he even think he's doing? Trying to ride my coattails to success? Newsflash, buddy: I was the one pouring my heart and soul into those experiments. You were just along for the ride.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the tone of the email. All polite and fake, like he's trying to butter me up so I'll give him credit where credit is due. Please. I know exactly what he's after \u2013 validation, attention, and a pat on the back for being a mere mortal who happened to stumble upon something brilliant.\n\nBut you know what really gets my blood boiling? He has the nerve to call it \"groundbreaking\" work. Groundbreaking?! Ha! I was the one who spent years perfecting the technique, pouring over literature, and conducting countless experiments. He just showed up and took credit for my research.\n\nThis is just another example of how the world doesn't recognize true talent. It's all about who you know, not what you know. And I'm sick of it. Sick of being overlooked, sick of being underappreciated, and sick of being treated like dirt by people who think they're above me.\n\nSo, no, I won't be responding to his email. I won't be acknowledging his \"contribution.\" And I certainly won't be congratulating him on his latest \"publication.\" Because let's face it \u2013 he didn't do anything. He just rode my coattails to success, and now he's trying to reap the benefits. Well, not on my watch.<|eot_id|>"

But what if I missed something? What if there's some hidden flaw in the recipe that's going to make everyone hate our desserts? I'm starting to think that maybe we shouldn't have even bothered with the lavender. It was always a bit too finicky anyway.\n\nAnd now it's too late. We can't just go out and find some local supplier at this hour. They won't even have anything decent. This is a disaster. I feel like I've let everyone down - Marie, the staff, the guests... everyone. Why did I forget to check the order? Wasn't I supposed to do that already?\n\nThis is just great. Just what I needed. Another thing to worry about. Now I'm going to have to spend the rest of the day frantically trying to come up with a solution, while also dealing with the fallout from the gala. Joy.<|eot_id|>"
