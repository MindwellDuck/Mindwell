Nope.\n\nI saw Alex's post on social media about his promotion and I couldn't help but feel like I'm stuck in some kind of rut. Everyone else seems to be moving up while I'm just going nowhere. Even my sister got a new job offer last month and she's still younger than me. What am I doing wrong?\n\nI know I'm not perfect, but come on, I've always delivered quality work. And yet, here I am, losing my dream role. It's like I'm just not good enough. Maybe if I had more experience, I would have gotten the promotion instead of Alex.
