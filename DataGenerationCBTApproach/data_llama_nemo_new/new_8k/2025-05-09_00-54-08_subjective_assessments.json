Why can't she just take care of these little tasks?\n\nI pulled out my phone to order dinner, thinking it'd be easier this time. But as I glanced at the fridge, I saw that ridiculous magnet she insists on keeping. Our anniversary? Really? It's been years since we've even celebrated. And today's date is circled in red, like some kind of morbid joke. I shook my head, wondering how someone so forgetful could still manage to keep track of our special day.\n\nI ordered pizza anyway, figuring it's better than waiting around for her to come back.
