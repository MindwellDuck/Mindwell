Did they say something stupid?\n\nI get up, trying to play it cool, but my heart's racing like a jackrabbit. I walk into the room, and there she is, smiling like a possum, completely oblivious to the fact that I've been standing there for two minutes, seething like a cauldron. Just catching up, yeah right. With some dude who used to make eyes at her back in college? Please.\n\nI try to keep my cool, but inside, I'm dying. Dying. Like, I'm literally suffocating under the weight of my own inadequacy. Why does she get to have these moments, while I'm stuck in this rut? Why does she get to laugh and smile and live her best life, while I'm just stuck in this dead-end job, this miserable marriage? It's not fair, man. Not even close.\n\nAnd then I see the look on her face, and it's like a punch to the gut. She thinks I don't know, that I'm just some clueless husband who doesn't understand how the game is played. But I do. I know exactly how the game is played. And I'm losing. Big time.\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to shake off the anger, but it's no use. It's like a tidal wave crashing down on me, washing away all my rational thoughts and leaving me with nothing but a hollow, gnawing sense of despair. This isn't fair. None of it is fair.<|eot_id|>"
