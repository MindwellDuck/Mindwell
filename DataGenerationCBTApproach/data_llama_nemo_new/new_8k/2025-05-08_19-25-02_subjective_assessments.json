If they'd just followed my orders, none of this would have happened. The health inspector must think we're running some kind of filthy operation. I swear, I'm going to lose my mind if we get shut down tonight. How could this happen? We were supposed to be ready hours ago! It's all because of those lazy cooks and their lack of discipline. I need to go talk to them right now and give them a piece of my mind.\"\n\n---\n\nOr, in a more introspective tone:\n\n\"I keep thinking about how this is all my fault. If I had just yelled at them harder when they were slacking off, maybe they'd have gotten it together by now. But no, I let them slide, and now look what's happening. The health inspector is probably here because of me, and I don't know how I'm going to live with myself. What if I lost my job over this? What if I never worked in the industry again?

I know exactly why I didn't get the job. It's because I'm just not good enough. Those two must be thinking about me right now, wondering why I'm stuck in this dump while they're out living their best lives.\n\nIt's just so unfair.

Budget cuts, huh? They're cutting my hours by half. I'll barely have enough time to breathe, let alone do any actual work. What if I lose my job completely? What if I have to move back in with my parents? \n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. Every day feels like a struggle. What if I just quit and never come back?
