His eyes welled up as he asked if she was the officer who responded to his mother's call last week. She recognized him from the domestic disturbance report that ended with her arresting his father. The boy pulled out a crumpled letter, saying it was from his mom, thanking her for keeping them safe. As she took the letter, her hands trembled slightly, remembering the bruises on the woman's face and the fear in her eyes when they last met. She felt a pang of remorse, wondering if she'd done enough to protect them both.",
