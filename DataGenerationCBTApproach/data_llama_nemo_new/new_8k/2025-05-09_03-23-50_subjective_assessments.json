Everyone else looks so happy, but I know the truth. They're all just pretending to be friends, waiting for me to slip up so they can turn on me. And don't even get me started on my badge. It's just collecting dust, a symbol of everything I've accomplished for no one. No one remembers me anymore. I might as well just throw it away and forget about it.\n\nMy husband thinks he's doing me a favor by retiring early, but really, he's just abandoning me. He doesn't care about the sacrifices I made for him, for our family. All he cares about is his own comfort and happiness. And those kids...they're just taking advantage of us, using us for their own gain before they even leave the nest. I swear, sometimes I wonder how I ended up with such ungrateful people in my life.\n\nThis house is a prison, a constant reminder of all the things I've lost. Even the memories aren't mine anymore. They're all tainted by the fact that everyone else gets to move on while I'm stuck here, alone. I hate this place, I hate these people...I hate everything.<|eot_id|>"

And why did his things always seem so... put together? I glanced around my own room, taking in the scattered clothes and half-eaten pizza box. It was like I lived in a disaster zone compared to him. His neatness was almost... suffocating.\n\nI thought back to all the times we'd talked about our living arrangements. He'd mentioned how much he loved having a dedicated workspace, and how it helped him stay focused. Meanwhile, I'd been struggling to find a quiet corner in this chaotic apartment. It felt like he was somehow more deserving of order and organization than I was.\n\nAs I picked up the pen, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was somehow failing. Failing to keep my space clean, failing to be more organized, failing to be the partner he deserved. The thought stung, and I felt a lump form in my throat.
