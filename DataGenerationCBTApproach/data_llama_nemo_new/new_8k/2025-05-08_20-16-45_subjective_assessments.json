That's what she's been doing since we split - playing games with our child's emotions. It's so unfair. Why can't she just leave us alone?\n\nBut what really gets my blood boiling is that I had to waste my whole afternoon dealing with this nonsense. If she'd just kept our daughter safe, I wouldn't have had to spend my precious time checking up on her. This is all because of her recklessness and lack of responsibility.\n\nAnd another thing, who does she think she is, calling our house unannounced? Doesn't she know how stressful it is for our kid to come home to an empty house every day? It's like she doesn't care about anything except herself.<|eot_id|>"

Her face, pale as the sheets she lay upon, bore an expression he knew too well. He stepped closer, his heart pounding in sync with hers. It was Mrs. Thompson, his neighbor from years ago, now widowed and living alone. He'd seen her at the supermarket last week, her smile warm despite the winter's chill. But today, her eyes held a terror that mirrored his own silent fears. She reached out, trembling fingers grasping his arm. \"Promise me,\" she whispered, \"you won't let me die alone.\" His breath caught, the echo of his own divorce resonating in those words. He nodded, gripping her hand tightly as he prepared to fight for her life, and against the loneliness that threatened them both.",

I'm just glad I was able to get to the hospital fast enough to catch her before things got worse.\n\nAs we waited for the doctor, I couldn't help but think about how much my ex-wife used to worry about me when I was going through tough times. She always said I needed someone to take care of me, to make sure I didn't end up all alone like some kind of broken toy. And now, here I am, holding onto Mrs. Thompson's hand like it's the only thing keeping me from drowning in this sea of uncertainty.\n\nBut what really gets me is how quickly everyone else seemed to move on after my divorce. They'd all say stuff like, \"Oh, you're better off without her\" or \"You deserve someone who loves you more.\" Like, no, they don't get it. My ex-wife loved me, but she also left me. And now, I'm stuck here, fighting for Mrs. Thompson's life, wondering if anyone will ever truly love me back.\n\nIt's funny, though - I keep thinking about how Mrs. Thompson's story is basically mine. We're both alone, we're both scared, and we're both fighting for something we can barely hold onto. Maybe that's why I feel so connected to her, even though we've never met before. Maybe that's why I know exactly what she needs, exactly what she wants. Because, deep down, I know what it feels like to be completely, utterly lost.<|eot_id|>"
