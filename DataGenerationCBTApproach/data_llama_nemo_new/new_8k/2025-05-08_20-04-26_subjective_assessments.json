They're already making mistakes, and it's going to cost them dearly.\n\nI shook my head, feeling a wave of sadness wash over me.

No, I couldn't live with myself if I didn't say something. But what could I possibly say? That they're not good enough? That they'll never amount to anything?\n\nNo, I'd rather just sit here and watch, and hope that somehow, someway, they'll manage to figure it out on their own.
