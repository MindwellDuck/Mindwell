And now, she's just sitting there, oblivious to the fact that we're supposed to be celebrating something huge today. Unbelievable.

All these years, I've been putting up with her forgetfulness, and now I realize it's not just about forgetting anniversaries. It's about how she doesn't even bother to check if I'm okay when I call out to her. That's not love, that's just plain neglect. What's wrong with her? Is she even paying attention to our life together? I don't know how much more of this I can take.\"\n\n\"This is getting ridiculous. First, she forgets our anniversary, and now she's just sitting there, staring blankly at the screen like she's lost in space. Does she have any idea how hurtful this is? I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her, waiting for her to mess up again. And what really gets my blood boiling is that she never apologizes or makes an effort to fix things. It's like she thinks I'll just magically forgive her every time. Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart: I'm done playing nice.\"<|eot_id|>"

It's as if the very fabric of reality has torn apart, leaving me staring into the abyss.

Don't they understand that I need my solitude to concentrate?\n\nIt's not like I'm asking for much. A simple \"good evening\" or a brief explanation for their visit would have sufficed. But no, instead, they just waltz in, uninvited, and leave me feeling disrespected and ignored. I wonder if they even noticed me standing there, watching them from the shadows.\n\nPerhaps I should consider installing security cameras or motion-sensitive lights to deter such incidents in the future. After all, one can never be too careful these days. And maybe I'll take up gardening or something to keep myself occupied during those late-night hours. Anything to avoid the discomfort of being disturbed by people who seem to think they're above the law.\n\nIn any case, I'll make sure to adjust my schedule accordingly, taking into account the unpredictable nature of strangers and their blatant disregard for other people's time.

His eyes, those piercing orbs that had once held such promise, now seemed cold, calculating, and utterly devoid of humanity.
