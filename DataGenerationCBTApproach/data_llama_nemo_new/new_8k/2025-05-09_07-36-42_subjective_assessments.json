Nobody ever made him pay for what he did. The system failed us, plain and simple. If it wasn't for some lucky break, if it wasn't for some bureaucratic red tape, that kid would've been behind bars a long time ago. But no, instead, he gets to walk free, while we're stuck dealing with the consequences of his actions.\n\nIt's just not fair. It's not fair that he gets to live his life, while we're left to suffer. It's not fair that nobody ever took responsibility for what he did. It's not fair that... (sigh)...that I'm even thinking about this again. It's just so frustrating, so infuriating. Why can't justice be served? Why can't someone finally hold him accountable?\n\nI look at that kid, and I see a monster. I see someone who doesn't care about anyone but himself. Someone who thinks he's above the law. Well, let me tell you something, kid. You may have gotten away with it this time, but mark my words, justice will catch up with you eventually. And when it does, you'll wish you never crossed paths with me.<|eot_id|>"

As I stood there, frozen in grief, my thoughts drifted back to the countless memories we created within these walls. The tears that welled up in my eyes were a testament to the depth of my emotional pain.
