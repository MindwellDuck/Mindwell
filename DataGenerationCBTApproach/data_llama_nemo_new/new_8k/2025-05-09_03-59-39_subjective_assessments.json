A constant hum in the background, a nagging voice that refuses to quiet down. I'm a magnet for toxic relationships, a vessel for emotional turmoil. It's as if I have a sixth sense for attracting the most destructive forces life has to offer.\n\nWhy else would someone like him come into my life? Why else would I be drawn to the same patterns of abuse and neglect? I must be some kind of emotional black hole, sucking in all the darkness and spewing out nothing but heartache. It's a never-ending cycle, and I'm powerless to stop it.\n\nThose files are just a testament to my own ineptitude, a reflection of my inability to attract anything but misery. I'll probably end up stuck in this rut forever, reliving the same painful experiences over and over. Sigh. Just great.<|eot_id|>"

Her husband's side was still made, untouched since he'd left for the hospital two days ago, not expected home until Christmas. She looked at the empty chair by the window where his reading glasses usually lay. The house felt quieter than usual, emptier. She made her way to the kitchen, pausing at the photo of them on their wedding day - 50 years ago. Her reflection in the glass showed a woman with lines etched deeper than she remembered. She poured herself a cup of tea, now cold, and sat down at the table. The unopened letters from the hospital's legal team stared back at her, the words \"Wrongful Death\" visible through the envelope. She felt a familiar heaviness in her chest, a void that seemed to grow with each passing day. Hopelessness was her constant companion now, an unwelcome guest she couldn't evict.",

It's like he never left. I know he had to go to the hospital, but I thought he'd come back by now. Christmas is just around the corner, and I'm still waiting for him. \n\nI try to focus on the happy memories, but even those feel tainted now. Like, what's the point of looking at old photos when he's not here to share them with me? And these letters from the hospital...they're just a reminder of what could've been. Wrongful Death? That's just not something that happens to good people. We were meant to grow old together, not have some cruel twist of fate rip us apart.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm just being too sensitive, if I'm expecting too much. But what's wrong with wanting to hold onto the past, to cling to what we had? It's not like I'm asking for much. Just a little bit of comfort, a little bit of peace. Is that too much to ask?\n\nI guess I just wish things would go back to normal. You know, like they used to. When life was simple, and love was enough. But that's not happening, is it?
