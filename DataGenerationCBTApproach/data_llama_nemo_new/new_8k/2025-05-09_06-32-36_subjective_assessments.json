Get your own damn life together, neighbor! You're not the only one who has to deal with crap around here. And another thing, if they really cared about our relationship, they'd turn down the volume by now. But nope, they're too busy being oblivious to everyone else's problems.\n\nSeriously, can't they just keep it down for once? Is that too much to ask? Apparently so, because I swear, they have a personal vendetta against my ability to function. Well, let me tell you something, pal: I've had enough of your crap. Shut it down, or I'll lose my mind.

He throws it onto the couch in frustration, knocking over an empty whiskey glass. It rolls onto the floor with a hollow clink, echoing his own emptiness. He looks at himself in the mirror - dark circles, unkempt beard, clothes rumpled from wearing them all week. He turns away, unable to face his reflection any longer. The silence of his apartment mocks him, a stark contrast to the bustling newsroom where he used to thrive. Now, every story feels like another nail in the coffin of their failed relationship.

I'm the one who's been holding everything together around here, and now she's just walking away?\n\nI try to shake off these thoughts, but they keep creeping back in.
