The faint scent of disinfectant and the soft whir of machinery only serve to exacerbate my feelings of isolation and despair. I am a shell of my former self, unable to find solace in the familiar rhythms of the lab. His departure has forever altered the dynamics of this space, transforming it into a cold, unforgiving expanse devoid of warmth or camaraderie.\n\nEvery step I take down these corridors feels like a betrayal, a painful reminder of his irreconcilable absence.
