I pictured the fire department arriving to put out a blaze, or the police responding to a break-in, their sirens piercing the air. It was as if my brain was trying to prepare me for every possible disaster, no matter how unlikely.\n\nBut the questions kept coming, each one more dire than the last. What if I forgot to lock the door, allowing some unknown entity to slip inside? What if I left my laptop unattended, making me vulnerable to cyber attacks?
