She watched from the kitchen window as they clinked glasses, his hand casually touching her husband's arm. A familiar pang of jealousy tightened in her chest.

Instead, she turned off the lights and walked home alone.",

And now, with someone else by his side, it's like he's trying to rub it in my face.\n\nI try to remind myself that it's just a harmless social interaction, but it's hard not to take it personally. His hand brushing against hers, the way they're smiling at each other... it's all just so... intimate. I wonder if he even realizes how much it bothers me. Probably not. He never does.\n\nI've tried talking to him about it before, but he just brushes it off, tells me I'm overreacting. But I know what I saw. And I know how I feel. It's not just about the physical touch; it's about the fact that he's choosing to spend time with someone else when we could be together.\n\nI just wish he would take some responsibility for his actions. If he can't be bothered to make an effort to keep our relationship strong, then maybe he shouldn't be spending time with anyone else. Simple as that.<|eot_id|>"
