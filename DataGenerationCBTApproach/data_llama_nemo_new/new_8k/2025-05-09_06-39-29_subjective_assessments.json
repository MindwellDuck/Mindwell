His partner, unseen but felt in their shared home, had left a worn notebook open on his desk - a collection of memories from their late son's childhood. A faded photograph marked today's page: their boy, laughing, at a beach they'd visited years ago. He traced the image with a trembling finger, sorrow welling up as he remembered that long-forgotten joy.",

Newsflash, life doesn't stop because our kid died. We have to keep going, even if it kills us. And what's with this notebook, anyway? Is she trying to torture me with all these happy memories? It's like she thinks I need some kind of therapy session or something. Well, let me tell you, I don't need her pity. I can handle my emotions just fine, thank you very much. But no, instead she just leaves me these little \"gifts\" to remind me of everything I've lost. It's like she's trying to drive me crazy.<|eot_id|>"
