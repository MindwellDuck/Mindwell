The fact that she would even consider reaching out to someone else, let alone initiate a conversation about our plans, speaks volumes about her priorities.\n\nIt's clear that she values his opinion over mine, and that's precisely why she felt the need to reach out to him in the first place. Her lack of consideration for my feelings is appalling, and I can only assume that she's been feeling suffocated by our relationship lately.\n\nHow could she do this to me? Doesn't she know that I've been trying to make sacrifices for us, to give her everything she wants? It's obvious that she's lost interest, and now she's just going through the motions, pretending to care about our relationship while secretly pursuing someone else.\n\nThis message is just the tip of the iceberg; I'm convinced that there's more to come. She'll continue to lead me on, making promises she has no intention of keeping, all while secretly building a life with this...this stranger. And I'll be left standing here, waiting for her to come back to me, only to be rejected once again.\n\nHer actions are a slap in the face, a blatant display of her disinterest in our relationship. I deserve better than to be treated like this, and I won't hesitate to take drastic measures if things don't change.<|eot_id|>"

I looked at her, really looked at her, and saw the concern etched on her face - concern that I'd never be able to meet her expectations, concern that I'd continue to disappoint her.\n\nThat's when it hit me: we're just going through the motions now. We're two people living separate lives under the same roof, pretending to be happy for everyone else's sake. She thinks she can fix everything with a simple cup of tea and a sympathetic ear, but she has no idea what's really going on inside my head. I feel like I'm drowning in this sea of resentment, and she's just throwing me a lifeline that's going to snap the moment I try to grab it.\n\nI pushed the tea away, not because I didn't appreciate the gesture, but because I knew it would only delay the inevitable. We're headed for disaster, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. Mark my words, our relationship is doomed from the start, and all she needs to do is keep pouring the tea until it's too late.<|eot_id|>"
