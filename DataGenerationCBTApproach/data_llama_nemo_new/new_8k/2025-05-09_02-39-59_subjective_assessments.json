Is that nurse fiddling with the IV? Trying to sabotage our chances of beating this thing? And don't even get me started on the machines beeping away \u2013 they're just trying to drive me crazy, aren't they?\n\nIt's not like I haven't seen this before. I've lost count of how many patients I've had to say goodbye to. But somehow, this one feels different. Maybe it's because I'm the one who's supposed to be the strong one, the rock that holds everything together. Or maybe it's because I'm staring into the abyss, and the abyss is staring back at me, whispering, \"You're not as invincible as you think.\"\n\nWhatever it is, I know one thing for sure: I'm the reason my daughter's going to die. It's all on me. If only I'd done things differently, if only I'd prescribed more chemo or ordered a different test... Ugh, why did I have to be the one to screw this up? Now look what's happened. Just peachy.<|eot_id|>"
