They look like they're moving, like they're trying to tell me something. I'm starting to think this place is haunted or something.\n\nI need to get out of here, but I don't want to leave my art behind. It's like it's calling to me, warning me away. But what if it's not just my imagination? What if something really is going on? I'm seriously considering calling the cops, but what if they just think I'm crazy?\n\nThis is getting ridiculous. I need to calm down, but I just can't shake off this feeling. It's like my gut is telling me something, and I'm listening. Yeah, I'm definitely going to stay here until morning.

But, alas, the respite was short-lived, for the envelope's presence continued to haunt me, its malevolent influence casting a pall over my otherwise tranquil morning.\n\nWhy must this constant reminder of our fractured relationship continue to plague me? Can't she see that I've moved on, that the wounds have long since healed? And yet, the ache within persists, a gnawing sense of guilt that refuses to subside. I am tormented by the notion that my actions, or rather, my inactions, may have contributed to the chasm that now separates us.

How can we trust those who so callously disregard the well-being of others? It's clear that his brand of dishonesty is endemic, infecting every aspect of our lives.\n\nAs I watched him effortlessly swindle an elderly woman out of her hard-earned pension, I was struck by the realization that such individuals are the norm, rather than the exception.
