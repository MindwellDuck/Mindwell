My mom calls, asking when I'm getting married, when I have kids... like I haven't thought about those things a million times already. And don't even get me started on social media. Everyone's posting these perfect little updates about their lives, while I'm over here feeling like a complete loser.\n\nFive years gone and I still can't escape the guilt.
