And don't even get me started on how he looks now. All worn out and faded like our relationship. It's like he's trying to make me feel guilty or something.\n\nWhy did I ever think we were happy? We were never happy. He was always off doing his own thing, leaving me to deal with everything on my own. And now look at us - a shadow of what we used to be. I'm surprised he didn't leave me sooner.\n\nI guess some people just can't let go of the past. Like, hello, I've moved on. I've got better things to do than dwell on old memories. But no, he's still stuck in the past, reliving all the good times like they're still relevant. Newsflash, buddy: they're not.\n\nAnd another thing, why does he get to decide what's important? Why does he get to choose which memories to keep and which ones to throw away? Doesn't he realize that I have memories too? Memories that aren't just about him and his stupid smile.\n\nIt's just so...so...infuriating. How can someone be so oblivious to the fact that their actions (or lack thereof) have consequences? I mean, seriously, if he really cared about me, he'd be here with me now, not stuck in the past, reminiscing about the good old days.\n\nBut no, instead, he's just a relic of the past, clinging to his precious memories like they're the only thing that matters. Well, let me tell you, they don't. Not anymore.<|eot_id|>"

She poured herself a cup, the familiar aroma doing little to lift her spirits as it once did.

The silence was heavy, echoing with memories of laughter and bustling mornings that seemed like distant dreams. Today was her first day back at work since the holidays, and the thought of facing the cheerful chatter of customers felt overwhelming.

I mean, come on, can't he see that I'm over here dying inside?\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is that I know exactly what he's thinking. He's thinking, \"Oh, poor baby, she's feeling down today.\" Yeah, right. He's thinking, \"Good riddance, I've got a meeting to get to and I don't want to be late.\" That's what he's thinking.
