No one questioned my motives or raised an eyebrow at my frequent absences. And now, suddenly, I'm the one who's supposed to be the pariah?\n\nIt's just not right. I demand answers. Who could have written such a scurrilous letter? And why now? Is it some kind of twisted revenge? I'll get to the bottom of this, mark my words. I'll find out who's behind this dastardly plot and make them pay.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll just have to suffer through the indignity of having my reputation tarnished by these baseless accusations.
