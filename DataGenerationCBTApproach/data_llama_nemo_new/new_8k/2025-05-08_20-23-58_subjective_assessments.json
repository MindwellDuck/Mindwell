I find myself wondering if perhaps I'm simply not cut out for this line of work, if my contributions are merely a pale imitation of Sarah's brilliance.\n\nIt's almost as if I'm trapped in some sort of cruel joke, where every step forward is met with two steps back. My mind reels at the prospect of being surpassed by someone so clearly superior. And yet, despite the gnawing sense of despair, I remain steadfastly convinced that I possess the intellect and drive necessary to succeed.
