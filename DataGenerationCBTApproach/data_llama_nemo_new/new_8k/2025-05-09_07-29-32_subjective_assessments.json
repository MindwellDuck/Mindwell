It's like, I know we haven't been spending as much time together lately, but come on, can't she give me some credit for trying? I mean, I'm working my butt off over here, and she's just sitting around waiting for me to magically appear.\n\nAnd now she's got the nerve to ask if we can talk, like I'm just gonna drop everything and pick up the phone. No thanks. I've got better things to do than indulge in some pointless conversation. Besides, what's there to talk about anyway? We both know where we stand. She's mad, I'm stressed, and we're both just trying to make ends meet.\n\nSo, no, I won't be picking up the phone. And yeah, maybe I'll just go ahead and ignore her email too.
