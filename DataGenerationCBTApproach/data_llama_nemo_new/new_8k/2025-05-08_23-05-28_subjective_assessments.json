His father's legacy, the recipes they'd created together, all disappearing.\n\nHe felt a profound sense of loss wash over him, drowning him in despair. The kitchen, once his sanctuary, now seemed like a cold, empty echo chamber. He looked around at the stainless steel surfaces, devoid of life and warmth.
