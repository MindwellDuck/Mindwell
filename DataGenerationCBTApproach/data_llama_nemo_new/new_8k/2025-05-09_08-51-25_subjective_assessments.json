I thought we were supposed to be a team, but I guess I was wrong. You're just like everyone else - completely uncaring and irresponsible.\n\nI'm telling you right now, I'm never going back to this doctor again. Never.

But no, instead I just sit here at my desk, feeling like a complete failure.\n\nIt's not just Timmy, though. I think about all the other kids in my class, the ones who seem to be doing okay, but are probably secretly struggling too. We're all just stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, and I don't know how to break free. Sometimes I wonder if anyone will even notice when I finally give up. Will they care? Probably not.
