What if it's someone who knows exactly where I am?\n\nAnd have you ever noticed how quiet it gets when you're working late at night? It's like the whole city is holding its breath, waiting for...I don't know, something to happen. My gut's been telling me all night that something's off, and now I'm starting to think it might be true. I've got this feeling, this sense of unease that just won't go away. I keep thinking about all the times I've seen weird stuff on the streets, all the times I've had to deal with people who just didn't seem right. Now I'm wondering if it's all connected.\n\nI know some guys would say I'm overreacting, that I'm just spooked because I'm working late. But I'm telling you, I can feel it. This place feels like it's watching me, waiting for me to slip up so they can pounce. And I'm not going to let that happen. I'll stay vigilant, no matter what. Because when your instincts tell you something's wrong, you listen. You trust your gut. And mine's screaming at me to get out of here before it's too late.<|eot_id|>"

They have to take it out on me, like I'm some kind of personal failing.\n\n\"You're slower than my grandma with arthritis,\" they sneer, their voice dripping with venom.

I'm already running late, and if I don't hurry up, I'll never make it to my next appointment on time.\n\nBut why bother trying to explain? It's not like anyone would understand. They'd just think I'm incompetent, anyway. And besides, what's the point of apologizing when they're just going to find fault with something else? No, I'll just keep my head down and get back to work, even though it's clear no one appreciates my efforts.\n\nAs I watch the customer storm off, I notice the other patrons staring at me, their faces a mixture of curiosity and disdain. I wonder if they're thinking what I am - that I'm a failure, a disappointment to everyone around me. Maybe I should just quit now, before things get any worse. But where would I go? I need this job, no matter how miserable it makes me feel.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of frustration and despair, with no escape in sight.
