He probably just orders at every restaurant and thinks he's some kind of food expert. Newsflash: you don't become a food critic by actually tasting food. You just sit there and write stuff down based on what your friends tell you.\n\nAnd another thing, why do these critics always have to be so harsh? Can't they just give a little constructive feedback like normal people? No, instead they have to go out of their way to tear someone down. It's like they're trying to make themselves feel better by putting others down.\n\nThis guy's review is just a perfect example of that. He's got no idea what he's talking about, but he's going to try to make me look bad anyway. Like, seriously, who writes a review like that? It's just a bunch of hate speech. And now I'm going to have to deal with all the other haters who are going to come crawling out of the woodwork because of one guy's opinion.\n\nYou know, I swear, some people just have no respect for hard work. They think they can just sit back and criticize someone else's life without putting in any effort themselves. Well, let me tell you something, buddy: if you want to talk trash, you'd better be ready to put in the work yourself. Otherwise, just stick to eating at McDonald's or whatever it is you eat.\n\nI'm telling you, this review is just a symptom of a bigger problem. There are too many people out there who think they can just speak their minds without thinking about how their words affect others. Well, I've got news for them: we're not all made of glass. We can take a little criticism, unlike some people who seem to need a participation trophy just for showing up.<|eot_id|>"

Who needs all that drama anyway? What if I just quit and left everything behind? At least then I wouldn't have to deal with the stress of this job anymore.\n\nBut no, I'll probably just end up broke and alone, living in some dingy apartment with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company.

It's like, stop it, brain! Just shut up already! But it won't listen. It just keeps spinning out worst-case scenarios until I feel like I'm going to throw up.\n\nWhy do I always seem to attract all the bad luck? What if I'm cursed or something?!
