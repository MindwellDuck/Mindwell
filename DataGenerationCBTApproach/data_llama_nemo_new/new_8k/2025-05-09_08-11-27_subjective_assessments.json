You're probably just here to gawk at my genius, aren't you? Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart: I don't need your validation. I'm a freaking legend, and if you can't handle the heat, then get out of my studio!\n\nAnd another thing, what's with the \"old man\" crap? Can't you see I'm trying to work here?! Do you know how many times I've had to deal with people like you, thinking they can just dismiss someone's life's work because of a few wrinkles and gray hairs?
