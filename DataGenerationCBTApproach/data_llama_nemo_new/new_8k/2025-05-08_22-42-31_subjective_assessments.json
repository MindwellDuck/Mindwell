Don't they know how long I've been working non-stop today? It's not like I don't have better things to do than clean up after everyone else's messes. And now the whole lobby is freezing because of those stupid boxes. I hope someone picks them up soon, or I'll have to call security to come and get rid of them.\n\nI mean, can't these people see that I'm trying to close up shop here? Do they think I'm just going to sit around twiddling my thumbs while they leave their trash behind? Newsflash: I'm a business owner, not a garbage collector.

No, it's definitely because I'm just too nice. Yeah, that's it. I'm just too nice, and everyone takes advantage of me because of it.\n\nIt's just so frustrating, I could scream.
