He looked around at the dusty corners and bare walls, wondering where all their plans for decorating had gone. A single white rose lay wilting in a vase on the kitchen counter, its petals falling like tears onto the yellowed post-it note it had arrived with: \"For you, from me.\" His eyes stung as he remembered her smile when she gave it to him yesterday. Now it was just another reminder of how quickly joy could fade into melancholy.",

I mean, who sends a wilted flower with a sad note? She must've been having a bad day or something. Or maybe she's just not feeling it anymore. Yeah, that's it. We're just not meant to be happy together.\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who cares about this relationship. Everyone else seems to think we're fine, but I know better. They don't see the cracks, the tiny little fissures that are slowly spreading through our marriage. And honestly, I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth fixing them.\n\nBut hey, what do I know?

There is no middle ground; she is either a reckless amateur or a malicious saboteur. I fail to see how anyone could have been so grossly incompetent as to cause such destruction, yet simultaneously manage to conceal it so effectively.\n\nHer colleagues seem to be taking this opportunity to praise her \"innovative\" approach to experimentation, but I know the truth. This was a calculated move to undermine our research and discredit me by association. It's clear that some individuals will stop at nothing to achieve their own selfish goals, even if it means destroying the work of others.\n\nIn light of this incident, I must reevaluate my entire working relationship with my colleague. If she cannot be trusted to follow even the most basic protocols, then perhaps it would be best if we worked separately from now on.
