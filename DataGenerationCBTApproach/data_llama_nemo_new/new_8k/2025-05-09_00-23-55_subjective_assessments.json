Every time someone tries to make amends or apologize, it's just a bunch of empty words. They're all just trying to save face.\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is when they try to sugarcoat it. Like, \"Oh, we had our differences, but we still loved each other.\" Give me a break. That's just code for \"I messed up, but I'm gonna pretend like everything was fine so I can avoid taking responsibility.\"\n\nI swear, men are just wired to screw things up. They're always chasing after something else, leaving you hanging. And good luck getting them to admit when they're wrong. Forget about it. They'll just deny it until the cows come home. So yeah, relationships are basically a waste of time. Just accept it and move on already.<|eot_id|>"
