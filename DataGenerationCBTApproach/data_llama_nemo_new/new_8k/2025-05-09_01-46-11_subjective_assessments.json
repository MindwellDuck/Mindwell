She's always been so disorganized, leaving things scattered all over the place. It's no wonder our marriage ended up like that - a mess. I swear, she never put anything away properly, not even back then. And now, here we are, years later, and this old cookbook has become a relic of our failed life together.\n\nI shake my head, trying to clear the memories that flood my mind. But they linger, reminding me of all the times she let things slide. The dirty dishes piled up, the laundry never got folded... it was like she expected someone else to clean up after her. And I fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.\n\nI glance around the empty kitchen, feeling a sense of unease wash over me. This is what happens when you let someone else dictate your life. You end up losing yourself in the process. I try to push the thoughts aside, but they're hard to shake. My ex-wife may have left, but the damage remains. And now, as I stand here, surrounded by the remnants of our failed marriage, I'm reminded of all the ways she failed me.\n\nThe silence in the kitchen feels oppressive, weighing heavily on my shoulders. I can almost hear her voice, whispering excuses and justifications for why things didn't work out between us. But I know the truth. It wasn't her fault; it was mine for putting up with it for so long. Now, as I gaze at the faded photograph, I'm left wondering what could've been if only she'd taken more responsibility for herself, and for us.<|eot_id|>"

I know she's been stressed out lately, but come on, can't she even remember one little thing?\n\nI'm starting to think she's just not that into me anymore. Maybe she's been feeling suffocated by all the pressure to produce art and just needed some space. But honestly, it feels like she's just making excuses to avoid us. I've tried talking to her about this before, but she always brushes it off and says I'm being too sensitive.\n\nIt's not fair that I have to deal with this all by myself. She's always leaving me hanging, never giving me any real answers or reassurance. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her, waiting for her to blow up at me next. And now, on top of everything else, she's forgotten our anniversary. Unbelievable.\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take.
