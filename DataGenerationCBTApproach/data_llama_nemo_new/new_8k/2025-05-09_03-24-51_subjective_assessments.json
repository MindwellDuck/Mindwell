But do I? No, of course not. I'm far too dignified for such petty displays of emotion. Instead, I'll just sit here, quietly seething, as he continues to indulge in his digital dalliances.\n\nWhat's truly astonishing is how effortlessly he navigates this minefield of unspoken feelings, never once acknowledging the elephant in the room. His eyes darting towards the screen, his fingers drumming a staccato beat on the table \u2013 it's almost as if he's trying to will himself away from the inevitable confrontation that looms on the horizon.\n\nAnd yet, despite my better judgment, I find myself fixated on the worst-case scenario.
