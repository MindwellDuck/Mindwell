I mean, what did they expect? My readers loved me, and I was the one who made this place worth coming to.\n\nAs I left the office, I caught a glimpse of those interns over there, and I swear they were all thinking the same thing - \"Good riddance.\" They were probably thrilled to have someone else take my spot, and I couldn't blame them. I mean, let's be real, my columns weren't exactly... shall we say, \"lifestyle-friendly.\"\n\nBut what really got under my skin was when I saw Sarah from HR walking around the office, smiling at everyone like she owned the place. I'm pretty sure she was gloating about how much money they saved by cutting my column. And don't even get me started on Tom from marketing - I'm sure he was already brainstorming ways to replace me with some younger, trendier writer.\n\nIt's just so unfair, though. I've been doing this job for years, and I know exactly what our readers want. But I guess no one listened to me anymore. Oh well, I'll just have to find another outlet for my talents.

They're just collecting dust because they remind him of all the beautiful things we could've created together. \n\nI mean, what's the point of even trying to paint now? It's not like anything I create will ever be as vibrant and alive as our love was. He took that away from me, and nothing will ever bring it back. I'll just stick to holding onto these brushes, reminding myself of what we had. Maybe someday I'll find the strength to pick up a new brush, but until then, I need these old ones by my side.\n\nI don't see why anyone would think otherwise. We both knew where this was headed. He's always been distant, and I was too blind to see it. Now that it's over, I can finally acknowledge the truth. Our love was never meant to last, and I'm better off without him.
