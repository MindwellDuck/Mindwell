I glanced around, noticing the sympathetic glances from Sarah and Michael, but even their support felt like a distant hum compared to the sting of John's words.\n\nAs I left the meeting, I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't good enough. That somehow, someway, I'm just not cut out for this. It's not fair, and it's definitely not true. But the doubt crept in, whispering that maybe, just maybe, I am indeed inferior. And that thought sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nI keep thinking back to all the late nights, early mornings, and weekends spent working on this project. All the sacrifices I made, all the times I doubted myself. And now, it feels like it was all for nothing. Like I'm just not worthy of recognition or respect.
