His colleague, ten years younger and recently promoted, leans over to show him a photo on his phone - a Caribbean beach backdrop with a caption reading \"Celebrating another record-breaking quarter! #workhardplayhard\".

It was almost as if Jake had deliberately chosen this moment to flaunt his success, to rub it in my face like a badge of honor. The forced smile, the gleam in his eye \u2013 all seemed calculated to make me feel inferior. I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets he might be hiding behind that charming facade. Was he secretly sabotaging our team's projects? Did he have ulterior motives for his rapid ascent up the corporate ladder?\n\nThe caption itself seemed almost mocking, a cruel reminder of my own stagnation. \"Work hard, play hard\" indeed. Who needs work when one can coast on the coattails of others? I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that Jake's promotion must have been a direct result of his willingness to step on toes, to crush those beneath him in pursuit of power.\n\nAnd yet, despite the nagging doubts, I managed to muster a polite smile and offer my congratulations. After all, one must maintain a veneer of professionalism, even in the face of such blatant arrogance. But deep down, I knew the truth \u2013 that Jake's success was built on the backs of others, and that our team's future hung precariously in the balance.<|eot_id|>"

The way their faces leaned in unison, scrutinizing the very piece I had poured my heart and soul into. Weeks of dedication, countless hours of toil, and yet, it seemed to hold little significance for her.\n\nHer attention was elsewhere, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment. It wasn't just the fact that she wasn't acknowledging my artwork; it was the manner in which she was engaging with him. Their heads were so close, their conversation hushed and intimate. I found myself wondering if there was something more to their interaction than met the eye.\n\nWasn't she simply being polite? Did she genuinely appreciate my work, or was this some sort of courtesy? The thought sent a twinge of unease through me. Why would she choose to spend her time with someone else when she could have been discussing my art? The questions swirled in my mind, refusing to settle.\n\nIt's not as though I'm expecting special treatment or anything. I merely wish she would acknowledge the effort I put into creating something worthy of recognition. Is that too much to ask?
