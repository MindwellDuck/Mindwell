I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease, but it lingered, like a shadow following me everywhere.\n\nI glanced around the room again, searching for someone, anyone, who could tell me what was going on. Maybe if I asked the right questions, they'd finally understand why things feel so out of control. But everyone seemed to be avoiding eye contact, like they were hiding secrets. Secrets that I couldn't quite put my finger on.\n\nIt's funny how quickly things can change.
