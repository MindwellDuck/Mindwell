Maybe she'd still be here, and we could've worked through our issues. But no, that's not how life works, right? People do what they want, and we're just left to deal with the fallout.\n\nIt's so frustrating, because I feel like I'm doing everything right. I'm there for her when she needs me, I'm supporting her, I'm trying to help. But does anyone appreciate it? No, instead they just leave me hanging, like I'm not even worth the effort.\n\nI guess that's just the way it goes sometimes. You can't control how others behave, but you can try to control your own reactions. So, I'll just put on a brave face and deal with it. But honestly, it hurts.<|eot_id|>"
