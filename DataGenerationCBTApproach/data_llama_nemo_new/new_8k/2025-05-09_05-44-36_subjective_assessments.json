My friends are all out living it up, getting paid to do something they love, and I'm over here stuck in this dead-end job. It's like I'm just not good enough. The thought of those guys out there, laughing and joking with each other, makes me want to scream.\n\nWhy can't I just catch a break? Why does everything always fall apart for me? I try to shake off the feeling of inadequacy, but it's hard when all I see are reminders of what I don't have. Even my own apartment feels like a prison, a constant reminder of my isolation.\n\nI take another sip of my cold coffee, feeling like I'm drowning in my own misery. Why can't I just be one of them?
