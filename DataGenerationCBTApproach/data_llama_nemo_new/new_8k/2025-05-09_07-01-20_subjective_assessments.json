She felt the familiar resentment bubble up inside her as he carelessly tucked his receipt into his pocket without even glancing at it. He was one of many who didn't know the value of hard work, of earning a living, of waiting patiently behind the counter every day until closing time. As she handed him his bag with a tight smile, she couldn't help but think, \"It's not fair. I've worked so much harder than you ever will.\"",

The ones who don't bother to count their change or even glance at their receipts? What if they're all secretly plotting against us, taking advantage of our kindness and generosity? What if we're just pawns in their game, forced to wait in line after line while they swoop in and out, leaving us to deal with the consequences?\n\nI thought about my own life, working tirelessly for years, pouring my heart and soul into every transaction. What if no one appreciates me? What if my efforts go unnoticed, my dedication unvalued? What if I'm just a cog in a machine, a replaceable part, destined to be discarded when I'm no longer useful?\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more my anxiety grew. What if this young man's careless behavior sets a precedent for future generations? What if we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of entitlement and disrespect? What if... what if... what if...\n\nMy mind was racing, conjuring up worst-case scenarios, each one more terrifying than the last.

That coffee mug, once a symbol of our morning rituals, now seemed like a cruel mockery, a reminder of the emptiness that would soon consume us both.

He must have known, he must have seen the desperation in my eyes, the desperation that drove him to abandon ship. It's not like he could have possibly thought I wouldn't notice, couldn't have possibly expected me to remain oblivious to the inevitable. But of course, he did. Because what choice does a man have when faced with a woman as intelligent and perceptive as myself? Clearly, this was no accident; he had planned it meticulously, leaving me to pick up the pieces of a shattered heart.
