My hands trembled as I fumbled through my notes, searching for the words to offer some semblance of comfort.\n\nBut what could I possibly say? That I had done everything in my power to save him? That I had poured every ounce of skill and expertise into his care? It was all just empty platitudes now, hollow reassurances in the face of such unyielding grief. I thought back to all those sleepless nights, all those long hours spent poring over medical texts, searching for a miracle cure. And yet, here I was, standing in front of this woman, feeling utterly inadequate.\n\nShe spoke of Dr. A., of the promises he had made, of the failures I had committed. Her words cut deep, a knife slicing through the fragile veneer of my confidence. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of self-doubt, unable to escape the crushing weight of my own inadequacy. How could I have been so blind? So foolish? I thought I had given my best, but it seemed it wasn't enough.\n\nHer eyes locked onto mine, filled with a mixture of anger and sorrow. I knew I deserved it. I had let her down, just as I had let so many others down. The shame washed over me like a tidal wave, threatening to consume me whole. I felt like I was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch me if I fell.<|eot_id|>"

And now, with no word from him, I felt like I was truly alone. The thought of all those times he'd left me behind, never checking in or letting me know he was safe, was suffocating me.
