They're all just pretending to be cool with it, but trust me, they're seething. It's like, hello, did you guys notice how he basically stole my job and left me high and dry? Did you see how he got promoted while I was still trying to pick up the pieces?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that stupid ring. Who does he think he is, rubbing it in my face like that? Like, seriously, couldn't he have at least gotten me a decent raise or something? No, instead he had to go and buy some gaudy diamond just to prove a point. Well, let me tell you, it's not going to work. I'm not impressed. \n\nI need to get out of here before things escalate further. This whole scene is giving me major anxiety.
