Can't even look at it without feeling like crap.\n\nI swear, every time I walk past that park, it's like reliving the worst memories. The laughter, the sunshine, the whole thing is just a sick joke. Either I'm stuck in this godforsaken town forever, missing her, or I can just forget about her and move on. There's no middle ground, no happy medium. It's all or nothing.\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is that everyone else seems so oblivious to it all. They're just strolling along, enjoying the day, while I'm over here drowning in my own misery.

The way she cut off my explanation mid-sentence, her voice rising in indignation, left me feeling like I was under scrutiny.\n\n\"I simply don't understand,\" she said, her words dripping with accusation. \"My child is an exceptional talent, and it's clear that the panel must have been blind to her abilities.\" Her eyes seemed to bore into mine, as if daring me to contradict her. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I struggled to maintain my composure.\n\nIt's almost as if she can read my mind, I thought to myself, her expression a perfect mirror of my own frustration. Did she really think that I would somehow conspire against her child? The absurdity of the situation hit me like a ton of bricks, yet I couldn't shake the feeling that she genuinely believed this.\n\nAs we continued to discuss the matter, I found myself growing increasingly defensive, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. What if she discovered some hidden truth about the audition process? What if I had inadvertently wronged her child? The more she spoke, the more I became convinced that she knew something I didn't \u2013 that there was more to the story than met the eye.\n\nBut deep down, I knew I was just being paranoid.
