I feel like I'm losing them all over again, like when my daughter left for college. I thought we were closer than that.\n\nI wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that I didn't post as many pictures of my grandkids lately. Maybe they felt neglected or something. I know I've been busy with work, but I always make time for them...don't I?\n\nThis can't be happening. We're a family. We're supposed to stick together.
