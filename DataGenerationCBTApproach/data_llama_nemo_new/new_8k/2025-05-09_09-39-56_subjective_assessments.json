Doesn't she know how much I rely on that first cup to get going?\n\nAnd now, looking at her favorite mug sitting idle in the cupboard, I'm reminded of all the little things she used to do that made our life together so effortless. She'd always make sure the coffee was ready, and the toast was toasted just so. It's almost as if she vanished into thin air, leaving me to navigate this new reality without her.\n\nI try to shake off these thoughts, telling myself that grief is a process, and it takes time. But honestly, it feels like she should still be here, making everything right again. If only she had been more considerate, more attentive to my needs... perhaps she wouldn't have left us so suddenly. The thought sends a pang through me, but I push it aside, focusing instead on the mundane tasks ahead.\n\nIt's just that, sometimes, I find myself wondering why things don't seem to work out the way we want them to. Why can't life be more predictable, more straightforward? But I suppose that's just the way it goes sometimes. We're all just trying to figure it out as we go along.<|eot_id|>"
