But no, instead you just go ahead and pour yourself another glass, like we're still in that whole \"we're a team\" phase of our marriage. Well, let me tell you something, buddy: those days are long gone. Now it's every man for himself around here. And by the way, can you please stop staring at me like you're trying to figure out why I'm so upset? Like, I'm not exactly broadcasting my emotions for you to pick up on.
