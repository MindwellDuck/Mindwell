My whole career has been a lie. I must have been born with a racist bone in my body or something. \n\nAnd what really gets me is that I know I'm better than this. I'm a good person, I just... have a problem. Yeah, that's it. A problem. Not a deep-seated prejudice or anything. Just a little \"issue\" that needs to be worked out. \n\nBut seriously, who does this guy think he is? Pulling me over like I'm some kind of suspect just because of my skin color? Please. I've seen more suspicious behavior from my own family members. At least they don't have the nerve to pretend like they're above the law. \n\nI guess I'll just have to live with the fact that I'm a racist cop. Joy. Can't wait to tell my wife about this.
