It's not like I'm expecting him to be perfect; however, this lack of effort is starting to wear me down. His tardiness is becoming increasingly unacceptable, and I'm beginning to wonder if he's even committed to our marriage anymore. \n\nIt's not about the socks or the unmade bed; it's about the underlying issues that need to be addressed. But every time I bring it up, he just brushes it off, leaving me feeling frustrated and unheard. I've tried talking to him about it before, but nothing ever changes. Maybe I'm just too sensitive, but it feels like he's intentionally trying to drive me crazy. Whatever the reason, one thing is certain \u2013 I deserve better than this.<|eot_id|>"

After all, I'm not one of those drama queens who gets worked up over nothing. But as our eyes met, I could swear he knew exactly what I was thinking. That look on his face said it all - he's got no idea how pretentious he sounds when he talks about art.\n\nI took a deep breath and turned back to the painting, trying to focus on something other than him.
