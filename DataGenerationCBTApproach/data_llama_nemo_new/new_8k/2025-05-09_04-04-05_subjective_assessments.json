And yet, every time I try to reach out, she dismisses me with a hasty note, leaving me to wonder if I'm truly worth the effort.\n\nThat cat, for instance, requires regular feeding. How did I miss that crucial detail? Was it because she deliberately chose to overlook it, or was I simply too distracted by her thoughtless behavior? Either way, it's clear that our relationship has become a series of missed cues, a game of emotional whack-a-mole.
