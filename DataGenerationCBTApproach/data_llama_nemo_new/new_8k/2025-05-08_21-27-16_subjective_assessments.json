It's simply unacceptable that I've been passed over for yet another opportunity, while those beneath me seem to be catapulted into positions of authority with ease. The fact that I'm still employed at all, considering my advanced years, is nothing short of a testament to the company's blatant disregard for meritocracy.\n\nIt's disconcerting to think that my dedication and expertise have been consistently overlooked in favor of more youthful, less experienced counterparts. One would assume that a performance review would provide some semblance of clarity regarding areas for improvement or potential growth opportunities. Instead, I'm met with a lukewarm acknowledgement of my past achievements, devoid of any concrete suggestions for future advancement.\n\nFurthermore, I find it distressingly peculiar that my colleagues, many of whom are significantly younger than myself, appear to be thriving in their roles, while I'm stuck in a state of stagnation. Is it not the responsibility of management to identify and nurture talent, regardless of age? The lack of consideration for my unique skillset and experience is nothing short of egregious.\n\nIn light of these developments, I can only conclude that the company's priorities are woefully misaligned with its stated values. It's high time someone took a hard look at the systemic issues that are stifling innovation and progress within our organization.

She couldn't remember the last time she hadn't felt this way - the anxiety that gripped her like a vice, making every breath shallow and labored. Today was supposed to be just another day of retirement, but it had started off like any other since he'd gone. She reached for her phone on the bedside table, hands trembling slightly as she scrolled through old emails from her journalism days, hoping to find some solace in familiar words. But all they did was remind her of what she didn't have anymore - a purpose, a deadline, someone to share it with. The empty house seemed even quieter now, echoing with unspoken thoughts and unheard conversations. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself, but the anxiety only tightened its grip. Today felt different somehow, heavier. Like something was about to change again, and she wasn't ready for it.",

My mind is a jumble of what-ifs and maybes, and I'm trapped in this prison of my own making.\n\nEvery breath feels like a struggle, every heartbeat a countdown to the inevitable.
