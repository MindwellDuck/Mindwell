The canvas he'd left unfinished still leaned against the easel, his brushes dried out beside it. A single paint tube lay abandoned on the floor, its cap off, a forgotten tear stain darkening its side. She picked it up, her fingers tracing the indented impression of his thumb. A quiet sob escaped her lips as she noticed the color: their favorite shade of blue, the one he'd mixed just for her, now drying out like their love had done so suddenly.",

My partner thinks I'm amazing, but what do they know? They're just supporting me out of love. Not because I actually deserve it.\n\nBut seriously, how can one review completely destroy someone's confidence? It's like they're trying to ruin my life. And what really gets me is that it's right there, staring me in the face. I feel like I'm going to vomit. This is all so unfair. I'm never showing my art again. Forget about it. I'll just stick to my day job, where I don't get rejected by strangers.\n\nAnd another thing, if I'm being honest, maybe I wasn't that great at art to begin with.

Her smile is just mocking me now, like she's laughing at my pathetic attempts to keep our legacy alive.\n\nWhy do I even bother trying to recreate the magic? It's never going to be the same. She was the one who brought light into this place, and now it's just a hollow shell. I swear, every time I look at that photo, I feel like I'm reliving the worst part of losing her all over again.

I'll just learn to live with it, and maybe, just maybe, find a way to honor her memory without feeling like I'm suffocating under the weight of my own grief.

What if the cruel hand that had defaced my work was merely a harbinger of greater calamities to come? Would I be able to recover from this affront, or would the sting of defeat forever mar my artistic endeavors?\n\nIn the silence that followed, I felt an overwhelming sense of desolation wash over me, as if the very fabric of my existence had been torn asunder.
