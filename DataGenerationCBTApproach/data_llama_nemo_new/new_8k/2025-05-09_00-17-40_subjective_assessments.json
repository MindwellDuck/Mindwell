Like, what kind of person does that?\n\nI've had enough of these entitled kids running around today. They think the world revolves around them and nobody else matters. Newsflash, kid: we all matter. We all deserve respect. But do I get any? Nope. All I get is a bunch of apathy and disrespect from people who clearly don't care.\n\nAnd to top it off, now I'm late for my appointment. Thanks to this idiot, I'll probably have to wait another hour. Just great. My day is already ruined. Why can't people just be more considerate? Is that too much to ask?<|eot_id|>"
