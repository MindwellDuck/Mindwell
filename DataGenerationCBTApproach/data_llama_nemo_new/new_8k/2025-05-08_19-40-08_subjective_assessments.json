It's just a bunch of dusty old knowledge collecting dust. I swear, nobody reads anymore. My wife always said she loved reading, but now she's gone and I'm left with nothing but memories.\n\nI glance over at her chair, and it's just...empty. Like, completely devoid of anything. No warmth, no comfort, no love. Just a cold, hard seat staring back at me. I can almost feel her absence suffocating me. I try to shake off the feeling, but it's like a weight is crushing me.\n\nI force myself to look away from the photo, but I can still see her smile haunting me. It's like she's laughing at me, telling me I'll never find happiness again. I take a deep breath, trying to calm down, but my anger just boils over. Why does it have to be today of all days? Our anniversary. Of all anniversaries. It's just another reminder of everything I've lost.<|eot_id|>"
