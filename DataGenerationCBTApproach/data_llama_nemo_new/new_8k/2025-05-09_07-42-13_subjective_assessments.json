Did they get left behind while I was too distracted by this guy?\n\n\"I swear, every time someone comes in here looking like they've been through hell, I start thinking about all the things I could've done differently. What if I had taken him more seriously? What if I had acted faster? This is all my fault, I just know it. Why didn't I just call him already?

No, I suppose that's just the difference between us \u2013 she's got the luxury of ignorance, while I'm burdened by the weight of regret.<|eot_id|>"
