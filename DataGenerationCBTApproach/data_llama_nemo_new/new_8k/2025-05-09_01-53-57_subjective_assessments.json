My husband thinks he's being supportive, but his words ring hollow. And what's the point of even trying when everything I do ends in failure?\n\nThis morning, just like every other morning, feels like a never-ending cycle of disappointment. The lab's deadline looms over me like a specter, a constant reminder of all my shortcomings. I'm starting to wonder if anyone would even notice if I just gave up altogether. At least then I wouldn't have to face the crushing weight of expectation, the suffocating pressure to perform. But no, instead I'm stuck in this rut, forced to trudge through another day of mediocrity.<|eot_id|>"

It's like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of sadness, and I don't know how to break free.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I was foolish to think we had something real. Maybe I was just blind to the reality of things. But deep down, I know that wasn't true. We had something special, something worth fighting for. And now it's gone, lost forever. The thought of living without him is unbearable, and I don't know how much more of this I can take.\n\nI guess some days are better than others, but honestly, what's the point of even trying?
