It's like, basic human decency or something. But no, this guy's all about being weird and awkward. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on how he looks at me after that. All smug and self-satisfied, like he's done me some huge favor by not shaking hands. Newsflash, buddy: a simple \"hello\" would've sufficed.

It's just not fair to me or to himself.\n\nI feel like I'm constantly trying to hold him up to some kind of standard, but no matter how hard I try, he just can't seem to meet it.

My work will continue to speak for itself, and I shall remain resolute in the face of adversity, unapologetically standing by the principles that have guided me thus far.
