The old man who always complained about the price, now retired and living in some fancy new neighborhood. The young couple who came in every week, now with kids of their own. They're all leaving me, one by one.\n\nI feel like I'm drowning in this sea of goodbyes. Every customer, every face, every memory - it's all slipping away from me. I'm just a ghost, haunting these aisles, waiting for someone to notice me. But they don't. They're all moving on, leaving me behind.\n\nWhy did it have to end like this? Why did she have to leave? Wasn't she happy here? Did she really have to move so far away? The questions swirl in my head, but there are no answers. Only this hollow feeling, this ache in my chest.\n\nI'll never forget her, though. I'll hold onto the memories, even if they're bittersweet. But it's hard to keep going when it feels like everyone I care about is walking out the door.<|eot_id|>"
