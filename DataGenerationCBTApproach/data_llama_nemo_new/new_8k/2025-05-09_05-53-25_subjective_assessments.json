But no, instead, they just sit there, smiling and chatting like everything is fine. Meanwhile, I'm over here trying to save lives and deal with the stress of it all. \n\nI don't understand why nobody takes responsibility for anything around here. If only they would take control of the situation, maybe things would run more smoothly. But no, everyone just seems to be winging it, leaving me to pick up the pieces. It's infuriating. \n\nAnd to think, I've dedicated my career to helping others, and this is the thanks I get?
