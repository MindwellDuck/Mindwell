My hands are shaking, and I'm trying to keep my cool, but it's no use. These kids are like a plague, spreading chaos wherever they go. I hate days like this, where everything seems to conspire against me. Why can't they just leave me alone?\n\nI glance out the window, half-expecting to see some kind of disaster unfolding before my eyes. The sky looks dark, like a storm is brewing, and I can practically smell the anxiety wafting off the pavement. This is going to be one of those days, I just know it. A day where nothing goes right, where every little thing sets me off. I can feel it in my bones, like a cold dread creeping up my spine.\n\nAnd to think, I was having such a productive morning, too. Now, thanks to these little terrors, I'll never get anything done. My whole life is unraveling, thread by thread, and I don't know how much more of this I can take.<|eot_id|>"
