The moment I attempted to contribute to the discussion, the entire atmosphere shifted against me. It was as if the very air had turned toxic, suffocating me beneath its weight. \n\nThe instructor's remark, though seemingly innocuous, struck a chord deep within me. His words were akin to a dagger plunged into my heart, leaving me gasping for breath. How could he so callously dismiss my knowledge of Python? Did he truly believe himself superior to everyone else in the room?\n\nIn that instant, I felt like I'd been reduced to nothing more than a mere spectator, a bystander to my own intellectual inadequacy. The laughter that followed was merely a cruel reminder of my supposed shortcomings. I couldn't help but wonder if there was even a shred of truth to his assertion \u2013 did I truly possess any semblance of understanding regarding this ancient programming language?\n\nAs I sat amidst the sea of smirking faces, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I'd been irreparably damaged. My confidence, once buoyed by my enthusiasm for learning, now lay shattered and broken. The experience left me feeling utterly defeated, as if I'd failed miserably in the eyes of those around me.\n\nIt's simply unacceptable that someone would so brazenly belittle another's expertise. Can one truly expect such behavior in a place meant for mutual growth and support? I fear I shall never set foot in that establishment again, lest I wish to risk further humiliation at the hands of those who seem determined to undermine my self-worth.<|eot_id|>"
