She'd seen him again today, his eyes cold and distant. He hadn't even bothered to look at the menu she'd painstakingly crafted, let alone taste the dishes she'd prepared just for him. As she began to prep for the evening service, she felt a familiar sting behind her eyes. Another rejection, another missed connection. She tried to focus on the rhythm of chopping vegetables, but each thud of the knife against the board echoed with the same hollow finality as his words, \"It's not you, it's me.\"",

What if I mess up? What if I forget something crucial? What if... what if... what if... My mind starts racing, conjuring up worst-case scenarios that seem more likely than actual success. It's like I'm trapped in some kind of culinary Groundhog Day, doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the staff.
