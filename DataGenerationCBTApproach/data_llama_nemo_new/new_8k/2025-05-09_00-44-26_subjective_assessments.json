Does she think I'm not worried enough already? Newsflash, honey: I am worried sick right now. This isn't funny anymore.\n\nI know she thinks she can just do whatever she wants and I'll just sit back and relax. Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart - I'm not exactly thrilled about being kept in the dark like this. And what if something happens to our kid? What if she gets hurt because of your reckless behavior?\n\nThis is so typical of her. Always doing things her own way, never thinking about anyone else but herself. I'm starting to wonder if we were even compatible in the first place. Maybe I was just too good for her, maybe I deserved better than someone who would leave our kid alone at 3 AM.\n\nUgh, I need to get out of here before I lose it completely.
