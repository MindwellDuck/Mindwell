He stopped, leaning against the cold brick wall, feeling the familiar ache of loneliness in his chest as he watched the snow fill her favorite spot on the sidewalk where she used to wait for him after her shifts.",

That's just a cop-out. I need to make a choice, and I choose to leave. Now. Before I do something I regret.<|eot_id|>"
