Can't they even take care of one simple thing?\n\nAnd to think, I've been putting up with this crap all week. I've been working non-stop, barely getting any sleep, and still managing to keep our streets safe. Meanwhile, they get to come home, have a party, and trash my apartment. It's just great. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around them, waiting for them to do something stupid.\n\nI guess I should've known better than to expect them to behave themselves. I mean, I've seen how they act when they're drunk. It's like they think they're above the law or something. And now, my whole living room looks like a war zone. I'll have to spend hours cleaning this mess up. Just great.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I'm just too uptight. Maybe I am the problem here. Maybe I need to relax a bit more and let them have their fun. But at the same time, I know I deserve better than to come home to chaos every night. This isn't fair.<|eot_id|>"
