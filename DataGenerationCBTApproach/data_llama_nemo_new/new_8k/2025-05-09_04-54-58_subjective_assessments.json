One whole year has passed since he left us, and it still feels like yesterday. \n\nI can almost smell the hospital room, feel the cold floor beneath my feet. My heart is literally breaking into a million pieces right now. Why would anyone want to wake up when they know they're going to spend the day alone? It's not like I'm some kind of monster who needs to pretend everything is okay just because the sun is shining outside. \n\nI keep thinking about all the little things we used to do together - our morning coffee, our walks on Sundays... it's like he vanished into thin air. I swear, if I see one more sunrise without him by my side, I might lose it completely. Today is supposed to be some kind of \"new beginning\" or whatever, but what's the point? We're just stuck in this never-ending cycle of pain and sadness. \n\nWhy do I even bother trying to put on a brave face? He'd always say I'm strong enough to handle anything, but what about today? What about tomorrow? And the next day? And the day after that? It's like the world is just spinning around me, leaving me behind in this dark cloud of grief.<|eot_id|>"
