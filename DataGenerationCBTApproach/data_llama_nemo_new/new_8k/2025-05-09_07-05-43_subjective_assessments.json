She thinks she can just waltz into our hospital and start rubbing shoulders with the big shots? Please. I've seen her type before. They all think they're above the rest, just waiting for someone to slip up so they can pounce.\n\nAnd what really gets my blood boiling is that nobody ever called her out on it back then. Nobody said anything when she took my job. Now she's just walking around, thinking she's the queen bee. Well, let me tell you something, sweetheart: you're not the queen. You're just a pretender.\n\nI'm glad I didn't say anything to her today. If I had, things might've gotten ugly. But honestly, I wouldn't have done anything anyway. She's not worth my time.<|eot_id|>"
