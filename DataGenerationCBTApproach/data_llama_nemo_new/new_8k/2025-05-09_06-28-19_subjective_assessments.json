It's simply not fair that I'm expected to keep up with his lavish lifestyle.\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I'm just a homemaker, after all. My worth is measured by the number of dirty dishes I can scrub and the occasional dinner I manage to cook.

I mean, seriously, who needs personal growth when you've got a six-figure salary and a trust fund to fall back on?\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I find myself wondering if I'm just being too picky. Maybe I am expecting too much from him. Maybe I should just learn to appreciate the little things - like how he always remembers to buy me flowers, even if they're wilted and brown. Yeah, that's probably it. I'm just being too hard on him. After all, someone has to keep him humble. Might as well be me.<|eot_id|>"
