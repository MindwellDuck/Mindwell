My wife was pregnant, for crying out loud! That's all that matters. If they had just listened to us, if they had given her a chance to tell her side of the story, maybe things would've turned out differently.\n\nBut no, instead they just shut down the whole thing. And now we're left with nothing but questions and anger. It's so unfair. I keep thinking about all the times I told my wife how much I loved her, how much I wanted our baby to grow up safe and sound. And now it's all being taken away from us.\n\nI swear, those cops must have been in cahoots with the real culprit. There's no other explanation. My wife was innocent, and they knew it. But did they care? Nope. They just went ahead and closed the case anyway. It's disgusting.\n\nI'm telling you, this is all because of their incompetence and lack of compassion. We deserve justice, and we won't rest until we get it. Mark my words, this isn't over yet.<|eot_id|>"

It's not like it's hard to find a new one if you need one. But no, he's just gonna leave it there, like a dirty little secret.\n\nI swear, sometimes I wonder if we're even compatible.

I need to talk to him about this, but at the same time, I don't know if I want to know the truth.\n\nThis is so frustrating! Why can't he just be honest with me for once?

Is that supposed to be some kind of passive-aggressive gesture? Like, 'Hey, I know we didn't talk about anything important, but I'll just go ahead and cook your favorite meal so you'll forgive me'?

How dare they sully this once-respectable neighborhood with their...their...frivolity? The sunlight may have cast their shadows, but it was no coincidence; it was a cruel reminder of all that I feel has been lost.\n\nMy children deserve better, and so do I. This couple's wanton disregard for propriety will be their downfall, mark my words.

To conform to societal expectations, to follow the tried-and-true path laid out before them? No, they'd rather throw caution to the wind, embracing a lifestyle that will inevitably lead to ruin.

I found myself replaying our conversation from earlier, searching for some hidden cue that might explain her sudden absence.

I'm starting to feel like I'm the only one who's noticed anything amiss here. \n\nIt's not just the lack of communication that's bothering me; it's the complete disregard for my feelings.
