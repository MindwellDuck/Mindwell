It sounds like they're trying to make as much noise as possible so I'll hear them coming. Like, seriously, do they think I'm blind? Can't they see I'm trying to grade papers here? \n\nThis is all because of those incompetent utility companies, anyway. They're just too lazy to fix the power grid. I swear, it's always something with them. First, it's the water main bursting, then the internet goes down... I'm starting to think they're just trolling me at this point.\n\nOh, and I bet it's not just a coincidence that the fire alarm went off last week, either. That was definitely related to these power outages. Yeah, it's a conspiracy, folks. Don't @ me.\n\nI need to go check on things, but I'm pretty sure I know exactly what's going on. Those burglars will be caught red-handed (or whatever) by morning, and I'll still manage to finish grading these papers on time. Piece of cake.<|eot_id|>"
