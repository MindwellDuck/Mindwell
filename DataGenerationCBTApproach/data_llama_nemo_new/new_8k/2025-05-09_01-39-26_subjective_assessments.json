It's as if I'm cursed, destined to fail at everything I try. My friends all seem to have their lives together - they're married, successful, and happy - while I'm still single, struggling to make ends meet. I wonder if I'll ever find someone who truly understands me, or if I'll be stuck alone forever, watching others celebrate milestones that I can never achieve.

There was the time I spilled coffee on my favorite blouse during a staff meeting, or the occasion when I accidentally locked myself in the supply closet. Each incident has left an indelible mark on my psyche, making me acutely aware of the fragility of my physical abilities.\n\nIf I were to lose control, even momentarily, the consequences would be catastrophic. My partner would have to take care of everything, including the household chores and, heaven forbid, the garden. The thought of relying solely on him is unbearable.
