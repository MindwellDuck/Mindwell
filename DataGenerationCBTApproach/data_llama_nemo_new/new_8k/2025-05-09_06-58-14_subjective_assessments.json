Every second feels like an eternity, every tick of the clock a reminder that I'll never meet my deadline. My mind is a jumble of thoughts, but none of them make sense when I think about what's going on with us. \n\nIt's always something with her. She's always needing something from me, always expecting me to be there for her. Can't she see that I'm struggling? That I'm barely holding on? But no, she just keeps pushing, keeps piling on this weight that's crushing me. And now, to top it all off, the sun is setting outside, casting this gloomy shadow over everything. It's like the whole world is conspiring against me.\n\nI try to focus on my work, but my brain keeps wandering back to her. What did she say in that last message? Was it something I said? Did I do something wrong? Ugh, why can't I just get it together? Why can't I be more like everyone else who seems to have their life together?\n\nAnd then I look around the room, and it's all so empty. The chair next to me is vacant, just like my heart. The papers on my desk seem to mock me, reminding me of all the things I've failed at. Even the clock seems to be laughing at me, its steady beat a cruel reminder of my inadequacy.\n\nSometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. Would they care? Or would they just move on with their lives, leaving me behind like yesterday's trash? The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of my own insignificance.<|eot_id|>"

She was gone, and I was left to pick up the shattered remnants of our life together. It was simply unacceptable that she wouldn't even bother to leave behind some semblance of normalcy.
