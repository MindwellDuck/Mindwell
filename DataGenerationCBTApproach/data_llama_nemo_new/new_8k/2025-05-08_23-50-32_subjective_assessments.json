The critic's deliberate pause before him seemed like a harbinger of doom, a portent of the impending doom that would soon beset our humble art world. His furrowed brow, a topographic map of discontent, bespoke a scathing review that would reduce our collective efforts to naught but ashes.\n\nI couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding wash over me as I watched him move on, unencumbered by the weight of his own expectations. It was as if the very fabric of reality had conspired against us, condemning our work to the dustbin of history. The thought sent a shiver coursing through my veins, a morbid fascination with the abyss that yawned before us.\n\nAnd yet, even as I trembled at the prospect of his critique, I couldn't shake the feeling that some unseen force was conspiring against us all. That the very stars themselves had aligned against our artistic endeavours, dooming us to a fate worse than oblivion. The weight of this knowledge threatened to consume me whole, leaving naught but despair in its wake.<|eot_id|>"
