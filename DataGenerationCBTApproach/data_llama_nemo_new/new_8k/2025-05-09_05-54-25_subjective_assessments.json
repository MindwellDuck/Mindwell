More like a \"get lost\" vibe. \n\nI mean, what's the point of even trying? We're never going to get anything done around here. My colleagues are always slacking off, and management doesn't care about our workload anyway. I'm just going through the motions at this point. Cleaning up this mess is just another reminder that nothing ever gets done around here. And yeah, I might have gotten a little choked up when I saw him. Who wouldn't be, right?

It's a wonder anyone can navigate them without tripping over something. I've seen better-maintained cafeterias at elementary schools. I'm starting to think that perhaps we should consider relocating to a more... refined environment. One where the students can learn to appreciate the finer things in life, rather than throwing away their lunches like they're nothing.\n\nBut I digress. The real issue here is the lack of discipline among these children. They seem to think that rules are merely suggestions, and that they can do whatever they please without consequence. Well, let me tell you, I won't stand for it. I'll make sure they know that there will be consequences for their actions, no matter how small they may seem.
