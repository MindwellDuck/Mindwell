The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I find myself questioning whether I'll ever be able to catch up on lost time. \n\nPerhaps I'm just not cut out for this whole adult thing. Maybe I'm better off sticking to the familiar rhythms of my old life, no matter how imperfect it may have been. At least there, I knew what to expect \u2013 a sense of security, however fragile it may have been. Now, I'm left with nothing but uncertainty and the crushing weight of responsibility.<|eot_id|>"
