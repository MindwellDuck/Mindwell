Like, what kind of idiot forgets something that simple?\n\nAnd another thing, why do all these things have to happen to me? Can't I just have one day where everything goes smoothly? Is that too much to ask? Apparently so, because today is shaping up to be a total disaster.\n\nI guess I'll just have to suck it up and try to get this story done. But honestly, I'm not exactly feeling inspired right now. Maybe I'll just take a few deep breaths and pretend like everything is fine. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Just pretend like I'm a functioning adult who can handle a little stress. Easy peasy.<|eot_id|>"
