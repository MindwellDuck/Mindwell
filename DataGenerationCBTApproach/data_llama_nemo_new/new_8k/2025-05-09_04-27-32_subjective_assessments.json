I've always prided myself on being a role model, a shining example of dedication and expertise. But now, I'm left to question whether my efforts were truly appreciated or merely tolerated. The thought is almost too much to bear.\n\nPerhaps I'm just being overly critical, but it's hard not to feel a twinge of resentment whenever I see others succeeding where I once felt I would thrive. It's not fair, really. I've given everything to this profession, and this is the thanks I get? A pat on the back from some junior doctor who barely knows me?
