The exhibition was his work, but he felt no pride, only a bitter taste in his mouth. Each painting, once vibrant and alive with color, now seemed dull and lifeless under the harsh gallery lights. He paused before his favorite piece, a landscape she had loved. Her absence echoed through every brushstroke, a void he couldn't fill with paint or canvas. A young couple approached him, their eyes wide with admiration for his \"masterpieces.\" He bit back a sharp retort, instead offering them a thin-lipped smile and a curt nod before walking away, leaving them and his art behind in the sterile, cold gallery.",
