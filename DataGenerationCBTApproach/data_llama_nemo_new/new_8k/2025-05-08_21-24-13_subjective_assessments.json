But she's not here anymore, and now it just feels so...empty.\n\nWhy did I even bother getting all excited about this article if nobody's going to acknowledge it? I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just invisible. Like, what's the point of even trying if nobody's going to notice?\n\nI need to get out of here, go do something to distract myself from these feelings. Maybe take a walk or something. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Just need to get some fresh air and clear my head. Ugh, this is just so frustrating...<|eot_id|>"

Not a single sign of him anywhere. I tried calling his phone, but it went straight to voicemail. Typical.\n\nI took a deep breath and told myself it must be some kind of mistake. Maybe he overslept or got stuck in traffic. Yeah, that's it. He's probably running late, and I'll see him soon enough. After all, what's a few minutes late between partners? I mean, love conquers all, right?\n\nBut as I stood there, watching the clock tick away, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The silence was deafening, and the emptiness felt like a punch to the gut. I forced myself to smile and remind myself that everything will work out. That's what anniversaries are all about, after all \u2013 celebrating the love and commitment we share.\n\nStill, as I walked back to my car, the weight of the empty chair beside me felt like a constant reminder that maybe, just maybe, things aren't as perfect as I thought.
