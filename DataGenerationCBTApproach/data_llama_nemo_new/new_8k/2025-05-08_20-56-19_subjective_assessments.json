He must've been lying to me the whole time, telling me everything was fine when really he was screwing around behind my back. Or maybe he's just trying to get under my skin after all these years. Either way, I don't trust him anymore.\n\nI keep thinking about how we were happy together, and now it's all just a lie. Our whole relationship has been a joke. I feel so stupid for not seeing it sooner. I need some space, but at the same time, I want to confront him about it. This is war.<|eot_id|>"

I mean, come on, he used to be a struggling artist, but now look at him \u2013 successful, famous, and living large. Meanwhile, I'm over here teaching high school English until retirement, feeling like I've wasted my own potential.\n\nHe looked up, caught me staring, and flashed that charming smile of his. \"Hey, hon, what's wrong?\" Oh please, don't play dumb. You know exactly why I'm upset. It's not like I haven't noticed how much he loves that kid's writing. I swear, every time we go out to dinner, he's raving about some new book by that same author. It's like he's trying to make up for something.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm down, but my mind was already racing ahead. What if he's been secretly mentoring that kid behind my back? What if he's been using our relationship as a cover for his own literary ambitions? The thought made my stomach turn, but I pushed it aside, telling myself I was being paranoid. After all, we've been together for decades, and I trust him...don't I?\n\nI walked over to him, gave him a gentle nudge, and said, \"You know, I think I need some space right now.\" He nodded understandingly, but I could see the guilt flickering in his eyes. Yeah, I knew he knew exactly what I was thinking. We've been married long enough for him to pick up on my vibes. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go pour myself a drink and try to process this whole thing.<|eot_id|>"

His actions were a slap in the face to everything our mothers taught us \u2013 respect for the earth, compassion for others, and a commitment to excellence.

Just a little recognition, maybe a few bucks to cover the rent. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so, because these galleries keep turning me down. Well, I guess I'll just have to prove them wrong.
