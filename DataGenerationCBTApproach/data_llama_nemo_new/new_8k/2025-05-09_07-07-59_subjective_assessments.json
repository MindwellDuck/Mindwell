What if... what if... what if... My mind started racing with all the possible scenarios, each one more terrifying than the last. I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare, unable to wake up.\n\nI slowly turned the handle, my heart pounding in my chest. As the door creaked open, I hesitated, wondering if I was really ready for this. What if he got angry? What if he never spoke to me again? But what if... Ugh, stop it! Why am I thinking these thoughts? It's too late now. I took a deep breath and stepped inside, the weight of my decision crushing me.\n\nAs I rummaged through the drawers, my hands shaking, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen next. Would he come after me? Would our friends and family turn against me? The possibilities swirled in my head, each one more ominous than the last. I knew I had to do this, but what if...<|eot_id|>"

It's infuriating to see others coasting while I'm struggling to keep up.\n\nI wonder if anyone else has noticed how inefficient our team is.
