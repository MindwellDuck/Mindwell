I swear, every time we come here, they're right there, sipping their lattes and chatting away. What's going on between them?\n\nI tried to talk to her after class yesterday, but she just brushed me off. Said she was busy. Busy? With him? I don't think so. I'm starting to think she doesn't even care about our friendship anymore.\n\nWhy do I always notice these things? Can't I just ignore them?
