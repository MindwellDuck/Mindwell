The wife of an old college friend had passed away unexpectedly. She felt a lump form in her throat as she remembered their shared laughter, late-night study sessions, and the promise they'd made to keep in touch no matter where life took them. She hadn't spoken to either of them in years. Tears welled up, blurring the page. She missed the past, the friendship that had slipped away, and the countless moments they'd never have now.",

I mean, what even is the point of having friends if they're just going to abandon you like that? We were supposed to be lifelong buddies, but no, they just disappeared. I'm still trying to process how someone could so callously discard our friendship like it meant nothing.\n\nIt's not like we didn't try to stay in touch. We exchanged numbers, promised to meet up every year, but did they ever follow through? Nope. They just ghosted me, left me hanging. And now this. The wife of one of my closest friends from college is gone, and all I get is silence from him. It's like he doesn't even care.\n\nI swear, some people have no empathy. They're just too self-absorbed to notice the hurt they're causing others. And don't even get me started on the fact that we used to share such amazing memories together. Now those moments are just a distant memory, lost forever because of his lack of effort.\n\nWhy do people always seem to forget about their friends when something bad happens? Can't they see that I'm hurting over here? Don't they care that I'm still reeling from the loss of our friendship? It's like they think I'll just magically move on or something. Newsflash: I won't. Because I know exactly what kind of person he is.\n\nAnd another thing, why does everyone else get to move on while I'm stuck in the past? I'm still grieving the loss of our friendship, and nobody seems to care. It's like I'm the only one who actually feels anything. But hey, what do I know? Maybe I'm just too sensitive.<|eot_id|>"
