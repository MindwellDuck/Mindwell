Doesn't he know how it stings when someone tries to fix everything?\n\nHe said my painting was beautiful, but did he really see it? Or was he just saying that to make himself feel better? I think back to all the times I've felt suffocated by his expectations. He wants me to recreate our memories, to relive the moments we shared, but I'm not that person anymore. And yet, here I am, stuck in this rut, unable to move forward. Maybe it's not my fault that I've lost my passion for art.
