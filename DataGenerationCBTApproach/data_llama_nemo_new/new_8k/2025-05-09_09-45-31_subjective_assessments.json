She felt the disappointment settle heavy in her stomach, a familiar old friend. Another move, another disruption to their quiet life together. She had hoped for different news this time.",

Is he just going to keep leaving me behind until I'm nothing but a shell of who I used to be?\n\nAnd what really takes the cake is that he didn't even have the decency to talk to me about it before making the decision. Just drops this bombshell on me, like I'm supposed to be thrilled or something. Newsflash, honey: I'm not thrilled. I'm furious. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of never-ending nightmare where everything I love is constantly being torn away from me.\n\nHow could he do this to me?

Maybe I'm the one who's always late, or forgetful, or just plain lazy. Is that why he doesn't bother responding? Am I really that unimportant to him? I try to push those thoughts aside, but they linger, making me feel like I'm somehow less than him. It's infuriating, because I know I'm capable of more than this.
