My heart racing, I knew that tonight would bring nothing but calamity. Tonight, the universe would conspire against me, and I would be powerless to stop it.<|eot_id|>"

What if I've lost touch with reality?\n\nI look at the solitary \"Sold\" dot, trying to find some sense of validation. But what if it's just a fluke? What if someone bought it out of pity or obligation? What if I'll never sell another piece again?\n\nMy watch reads 2 PM. Two whole hours have passed and still nothing.

My hands, once steady and confident, now trembled with rage as I grasped the handle of my knife. The sudden, jarring silence that followed was almost deafening, a stark contrast to the discordant harmony that had previously reigned.\n\nIn that instant, I felt a seething sense of injustice, a deep-seated conviction that the universe was conspiring against me. The dishwasher's impertinence was merely the latest affront in a long line of indignities, each one fueling my growing resentment.

He knew I needed to see it, to remember him. And now, every time I look at it, I'm hit with this wave of sadness and guilt.\n\nIt feels like he's still trying to tell me something, but I don't know what. Maybe it's just my imagination, but sometimes I swear I hear whispers in the silence. Whispers that only I can hear. And when I do, it's like he's saying \"remember me\" over and over again.\n\nI wish I could just shake off these feelings, but they're so real.
