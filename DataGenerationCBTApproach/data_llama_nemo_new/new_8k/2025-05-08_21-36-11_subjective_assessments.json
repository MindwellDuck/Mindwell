He thinks he's so great, always making excuses and blaming everyone else. Well, let me tell you, I've got a whole folder full of those voicemails, and I'm not afraid to play them back.\n\nTwo years down the line, and I'm still stuck on this guy. Stuck because I keep finding these little reminders, these tiny little pieces of evidence that make me realize I'm still invested. It's like my brain is trying to tell me something, but I'm too damn stubborn to listen. So yeah, I'll just keep listening to this voicemail over and over again, reliving the same old drama, because that's exactly what I need right now - more pain.<|eot_id|>"

The radio squawked softly from its clip, but she silenced it, not wanting to disturb the peaceful scene. Her husband stood at the kitchen counter, his shoulders hunched as he rubbed at a stubborn stain on his hands. He didn't turn around when she entered, and that's when she noticed the faded bloodstains on his shirt, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary last year.\n\nHer heart sank like a stone in her chest. She'd seen enough blood to know it was old, dried. She stepped closer, her boots echoing softly on the tiled floor. He finally turned around, his eyes hollow and haunted, a stark contrast to his usually warm smile. In his hands, he held the shirt like an accusation, a silent testament to the life they'd taken yesterday.\n\n\"I couldn't bring myself to throw it out,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It's not your fault, you know that. We were just doing our job.\"\n\nBut she didn't feel like it was their job. Not today. Today, it felt personal, and the remorse sat heavy in her stomach, threatening to spill over. She took the shirt from him, folding it carefully before placing it in a bag meant for evidence. But this wasn't evidence. This was her reminder, her penance.\n\nShe looked at him then, really looked. The lines around his eyes were deeper than she remembered, and there was a weariness in his posture that spoke of more than just the physical labor of their jobs. She reached out, taking his hand in hers, offering what little comfort she could. But even as she did, she felt the weight of her own remorse, a silent companion that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day.",
