It's just so...so...infuriating.\n\nAnd what really gets my blood boiling is that she's probably laughing about this behind closed doors. She thinks she's so much better than me, doesn't she? Well, let me tell you, she's got news for herself. This isn't funny, and I'm going to make sure everyone knows it.\n\nOkay, okay, deep breaths. Let's get through this.

Like he thinks a few faded photographs can erase the ache within me.\n\nSometimes I wonder if he even remembers the good times anymore. Does he truly recall the laughter, the love, the sense of belonging we once shared? Or has it all become just another layer of dust on the shelf of our collective past? I'm not sure anymore.

Every creak of the floorboards, every faint noise outside, made me jump, convinced that I was on the verge of uncovering evidence of this potential break-in. It's not like I'm being paranoid, I simply know what I've seen before - those shadows cast by the car's headlights, the feeling of being watched - they're all too familiar.
