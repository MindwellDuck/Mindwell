Now I'm left here, alone, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company.\n\nI wonder what she's doing right now. Is she happy? Does she ever think about me? Probably not. She's probably moved on to someone better than me. Someone who actually deserves her.\n\nThis place used to be so full of life, but now it's just a hollow shell.

The fact that they had approached another employee for assistance, mere feet away, seemed like a brazen affront to my own capabilities and worth.\n\nHow could they so callously disregard my expertise and experience? Hadn't I been standing there, ready to provide aid at a moment's notice? Didn't my uniform and name tag scream \"available and willing to assist\"? And yet, they chose to bypass me, opting instead for someone else's help. The audacity was staggering.\n\nIt wasn't just the action itself that rankled; it was the implicit message it conveyed. They must think me incompetent, or perhaps even untrustworthy. That I'm somehow less capable than my colleague, who happened to be younger and more... accommodating. The thought sent a surge of resentment coursing through my veins.\n\nI felt a bead of sweat trickle down my forehead as I struggled to maintain my composure. How dare they treat me this way? Don't they know who I am? I've been working here for years, consistently delivering top-notch service while they're still learning the ropes. It's simply unacceptable that they would so flagrantly disregard my contributions.\n\nMy mind racing with indignation, I found myself mentally replaying the interaction, searching for some hidden cue or signal that might have led them astray. Was it something I said or did? Did I misspeak or misinterpret their needs? The what-ifs swirled in my head like a maelstrom, fueling my anger and frustration.\n\nIn the end, it didn't matter why they'd ignored me. What mattered was that they had, and the knowledge that I was being deliberately overlooked. My pride was wounded, my ego bruised. I seethed with resentment, my anger simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over into full-blown outrage.<|eot_id|>"

And now my agent is breathing down my neck, telling me I need to \"find my inner child\" or whatever nonsense.\n\nI swear, it's like nobody understands what I'm going through.

Can't we just admit that creating art is hard, and sometimes it doesn't turn out right?\n\nBut no, instead, I get criticized for not meeting some arbitrary standard of excellence.
