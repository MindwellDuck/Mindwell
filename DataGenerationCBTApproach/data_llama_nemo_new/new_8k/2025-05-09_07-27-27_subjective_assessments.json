Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, struggling to keep up with the latest advancements in our field due to the lack of resources and support from our department.\n\nIt's infuriating to see someone else reap the rewards of our hard work while I'm left to deal with the mundane tasks and bureaucratic red tape. Their success is a constant reminder of my own stagnation, and I can't help but wonder what I could have done differently if only I had more opportunities and backing. It's simply not fair that they get to bask in the glory of their accomplishments while I'm stuck in this rut.\n\nI've been working tirelessly for years, pouring over data and refining my techniques, yet my contributions remain overlooked and underappreciated. It's as if my efforts are invisible, and all anyone sees is the polished product of someone else's genius. I swear, some people have no idea how hard it is to make real progress in this field.
