I swear, she has no idea how much this means to me. She just thinks it's funny, doesn't she? Well, let me tell you, it's not funny. This is my life's work, and I'm being torn apart by a bunch of strangers.\n\nJust great. Now I can feel my face burning up. I need to get out of here before I pass out. This is humiliating.

She had been divorced for over a decade now, but still found herself irritated by the occasional glance from strangers who seemed to pity her situation. Today, however, it wasn't sympathy that fueled her irritation; it was the sight of a young man parking his car diagonally across two spaces, leaving barely enough room for her compact car. She could see him, laughing and joking with his friends, not a care in the world about anyone else's convenience. As she struggled to maneuver into the tiny space left for her, she felt her irritation boil over. \"Really?\" she muttered under her breath, slamming her door shut harder than intended.",

I'm a retired doctor, for crying out loud! I know how to handle myself. But no, everyone's always giving me the side-eye, like I'm some kind of pathetic old lady.
