The silence was a welcome relief, but it didn't fill the emptiness inside me. I dropped my bag on the floor and made a beeline for the kitchen, hoping to find some solace in a cold beer. But as I opened the fridge, I saw nothing but bills and reminders staring back at me. Like the one on the counter, taunting me about my mortgage payment due tomorrow. I picked it up, feeling like I was drowning in debt. What's the point, anyway? I'm just barely holding on. Another month, another struggle. I tossed it in the trash, along with all my hopes and dreams. Who needs financial security when you've got the weight of your own worthlessness?\n\nAs I sat down on the couch, surrounded by the dark shadows of my apartment, I couldn't help but think that I'm just not cut out for this whole adult thing. Maybe I should just give up now and move back in with my parents. At least they wouldn't expect me to pay rent. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and for a moment, I felt like I was staring into the abyss. But then I shook it off, telling myself I'm fine. I mean, what choice do I have, right?<|eot_id|>"

It's not like I don't know how to take care of things around here, but seriously, can't they just put in a little effort sometimes?\n\nAnd those dishes from breakfast? Still sitting there, piling up.

Tomorrow will probably be just as chaotic, right?\n\nI mean, I love my partner, but come on. A little bit of effort wouldn't kill them, would it? Is that too much to ask?

But does anyone give me the time of day?\n\nIt's not like I'm asking for special treatment or anything. I just want to see some fairness, some acknowledgment of the sacrifices we make every day.

More like because I needed to clear my head, process the frustration that's been building up inside me for months now. Maybe someday, someone will recognize the value of our experience and hard work. Until then, I'll just keep doing my job, quietly, in the background. Because that's what we do. We keep going, no matter how little we're appreciated.<|eot_id|>"
