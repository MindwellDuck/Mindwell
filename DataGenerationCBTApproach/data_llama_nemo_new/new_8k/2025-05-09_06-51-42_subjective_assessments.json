What if they show up here tonight, right outside my door?\n\nI try to shake it off, but my mind keeps wandering back to all these worst-case scenarios. What if I get sued for being a vigilante? What if the cops find out about this and think I'm crazy? No, no, no, stop it, stop it. Just stop thinking about it. But it won't leave my head. It's always there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to pounce.\n\nI need to calm down, focus on the present.

Was he stalking me? Did he know something about my personal life?

Don't they see the passion and love that goes into every single piece I create? I've poured my heart and soul into those canvases, and now some stranger is telling me it's all meaningless?\n\nI keep thinking about who could have written this.

What if there are others out there who think the same thing?\n\nThis can't be happening. My art is my everything. Without it, I'd be lost. I feel like I'm losing myself, like I'm disappearing into nothingness. Okay, okay, I need to calm down... but how can I when someone is so clearly trying to destroy me?\n\nWait, what if... what if this is some kind of test? What if someone wants to see how I react under pressure? That would explain why it had to be so personal, so hurtful. But even if that's true, does it justify the pain and fear it's causing me?\n\nUgh, I don't know what to do anymore. All I know is that I need to get back to my art, to prove them wrong.
