And what really gets my blood boiling is that he had the audacity to leave it right there in his wallet, like I wouldn't notice if I was looking through it. Like I don't know how to use a credit card or something. \n\nAnd can you believe he didn't even bother to tell me about it? Just assumed I'd magically know all about some dinner he went on without me? Newsflash, honey: I have feelings too, you know. This isn't just about the money; it's about the fact that he thinks I'm not capable of handling basic financial information. \n\nIt's just another example of why I'm starting to wonder if we're even compatible.
