And now look where we are - dead, and I'm left to deal with his mess.\n\nI swear, every time I think about that trip, my stomach turns. He was so convinced it would change everything, but I just saw it as a waste of time and money. And now, here I am, re-reading his notes like I care. Newsflash, honey: I don't care. But, apparently, his stupid notebook does. It's like he's trying to tell me something, like I missed something crucial back then. Please, spare me the drama.\n\nAnd another thing, why did he have to write it down? What's the point of leaving a paper trail for someone else to pick up? It's not like I need some reminder of how much I messed up. I mean, come on, can't he just leave me alone? This is all just too much. His stuff, his memories, his stupid ideas...

His thoughtlessness is a symptom of a deeper issue - one that speaks volumes about our relationship's trajectory.\n\nIt's astonishing that he can so callously disregard my contributions to our household, all while expecting me to maintain a sense of normalcy. Does he truly believe that I'm oblivious to these affronts? That I won't notice when he leaves his dirty plates piled high, awaiting my intervention? The notion that he might genuinely forget or be too apathetic to care is laughable. This isn't a minor oversight; it's a deliberate choice, one that underscores his fundamental disregard for my feelings.\n\nI've tried to address this issue before, but my words fall flat. He dismisses my concerns with a wave of his hand, implying that I'm overreacting or being too sensitive. But I know what I feel - a deep-seated resentment that simmers just below the surface.

The questions swirled in my head like a maelstrom, refusing to be silenced.\n\nAnd still, I cooked, driven by a morbid curiosity - what would happen if I confronted her about it all?
