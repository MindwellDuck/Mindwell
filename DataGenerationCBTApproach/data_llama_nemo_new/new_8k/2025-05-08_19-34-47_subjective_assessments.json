They're like vultures, circling above, waiting for someone to let their guard down so they can pounce.\n\nI mean, what's the point of even having meetings if we're just going to waste our time listening to some kid spout off about their \"groundbreaking\" research? Newsflash: it's not groundbreaking, it's just regurgitated crap. And don't even get me started on how they think they can just cite other people's work and expect us all to forget that they've been doing the same thing for months.\n\nIt's like, hello, basic research skills, people! If you're going to present your work, at least have the decency to do it properly. Don't just phone it in and expect everyone else to cover for you. I'm sick of it. Sick of the lack of originality, sick of the entitlement, sick of the whole damn thing.\n\nAnd to think, I was actually looking forward to this meeting. Now I just feel like wasting my breath.

It's all my fault, of course. If I had just been more assertive, maybe we could have found another surgeon or something. But no, instead I was left standing there, feeling helpless and guilty.\n\nIt's really frustrating because I know I did everything by the book. I followed every protocol, double-checked the paperwork... but still, nothing goes according to plan. And now everyone's looking at me, expecting me to fix this mess. Like I'm some kind of miracle worker.\n\nI just wish they'd take responsibility for their own mistakes for once. Instead of blaming me for their incompetence, maybe they should try to figure out what went wrong and actually do something about it. But no, that's too much to ask, isn't it?<|eot_id|>"

Was she thinking about me? Or was she just trying to capture the moment, the feeling? It didn't matter. What mattered was that I wasn't there for her anymore. That I'd let her down, and this sketchbook was just a reminder of everything I'd failed at.\n\nAs I touched the paper, my fingers left a smudge, just like my own mistakes. I wiped it away, but the stain remained, a constant reminder of what could never be undone.
