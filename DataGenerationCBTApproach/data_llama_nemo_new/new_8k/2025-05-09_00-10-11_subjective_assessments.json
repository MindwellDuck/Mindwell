My own pursuits, relegated to the dusty recesses of our shared studio, were met with a dismissive glance, a fleeting acknowledgement that spoke volumes about his priorities.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been privy to whispers of his colleagues' artistic endeavors \u2013 the lavish exhibitions, the critical acclaim, the accolades that seemed to fuel his very existence. It's almost as if they're the ones who truly understand the value of creativity, while I'm left to toil in obscurity, my canvases gathering dust alongside the unfulfilled promises of a bygone era.\n\nWhy must I always be reminded of what I lack? Why can't he see the beauty in the world I strive to capture, even when it feels like no one else does? The weight of his indifference settles upon me like a shroud, suffocating my every attempt to express the depths of my soul. And yet, I remain, steadfast in my pursuit, though it's clear that I'll never measure up to the standards he's set for himself.<|eot_id|>"

If he'd been more involved, maybe things would have turned out differently.\n\nBut no, instead, she grew up resentful and distant. And now, here we were, years later, and still no reconciliation. It's not like I'm the one who drove her away; it's just that life got complicated, and we lost touch. I've tried reaching out, but she's always shut the door.\n\nIt's frustrating, really, because I feel like I've done everything right. I provided for her, supported her education... what more could she want? But does anyone ever give credit where credit is due? No, everyone just assumes I'm some kind of neglectful parent, and that's just not true. My daughter's problems started long before I became her mother.<|eot_id|>"
