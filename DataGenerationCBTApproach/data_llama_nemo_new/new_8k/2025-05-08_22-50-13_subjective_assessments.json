The words he spoke still lingered in my mind, a bitter reminder of the pain and betrayal I had endured during our marriage.\n\nIt's hard to explain why, but every time I think about him, I feel this overwhelming sense of resentment. It's as if the wounds of the past have never fully healed, and the slightest trigger can set off a chain reaction of negative emotions.

I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever be able to truly escape the shadows of our relationship.\n\nPerhaps it's just my imagination running wild, but I could swear I saw him walking down the street yesterday, his eyes locked onto mine with a mixture of guilt and regret. Of course, it was probably just my mind playing tricks on me, but the feeling persisted nonetheless. I'm beginning to question my own sanity, wondering if I'm somehow responsible for the pain he caused me.\n\nAll I know is that I need to find a way to quiet the voices in my head, to learn to live with the knowledge that he's out there, watching me, waiting for me to make another mistake.
