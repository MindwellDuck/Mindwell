They all think they know better than me, like I'm some kind of relic from the past. Like, I was doing just fine before my husband passed away, thank you very much. But now, suddenly, I'm invisible. No one wants to talk to me, no one wants to listen to me. It's like I'm just a ghost hovering around the edges of society.\n\nI try to stay positive, I really do. But it's hard when everyone around me seems to be moving forward while I'm stuck in neutral. I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's exhausting. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. Would anyone care?\n\nI glance over at the young girl who just snapped at me, and I can feel my face burning with embarrassment. Why does she have to be so rude? Can't she see that I'm just trying to make ends meet? But deep down, I know it's not about her. It's about me. It's about how I fit into this world, and how I measure up against everyone else.<|eot_id|>"
