It's enough to drive one mad, I assure you.\n\nBut what really takes the cake is the fact that I'm left to deal with the aftermath of his antics alone. No gentle prodding, no soft words of encouragement. Just me, standing here, staring at the wreckage of our relationship, wondering how it all came to this. How did we go from two loving partners to two strangers living under the same roof?\n\nIt's a travesty, a catastrophe, a complete and utter collapse of our partnership.
