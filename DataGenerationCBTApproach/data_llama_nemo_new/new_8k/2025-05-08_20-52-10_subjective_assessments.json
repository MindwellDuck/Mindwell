Not me, that's for sure. My life is just as dull and grey as the sky right now. At least my place is quiet, no annoying sounds or memories to deal with.

His reckless disregard for this fundamental aspect of our partnership is nothing short of staggering.\n\nIn light of this revelation, I fear that our relationship may never be the same again.
