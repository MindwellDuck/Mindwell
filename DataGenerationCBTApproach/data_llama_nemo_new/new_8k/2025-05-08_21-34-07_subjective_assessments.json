I'll probably lose myself in grief all over again, reliving every moment we shared. This must be some kind of cruel joke, right?\n\nI keep thinking about how much he loved me, and now I'm just going to be haunted by his memory forever. What if this letter is some kind of warning sign? Maybe it's trying to tell me something - that I'm not good enough, that I'll never move on. I don't know how I'll cope with the weight of these feelings all over again. My mind is racing with worst-case scenarios, and I just want to crawl under a rock and hide.\n\nThis has to be some kind of bad omen. Why else would someone send me a letter after all these years? I swear, the universe is conspiring against me. I just wish I could turn back time and make things right between us. But deep down, I know that's impossible. Now I'm just stuck with the memories, and this letter is just another painful reminder of everything I've lost.<|eot_id|>"
