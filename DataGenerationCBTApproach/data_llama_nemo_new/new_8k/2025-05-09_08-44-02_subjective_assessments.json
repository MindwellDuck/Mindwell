As she picked it up, her heart pounded with a familiar dread. She had felt this shame before, the sting of criticism from parents over a lesson plan gone awry. The envelope was thin, but its contents felt heavy as she slipped her finger under the seal. Inside, a single sheet of paper detailed a complaint about her teaching methods, signed by five parents. Her eyes scanned the lines, each word stinging like salt on an open wound. She felt her cheeks flush with heat as she realized how many people now saw her as inadequate. The letter was crumpled in her fist before she could stop herself, shame burning like acid in her stomach.",

Five parents complaining about my lesson plans? Are you kidding me? I know I'm not perfect, but come on. At least I'm trying. Those other teachers must be doing something right, because they never get complaints like that. I feel like I'm just not good enough, like I'm stuck in some kind of rut.\n\nAnd it's not just the parents - it's everyone. My colleagues seem to have it all figured out, while I'm just struggling to keep up. I've been teaching for years, and I still can't seem to get it right. What's wrong with me? Is it something I'm doing? Am I just not cut out for this job?\n\nI hate days like this, when everything feels like it's falling apart. I just wish I could be more like those other teachers - confident, competent, and in control. But until then, I'm stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and frustration.<|eot_id|>"
