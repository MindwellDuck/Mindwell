That child's carelessness was a slap in the face, a reminder that some people just don't deserve our patience. And now, here I am, surrounded by the remnants of other people's failures, forced to confront my own inadequacies. Why do I always get stuck with the worst customers? It's like the universe has a personal vendetta against me.\n\nI sighed, feeling the weight of my exhaustion settle in. Another long day, another chance to deal with incompetence. I wondered what kind of parents would abandon their kids' belongings like this, leaving them to fend for themselves. Did they ever stop to think about the impact their actions have on others? Probably not, too busy worrying about their own problems. It's just another example of how some people are completely oblivious to the world around them.<|eot_id|>"
