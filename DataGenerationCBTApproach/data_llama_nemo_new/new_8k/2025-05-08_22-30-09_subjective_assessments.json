Didn't she know that I'm here to support her, to guide her through the darkest of times? And yet, she chose to suffer in silence. That's not how it's supposed to be. Students are supposed to look up to their teachers, to respect them. This...this was a failure on both our parts.\n\nI thought back to all the times she came to class, always smiling, always eager to learn. How could I have missed this? Shouldn't I have seen it? Shouldn't I have known better? The weight of responsibility settled heavy on my shoulders. I felt like I'd failed her, like I'd let her down.\n\nThis wasn't just about my student; it was about the entire system. We're supposed to provide a safe haven, a place where students can thrive. But what if we're failing? What if we're not doing enough? The questions swirled in my mind, fueled by a growing sense of unease. Something needed to change, and fast.<|eot_id|>"
