But I knew I had to keep moving, to find some semblance of order in this chaotic world. After all, what choice did I have? The coffee maker wouldn't brew itself, and neither could I.

Maybe I'm just tired and paranoid. Still, the thought of someone lurking around my house makes me uneasy. I keep wondering if it's related to that weird package I received last week. I didn't order anything online, but the delivery guy said he had no idea what it was either.\n\nI tried calling my husband to let him know, but his phone went straight to voicemail. He's always busy with work too, so maybe he's not answering because he's dealing with something else. Or maybe...just maybe...he knows more than he's letting on. I don't know, it's all just speculation at this point.\n\nI'll probably go check the security cameras later to see if I can catch a glimpse of whatever was going on.

Newsflash, life: things don't work out the way we want them to. People die, relationships end, and sometimes you're left with nothing but a bunch of crap and memories. But still, I expect more. I expect to wake up next to her, to hear her laugh, to smell her damn perfume. And when I don't get it, I'm supposed to just deal with it? Are you kidding me? This isn't how it's supposed to be.

It's like I'm waiting for some kind of miracle, some kind of magic trick that's gonna make everything okay again. But it never does. So yeah, I guess I'm just stuck in this rut, waiting for something that's never gonna happen.

I find myself reaching for it every morning, hoping against hope that she'll magically appear and we can continue our lives as usual. But deep down, I know that's not how it works. Life doesn't work that way. You either live or you die, and sometimes you're left with nothing but the memories.

It is a travesty that the company would so callously disregard the contributions and dedication of long-standing employees like myself.\n\nIn light of this development, I fear that my own career trajectory has been irreparably compromised. The promotion of someone significantly less qualified than myself raises serious questions about the meritocracy that supposedly underpins our organizational structure.
