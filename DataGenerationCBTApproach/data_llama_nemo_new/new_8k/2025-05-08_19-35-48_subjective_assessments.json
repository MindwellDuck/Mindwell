I specifically recall signing up for this group because I value intellectual discourse and camaraderie among fellow readers. However, tonight's debacle was nothing short of embarrassing.\n\nFirstly, the lack of preparation displayed by some members is appalling. Not having read the assigned novel is simply unprofessional. How can we expect to engage in meaningful discussions when everyone isn't holding themselves to the same standards? It's disheartening to see such a blatant disregard for the norms we've established.\n\nFurthermore, the atmosphere in the room was suffocating. The awkward silences and hushed whispers were palpable, making me feel like an outsider. I'm starting to wonder if this book club is truly worth continuing. Perhaps I should just stick to reading alone, where I can maintain some semblance of control over my literary experiences.\n\nI do hope our next meeting will be more productive, but until then, I fear for the future of this group. Its very existence seems to be predicated on mediocrity, and that's something I won't stand for much longer.<|eot_id|>"
