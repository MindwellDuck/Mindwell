She just smiles and pats me on the back, telling me that it's okay, that everyone makes mistakes. But she doesn't understand - it's never okay. When someone as intelligent and capable as myself can't even manage to articulate a simple idea, it's a reflection of the entire system.\n\nI mean, think about it - if our instructor couldn't even notice my struggles, how can we trust her to teach us anything? It's clear that she's more interested in coddling her students than actually helping us learn. And it's not just her - the whole academic environment is designed to fail people like me. The textbooks are outdated, the lectures are boring, and the assignments are impossible to complete. It's no wonder I struggle - the odds are stacked against me from the very beginning.\n\nBut despite all this, I'll keep trying. Because if I give up now, I'll never know what could have been. And who knows - maybe someday I'll finally find a teacher who understands me, who recognizes my potential and helps me reach it. Until then, I'll just have to suffer through the incompetence of those around me.<|eot_id|>"
