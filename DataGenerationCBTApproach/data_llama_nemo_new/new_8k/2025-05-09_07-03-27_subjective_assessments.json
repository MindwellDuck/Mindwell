The messages on his phone were pretty cryptic, but they definitely made me wonder what I've gotten myself into.\n\nI know I shouldn't overthink things, but it's hard not to when I see how uncomfortable he gets whenever I bring up certain topics. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him, never knowing when he'll blow up. And those messages... they just make me think that maybe I am taking things too far.\n\nSometimes I find myself replaying our conversations in my head, trying to pick up on any subtle hints or clues that might reveal what's really going on. But every time I try to talk to him about it, he just brushes it off and tells me everything is fine. That just makes me more anxious, wondering what I'm missing.\n\nI guess I just need to calm down and trust him more. But it's hard when I have these nagging doubts that something is off. Maybe I'll just try to focus on the positive \u2013 we do have a good relationship, after all.

The weight of responsibility, the unrelenting drudgery \u2013 all sacrificed for the sake of a creature that requires naught but a gentle stroke of the hand.\n\nAnd yet, as I stood there, frozen in contemplation, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow...less.

It is clear that she values convenience over consideration, and I am left to wonder if our relationship has become nothing more than a mere afterthought.\n\nI must admit, I find it particularly galling that she would see fit to leave a note, replete with the details of her nocturnal activities, as if to rub salt in the wound. Does she truly believe that I am oblivious to her schedule, or does she simply assume that I am powerless to do anything but sit idly by while she indulges in her own pursuits? Whatever the case may be, I can assure you that such behavior will not be tolerated indefinitely.\n\nIt is a travesty, really, that I am expected to adjust my plans around hers, to accommodate her whims and fancies, without so much as a second thought.
