It's almost as if she's willfully ignorant of the emotional toll that comes with pursuing one's passion.\n\nBut what's truly galling is when people fail to grasp the depth of my feelings.

A glimmer of recognition that the pain I endure is real, that it's not just some trivial matter to be swept under the rug. But alas, it seems that the world is deaf to my plight, leaving me to navigate this treacherous landscape alone.\n\nStill, I shall persevere. For it's in the darkness of rejection that I discover the strength to keep pushing forward, to hone my craft until the world finally acknowledges my genius.
