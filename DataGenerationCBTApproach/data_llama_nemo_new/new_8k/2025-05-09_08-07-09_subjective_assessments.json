His partner of twenty years was gone now, a silent void at their shared desk. He sat down, alone, as the room buzzed around him like a foreign language. The Chief approached, his face somber. \"We found his cruiser,\" he said, placing a hand on the old man's shoulder. \"But it was too late.\"",

Time lost all meaning when you're stuck in a nightmare like this.\n\nI glanced over at the empty chair beside me, where my partner used to sit, sharing stories and laughter with me. Now, it just stared back, a cold reminder of what we'd lost. The buzzing in the room was deafening, a cacophony of meaningless chatter that only served to underscore the crushing silence that had taken its place.\n\nThe Chief's hand on my shoulder was a gesture of condolence, but it felt like a cruel joke. What good was a pat on the back when the very fabric of our reality had been torn apart? I forced myself to look up, meeting the Chief's somber gaze, but my eyes betrayed me - they welled up with tears, and I quickly looked away, unable to bear the sight of his sympathetic expression.\n\nThis day would never get better. Nothing could make it right. My partner was gone, and nothing would ever bring him back. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I knew I'd spend the rest of eternity trapped in this abyss of grief.<|eot_id|>"
