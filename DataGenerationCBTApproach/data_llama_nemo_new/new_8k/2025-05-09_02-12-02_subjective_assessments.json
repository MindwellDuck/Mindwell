My gaze drifted towards the source of the commotion, where a frazzled individual was berating me with unbridled ferocity.\n\nIt became immediately apparent that this parent had been wronged by my grading system, and I could sense the depth of their indignation. Their outburst was a direct result of my alleged \"malice\" and \"incompetence.\" I felt a surge of defensiveness, as if my very character was under attack. It was clear that this parent had been subjected to some egregious injustice, one that would undoubtedly leave a lasting scar on their psyche.\n\nTheir child's artwork, now reduced to a mangled mess, seemed like a poignant metaphor for the destruction wrought by my supposed transgressions. I couldn't help but wonder what other injustices lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered. As the parent continued to rail against me, I found myself becoming increasingly entrenched in my own narrative \u2013 one that posited me as the unwitting victim of a heinous conspiracy.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that I had to take drastic action to rectify the situation. I swiftly summoned the school administration, determined to set the record straight and restore my tarnished reputation. After all, someone had to defend my honor against the onslaught of unfounded accusations.<|eot_id|>"

The table, once filled with laughter and conversation, now sits bare. Our family photos, our memories, all gone. It's like she's erased us from existence.\n\nAnd why now?
