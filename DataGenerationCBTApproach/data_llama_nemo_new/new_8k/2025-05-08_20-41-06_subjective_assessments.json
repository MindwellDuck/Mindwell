Like I'm some kind of servant or something. Newsflash: I've been working here for years, and I know exactly what I'm doing. I don't need them telling me how to fold a shirt.\n\nBut what really gets my goat is when they complain about the prices. \"This is ridiculous,\" they'll say, or \"I could get this at the mall for half the price.\" Well, let me tell you, dear, you're not going to find quality like this anywhere else. And besides, I work hard for my wages, so don't even think about trying to lowball me.\n\nIt's customers like these that make my job so frustrating. They have no idea how much effort goes into making sure everyone leaves here happy. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a cashier. Not like I'm some kind of expert or anything.\n\nOh, and by the way, did I mention that the store manager is always breathing down my neck? Trying to cut corners and increase profits at the expense of good customer service. It's a wonder anyone comes back to this dump anymore.<|eot_id|>"
