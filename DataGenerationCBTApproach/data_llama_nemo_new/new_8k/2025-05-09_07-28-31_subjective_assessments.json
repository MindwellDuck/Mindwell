And now, here he was, a shadow of his former self, brought low by his own recklessness. It was a stark reminder that some people just aren't cut out for success. You can't just coast through life, expecting everything to work out in the end. That's not how the world works.\n\nI glanced around the room, taking in the somber expressions of my colleagues. They were all thinking the same thing \u2013 that my brother was a lost cause, a disappointment to us all. And I couldn't blame them. I mean, who wouldn't want to distance themselves from someone like him? His behavior was unacceptable, a reflection of the kind of person he truly was.\n\nBut still, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.
