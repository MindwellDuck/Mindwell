The usual Saturday morning bustle seemed amplified today; vendors called out prices, patrons chattered eagerly, and children laughed loudly. Her heart pounded as she struggled to find calm amidst the chaos. She needed the freshest produce for tonight's charity gala, but every stall was either sold out or had lines stretching endlessly. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the cool autumn air. Time was slipping away, just like her late husband's grip on life three years ago. The stress of honoring his memory with this event threatened to consume her. As she turned to leave empty-handed, a sudden commotion caught her eye - a crate of tomatoes tumbling onto the cobblestones, rolling towards her feet. She froze, heart racing, as she watched them come to a halt at her shoes. A wave of panic surged through her, threatening to spill over into tears. She couldn't even buy enough tomatoes for one dish without feeling overwhelmed.",

I went to that market last week and they were out of avocados. Can you believe it? Avocados! Like, how hard is it to stock those things?\n\nIt's not just the lack of availability, though. It's the whole atmosphere. The smell of stale bread and sweat, the sound of screaming kids and bickering adults... it's all just so overwhelming.
