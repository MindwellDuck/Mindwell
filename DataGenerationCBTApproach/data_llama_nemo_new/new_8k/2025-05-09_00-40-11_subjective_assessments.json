Why had she moved on so quickly?\n\nI thought back to our relationship, trying to pinpoint where it had all gone wrong. Was it something I did? Something I didn't do? I replayed every conversation, every argument, every moment we shared. And yet, no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I'd somehow failed her.\n\nIt wasn't fair, really. She deserved better than someone like me. Someone who couldn't even hold onto a marriage. But why did it have to be this way? Why did life have to deal me such a cruel hand?\n\nI glanced around the store, watching as other customers came and went, none of them seeming to know or care about my personal struggles. It was as if they were all living their perfect lives, while I was stuck in this rut. I sighed, feeling a lump form in my throat.\n\nI wish things had turned out differently. I wish we'd made it work. I wish...but that's not the point. The point is that it didn't, and now I'm left to pick up the pieces of a shattered dream.<|eot_id|>"

It's like they want me to fail. I try to force it open, but it's like trying to move a mountain. I'm starting to think that maybe I shouldn't have taken this job in the first place. Maybe I should've stayed home, curled up by the fire, and left the heroics to someone else.\n\nI radio for backup, but all I get is static. Of course, I do. Because why would anything go right for me tonight? My phone has no signal, so I'm completely cut off from the rest of the world.
