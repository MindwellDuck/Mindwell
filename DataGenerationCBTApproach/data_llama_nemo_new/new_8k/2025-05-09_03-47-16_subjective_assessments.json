My family's visit had been unexpected, but I knew they were upset about what happened. They always said I was a good doctor, that I would never make mistakes. But now...now they looked at me differently.\n\nWhy did they have to react this way? Can't they see I'm trying to do everything right? I've been studying, attending conferences, reading every book I can find on my specialty. I thought I was prepared for anything. But no matter how hard I try, things just don't go as planned.\n\nTheir accusations cut deep, but I tried to remain calm. \"We're just worried about you,\" my sister said, her voice shaking. \"We want you to get better.\" I nodded, feeling a lump form in my throat. Why didn't they understand? I'm doing everything I can. It's just not fair that they're blaming me like this.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to explain, but the words felt hollow. What could I say to make them see that I'm not a failure? That I'm still the same person they know and love? Maybe if they just gave me a chance, saw past all this...but no, they're too caught up in their anger and hurt.\n\nIt's just so unfair. I thought we were a team, a family. But now it feels like they're against me. And I don't know how to fix this. All I can do is keep trying, hoping that someday they'll see the truth \u2013 that I'm not the one who made the mistake.<|eot_id|>"

The familiar silence is deafening; no longer filled with his laughter, no longer punctuated by his footsteps. She drops her chef's coat on the floor, not bothering to hang it up. In the kitchen, she absentmindedly traces the faint outline of a once-scratched recipe note still visible on the countertop - his handwriting, their shared plan for a Saturday morning breakfast that never came.

I feel this emptiness spreading through me, like it's been growing since he left. I wonder if he's thinking about me right now, wondering when I'll come home. Does he ever think about our plans, our dreams? Or am I just stuck in this rut forever?\n\nI glance around the kitchen, half-expecting to see him standing there, pouring himself a cup of coffee. But of course, he's not. That's why I'm here alone. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of loneliness. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe we'll finally get back on track. But until then, I'm stuck in this limbo, wondering what could've been.\n\nI start to clean up the kitchen, my movements mechanical. My mind keeps wandering back to him, replaying all the things we used to do together. Why didn't he call today? Is everything okay? I try to push the thoughts away, telling myself I'm just being paranoid. But the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced he's thinking about me too. We're connected, somehow.

My wife comes in here tonight, and suddenly I'm expected to be grateful? For what? So we can pretend like everything is okay? Please. I know exactly how much I've lost, and I won't be swayed by some sentimental trinket like this photo.\n\nAnd another thing, why does she always have to bring it up?
