It's like, how could she forget something so simple? We're always drinking coffee together. It's like she's losing it or something.\n\nI know she's been forgetting stuff lately, but this is ridiculous. I mean, who forgets a coffee cup? It's not like we have a lot of other things going on around here. And now she's ignoring me too? What's wrong with her?\n\nI feel like I'm walking on eggshells around here. One minute she's fine, the next she's completely spaced out. It's like she's disappearing before my eyes. And I don't know how to deal with it. I try to talk to her about it, but she just shrugs it off and says she's stressed. Stress? From forgetting a stupid coffee cup?\n\nIt's like, I get it, life gets busy. But this isn't just about one thing. This is about our whole relationship. And I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem. Am I the one who's making her forgetful? Is it something I did? I don't know, man. All I know is that I feel like I'm losing her, piece by piece.<|eot_id|>"

And then, today, I discovered the door ajar. A sense of trepidation washed over me as I pushed it open, my heart sinking with every step into the familiar yet foreboding space within.\n\nMy gaze fell upon the scattered documents on the kitchen counter, and a cold dread crept up my spine. Those divorce papers, once neatly stacked, now lay in disarray, as if someone had been rummaging through them with reckless abandon. It was then that I realized \u2013 they must have broken in while I was away. The question was, who?\n\nA name began to form in my mind, one that I hadn't thought about in years. Someone I thought I'd left behind, someone who knew exactly how to push my buttons. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks, and I felt my blood pressure rise. How could they do this? Didn't they know I was trying to move on?\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my thoughts continued to spiral out of control. Who could have done this? What did they want? And why now, after all these months? The questions swirled in my head, refusing to be silenced.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in anxiety, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden in the shadows, waiting to be uncovered. The black sedan, the open door, the scattered papers \u2013 it was all too much to bear. I needed answers, and I needed them now.<|eot_id|>"
