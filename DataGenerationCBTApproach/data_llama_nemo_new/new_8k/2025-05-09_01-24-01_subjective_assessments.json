She'd been a police officer for decades, but this morning's call still haunted her - the young man who'd taken his own life, barely more than a boy. Her partner had tried to talk to her on the ride back, but she'd shut him down, retreating into silence. Now, as she sat alone, the familiar weight of remorse pressed heavy on her chest. The untouched breakfast was a stark reminder of the family waiting downstairs, unaware that their mother's job had claimed another victim, this time not with a badge, but with a rope.",

It's hard not to feel like I'm failing when I think about that young man's family, waiting downstairs for me to bring some sense of closure. His death weighs heavily on me, and I keep replaying our conversation in my head, wondering if there was something I could have done differently. If only I'd been faster, more vigilant...the what-ifs haunt me. But I know I did everything I could; that's why I'm so consumed by guilt. It's not just about the job; it's about being a good person, a good mother, a good friend. And right now, I don't feel like any of those things. The thought of facing those faces today, pretending everything is okay, feels like a betrayal. Maybe I need to take a day off, just to recharge and figure out how to move forward. My heart is telling me that's the right thing to do.<|eot_id|>"

The dust that coated the frame was a fitting metaphor for the desolation that lay ahead - a barren landscape devoid of warmth or light.\n\nTheir child's first birthday, a milestone that should have brought us together in celebration, now loomed as a solitary occasion, a stark testament to my isolation. I felt the weight of my solitude bearing down upon me, a crushing burden that threatened to consume me whole. Every passing moment ticked away with agonizing slowness, each second a countdown to the inevitable heartache that awaited me.\n\nWhy must fate conspire against me thus? Why must I be forced to navigate this desolate existence alone, bereft of the love and companionship that once sustained me? The thought sent a wave of despair crashing through me, leaving me gasping for air. And yet, even as I trembled with anticipation of the horrors to come, I couldn't help but feel a twisted sense of morbid fascination - as if drawn to the very abyss that yawned open before me, helpless to look away.\n\nIn that moment, I knew that our happiness had been nothing more than a fleeting mirage, a brief respite from the unrelenting darkness that lurked just beyond the horizon. And I was powerless to stop its approach, unable to escape the maelstrom that would soon engulf me.<|eot_id|>"

This letter is a slap in the face, a reminder that some people will stop at nothing to sabotage what little happiness we've managed to rebuild.\n\nI need to talk to him about this, to make it clear that I won't be manipulated or guilt-tripped into doubting myself.

I deserve better than to be treated like this.\n\nAnd another thing - why did they even bother using our old address label? Wasn't that enough? Did he really think I'd forget where I came from?

I wish he would just take some responsibility for his own actions, you know? Like, maybe try sleeping on his side instead of his back, or using earplugs or something.
