She hasn't painted anything meaningful since he left, two years ago today. A sudden gust of wind rattles the window behind her, startling her into dropping the brush onto the dusty floor. As she bends to pick it up, a small, framed photo tucked beneath an easel catches her eye - them laughing together on their honeymoon. The weight of that carefree happiness feels heavier now than any canvas could bear. She picks up the photo instead of the brush, tracing its edges with fingers that ache for something more tangible than despair.",

Like, why else would I drop my brush? I swear, the universe is conspiring against me. And now, as I bend down to pick it up, I see this little photo of us on our honeymoon. Just sitting there, taunting me with all the things we've lost. Why did it have to be right next to the brush? It's like fate or something. \n\nI don't know why I even bother trying to paint anymore. What's the point? He's gone, and I'll never be happy again. But at least I can hold onto these memories, right? So, I'll just put the brush away and pick up the photo instead. Maybe if I stare at it long enough, I'll feel something. Anything.<|eot_id|>"

I caught a glimpse of the message on her phone, and my heart sank. Alex, of all people, sending her jokes and carefree messages - it was almost too much to bear. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of nostalgia, unable to escape the weight of our past.\n\nI tried to push aside the emotions, telling myself it was just a harmless conversation, but the ache within me refused to subside. I couldn't help but wonder if she'd ever truly moved on, if the laughter still echoed in her mind, reminding her of me. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I knew I had to retreat, to escape the painful reality that lingered in every corner of this house.\n\nI made my way back to the safety of my study, the silence enveloping me like a shroud. At least here, I could pretend that nothing had changed, that the world outside these walls remained unchanged. But the sound of her laughter lingered, haunting me, a constant reminder of what I'd lost, and what I could never have again.<|eot_id|>"
