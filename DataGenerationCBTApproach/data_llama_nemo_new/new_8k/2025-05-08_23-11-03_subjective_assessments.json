The familiar hum of her home office seemed amplified, each tick of the clock echoing like a distant bomb's countdown in her ears. She had been married to him for decades, yet his sudden silence on the other end of the line, after asking about yesterday's article, felt like an abrupt divorce from their shared reality. Anxiety gnawed at her stomach as she realized tomorrow's paper was due, and she hadn't written a single word.",

Just a hollow shell of what we used to be. And now, with this deadline looming, I'm left to pick up the pieces by myself. Whole days will be wasted if I don't get this story out. I'll never meet my own expectations again.\n\nWhy did I even bother getting married? Now I'm just a single mom, trying to make ends meet while he's off chasing his dreams. Entire days are lost to his absence, and I'm left to deal with the fallout. Tomorrow's paper is going to be a disaster, and I have no one to blame but myself.<|eot_id|>"

And now, with her gone, I was left to face the darkness alone, my every waking moment consumed by the crushing sense of isolation.\n\nI tried calling her, but the phone went straight to voicemail, leaving me with nothing but the oppressive silence of the night. It was as if the universe itself was conspiring against us, determined to drive us further apart.
