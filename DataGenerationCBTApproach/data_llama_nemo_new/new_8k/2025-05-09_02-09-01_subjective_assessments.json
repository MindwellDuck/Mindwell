And now this guy's got the nerve to come at me like I'm some kind of monster?\n\nI've had enough of these parents thinking they know better than me. I've been teaching for years, and I know what works. But no, instead of actually addressing the problem, they just want to scream and yell and make a scene. It's pathetic. And now I'm going to have to deal with the fallout from this drama, all because some self-absorbed parent can't handle reality.\n\nI'm telling you, if I had a dollar for every time someone like this came at me, I'd be set for life. But no, instead I get stuck dealing with entitled parents who think the world revolves around their precious little children. Well, let me tell you, it doesn't. And neither does my sanity.<|eot_id|>"
