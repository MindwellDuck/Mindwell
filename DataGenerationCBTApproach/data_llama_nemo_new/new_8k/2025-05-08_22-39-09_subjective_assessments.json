The thought of those masked figures, their faces twisted with malice, still haunts me to this day. And now, here we were, staring down the barrel of another potential attack.\n\nMy heart was racing like a jackrabbit, pounding out a frantic rhythm that threatened to consume me whole. I felt like I was trapped in some sort of waking nightmare, unable to escape the clutches of fate. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to act, to take control of the situation before it was too late.

The worst-case scenarios played out like a macabre dance in my mind, each step leading inexorably towards disaster. I pictured the man in the hoodie, his eyes gleaming with malevolence as he pulled out...whatever it was he had hidden away. My breath caught in my throat as I imagined the sound of shattering glass, the scent of smoke and sweat filling the air.\n\nIt's almost as if I knew exactly what was going to happen. As if I had seen it all before, and was powerless to stop it. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, leaving me feeling cold and clammy beneath my skin. This was it - the end times.
