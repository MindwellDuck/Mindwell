And now, thanks to their thoughtless behavior, I've got a ruined shirt and a soggy sandwich.\n\nThat guy who spilled his drink last week was just as careless, but did anyone say sorry? No, of course not. He just walked away, leaving me to clean up after him. It's like nobody cares about anyone but themselves. The whole point of having a social interaction is supposed to be sharing a pleasant experience, but instead, it's all about how others treat us.\n\nI'm starting to think that hospitals are just breeding grounds for rudeness and entitlement. Everyone's so caught up in their own little worlds, they can't even be bothered to acknowledge someone else's presence. And don't even get me started on the state of the cafeteria \u2013 it's like they expect us to eat off the floor if we're lucky.<|eot_id|>"

We're all just pretending to care about sales and discounts. It's all just a big show.\n\nI force myself to smile, but inside, I'm dying. Why can't anyone appreciate the little things? I used to love coming to work, seeing the customers, helping them find what they need. Now it just feels like a chore. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this job.
