Now he's lying there, completely out of it, and I'm stuck delivering the worst news ever to his family. They're all going to hate me for this, and rightfully so. I'm the one who's been carrying the weight of his recklessness all these months.\n\nIt's not like I didn't try to warn him, though. I sent him texts, emails, even showed up at his doorstep multiple times. But did he take it seriously? Nope. He just brushed me off and kept on doing whatever it was he was doing. And now...now he's paying the price.\n\nI feel so sick to my stomach thinking about it. I keep replaying all the times I tried to get through to him, wondering why he couldn't see the warning signs. Wasn't I clear enough? Did I say it loud enough? Ugh, it's all just so frustrating and unfair.\n\nI guess some people are just beyond saving, and my friend is definitely one of them. I mean, he's been given every opportunity to turn his life around, and yet he still managed to screw everything up. It's just...ugh.<|eot_id|>"

Would we have kids by now? I wonder if he ever thinks about me sometimes, or if he's completely moved on. Does he think about all the good times we had?\n\nIt's weird, but seeing those old photos makes me realize how fast life slips away. One minute you're holding onto something, and the next it's gone. I guess that's why I'm always wondering what could've been. Maybe someday I'll find out. \n\nSometimes I get these thoughts, like \"what if\" scenarios, and they just keep playing over and over in my head. It's hard to shake them off.
