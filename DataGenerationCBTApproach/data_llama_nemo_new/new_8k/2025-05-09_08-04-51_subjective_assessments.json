What if he's found someone younger, someone more energetic, someone who actually appreciates him?\n\nI feel like I'm stuck in some kind of nightmare, reliving every moment we've shared, wondering what could have been done differently. What if I had been more supportive? What if I had been more understanding? What if I had been more... attractive?\n\nIt's not fair, it's just not fair. He's always been so distant, so detached, but I thought our love was strong enough to overcome anything. But now I realize, maybe I was just holding on too tight. Maybe I was suffocating him.\n\nWhat if I let go, though? What if I gave him the space he needs? Would he come back to me? Or would he stay with her, with her youth and her energy? Ugh, the thought alone makes my stomach turn.\n\nI need to talk to him, I need to know what's really going on. But what if he tells me the truth? What if he says he's leaving because he's unhappy in our marriage? What if he says he's leaving because he's found someone better? No, no, no... I don't want to hear it. I don't want to face the reality of our crumbling relationship.\n\nBut still, the questions linger, haunting me like a ghost. What if... what if... what if...<|eot_id|>"
