As he reached for his coffee maker, his hand trembled slightly, a subtle reminder of last night's late-night paperwork. Suddenly, the room spun, and he grasped at the countertop to steady himself.\n\n\"Honey,\" he called out, \"I don't feel so good.\" No response. He turned around, heart pounding, and saw an empty bed. His wife was gone. The panic surged through him like a tidal wave. He rushed to their bedroom door, only to find it ajar, the cool morning air seeping in from the open window. His mind raced with worst-case scenarios as he fumbled for his phone to dial her number. No answer. Just then, the front door creaked open downstairs, and he heard a familiar voice calling out, \"I'm home! Sorry I forgot my keys.\" He sank to the floor, relief washing over him like a warm shower, but the panic lingered, a shadow at the edge of his mind.",

I just need to get my coffee going, and everything'll be okay. That's when I realize... she's not here. Where the hell did she go? I call out, but no one answers. Panic mode activated, bro. I'm talking racing heartbeat, sweating bullets, the whole nine yards. I rush to our bedroom, and it's unlocked. Like, what the fuck? She could've been kidnapped or something. I'm literally shaking like a leaf, and my mind's running wild with worst-case scenarios. I grab my phone to call her, but she doesn't answer. I'm starting to freak out, dude.\n\nJust as I'm about to lose it, I hear the front door open, and my wife walks in, looking all nonchalant. \"Hey, sorry I forgot my keys.\" What the actual fuck? Is she kidding me? I sink to the floor, feeling like I've been punched in the gut. Relief washes over me, but it's tainted by this lingering sense of dread. I guess I'm just really sensitive today. Whatever, let's just forget this happened, right?<|eot_id|>"
