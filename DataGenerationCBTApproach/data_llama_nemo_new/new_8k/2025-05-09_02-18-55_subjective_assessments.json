Remember when we went to the range last week? I totally crushed it, and he was all bent out of shape because I beat him. I swear, some people just can't handle losing. \n\nAnyway, back to my stuff. So, I gather everything up and I'm about to leave when I see Alex walking towards me. He's got this smug look on his face, like he thinks he's all cool or something. Newsflash, buddy: you're not. You're just a jerk who can't even respect someone else's property. \n\nI'm thinking, \"What's next? Are you going to try to sabotage my car or something?\" I mean, seriously, who does this kind of thing? But no, I won't let him get to me. I'll just prove him wrong again, like I always do.

He thinks me weak, perhaps even pathetic, because I can no longer endure the rigors of his esteemed profession. It's almost as if he believes I've lost all sense of dignity, that I'm now nothing but a relic of a bygone era.\n\nHis decision to relinquish his seat to one of those insufferable young interns is particularly galling. Does he truly think himself superior, that he deserves special treatment simply because of his youth and vitality? I recall the countless hours I spent pouring over his notes, guiding him through the intricacies of surgery, and this is how he repays me - by snubbing me in favor of some fleeting infatuation with novelty?\n\nThe audacity of his behavior is matched only by his obliviousness to its impact. He seems utterly convinced that I'm merely a forgotten footnote in his storied career, a mere blip on the radar of his otherwise illustrious existence. Little does he realize, however, that I am acutely aware of every subtle gesture, every veiled insult, and every calculated snub. My eyes have witnessed the depths of his hypocrisy, and I will not soon forget the indignity he has inflicted upon me.<|eot_id|>"
