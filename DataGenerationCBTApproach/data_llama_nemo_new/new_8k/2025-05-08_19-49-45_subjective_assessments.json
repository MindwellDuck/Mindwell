I'm literally living in the dark, with no hope of rescue. My parents would never even bother coming back for me if I wasn't dead. They've been ignoring me for years anyway. This is just proof that I don't matter to anyone.\n\nIt's all over. I might as well just wait for the inevitable. At least when I'm gone, nobody will have to deal with me anymore. No more arguments, no more drama... just silence. And darkness. Perpetual darkness. That sounds kind of nice, actually. Less pain, less stress. Just blackness.<|eot_id|>"

Would it have made a difference?\n\nHe looks so frail, so weak. I can barely recognize him. I feel like I'm staring at a stranger, but one who's still somehow connected to me. We exchanged pleasantries, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of dread. What if this is it? What if this is the end?\n\nWe talked about everything and nothing, just small talk to fill the silence. But beneath it all, I was thinking about what-ifs. What if I'd taken more time to review his test results? What if I'd referred him sooner? What if... what if... what if...\n\nI know I shouldn't be dwelling on these thoughts, but they're eating away at me. It's like I'm stuck in some kind of nightmare, reliving the same moments over and over. And every time I think I've woken up, another what-if creeps back in.\n\nI tried to reassure him, to tell him everything will be okay, but deep down, I'm terrified. Terrified of losing him, of failing him. What if I'm not good enough? What if I've already failed him?\n\nAs we parted ways, I couldn't help but wonder what the future holds. Will he get better? Or will it be too late? The uncertainty is suffocating me, and all I can do is sit here and ask myself the same question over and over: what if...<|eot_id|>"

She pauses at her desk, noticing a pile of assignments left untouched since her husband's funeral three weeks ago. Her colleague, Sarah, approaches, holding out the stack with an apologetic smile. \"I'm sorry, but the editor needs these done by today. Can you take them?\" she asks, avoiding eye contact before walking away.\n\nThe woman feels a familiar pang of rejection as she looks at the assignments, each one a reminder that life goes on without her husband. She hesitates, then reluctantly takes the stack, tucking it into her bag with trembling hands. As she turns to leave, another colleague, Tom, passes by without acknowledging her presence, engrossed in his own work.

If she really cared, she'd know exactly what I needed \u2013 someone to sit down with me, to listen, to hold my hand. But instead, she just handed me a mountain of work and told me to deal with it. Like I didn't already know how to handle everything on my own.\n\nAnd Tom... Ugh, don't even get me started on Tom. He barely acknowledged me, like I was invisible. It was like he thought I was some kind of ghost haunting the office. Newsflash, Tom: I'm right here, still hurting, still grieving. You can't just ignore me and expect everything to go back to normal.\n\nWhy did everyone have to be so insensitive? Didn't they realize that I was still trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart? That I needed time, space, and understanding? It felt like no one got it, like no one truly understood what I was going through.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of inadequacy, but it lingered, gnawing at me like a constant reminder of my failure. Maybe if I just worked harder, pushed myself to be more productive, maybe things would start to look up.
