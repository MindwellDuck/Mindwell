The house felt empty without her laughter filling its rooms. He found himself staring at their wedding photo, the corners worn from years of loving touch. A soft meow from their cat brought him back to the present. He picked up the feline, burying his face in its fur, seeking comfort in its warmth. The doorbell rang, startling him. It was a neighbor with a casserole, offering condolences for their recent miscarriage. His heart sank as he took the dish, his sorrow renewed by the sympathetic gaze of another.",

The cat's soft purring was nice, but it didn't really fill the void. When the doorbell rang, I wasn't expecting anyone, especially not after... well, you know. But here was this neighbor, bearing gifts and trying to be kind. Her expression was genuinely sympathetic, but all I could think about was how she probably knew more than she let on. Did she suspect something? Was she just pretending to care? The casserole was nice, I suppose, but it didn't change anything. It's just going to sit there, untouched, while I'm stuck in this emptiness.<|eot_id|>"
