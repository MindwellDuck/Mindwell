The uncertainty was unnerving, to say the least.\n\nFurthermore, considering the fact that this person's family may have had dealings with our department in the past, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there might be a deeper motive at play here. Perhaps they're seeking revenge for some perceived injustice, and tomorrow's confrontation will only serve as a catalyst for further escalation.\n\nIt's disconcerting to think that someone could harbor such animosity towards those who put their lives on the line every day.
