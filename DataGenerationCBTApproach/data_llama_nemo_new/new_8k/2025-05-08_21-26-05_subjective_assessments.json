I feel like such a careless idiot.\n\nI keep replaying our conversation yesterday in my head, wondering what I said wrong. Did I say something about the ring? Was there a hint of disrespect in my voice? I wish I could go back and take it all back. But no, I had to go and make a big deal out of nothing.\n\nAnd now, every time I close my eyes, I see her face staring back at me. I can almost hear her whispering, \"You're not worthy of my family's heirlooms.\" It's like she's trying to tell me something, but I don't know what. Maybe I should've kept the ring on today... maybe that would've changed everything.\n\nI hate feeling so guilty and anxious all the time. It's like I'm walking around with a weight on my shoulders, waiting for someone to call me out on it. But who am I kidding? I know exactly why she's upset. It's because I'm not good enough.<|eot_id|>"
