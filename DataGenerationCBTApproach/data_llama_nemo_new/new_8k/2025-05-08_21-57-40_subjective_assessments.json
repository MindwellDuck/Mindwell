But no, every time I see something like this, it's like she's trying to guilt trip me into feeling sorry for her.\n\nI don't know how much more of this I can take. First, she leaves me for some other guy, and now she's got some stupid old recipe book that's just taunting me. I'm starting to think she's just playing some kind of twisted game with me, trying to get under my skin. Well, let me tell you something, sweetie, it's not going to work. I've had enough of your games.\n\nYou know who's really to blame here? Her. She's the one who messed up our marriage, who left me high and dry. And now she's trying to ruin my life with this stupid cake. I'll show her. I'll throw this whole thing out the window and start fresh. No more reminders of her. No more pain.<|eot_id|>"
