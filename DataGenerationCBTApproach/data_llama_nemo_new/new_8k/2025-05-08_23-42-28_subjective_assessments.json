That photograph, carelessly discarded among the dust and shadows, had been the final nail in the coffin. His smile, once so radiant, now appeared mocking, a cruel jest played upon me by fate itself.\n\nIt was clear to me that he had abandoned me, that our marriage had been nothing more than a ruse, a clever facade designed to conceal the rot within. The laughter we shared, the triumphs we celebrated \u2013 all just a distant memory, a fleeting illusion born of naivety. My mind reeled at the thought of how I could have been so blind, so foolishly enamored with a man who had never truly loved me.\n\nIn that moment, I knew I would never be able to forgive him, that the wounds inflicted during our marriage would forever scar me. The typewriter, once a tool of creativity and collaboration, now served as a poignant reminder of all that I had sacrificed for a love that had ultimately proved to be a lie.<|eot_id|>"

So, I just left it there, unfinished and imperfect, a constant reminder of my failure. Maybe someday I'll get back to it, but until then, it's just a shadow of what could've been.\n\nSometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I didn't show it off. Would they care that much? Probably not. But still, it feels like such a big deal to me. Like, either it's perfect, or it's nothing. There's no middle ground. And honestly, I'm not sure which side I'm on right now.<|eot_id|>"

I tried to push it aside, focusing on getting my daughter the help she needed, but my mind kept wandering back to the woman and our shared history.\n\nWhy did she look so familiar? Had we met before?
