The usual chatter was absent; everyone else had gone home to their families hours ago. She reached into her pocket for her wedding ring, a habit she hadn't broken despite it being three years since the divorce. As she rubbed the smooth band between her fingers, she noticed a photo on the bulletin board - a colleague's child in a police uniform, grinning from ear to ear. A pang of regret hit her like a punch to the gut. She looked at her own empty hands, no ring, no child, just calluses and a faint tremor from too many late-night patrols.",

Just a fake smile from some rich kid who doesn't know the first thing about hard work. His parents probably just handed him everything on a silver platter. I swear, it's not fair that he gets to wear a police uniform while I'm still scrubbing toilets.\n\nWhat's the use of getting all sentimental about something that's never going to happen to me? I'll be lucky if I make it out of here with my pension intact. My ex would have left me by now if I didn't have this job. Now I'm stuck with nothing but these calluses and a lifetime of regret.\n\nAt least I'm not one of those pathetic stay-at-home dads who can't even take care of himself. That's just a cop-out.
