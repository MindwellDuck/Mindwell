It's like he's intentionally trying to ruin the whole neighborhood. And what really gets my goat is that he's got the nerve to think he's better than us just because he's made a little money off his \"art\".\n\nThis is all gonna come crashing down eventually. Mark my words. The art world is going to turn on him, and he'll be left with nothing but a bunch of worthless paintings and a garage full of useless junk. And we'll be stuck here, dealing with the fallout. Great. Just great.\n\nWhy does he have to do this to us? Can't he just leave us alone? Ugh, I hate this guy.<|eot_id|>"

It was like they were trying to show off or something.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm over here struggling to get my kids dressed and fed on time. My house is a disaster zone, and I'm pretty sure my husband has been gone for hours already. But do I feel guilty about it? Nope. I mean, why would I? He's always working late anyway. And besides, Sarah's got a maid coming in twice a week. That's just not fair.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on social media. Everyone's posting these perfect little updates about their families and their lives, and it's just so...insecure-making. I mean, what's the point of even having friends if we're all just going to pretend like our lives are perfect? It's exhausting trying to keep up this facade.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm just not cut out for this whole marriage thing. Maybe I'm just not good enough.
