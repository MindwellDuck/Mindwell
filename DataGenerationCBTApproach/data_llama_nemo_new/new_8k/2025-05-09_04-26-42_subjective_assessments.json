Just me, against the world. \n\nAs I dumped the unsold stuff into the trash, I couldn't help but think about all the successful entrepreneurs I've met online. They're always talking about how they started small, worked hard, and now they're living the dream. Meanwhile, I'm over here barely scraping by. It feels like everyone else has it together except me. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole business thing. At least Mike doesn't have to worry about bills and rent and all that stress. He can just focus on making art and traveling... yeah, that sounds way more appealing than my life right now.<|eot_id|>"
