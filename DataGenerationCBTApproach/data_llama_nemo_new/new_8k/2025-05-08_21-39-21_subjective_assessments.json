To even consider altering them was an affront to everything he stood for.\n\nAnd what about the customers? They came here seeking comfort food, familiar flavors that transported them back to a bygone era. A vegan option would only serve to confuse and alienate them. It was a betrayal of the trust they placed in us, a disregard for the traditions that made our restaurant so beloved.\n\nI felt a surge of indignation at the very idea. Who did these newcomers think they were, trying to disrupt the status quo like this? Didn't they understand that some things are just meant to be?
