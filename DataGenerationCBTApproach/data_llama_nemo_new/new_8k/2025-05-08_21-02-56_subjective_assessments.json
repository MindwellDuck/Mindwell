The ones who seemed to effortlessly glide through life, their relationships as effortless as they were flawless. Meanwhile, I was stuck here, alone and unwanted, like some sort of perpetual outcast.\n\nIt's not fair, I thought, seething with indignation. Why do I always get stuck with the leftovers? Why can't I have just one decent relationship to call my own? Is it really too much to ask for someone to see past my awkwardness and appreciate me for who I am?\n\nBut no, instead I'm left to wallow in this pit of despair, surrounded by the very people who make my existence feel like a cruel joke. They're all so... happy. So... successful. And I'm just over here, stuck in this rut, unable to escape the crushing weight of my own inadequacy.\n\nIt's not my fault, I tell myself, trying to shake off the anger that's building inside me. But it's hard not to wonder what I did wrong. What could I have done differently? Was it something I said? Something I wore? Something I didn't say or wear? The questions swirl around in my head, taunting me with their answers.\n\nAnd then I glance around the staff room, taking in the smiling faces of my colleagues. They're all oblivious to my pain, too caught up in their own little worlds to notice the elephant in the room. It's infuriating, really. Can't they see that I'm struggling? That I'm dying over here?\n\nBut of course, they can't. Because I'm just not good enough. Not good enough for them, not good enough for anyone. And that realization hits me like a ton of bricks, leaving me feeling hollow and defeated.<|eot_id|>"

Newsflash, dear husband: your behavior is not acceptable, and I won't stand for it anymore.\n\nI swear, some people have no idea what it means to be a decent human being. My partner's actions are a perfect example of that. He's a master thief, a con artist, and a complete and utter disappointment.
