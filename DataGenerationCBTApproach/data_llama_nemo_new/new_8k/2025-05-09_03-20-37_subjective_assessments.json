The memories came flooding back - the countless nights he'd terrorized our neighborhood, the sleepless hours spent worrying about his next move. And now, here he was, laughing carefree with my neighbor's young son on the porch. It seemed like no one had learned anything from the past.\n\nI tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself I was just being paranoid. But the image lingered, and I found myself wondering if my neighbor was oblivious to the danger that lurked beneath the surface. Hadn't they seen the way Mr. Jenkins would leer at me, the way he'd make snide comments about my family? Didn't they know that his presence was a threat to our entire community?\n\nAs I stepped out of my car, I caught a glimpse of Mr. Jenkins' smile, and my anxiety spiked. Why did he get to enjoy this moment, while I was left to deal with the lingering scars of our past? It wasn't fair. He was the one who'd caused so much pain, and yet he got to bask in the warmth of a sunny afternoon, surrounded by innocent children. I felt a surge of frustration, wondering why justice hadn't been served sooner.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but the sense of injustice lingered. Maybe I was just being overly sensitive, but something didn't feel right. As I walked towards my front door, I couldn't shake the feeling that Mr. Jenkins was waiting for me, watching me, and I knew I'd have to keep a close eye on him. After all, you can never be too careful when dealing with someone like him.<|eot_id|>"
