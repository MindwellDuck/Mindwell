And now, some snobbish art critic comes along and reduces everything I've done to nothing. It's infuriating.\n\nEither they're a mastermind who sees the brilliance in my work, or they're a soulless hack who doesn't know the first thing about art. There's no middle ground - they're either a visionary or a philistine.\n\nHow could they do this to me? Don't they see the passion, the blood, sweat, and tears that went into creating these pieces? They must be blind, completely oblivious to the beauty and emotion that radiates from every brushstroke.\n\nThis isn't just about my art; it's about my very identity. If they don't get it, if they don't understand what I'm trying to say, then maybe I shouldn't even bother showing my work anymore. At least then I'll know I'm not wasting my time.\n\nBut no, I won't give up. I'll keep pushing forward, no matter what they say. Because if they're right, then I'm a failure.

Alas, the sedan mirrored my every move, its relentless pursuit a stark reminder that some entities refuse to be deterred.\n\nMy thoughts careened wildly, a maelstrom of worst-case scenarios threatening to consume me whole. Had my partner abandoned me, leaving me to face this existential threat alone? The missed calls, a cruel taunt, mocking my desperation. Why had he failed to leave a message, to offer even a glimmer of reassurance? The silence was deafening, a void that seemed to yawn open before me like a chasm.\n\nAnd then, the unthinkable: what if our clandestine endeavors had been discovered? What if we were now mere pawns in a game of cat and mouse, our lives hanging precariously in the balance? The thought sent shivers coursing through my frame, my breath coming in ragged gasps as I struggled to maintain a semblance of composure. How could I possibly hope to protect myself against such overwhelming odds?
