Like, doesn't she have any respect for other people's property? I swear, some folks have no idea how to treat someone else's stuff.\n\nI'm not even mad at her, really. I'm just disappointed. Disappointed that there are people out there who don't appreciate the little things in life. You know, like a beautiful garden that takes years to build. It's just sad, is all.\n\nBut hey, I guess I'll just let it go. I mean, what's the point in getting worked up over it? She's probably just some lost tourist or something.
