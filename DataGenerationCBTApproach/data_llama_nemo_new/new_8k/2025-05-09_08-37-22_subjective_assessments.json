Newsflash: just because your grandma had Parkinson's doesn't mean everyone else does too. That guy was just trying to intimidate me, but I'm not going to let him win. I'll just hand him his change and pretend he didn't say anything. But honestly, if I were him, I'd probably do the same thing to anyone who looked like they could give him a hard time.\n\nIt's just so frustrating when people think they can treat others like dirt and get away with it.
