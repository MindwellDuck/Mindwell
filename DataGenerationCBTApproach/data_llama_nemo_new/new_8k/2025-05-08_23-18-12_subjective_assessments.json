Had she been trying to send some sort of message? Was this a careless oversight or a calculated attempt to stir up emotions? Whatever the reason, I couldn't shake off the feeling that our relationship has taken a turn for the worse.\n\nHer presence still lingers in every corner of my life, and now, even the most mundane objects seem to hold secrets and hidden meanings.

His eyes darted around the store like he was searching for an escape route, and when he finally mustered up the courage to speak, he did it with such disdain. It's clear he thinks I'm beneath him, that I'm somehow less capable because I've been working here longer.\n\nBut what's even more galling is that I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror before he came over. My face was flushed, and I could feel my heart racing. It's not like I'm some fragile ego that needs validation; I'm a competent professional, after all. Yet, every time someone like Mr. Thompson comes along, I'm reminded of my own inadequacies.\n\nAs I watched him walk away, I couldn't help but notice the tiny crack in the cash register's glass. It's almost as if the universe is conspiring against me, highlighting my perceived shortcomings at every turn. I mean, what are the chances that the cash register would malfunction on the same day I'm feeling particularly self-conscious about my role in the store?

I mean, come on, it's not like I'm some kind of bad luck magnet or anything. But at the same time, it feels like he's just dumping me like yesterday's trash. Which, let's be real, is exactly what he did.\n\nAnd another thing, why do I always end up getting stuck with the cleaning bills? Is it because I'm the one who actually works hard around here? Or is it just because I'm the one who loves him enough to put up with his crap? Either way, it's not fair. He's just going to go out there and find someone else to take care of him, isn't he?\n\nI swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just a accessory to his life, not a partner.
