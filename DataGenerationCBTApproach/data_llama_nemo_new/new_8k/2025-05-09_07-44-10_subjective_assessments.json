It's like he thinks he owns the place just because he's got a few fancy degrees.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the smell. That perfume they wear together is just nauseating. I can practically taste the deceit. I feel like I've been punched in the gut, like all the air has been sucked out of me. How could she do this to me?\n\nI know I shouldn't be so upset, but it's hard not to when it feels like she's deliberately trying to sabotage our team. I'll make sure to keep a close eye on her from now on. Maybe if I just confront her, she'll realize how much she's hurting me. But deep down, I know I'm right. She's just jealous of my skills and my success.<|eot_id|>"
