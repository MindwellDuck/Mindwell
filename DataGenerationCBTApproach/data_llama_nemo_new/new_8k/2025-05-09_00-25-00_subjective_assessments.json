Why did I have to be faced with this onslaught of unread emails when I'm already reeling from the latest developments in my divorce? It's not like I haven't been dealing with enough stress lately; do they really think I can handle one more thing?\n\nMy mind began to wander, conjuring up memories of past failures \u2013 the ones where I'd invested countless hours into a case, only to see it go cold or get botched by some incompetent colleague. And now, here I am, staring down a mountain of unread emails, wondering if anyone even cares about my work anymore.\n\nIt's just so... unfair. Like, what's the point of even trying? Maybe I should just give up now and save everyone the trouble. But no, I'll just sit here, frozen in anxiety, waiting for someone, anyone, to tell me that everything will magically sort itself out. Because, clearly, that's exactly how the world works.<|eot_id|>"

He hadn't called, too consumed by the patient who had slipped into a coma after his surgery. She'd understand, she always did. But as he finally stepped into their dimly lit home, greeted only by silence and the faint scent of last night's meal still lingering in the air, he felt it. Guilt, heavy and palpable, like a weight pressing down on his chest. Her untouched dinner sat on the table, now cold and unappetizing, next to a note that simply read, \"I waited.\"",

Two hours past our scheduled reunion, and yet, there was no sign of her. The silence was oppressive, a physical presence that weighed upon my chest, making every breath a struggle.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder if she would ever return to me, or if this moment marked the beginning of the end. The thought sent a chill down my spine, and I felt a lump form in my throat as I gazed upon the untouched dinner, now congealed and cold, a testament to the emptiness that had taken up residence in my heart. That note, scribbled in haste, seemed to whisper a haunting truth - that I had failed her, that I had let her wait, and that the consequences of my actions would be dire.\n\nEvery tick of the clock brought me closer to the abyss, and I could feel the darkness gathering around me, a suffocating shroud that threatened to consume me whole. I knew that I would never be able to escape the guilt that now haunted me, that it would follow me forever, a constant reminder of my failure to be there for her when she needed me most. And as I stood there, frozen in despair, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was staring into the face of a future devoid of hope, a future that would forever be tainted by the knowledge of what I had done.<|eot_id|>"
