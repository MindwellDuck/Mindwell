Maybe we were just deluding ourselves, clinging to a dream that was doomed from the start. But no, I refuse to entertain such notions. We were visionaries, pioneers pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. Our failure was merely a setback, a minor blip on the radar of progress.\n\nBut the letter...oh, the letter haunts me still.
