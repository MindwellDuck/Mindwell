Nobody wants anything to do with me.\n\nI've been trying to get back out there, make connections, but it's like hitting a brick wall every time. People don't want to talk to me, they don't want to hear my story. They're all too busy with their own lives, their own problems. And I'm just... forgotten.

And I'm left here, alone, wondering why nobody even bothers to notice me anymore.\n\nWhy does this keep happening to me? Is it because I'm not good enough? Because I'm not interesting? Or is it something deeper? Something more fundamental? Whatever it is, I know one thing - I'll never be able to shake off this feeling of worthlessness.
