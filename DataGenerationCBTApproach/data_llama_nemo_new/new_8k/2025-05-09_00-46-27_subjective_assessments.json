I'm starting to think I'm just holding them back.\n\nI swear, I used to be the center of their universe, and now it's like I'm just a distant memory. The nurse probably thinks she's doing me a favor by putting that thing here, but really, she's just rubbing it in my face. I mean, who needs reminders of what I've lost? Not me, that's for sure. I'll just get rid of it tomorrow. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Get rid of it and move on. But seriously, why did she even leave it here? Doesn't she know I don't want to see it?\n\nIt's just so... pointless. We were never meant to be anyway. I was just holding her back. And the kids, they deserve better than some old guy like me.

There's no middle ground; the loss of my dear friend's presence is either a catastrophic blow, or a negligible blip on the radar of my workday. I refuse to accept anything less than the former. The notion that we might have simply grown accustomed to their absence, like a gentle fade-out, is laughable. No, the reality is stark and unyielding: their departure represents the very end of an era, leaving naught but a barren wasteland in its wake.\n\nI shall never again take for granted the simple joys of sharing a meal with someone who understood me, someone who laughed at my jokes and shared in my passions. The memories we forged will forever remain etched in my mind, a bittersweet reminder of all that I've lost.
