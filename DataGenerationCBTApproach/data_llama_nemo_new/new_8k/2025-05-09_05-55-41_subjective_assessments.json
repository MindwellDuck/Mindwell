I need to get some inspiration from her right now.\n\nI was talking to my wife about this the other day, and she said I'm always so supportive of my friends' careers. And honestly, what's not to be supportive of? We went through art school together, we've been friends for years... it's only natural that I'd want to see her succeed.\n\nBut anyway, back to Sarah's show. I heard it's going to be huge. The gallery is one of the most prestigious in the city, and she's got a whole room dedicated to her work. I'm definitely going to try to make it. I'll bring my wife, and we can catch up with everyone there.\n\nIt's funny, I was thinking about how much I admire Sarah's confidence lately. She's always been so fearless with her art, never afraid to take risks. I wish I could be more like that. Maybe I'll start working on some new pieces inspired by her style.\n\nI don't know why I'm even thinking about this, but I feel like I need to do something to support Sarah right now. Maybe I'll write her a letter or something. Yeah, that's what I'll do. A heartfelt letter to congratulate her on her success.<|eot_id|>"
