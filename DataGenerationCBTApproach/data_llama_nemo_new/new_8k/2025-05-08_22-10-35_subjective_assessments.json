Can't they see I need my phone to survive? Do they not care about people like me who are just trying to live their lives? This is ridiculous. I'm starting to think they're just trolling me, watching me suffer in this darkness. Unbelievable.\n\nAnd another thing, why did this have to happen today? Of all days. I had plans, man. I was supposed to meet up with friends, go out, have some fun. Now, I'm stuck here, alone, in the dark, wondering if anyone will ever find me. Great, just great. Just peachy.<|eot_id|>"
