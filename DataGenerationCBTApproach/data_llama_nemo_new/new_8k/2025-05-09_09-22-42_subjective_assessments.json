It's like they're trying to make it easy for us to get robbed blind.

I'm telling you, it's a whole system designed to keep us vulnerable. Every time I hear those stupid footsteps echoing off the walls, I know someone's gonna come out of nowhere and try to rip my throat out. I'm seriously considering moving to a different city, where the streets aren't crawling with lunatics.
