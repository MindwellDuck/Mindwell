The way they laughed, the way they spoke over one another, it all seemed so... deliberate.\n\nI wonder what they're really discussing, what secrets they're sharing behind closed doors. Are they talking about my case? Did something go wrong during my treatment? I try to push the thought away, but it lingers, refusing to be silenced. What if they've discovered something I don't know about? What if they think I'm not fit to practice medicine?\n\nDr. Smith caught my eye, and for a moment, our gazes locked. He looked at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance, I could swear. But when he turned back to Dr. Johnson, his expression changed, and he smiled warmly. Warmly! As if he genuinely cared about my well-being. I'm not buying it.\n\nThis whole scene feels like a carefully constructed charade. They're playing a game, and I'm just a pawn. I need to get out of here, to clear my head. Maybe I'll schedule a follow-up appointment, just to make sure everything is okay. Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.<|eot_id|>"
