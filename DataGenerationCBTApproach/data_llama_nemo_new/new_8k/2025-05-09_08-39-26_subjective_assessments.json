The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the dusty windows, highlighting the emptiness of each room she passed. In the study, her husband's old leather chair still bore the imprint of his body, a silent echo of his presence that made her heart ache with regret. She picked up the framed photograph from the desk - them laughing together on their last holiday, lines etched around their eyes from years of joy and sorrow shared. Her reflection in the glass stared back at her, gray hair and wrinkles telling a story of time passed, but it was the unshed tears glistening in her eyes that spoke of the regret that lingered like a bitter taste on her tongue.",
