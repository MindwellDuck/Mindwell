His name became synonymous with the triumphs we had shared, while mine remained shrouded in obscurity. The memory of that fateful day, when he basked in the glory of our collaborative effort, now seemed like a cruel mockery.\n\nMy fingers instinctively tightened around the mouse, as if grasping for something tangible to counterbalance the suffocating sense of indignation that threatened to consume me. And yet, despite the turmoil brewing within, I found myself compelled to delete the offending message, erasing the painful echoes of a bygone era from my inbox.\n\nIn doing so, I couldn't help but wonder if this gesture would somehow validate my own perceived worthlessness, or serve as a poignant reminder of the transience of success.
