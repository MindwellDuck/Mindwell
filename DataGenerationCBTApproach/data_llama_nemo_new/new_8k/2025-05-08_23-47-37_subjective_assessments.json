Another day, another dollar gone to pay rent while everyone else seemed to thrive on their art.

And then, to add insult to injury, my neighbor appeared at the door, bearing an invitation to some pretentious gallery opening, no doubt showcasing the latest triumphs of the art world's newest darlings. The young artist, barely out of her teenage years, was apparently poised to make waves with her debut solo show. How quaint. How utterly... predictable.
