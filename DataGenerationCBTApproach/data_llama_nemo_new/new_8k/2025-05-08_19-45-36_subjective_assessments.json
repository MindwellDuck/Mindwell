Like, what's the hurry? Can't he see I'm trying to process this betrayal right here? I've got my thyme, but honestly, what's the point of even having it if he's just going to leave me behind? This is a total slap in the face, and I'm not going to let it slide.\n\nI mean, seriously, has he forgotten everything we went through together? All the late-night conversations, the laughter, the tears... does none of that matter to him anymore? It's like he's erased our entire history, and I'm left standing here feeling like a complete joke. Well, let me tell you something, pal: I won't forget. I'll never forget the way you treated me, and I'll make sure everyone knows about it.\n\nYou know what? Forget the thyme. Who needs thyme when you've got revenge on your mind? I'm going to go ahead and assume the worst about every single thing he does from now on. He's probably cheating on her too, and he thinks he's so much better than me because he's got a new plaything. Well, let me tell you, buddy: you're not as slick as you think you are. I'll be waiting for you, and when I catch up with you, you're going down.<|eot_id|>"

I can already imagine how it would feel to find out - like a punch to the gut every day.\n\nAnd those likes on our posts? Just a coincidence, right?
