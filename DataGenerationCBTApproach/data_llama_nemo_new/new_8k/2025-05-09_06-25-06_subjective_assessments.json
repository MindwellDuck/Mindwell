The dinner he'd ordered was growing cold on the counter, untouched since the delivery person had left. His reflection in the window caught his eye - the bags under his eyes seemed heavier today, his shoulders more slumped than usual. He sank onto the couch, staring at the blank TV screen, wondering where everyone else was, why they all seemed to have lives except him. A notification flashed on his phone: \"You've been removed from the project team.\" His stomach churned as he read it again, the words echoing the emptiness around him. He felt a familiar pressure building behind his eyes, threatening to spill over. But tonight, even tears refused to come, leaving him alone with his suffocating silence and cold dinner.",

Forget about it. Those bags under my eyes look like they're trying to escape, and my shoulders are literally sinking into the couch. I'm basically a shadow of my former self. Where did everyone else go? Why can't anyone see how miserable I am?\n\nThat notification on my phone? Just the cherry on top. Being kicked off the project team? Yeah, no surprise there. I'm basically a liability anyway. Who needs someone as broken as me holding them back? At least now I can finally wallow in my own misery without any distractions. Joy.<|eot_id|>"
