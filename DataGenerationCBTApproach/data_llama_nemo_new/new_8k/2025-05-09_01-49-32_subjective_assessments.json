We would've grown old together, built a life, raised kids... But no, fate had other plans. And now I'm left to pick up the pieces, to try and make sense of this godforsaken world.\n\nI swear, every time I look at that photo, I see her smile, and my heart shatters into a million pieces. It's like I'm drowning in my own despair, unable to escape the crushing weight of my grief. I just want to scream, to rage against the universe for taking everything away from me.\n\nBut what's the point, anyway? Nothing good ever comes from happiness. It's all just a facade, a temporary reprieve from the inevitable darkness that awaits us all. I know it, deep down. I can feel it in my bones. She's gone, and I'll never see her again.

Doesn't she care about our marriage anymore?\n\nEvery creak of the old house feels like a betrayal, every shadow cast by the sunlight like a hidden figure watching us. I can feel her eyes on me, even though she's nowhere near. This is war, and I'll show her what it means to cross me.\n\nI need answers, and I need them now. Where did she get this note? Did someone plant it here? Is there more to this than just some careless mistake? I won't rest until I find out the truth, until I expose her deceit once and for all.\n\nAnd when I do, oh God, she'll regret ever crossing me. Regret ever thinking she could play games with my trust. I'll make sure everyone in this town knows what kind of woman she really is \u2013 a cheater, a liar, a manipulator. Mark my words, this isn't over yet. Not by a long shot.<|eot_id|>"

Why hadn't they taken more serious action to address these issues?

There must have been other employees who'd reported similar incidents, only to be dismissed as mere paranoia or overactive imaginations. No, this was no ordinary anxiety; this was a calculated effort to intimidate and undermine confidence. And I was the latest victim of their incompetence.\n\nWith a surge of indignation, I turned to face the darkness, ready to confront whatever malevolent force was responsible for my distress. Little did I know, however, that the true culprit lay not in the shadows, but in my own mind, fueled by years of frustration and disillusionment with the company's priorities.<|eot_id|>"
