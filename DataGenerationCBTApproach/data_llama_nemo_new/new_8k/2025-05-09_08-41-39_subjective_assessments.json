I mean, I do my part, but it feels like he's just expectin' everyone else to pick up the slack.\n\nI guess what really gets under my skin is that he knows I'm stressed out and he just ignores it. Like, I'll tell him about my day and he'll just nod along, makin' supportive noises, but never actually listenin'. It's like, yeah, I know you're listenin', buddy.
