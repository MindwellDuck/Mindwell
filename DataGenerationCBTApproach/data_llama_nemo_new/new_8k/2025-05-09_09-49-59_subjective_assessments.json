The notion that I would willingly subject myself to such gastronomic torture is nothing short of laughable.

The promise of a satisfying meal has been reduced to a hollow lie, a cruel trick played by the culinary world. I shall not soon forget this harrowing experience, nor shall I soon forgive the kitchen's egregious transgression against my refined sensibilities.\n\nAnd yet, despite the revulsion that grips my heart, I am compelled to acknowledge the faint, lingering whisper of a memory - a fleeting recollection of a pleasant evening spent at Le Coq d'Or, where the atmosphere was convivial and the company warm. But let us not dwell on such trivialities; the true horror lies not in the past, but in the present, where the stench of mediocrity lingers, waiting to assault my senses once more.<|eot_id|>"
