The sauce was a travesty, a catastrophe of flavors that would have been better suited to a children's birthday party. And don't even get me started on the garnish \u2013 a limp, wilted sprig of parsley that seemed to have been plucked from the garden and slapped onto the plate with all the care of a slack-jawed amateur.\n\nBut, of course, no one ever mentions the exceptional quality of our other dishes. The soups are always creamy and rich, the meats are always cooked to perfection, and the vegetables are always... well, they're usually not as egregious as the offending sauce. Still, one can't help but wonder how such a glaring mistake could occur under my watchful eye. I mean, surely someone must have noticed the subpar presentation before it reached the table? But alas, I suppose that's the problem \u2013 I'm surrounded by incompetent fools who can't even be bothered to elevate their craft to the level expected of a reputable establishment like ours.\n\nAnd now, to make matters worse, I've received yet another scathing review from some anonymous critic who clearly has no idea what they're talking about. \"Overrated\" indeed. More like \"overhyped,\" if you ask me. I'll have them know that we're doing just fine, thank you very much \u2013 we're just ahead of the curve, that's all.
