He sat back, defeated, as the hopelessness he'd been fighting off all day finally consumed him.",

Those kids were always so ungrateful anyway.\n\nI wonder why the school can't just hire someone else to teach these classes. Maybe they're too busy dealing with all the problems caused by teachers like me. At least they don't have to deal with the emotional baggage of having to say goodbye to students every year. I'm just a teacher, not some kind of emotional support system. If they want to get rid of me, maybe they should start by getting rid of all the old desks and chairs.
