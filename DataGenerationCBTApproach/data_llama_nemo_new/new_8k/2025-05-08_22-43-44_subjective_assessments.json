He thinks I didn't put enough effort into it, but honestly, I was really struggling with the topic. \n\nI wonder if he's going to give us detention again. I hope so, because it would definitely make me more focused for the rest of the semester. Maybe he's trying to motivate us by making things tough. That's what all good teachers do, right?\n\nI saw Emily whispering to her friend over there, and I bet she's thinking the same thing as me - that Mr. Johnson has no idea what he's doing. We're basically just sitting here waiting for him to realize his mistake. It's like, come on, dude, get your act together!\n\nI'm just glad I got an A on that last test, even though it was a close call. I'm pretty sure Mr. Johnson knows I studied hard for it, but sometimes he just doesn't understand. Oh well, at least I can hold my head high now.<|eot_id|>"
