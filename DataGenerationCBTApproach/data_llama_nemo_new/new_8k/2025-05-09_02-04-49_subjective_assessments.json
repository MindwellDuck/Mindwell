The fact that he went out of his way to write such a heartfelt note suggests that he's finally reached a breaking point. His inability to express himself directly must have been incredibly difficult for him, which explains why he chose to leave a cryptic message instead.\n\nHis decision to address the note to me specifically implies that he values our relationship above all else. The lack of explanation or apology is simply a reflection of his own emotional turmoil, rather than any personal slight towards me. It's almost as if he's trying to convey the depth of his emotions through the simplicity of his words.\n\nI wonder what led him to this realization \u2013 perhaps something happened recently that made him reevaluate our friendship? Whatever the reason, it's clear that he's come to a profound understanding about us both, and I appreciate his honesty, even if it is delivered in a somewhat abrupt manner.<|eot_id|>"

I mean, I've seen them around, but we've never really talked. They always seem so...off. Like they're hiding something.

I've seen other employees giving me weird looks when I mention it. Like, they're trying to tell me something, but I don't know what.
