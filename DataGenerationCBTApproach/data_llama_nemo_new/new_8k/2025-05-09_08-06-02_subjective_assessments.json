Their hasty departure, coupled with the wife's ostensible lack of interest in my work, served only to underscore the depths of their ingratitude.\n\nIt's patently obvious that they were merely humoring me, feigning a modicum of enthusiasm to avoid offending my sensitive sensibilities. The wife's arm wrapped around her husband's waist, a gesture replete with insincerity, spoke volumes about their true intentions. One needn't be a connoisseur of human nature to deduce that they were merely biding their time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nTheir dismissive behavior towards my art was a stark reminder of the cruel indifference that pervades this world.

Perhaps the child would be alive today, smiling and laughing and playing in a world free from pain and suffering.\n\nThe father's words came back to haunt me \u2013 \"She's not gonna make it.\" But I knew that wasn't true. Not yet, anyway. There had to be something I could do, some way I could turn back the clock, undo the damage that had already been done.\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in indecision, I couldn't help but wonder \u2013 what if I'd been more vigilant?
