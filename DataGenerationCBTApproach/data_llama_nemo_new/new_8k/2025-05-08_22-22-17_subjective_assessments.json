It's like I'm the only one who cares about getting anything done around here.\n\nI demand to know why my colleague felt the need to leave such a massive burden on me. Did they think I was made of money? Or perhaps they simply didn't consider the impact their actions would have on someone like me, who's already struggling to keep up with the workload. Whatever the reason, it's clear that they've failed miserably in their duty to support their colleagues.\n\nThis is exactly why I hate working late hours. It's always someone else's fault, and never mine. But I suppose that's just the way things are around here.<|eot_id|>"

And yet, here they sat, oblivious to my plight, lost in the world of fiction.\n\nI must confess, I felt a pang of disappointment, bordering on disillusionment. How could someone so seemingly attentive and supportive be so callously detached when it mattered most? Was it not their duty to offer guidance, to lend a sympathetic ear, or at the very least, acknowledge my struggles?\n\nAlas, it appears that some individuals are simply incapable of grasping the nuances of our collaborative dynamic.
