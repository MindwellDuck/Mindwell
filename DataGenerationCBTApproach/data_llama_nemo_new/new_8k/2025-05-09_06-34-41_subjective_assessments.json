The very idea that someone of her stature would so callously disregard the well-being of a patient is nothing short of appalling. It's clear that she's lost all sense of professionalism and has devolved into a mere caricature of a doctor. Her lack of expertise is simply staggering, and I can only assume that her colleagues are either intimidated by her or too afraid to speak out against her egregious errors.\n\nIt's a wonder anyone takes her seriously, and I'm surprised she hasn't been sued yet. Her reckless disregard for medical protocol is a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash a catastrophe upon our hospital. I shudder to think of the countless lives she may have ruined with her harebrained decisions. And to think, she's still practicing medicine? It's a miracle we haven't had a major disaster on our hands yet.\n\nI do hope someone will finally take action and address this egregious situation before it's too late.
