I could almost hear the faint whisper of footsteps, heavy with malice, coming from the floor above.\n\nMy mind flashed back to our conversation earlier that day, when he casually mentioned that he'd been having some issues with his phone. A nagging thought crept into my consciousness - did he do this? Did he somehow orchestrate this whole scene to get under my skin?\n\nI felt a surge of anger and betrayal, mixed with a healthy dose of paranoia. What else was he hiding? Was he playing me, using me for his own twisted amusement? My grip on the door handle tightened as I struggled to process the implications.\n\nIt was clear to me that he knew exactly what he was doing. This wasn't just a coincidence; it was a calculated move, designed to unsettle me. And now, with my phone gone, I was at his mercy. The thought sent a chill down my spine, and I knew I had to get out of there before things escalated further.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my eyes scanned the hallway with a newfound sense of suspicion. Who else could have done this? And why? The questions swirled in my head, fueling my growing unease.<|eot_id|>"
