Like, what does she know about art anyway?\n\nAnd another thing, why do I always have to work alone? Can't she see that I need some feedback? It's like she thinks I'm just going to magically become a great artist if I just sit here by myself all day. Newsflash: it takes effort and guidance. But no, she just leaves me to figure it out on my own.\n\nI mean, seriously, who tries to recreate a sunset on their first try? It's impossible. I must be doing something wrong. Maybe if she actually showed up to class more often, we could work through this together. But no, she's always MIA. Great, just great.\n\nIt's not like I'm asking for much. Just a little bit of help would go a long way. But no, everyone's too busy with their own stuff to care about mine. Sigh...<|eot_id|>"
