But now...now it's just me, alone with my thoughts, and these biscuits that remind me of everything I've lost.\n\nI wonder if he ever thinks about me, sitting here in this empty kitchen, feeling so...so...fucking isolated. Does he ever miss our little rituals, like baking together on Sundays? I hope he does, because it's hard for me to imagine life without him. And what if he's moved on already? What if he's found someone else, someone who can appreciate his love of baking as much as I did?\n\nThe thought sends a pang through my chest, and I feel a lump form in my throat. I try to shake it off, telling myself it's just nostalgia, but deep down, I know it's more than that. It's fear. Fear of being left behind, fear of losing the connection we shared. And what if I'm too late? What if I've missed my chance to rekindle things, to make him see how much I still care?\n\nI take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but the questions linger, haunting me like a ghost.
