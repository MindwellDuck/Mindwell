That's just laughable.\n\nNewsflash: either I'm a genius teacher who always gets it right, or I'm a complete failure who deserves to be hated by everyone. There's no middle ground here. If someone's going to trash me like this, they might as well go whole hog and tell me I'm the worst thing since sliced bread.\n\nAnd another thing, what's with the anonymity? Can't these people even have the guts to own up to their cowardice? Do they think I'll just magically start teaching boring lessons now that they've made their pathetic little comment? Please. I'd rather die than stoop to their level.\n\nEither I'm a hero who inspires greatness, or I'm a zero who inspires nothing but contempt. And if it's the latter, then maybe I shouldn't bother showing up to work tomorrow. But hey, at least I'll know I went out with a bang.<|eot_id|>"
