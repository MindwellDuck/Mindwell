She pulled her worn coat tighter around herself as she stepped out into the rain, the chill seeping into her bones like an unwelcome companion.

They don't know the struggles I face every day. I'm stuck in this dead-end job, living in a tiny apartment, and dealing with the loneliness. Those girls might look happy, but trust me, they're just faking it.\n\nI'm telling you, this rain's gonna be the start of something terrible. Maybe it'll cause a flood or a power outage or something. Who knows, maybe it'll even lead to a breakup or a lost job. Whatever it is, I'm not ready for it. My nerves can barely handle this much stress already.
