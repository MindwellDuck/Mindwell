We'll be lucky if we can even get the guy stabilized before the lawyers start breathing down our necks. I'm telling you, this is gonna be a nightmare. We're gonna be up all night, and when we finally get some rest, we'll be exhausted and demoralized.\n\nI hate days like this. They're just a reminder of how broken everything is.
