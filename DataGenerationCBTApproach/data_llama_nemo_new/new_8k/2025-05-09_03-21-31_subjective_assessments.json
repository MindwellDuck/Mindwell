It's clear they're merely basking in the reflected glory of someone else's accomplishments, rather than genuinely acknowledging the value of their own work. And what's even more galling is that no one seems to notice \u2013 or care \u2013 about the countless hours I've devoted to this field, the sacrifices I've made, and the unwavering dedication I've shown.\n\nMeanwhile, that naive little ingenue is being coddled and praised for their fleeting successes, while I'm left to wonder if anyone truly values my contributions. It's nothing short of a travesty, and I demand some semblance of justice. Why must I always be relegated to the shadows, while they bask in the spotlight?<|eot_id|>"

How could they do this to me? Didn't they know I'd worked tirelessly to improve, to prove myself worthy of respect? Their laughter echoed through the dining area, a cruel reminder of my inadequacy.
