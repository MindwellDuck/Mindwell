She felt a lump rise in her throat as she watched him, oblivious to the chasm that now yawned between them. The clock ticked on, each second echoing like a hammer blow against the silence.",

And sitting there with his newspaper, completely ignoring me... it's like he's trying to make me feel even more alone.\n\nI keep thinking about all the little things he's done over the years - the times he forgot our anniversary, the nights he stayed out late without telling me, the countless arguments we've had. It's like he's been taking me for granted for decades. And now, when I need him most, he's just sitting there, sipping his coffee, like nothing's wrong.\n\nI know I shouldn't be so hard on him, but it feels like he's just not making an effort anymore. He used to be so romantic, so loving... what happened to that guy? I guess some people just get old and lazy, and I don't know if I can handle it much longer.<|eot_id|>"

Work commitments will always take priority over family gatherings. I shouldn't expect otherwise.
