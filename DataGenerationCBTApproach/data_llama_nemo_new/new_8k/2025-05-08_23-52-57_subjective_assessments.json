Maybe there's some other sign of a break-in. *sigh* Like I don't have enough to worry about already. And what if they're watching me right now? What if they're waiting for me to come out so they can pounce? No, no, no, stop it. You're being paranoid.

I could've sworn I left it right here on the table. Now it's gone. Someone's definitely been messing around in here. This is ridiculous. I need to call the police. Again.<|eot_id|>"

That I'm still just some amateur artist clinging to my glory days?\n\nIt's really quite flattering that he'd take notice of my work after all these years. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that we're both artists now, and he's probably just trying to one-up me by bringing up our shared past. But no, I'm sure it's purely coincidental that he chose to comment on my painting right in front of me. What a lovely coincidence.\n\nAnd the whispers, oh how sweet. He thinks he's being discreet, but really, he's just drawing more attention to himself. I'm sure everyone else in the room is dying to know what he said, and they'll all be talking about it for weeks to come. Meanwhile, I'll just be over here, seething with embarrassment and wondering why I even bothered showing my art in the first place.\n\nBut hey, at least I got a rise out of him.
