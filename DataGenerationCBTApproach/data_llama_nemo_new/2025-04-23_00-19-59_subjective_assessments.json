You okay up there?\" His concern only fueled her guilt. He'd taken the day off to care for their teenage son, stuck home with the flu. She should be helping, not hiding away in her sanctuary of academia.\n\nShe looked around at the stacks of books, the coffee cups with stale remnants of caffeine, the whiteboard filled with her scrawled equations.

It was just toilet paper. Just guilt. Just another day in the life of Dr. Emma Hartley. But it all felt like too much. Too overwhelming.

Newsflash: I'm still the same person who makes dinner and takes care of our kid. I just happen to have a brain that works better when I'm alone with my thoughts. That doesn't mean I don't love them; it means I love them enough to put in the effort required to make us proud.\n\nAnd another thing, what's with the constant reminders?

I mean, come on, I'm a scientist, not a personal shopping assistant.\n\nToilet paper? Seriously? That's what's got me so worked up? I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my mind.

You know why they're laughing? 'Cause they just got back from a goddamn pizza party, celebrating another fucking closed case. And what did I get? A fucking bullet in my shoulder and nightmares every damn night about my wife's lifeless eyes staring back at me. Fuck them all! I haven't had a day off in weeks, and now I've gotta listen to their bullshit 'congrats' tomorrow morning. Resentment doesn't even begin to cover it. I wanna scream, 'Fuck you all!' right in their faces. But I won't, because that's not how this fucking game is played. So here I am, sitting alone in my dark apartment, nursing a bottle of whiskey and a heart full of rage. Fuck my life!\"",

Fifty-four years have passed, and yet, I remain stuck in this never-ending cycle of drudgery. The badge that once symbolized pride now serves as a constant reminder of my insignificance. Every shift feels like an eternity, a never-ending struggle against the crushing tedium that threatens to consume me whole.\n\nI glance out the window, watching as the world outside moves forward with reckless abandon. Meanwhile, I'm trapped in this prison of routine, forced to endure the same monotonous days, week after week. The laughter of those carefree souls \u2013 Jenkins and his cohorts \u2013 echoes through my mind, a cruel taunt that serves as a stark contrast to my own desolate existence.\n\nTheir joy is a distant memory, a fleeting respite from the unrelenting grind that has become my life. I'm left to nurse my wounds, both physical and emotional, in the darkness of my apartment. The whiskey may offer temporary solace, but it's a poor substitute for the sense of purpose that once drove me.\n\nTomorrow will bring more of the same \u2013 hollow congratulations and empty words of encouragement. They'll pat me on the back, telling me what a good job I'm doing, but they'll never truly understand the depths of my despair. I'm just going through the motions, a cog in a machine that seems designed to crush the spirits of those who dare to dream of something more.<|eot_id|>"
