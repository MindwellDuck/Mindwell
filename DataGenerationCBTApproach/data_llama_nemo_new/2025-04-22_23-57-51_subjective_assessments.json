That meeting had been a disaster, and now I was stuck dealing with the fallout.\n\nAs we finished dinner, I noticed the clock on the wall. Only an hour until bedtime. I felt a pang of loneliness wash over me. Another day, another night alone. My wife tried to make small talk, but I tuned her out.

Edith paused, looking down at him. \"You're right, Arch,\" she said, her voice softer now. \"I won't let them get away with it.

His fingers danced upon the keyboard with an almost reverent precision, each keystroke echoing like a confession whispered into the night.\n\nHis wife, Emily, had retired to bed hours ago, her soft breaths filtering through the closed door as she slept, blissfully unaware of the turmoil that churned within him. He envied her peace, craved it even, but knew it was an ocean away from his shores.\n\nThe email had arrived late in the afternoon, a stark white envelope amidst the sprawling metropolis of his inbox. It was from his former mentor, Thomas, now retired and living in seclusion by the sea. The subject line read: \"A Request.\" Jonathan had opened it with trepidation, as one might approach a wounded animal, expecting pain but compelled nonetheless.\n\nThomas wrote of old times, of late nights spent huddled over code, of victories shared and losses mourned. He spoke of Emily, too, of how she had blossomed into a woman of grace and strength since Jonathan had first brought her to the office, her laughter echoing through the halls like sunlight breaking through clouds.\n\nThen came the request. Thomas asked for Emily's number, said he wanted to reach out, catch up on old times. Jonathan felt a chill run down his spine, not from fear but from the sudden, stark memory of Thomas' last day at the office. The way he had looked at Emily, his eyes lingering too long, his smile too wide. The way she had blushed, looking away, and how Jonathan had pretended not to notice.\n\nHe remembered the argument that followed, their first true fight. Emily had been upset, hurt even, accusing him of paranoia. He had shouted then, his voice echoing through their apartment, \"You don't understand! It's not just about you or me. It's about them!\" But she hadn't understood, couldn't understand, because she didn't know the truth.\n\nNow, here it was again, a specter from his past threatening to shatter the fragile peace he had painstakingly rebuilt. He felt a pang of remorse, sharp and poignant as a knife's edge. He had hidden this secret from Emily all these years, thinking it was for her protection, but now it felt like a betrayal.\n\nThe clock on his desk ticked away the seconds, each one echoing with the weight of his decision. Should he tell Emily about Thomas' request? About what had really happened at the office that day? Or should he protect her from this new threat, even if it meant carrying the burden alone?\n\nAs dawn began to break outside, casting long shadows across his desk, Jonathan made his choice. He picked up his phone, his fingers hovering over Emily's name in his contacts list. With a deep breath, he prepared to shatter their peace with the truth he had so long kept hidden.",

She thinks we're happy, that we're just two normal people living our best lives. But I know the truth. I've seen the way Thomas looks at her, the way he smiles when he talks about her. It's not just harmless nostalgia; it's obsession.\n\nIf I tell her, she'll freak out. She'll leave me, take the kids, and never look back.
