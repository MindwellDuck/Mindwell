She held out his phone, its screen cracked like a spiderweb, a single text message illuminated: \"Meet me at midnight. My place. I miss you.\"\n\nHe felt it then, the insecurity, clawing up his spine like a vine, tendrils wrapping around his throat. It wasn't even addressed to him, but it might as well have been. He was used to being second best; after all, he'd married Emily despite her still being in love with her ex.\n\n\"You were supposed to be home hours ago,\" she said, her voice tight. \"I found this when I was cleaning up your mess.\"\n\nHe took the phone, his hands shaking slightly. \"It's not what you think,\" he started, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.\n\n\"Then tell me what to think!\" she snapped, her eyes welling with tears. \"Tell me why my husband is still talking to his ex-girlfriend at midnight!\"\n\nHe opened his mouth, but no words came out. He was a scientist, for crying out loud; he should be able to explain this away logically. But all he could do was stare at the message, the weight of his insecurity crushing him.\n\nEmily waited, her breath hitching in her throat. Then she turned and walked away, leaving him alone with his thoughts and that damn text message. He felt like a specimen under a microscope, exposed, vulnerable. And worse than anything, he knew this wasn't over. Not by a long shot.",

I'm starting to wonder if there's someone else involved here, someone who's been manipulating Emily into thinking I'm cheating on her.\n\nBut the thing is, I didn't send that text. I swear, I would never do something like that. I'm a good guy, I love Emily, and I would never hurt her. So, where did this come from? Was it one of her exes trying to stir up trouble? Or maybe she's just feeling insecure because of something I said or did?\n\nI know I need to talk to her about this, but I'm scared. What if she accuses me of something I didn't do? What if she thinks I'm lying? I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to be accused of something I'm innocent of.\n\nUgh, I just wish she wouldn't jump to conclusions like this.

I need to keep them focused, but how can I when everyone else seems to be against me?\n\nI glance around the room, trying to gather my thoughts. Everyone looks so confident, so prepared. Meanwhile, I'm over here wondering if I've forgotten everything we covered last week. What if I mess up? What if I fail? No, no, no. I won't let that happen. I'll just wing it and hope for the best.\n\nTime to put on a show. I take a deep breath, try to calm my nerves, and begin the lesson. Who needs notes anyway? I've got this. Bring it on, Physics.<|eot_id|>"
