He had been at this for hours, his brushstrokes as tentative as a novice's, his once-bold colors now faded to muted hues on his palette. His partner, Martha, was due to arrive any moment to view the latest addition to his series, \"Decades of Discord.\"\n\nThe bell rang, echoing through the empty house like a gunshot. Albert hurriedly set down his brush, wiping his hands on his paint-stained smock. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for Martha's critique. She was an art critic, after all, her words capable of elevating or shattering an artist's reputation.\n\nMartha swept into the room, her keen eyes immediately zeroing in on the canvas. Albert watched nervously as she approached, her heels clicking against the hardwood floor like a ticking clock. She stood before the painting, her hands clasped behind her back, her silence deafening.\n\n\"Well?\" Albert finally blurted out, his embarrassment beginning to boil over into irritation.\n\nMartha turned to him, her expression unreadable. \"It's... abstract,\" she said, her voice laced with something that sounded dangerously like pity.\n\nAlbert felt the heat rise in his cheeks, spreading down his neck and across his chest like wildfire. He had poured himself into this series, each painting a catharsis of sorts, an exploration of his past and present. And here Martha was, dismissing it as mere 'abstract.'\n\n\"You don't understand,\" he began, his voice trembling with embarrassment and anger, \"This is me. This is my life, laid bare on canvas.\"\n\nMartha raised an eyebrow, her expression unmoved. \"Then perhaps you should try laying it out a little clearer, Albert,\" she replied coolly. \"As it stands, it's just... confused.\"",

His father was dead, had been for years. What could there possibly be to find? He snatched the envelope from her hand, tearing it open with shaking fingers.

I swear, I've been saying it for years - we're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nAnd then, when I got to the precinct, I found out about the gas cans dumped all over downtown. I told you, I told you. This is exactly what happens when you let your guard down. You let the wolves run wild, and next thing you know, the whole place is burning.\n\nI'm telling you, it's like the universe is just waiting for us to slip up so it can pounce. I mean, I've been a cop for 20 years, and I've seen it all. The corruption, the crime, the decay... it's all just a matter of time before it all comes crashing down.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the politicians. They're just as bad, maybe worse. They're more concerned with lining their own pockets than actually doing anything to help the community. I mean, what's the point of having a police department if we're just going to sit back and watch the city burn?\n\nIt's like, I know I'm not supposed to say these things, but someone needs to wake up. Someone needs to tell the truth. Because if we don't, nobody else will. And when the apocalypse comes, which it inevitably will, I want to be able to say I warned you.\n\nI'm not some crazy conspiracy theorist, I'm just a realist. I see the world for what it is - a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. And I'm not going to stand idly by while it destroys everything we hold dear. No way. I'll keep fighting, keep shouting, until someone listens.<|eot_id|>"
