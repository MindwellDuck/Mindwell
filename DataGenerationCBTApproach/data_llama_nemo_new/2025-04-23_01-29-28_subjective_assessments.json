Reminders of a life that went on without him. She picked up the top one, tore it open with more force than necessary. The words blurred before her as she scanned the contents.

His life's work, their shared dream, reduced to a legal technicality because she hadn't paid the bloody bills on time.\n\nA sob escaped her, echoing in the empty room. She felt a surge of anger, irrational and fierce. Why did everything have to keep moving on without him? Without her?\n\nShe looked back at Henry's photograph, his smile mocking her now. \"I can't do this alone,\" she choked out, crumpling the letter in her fist.\n\nBut she knew she had no choice.
