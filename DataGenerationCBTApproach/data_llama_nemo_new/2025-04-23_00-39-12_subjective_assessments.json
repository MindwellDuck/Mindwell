My wife, bless her heart, is snoring softly next to me, completely oblivious to the hurricane of worry swirling in my chest.\n\nI've been at this retail gig for what feels like a million years now, and you'd think I'd be used to the early mornings. But no, every Saturday, it's the same damn story. My mind races like a hamster on a wheel, worrying about whether we'll have enough stock today, if that new kid will finally show up on time, or heaven forbid, if some entitled customer decides to take their frustrations out on me.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the numbers. Sales are down this month, and I can't shake the feeling that it's somehow my fault. I'm too old for this, they'll say. Past my prime. Replaceable. I've seen them whispering about me behind their backs, the young'uns with their fancy degrees and their trendy beards.\n\nI tried to talk to my wife about it last night, but she just patted my hand and told me not to worry so much. Easier said than done, sweetheart! Worry's like a second skin for me now. It's there whether I want it or not.\n\nSo here I am, lying awake, feeling like a ticking time bomb. I've got a full day of who-knows-what ahead of me at the store, and all I can think about is how everything's going to go wrong. But hey, at least I'm dressed for the occasion, right? Sleepless nights and worry lines are my finest accessories these days.\"",

I mean, have you seen the way those younger employees look at me? They seem to think I'm just holding them back with my experience and knowledge. And don't even get me started on the numbers - it's like the whole world is against us.\n\nMy wife tries to reassure me, telling me that I'm doing fine and that I just need to relax. But it's hard when I can feel the stress building up inside me. I guess I just need to focus on getting through the day, one customer at a time.\n\nIt's funny, though - the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm probably overreacting. Maybe I am just being paranoid. But at the same time, I know how I feel, and that's all that matters. If I'm feeling anxious and stressed, then something must be wrong.\n\nI'll just take a deep breath and try to stay positive. After all, I've been doing this job for a long time, and I've gotten pretty good at it. I just need to trust myself and my abilities. Yeah, that's what I'll do.<|eot_id|>"

He burst into the gallery, sending the lone visitor skittering for cover behind a sculpture titled 'Untitled Chaos'. The room was already knee-deep in murky brown water, swallowing up paintings and prints like some ravenous beast.\n\n\"Damn it, not again!\" Jack shouted at no one in particular, his reflection rippling in the water. He could see his late wife's face among the swirling patterns, her laughter echoing through the empty gallery. She'd loved this place, its charm, its history. But all he felt now was trapped, drowning under the weight of her memory and the city's never-ending thirst.\n\n\"Fine!\" he spat at the ceiling, grabbing a mop. \"You want me to clean up your mess? I'll do it. But don't expect any fucking tips this time!\"\n\nHe attacked the water, his strokes harsh and angry, each splash sending another wave of stress crashing over him. His heart was pounding, hands shaking, breath coming in short gasps. He was 57, not some damn teenager having a panic attack.\n\n\"Fuck you too,\" he muttered at the building, leaning on his cane to catch his breath.

Like, do they think I'm some kind of genius or something? Please. I'm just trying to make a living off my art, but noooo, everyone wants to know the deep, dark secrets behind my creative process. Well, let me tell you, kid, it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

I felt like I was stuck in some kind of toxic cycle, where I was constantly giving and giving, while he took and took without ever showing any appreciation.\n\nMy mind began to wander to all the ways he'd let me down over the years.

I couldn't believe I'd wasted so much time on someone like him.\n\nBut as I looked around my cluttered office, I realized that I was the one who was really suffering here. My life was a mess, thanks to Thomas' constant absence. I was the one who had to deal with the stress, the anxiety, and the feelings of isolation.

The whole place would've descended into chaos. And what about my partner? She'd never even know what happened. They'd just assume she was late because of traffic or something.\n\nAnd what if I had just walked out earlier? Maybe I wouldn't have spilled all that whiskey. But no, I had to go and make a scene. Now look where I am \u2013 alone, covered in booze, and probably banned from this dump.\n\nUgh, why did I even come here tonight? It's always a bad idea. What if I ran into someone from work? Or worse, what if I saw her walking in the door right now? I'd totally freak out. No, wait, that's not true... I mean, I'm fine. I can handle myself. Yeah, right.\n\nThis stupid bar is a disaster waiting to happen. What if they had a fire alarm go off? Or the cops showed up? I'd be the one getting arrested. Great, just great. Why do these things always happen to me?\n\nI need to get out of here before things get any worse. Before I do something stupid. Like what? I don't know, man. That's the problem. I just know I need to get out of here before it's too late.<|eot_id|>"

        "Triggering Event": "Alright, mate? So there I was, hunched over my desk like a human coat hanger, eyes bleeding into the screen 'cause I'd been at it since dawn. My girlfriend, she's off somewhere, living her best life, not a care in the world. She'd promised to pick up lunch for us, ya know? Something decent, 'cause we've been surviving on ramen noodles and cold pizza all week.\n\nI check my watch. It's past noon. I stretch, creaks echoing like an old house settling. No sign of her. I pick up my phone, thumbs hovering over the keypad. Nah, mate, not gonna text her. She knows what time it is. I can feel the irritation gnawing at me, but I'm keeping it locked down. Barely.\n\nFinally, I hear the front door creak open. I sit up straight, ears pricked like a meerkat. She walks in, arms laden with shopping bags. My heart lifts, then plummets like a stone. It's all junk food - chips, cookies, soda. Not a single green thing in sight.\n\n\"Forget something?\" I ask, voice as tight as my shoulders.\n\nShe looks at me, all wide-eyed innocence. \"Oh, babe! I'm so sorry. They were out of everything healthy. I'll grab something on the way home, okay?\"\n\nI bite back the retort burning my tongue. Instead, I just nod, feeling that irritation simmering like a pot about to boil over. She leans in for a kiss, but I turn away, \"Gotta get back to work.\" My screen glares at me, mocking me with its cold, unyielding light. Great. Now my stomach's rumbling too. Just peachy.",

I mean, I know she said she'd get something decent, but nope, just a bunch of processed crap. What's wrong with her? Doesn't she know how hard I've been working?\n\nAnd now I'm stuck with this stomach growling like a beast, reminding me of my hunger every five seconds. I swear, it's like my body's trying to sabotage me. And don't even get me started on the screen staring at me like a judgmental face. Like, hello, I'm trying to meet some deadlines here.\n\nBut honestly, what really gets me is that she knew better. We've been talking about getting healthier, and yet...nope. She just goes ahead and buys all this stuff. It's like she doesn't even care about our goals or anything. I guess that's why I'm always stressed out \u2013 because nobody else seems to take things seriously around here.\n\nI mean, I love her and all, but sometimes I wonder if she's just not taking this whole adulting thing seriously enough. Maybe I need to have a talk with her about priorities. Yeah, that's exactly what I need right now \u2013 another conversation to add to my never-ending list. Joy.<|eot_id|>"
