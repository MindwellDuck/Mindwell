There's work to be done, and I'm the one who has to clean up after everyone else's mistakes.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the doctor's words. \"We did everything we could.\" Yeah, right. That's just code for \"we gave up.\" I've seen the look in Dr. Patel's eyes, the way he's always relieved when someone finally agrees to let us give up on them. It's like he's secretly rooting for us to fail.\n\nI glance around the ward, taking in the chaos. The machines beeping, the patients wheeled around, the constant din of activity. It's a miracle anyone gets anything done around here. And yet, somehow, we manage to keep going. Barely.\n\nMy gaze lands on the empty bed, and my stomach twists with a familiar sense of unease. Mrs. Hargrove's gone, and I'm left to deal with the aftermath. It's like the whole world has come crashing down around me. Again.\n\nI force myself to take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of impending doom. But it's hard to ignore the sense that things are about to spiral out of control. And I'm the one who has to hold it all together.\n\nI push open the door to my office, the fluorescent light overhead casting an unforgiving glare. Time to put on a mask and pretend like everything's fine. Because that's what we do here. We pretend like nothing matters, like we're all just pretending to care. But deep down, I know the truth. We're all just faking it until we make it.<|eot_id|>"

He'd been at it for hours, chasing this goddamn anomaly, while that prick Henderson took credit for their shared work. Again.\n\nHe grabbed the sample, slamming it into the machine, fingers trembling with anger and exhaustion. The results popped up, taunting him: another dead end. He roared, sweeping his arm across the bench, sending glassware crashing to the floor. \"Fuck!\" he bellowed, collapsing onto his stool, head in hands. \"I should've taken that fucking job offer from Harvard.\"",

This lab's a dump, the equipment's ancient, and now look at me - stuck in this godforsaken place, getting nowhere.\n\nThat Henderson guy's always so smug, thinks he's better than everyone else just because he's got some fancy degree. Newsflash, buddy: brains don't make you successful. It's who you know, who you're willing to step on to get ahead. And I'm starting to think I'm just not cut out for this whole science thing.\n\nWhy did I waste four years of my life on this degree? What was I supposed to do, become a lab rat or something? I thought I was going to change the world, but nope - I'm just stuck in this dingy lab, fighting for scraps. And Henderson's just sitting there, laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nIf only I'd taken that job offer... maybe I wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe I'd have a real career, not just some dead-end research position. But no, I had to go and stick around, thinking I could make a difference. Now look where I am - stuck in this miserable lab, with nothing but failure staring me in the face.\n\nUgh, why can't I just catch a break? Why does everything always seem to go wrong for me? Is it just me, or does the universe hate me? I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who sees how screwed up things really are. Everyone else just seems to be living their best life, while I'm stuck in this rut, going nowhere fast.<|eot_id|>"
