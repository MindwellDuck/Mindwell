Three months of my wife's worried glances and 'Are you okay?'s every damn morning. And now, I find out he's moved into my fucking beat. My fucking neighborhood. My fucking backyard. You know what they say about bad pennies, don't ya? They always turn up.\"\n\nHer grip tightened around the radio, knuckles white. \"This is Officer Thompson. I'm en route to 124 Maplewood.

Leaning against the wall, a cigarette dangling from his lips, laughing with some lowlife scum. She stepped out of the shadows, badge gleaming under the streetlight. His eyes widened, just for a moment, before he schooled his features into that infuriating smirk.\n\n\"Officer Thompson,\" he drawled, \"What brings you to my humble abode?\"\n\nShe didn't bother with niceties. She didn't bother with a warning. She walked up to him, close enough to smell the stale cigarette on his breath, and said, \"You're under arrest, Carlos.\"\n\nAs she read him his rights, she couldn't help but feel a grim satisfaction. This was for every sleepless night he'd cost her, for every worried look from her wife. This was vengeance, plain and simple. And it tasted fucking sweet.\n\nBut as she led him to the patrol car, she knew this wasn't over. Not by a long shot. Carlos had more than just a few screws loose, and he wouldn't go down without a fight. But she'd be ready. She always was. Because when it came to protecting what was hers - her city, her job, her wife - she was a fucking force to be reckoned with.\n\nAnd Carlos? Well, he'd learn that the hard way. Again.",

I mean, who does he think he is, slinking back into town after all these months, thinking he can just waltz back in and start causing trouble again?\n\n\"I swear, the stars must have aligned just so, because now I get to deal with this piece of crap one last time. And let me tell you, I'm not going to hold back. I'll make sure he regrets ever setting foot in this city. He thinks he's above the law, doesn't he? Well, newsflash, Carlos: you're not above anyone. Least of all, me.\n\n\"I can already see the headlines: 'Cops Bust Notorious Dealer in Sting Operation'. Yeah, that's right. I'm the hero here. The savior of this city. And Carlos? He's just the villain, getting what's coming to him. I mean, who needs proof when you've got gut instinct and a healthy dose of rage?\n\n\"As I pull up to the scene, I can feel my adrenaline pumping. This is it. This is my chance to show Carlos who's boss. I'm not just a cop; I'm a force of nature. Unstoppable. Unrelenting. And Carlos? He's just a speed bump on the road to justice.\n\n\"So, bring it on, Carlos. Bring your worst. I'm ready for you. And when I'm done with you, you'll be nothing but a footnote in the history books.

His pager went off just as he sat down to a cold plate of leftovers. A kid with appendicitis at the ER. Again.\n\n\"Seriously?\" Thompson muttered, wiping his mouth with a napkin. \"Can't these little bastards wait till morning?\"\n\nHe stormed back into the hospital, his footsteps echoing like thunderclaps. The kid was fine, but the mom was a mess. Tears streaming down her face, she clung to Thompson's arm.\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Thompson,\" she sobbed, \"I was so scared!\"\n\nThompson sighed inwardly. He hated it when they cried. \"Well, ma'am,\" he said, his voice dripping with fake sympathy, \"maybe if you'd brought him in yesterday, we wouldn't be having this little chat.\"\n\nHe patted her hand, leaving behind a smear of ketchup from his abandoned dinner.

Not with embarrassment - no, this was pure, unadulterated rage. He took a deep breath, turned around, and plastered on his best bedside manner smile.\n\n\"Well, sweetheart,\" he said, his voice dangerously low, \"maybe because your mother's been sitting on her ass while you were turning green.\"",

Now, as I looked at the clock ticking away, I knew that our family would have to suffer for years to come. Years of missed birthdays, forgotten anniversaries, and sleepless nights spent worrying about the latest crisis.\n\nAnd what about our kids? They deserved better than a father who was constantly absent, constantly stressed. But I knew it was too late now. The damage was done, and all we could do was watch as our lives unraveled before our eyes.\n\nAs I wiped away tears, I couldn't shake the feeling that things were going to get worse. So much worse.
