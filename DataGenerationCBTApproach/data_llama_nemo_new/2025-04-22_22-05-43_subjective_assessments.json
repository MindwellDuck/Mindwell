I roll up with the kid, right? Storeowner's freaking out, cash register's busted open, and there's this goddamn hero complex bubbling under my partner's skin. He starts pushing me aside, says he'll \"handle it.\" I tell him to hold his horses, we need a tactical plan first.\n\nKid looks at me like I've lost my marbles. \"Sir,\" he says, all condescending, \"we don't have time for that. The suspect could be getting away.\"\n\nSo, I step aside, let the hotshot do his thing. He storms in there like Rambo on a mission, and what does he find? Piss-stained pants and a terrified teen hiding behind the counter, crying about how it was all just a misunderstanding. Turns out, some other punks dared him to rob the place.\n\nI watch through the window as my partner's got this \"I can't believe I fell for this\" face. And do you know what he does? He actually pulls out his damn notebook and starts taking down a statement!

I've seen some rookie cops before, but this one takes the cake. He's got all these big ideas, but he doesn't even know the basics. It's like he thinks he's above the law or somethin'. And now, I'm stuck dealin' with the fallout, makin' sure everyone knows what happened.
