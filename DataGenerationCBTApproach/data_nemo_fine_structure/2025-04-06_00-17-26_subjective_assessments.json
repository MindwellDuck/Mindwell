Additionally, there is evidence of negative self-talk (\"pathetic\") and overgeneralization (\"always was\"). Overall, this response suggests that the individual has adopted a rigid, judgmental mindset towards themselves, which may be contributing to their distress. # Additional Resources: 1. **Cognitive Distortions**: A list"
