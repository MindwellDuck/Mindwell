Like, have you ever been with someone who was clearly upset? But then they just start talking about whatever random thing they were thinking about earlier? And suddenly, everything else around us becomes super quiet. It’s like time stops moving for both of us until we’re done talking. What does this mean? Maybe it means we’re all connected in some way. Maybe our minds are like magnets, pulling each other towards things that matter to us. Or maybe it’s just because we’re both tired and want to relax. Whatever it is, I feel like it shows how deep our emotions can go. When someone says, “This isn’t what you think,” it’s like they’re saying, “You might think you understand me, but there’s so much more going on inside.” And honestly, I’m okay with that.
