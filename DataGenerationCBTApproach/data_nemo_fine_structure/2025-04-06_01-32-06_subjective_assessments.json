And let me tell you, it doesn't help when they have the nerve to act like nothing's wrong. They're all smiles and sunshine, while I'm over here seething inside. I mean, come on, do they really think we don't see through this? Have they forgotten that everyone in this office knows exactly what's going on? It's just so frustrating because I know I'm better than them. I've worked so hard to get where I am, and now it feels like everything is being taken away from me. And honestly, it makes me wonder if anyone would notice if I just disappeared. Would anyone care? Probably not. This whole thing just feels like one big slap in the face. I can't believe people are doing this. Do they even care that they're screwing over someone who's clearly more deserving? I swear, sometimes I feel like the universe is just playing cruel jokes on me. What's worse is that no one seems to care.

To heal. To remember. And yet, as I watch her stand there, paralyzed by the thought of starting over, I feel a pang of sadness. Why does it have to be so hard? Why must we suffer through each new beginning? But then I think, maybe that's just how life works. Maybe suffering is what makes us stronger. Maybe it's necessary to push through the pain to find our true colors. After all, isn’t it said that “the best art comes from heartache”? So, yes, I tell myself, she needs to go back to work.
