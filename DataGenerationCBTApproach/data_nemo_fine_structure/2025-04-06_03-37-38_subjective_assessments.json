These people are so arrogant, they think they can just say whatever they want and everyone will eat it up. They're like robots, programmed to defend whatever they're given.

It was almost as if she had been chosen for her innocence, rather than her talent. She looked up at him with such genuine enthusiasm. Her eyes sparkled when she talked about the story, and the way she spoke about the importance of bringing truth to light was infectious. But he knew better. He could see right through her. There was something about her that didn't add up, something that made him want to protect her from the harsh realities of journalism. Maybe it was just his natural instinct to shield those who were vulnerable, but whatever it was, he couldnâ€™t shake off the feeling that he needed to keep an eye on her. It wasn't fair, though. Fairness never really existed in the world of journalism, especially not where he worked. And yet, he found himself wanting to make sure that no one took advantage of her. No one would use her naivety against her. He wouldn't let anyone take advantage of her. Not while he was still here. But why did he care? Why was he so invested in this young woman's success? Was it because he saw himself in her? Because she reminded him of how he used to be, full of hope"

He'd probably love this time to study together, but since he's not here, it's just me again. And what's even more annoying is how boring everything looks right now. The kitchen is spotless, but it doesn't feel satisfying when I'm doing all the cleaning by myself. We usually share the chores, but today it's just me against the clock. It's frustrating, especially when I think about how nice it would've been to have him here to help me get things done. Instead, I'm stuck here, feeling lonely and bored, while he's out living his life without me. This whole situation just makes me wish we could go back to how things used to be. If only we still had each other... But I guess that's not meant to be anymore. Now I'm left to face another long, slow night by myself, which is exactly what I wanted. Just great.

How can someone so arrogant think that sharing something as trivial as dinner with someone else makes them special? There's nothing unique about this moment; it's just another reminder of what I'll never have. I wonder if she realizes that her actions reinforce the very inequality she claims to fight against. This isn't just about her; it's about all the people who have been marginalized by her kind of thinking. What I want to know is whether she understands that these moments are just examples of everything thatâ€™s wrong with our society. She genuinely believes that her achievements make her superior, but deep down, she knows the truth. Her actions are proof that she has become exactly what weâ€™ve always feared â€“ a symbol of the system that perpetuates suffering.
