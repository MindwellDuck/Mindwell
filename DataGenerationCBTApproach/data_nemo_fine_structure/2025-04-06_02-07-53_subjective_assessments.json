I wouldn't be in this situation if they'd just kept their word and protected me. Now look at them—what could they possibly know? They probably think they’re so smart, but they don’t know anything. My husband knows everything; he’s the one who needs to be here, not some strangers who think they can save him. I shouldn't have trusted anyone else in the first place; now everyone will just make things worse. I'll never trust anyone again. This is all because of my own stupidity. If only I’d stayed home, none of this would’ve happened. But no, I had to go and get involved. I knew better than to fall for him, but I didn't listen. Now I'm paying the price.

I wonder why you are so happy now that you got what you wanted, which is clearly revenge against me. I hope you enjoy this moment of satisfaction because you’ll never be able to leave it behind. Maybe next time you’re looking for a place to go, you won’t find it here anymore. You know, I’ve had customers who come in here every day, buying things and leaving peacefully. But you, my friend, are different. You don't deserve to be treated kindly just because you're trying to make amends. You need to learn that you can't just waltz back in and expect us to welcome you with open arms. And I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but you deserve it.

And that means my entire marriage has been a lie, built on a foundation of deceit. This isn't about trust; it's about whether she actually loves me or not. There's no room for doubt, no space for nuance. Either she's cheating, or she's lying, or nothing happened. That's all I'll ever accept. Anything else would be too complicated, too messy. So I'll choose the simplest option, the one that makes me feel less fucked up. She's either doing something I don't know about, or she's pretending to be happy for me. I can't handle anything more than that. This isn't about being insecure; it's about being certain. And certainty is what I need right now. So I'll keep thinking, keep jumping between those two extremes until I find the truth. Because if I don't, I'll never stop wondering. I'll never stop feeling like a complete asshole.

They probably thought they could get under her skin, but what they did was make her realize how much she really cares about her research. And honestly, who needs grants anyway? It’s just another excuse for people to control everyone else’s life. So, yeah, she’s late. But she’ll be fine. She can handle this. After all, she’s always been able to bounce back from tough situations. This too shall pass. Maybe she doesn’t need that grant after all; maybe she’ll find something even better. She’s got this. It’s just a minor setback. The fact that she spilled coffee everywhere means nothing. That’s just her body reacting to stress, and she can clean up later. What matters most is that she keeps moving forward. So let her rush, let her panic, because she’ll come out stronger on the other side. And if she breaks down completely, well, that’s just part of the process. It’s okay to show vulnerability sometimes. Who cares if others think less of her?
