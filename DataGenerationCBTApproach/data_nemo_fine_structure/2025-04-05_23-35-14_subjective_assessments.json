I feel like I'm drowning in his success, unable to catch up with anything he achieves. Everytime I see him on TV, smiling with his beautiful wife, I want to scream. Why is he so happy? Doesn't he know that I've been suffering for years because of him? It feels like every time we're both in public, everyone turns to stare at us, whispering behind our backs. They think I'm a loser, and I believe them. But when I hear his music playing, something inside me breaks. I remember the times we spent together, laughing, dancing, and dreaming of building a life. I replay those moments, wishing I could turn back time, erase the pain he caused, and start anew. Yet, no matter how hard I try, I'm stuck here, alone, while he lives happily ever after. What am I supposed to do now? Shouldn't I be grateful for the memories? But they only remind me of what I lost. I shouldn't feel sad, I should be happy for him.

The expression on her face was one of confusion and disorientation. When I asked what happened, she seemed unsure how to answer. Her eyes darted around the room as if searching for answers somewhere else. It took me a few moments to realize that she must have fallen asleep while working. But then I started thinking about other possibilities - maybe she had fainted from exhaustion, or perhaps she was just daydreaming, lost in thought. What if she got hit by a car on her way home? Or what if she suffered a stroke? What if someone broke into our house and hurt her? It didn't take long for my mind to fill up with all these worst-case scenarios. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong, even though there was no concrete evidence. My anxiety grew with every passing moment, making it hard to focus on anything except those dark thoughts. Now, whenever I see her, I wonder what might be going through her mind - is she okay, or is she struggling with some unknown issue?

Even though we haven't seen each other all day, she'll come running whenever I sit down on the couch. Today was no exception - she rubbed against my leg as soon as I sat down, but now that I look at her again, she looks almost...different? Maybe it's just my imagination, but she seems a bit more agitated than usual. And what's with the meowing? Our poor little thing is probably trying to tell us something, but I'm too busy dealing with my own anxiety to pay attention right now. I wish he was here to handle things; he knows exactly how to calm me down when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Instead, I'm stuck dealing with every little thing myself, which isn't fair. I know she wants attention, but why does she have to meow so loudly? Doesn't she understand that I'm already stressed enough? I guess what really bothers me is seeing her act differently.
