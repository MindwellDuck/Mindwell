I'm still the same guy who used to be the best doctor this town has ever seen. But no, everyone's forgotten about me. It doesn't even matter that I spent decades building this place from scratch. No one remembers that. All they care about is how much money they can make off their latest gimmicks. My own clinic, which was always more than just a business, has become nothing more than a memory—a reminder of how far we've fallen. How could they forget us? And now this? This little...this kid! He looks so fucking young, and they're smiling together. What am I supposed to feel? Joy? Ha! I don't feel anything except rage and humiliation. Why would I want to be replaced by some idiot who didn't even work here before? Did you think you could just waltz in here and steal my patients? Steal everything I worked hard for? You must think you're better than me, huh? That you deserve to take my place because you're younger and prettier? Well, let me tell you something, pal—you'll never be me. Never!"

He forced himself to focus on the task at hand, but deep down, he knew he couldn't shake this feeling anytime soon. He tried to push it aside, telling himself he needed to stop being such a whiner.

You know, maybe if she didn't leave, things would be different today. But now we have to deal with the reality of our situation. You can't change the past, but you can control how you react to it. It's time to let go and focus on the present. Look, I understand that it hurts, but blaming her isn't going to help anything. She made a choice, and now you have to accept it. Let's keep moving forward instead of dwelling on the past. It’s just an old picture. It doesn’t define the entire relationship. Instead of focusing on the past, why don’t you try to find ways to improve the present? Life is too short to dwell on something like that. That picture may remind him of the past, but it shouldn’t dictate his future. Have you tried reaching out to him? Maybe talking things through could bring some closure. Just saying. Let's not forget that relationships involve two people, not just one. If she left, there must have been reasons. Are you taking full responsibility for those reasons?

This pattern demonstrates that he will always react with anger whenever something triggers memories of his deceased partner, whether it be an email, a phone call, or simply a random thought. He can't handle anything remotely related to her, so he must act out in anger every time. When faced with reminders of her life, such as her old email account, he becomes enraged, revealing his true nature as someone who hates everything connected to her. Even though he may have loved her once, now he cannot bear the thought of her, and this constant anger indicates that he will always reject anything associated with her. It’s clear that he doesn’t care about her at all; he’s just angry because she died, and this anger will last forever. His reaction to the email is proof that he will never show affection again, and he’s doomed to live a life filled with hatred towards anything that reminds him of her."
