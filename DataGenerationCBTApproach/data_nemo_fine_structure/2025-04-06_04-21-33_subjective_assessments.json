As he reached for a sandwich, his coworker, a middle-aged woman, entered and raised an eyebrow at him. \"Really, you're not going to change those first?\" she asked, suppressing a smile. He looked down, realizing his mistake. The gloves were stained with remnants of the patient's lunch they'd been feeding moments ago. Feeling his cheeks flush, he muttered, \"Guess I'm still learning on-the-job,\" and quickly retreated to the locker room to change.",

I can't help but think that the coworker was really upset about me rushing into the lounge in my dirty gloves, like it was some kind of personal attack. It must have taken all her self-control not to say something harsher, considering how annoyed she seemed. Maybe she even felt embarrassed by her own thought process, wishing she hadn’t made such a snide comment. I wonder if there’s more to this interaction than meets the eye? Did she secretly feel threatened by my presence, or was it just a playful jab? I bet she wasn’t thinking that clearly when she said “really, you’re not going to change those first?” It’s almost as if she was trying to send a message through her words, maybe even testing my boundaries or pushing my buttons. But honestly, I don’t see why she would react like that – we work together, after all! I guess some people just don’t understand the importance of maintaining professional hygiene standards, especially in healthcare settings. Am I missing something here? Is there another side to her story that I’m not seeing? What do you guys think? Was I overreacting, or did I deserve that? How could someone be so insensitive and dismissive towards someone who is just doing their job? And what does it say about us as professionals that we let our emotions get the better of us? Or are we just too busy dealing with the chaos of the hospital to care about these little"

But then, after about a year, things started falling apart. We began to argue more often, and I realized that he wasn't really interested in me anymore. So, I ended things, and he moved back in with his parents. That's when my sister stepped in. She always said that she hated how I treated him, and she thought I was being too harsh. Now, whenever I try to talk to her about it, she just brushes it off. \"Oh, you're just overreacting,\" she'll say. Or, \"It's your fault he left.\" Like, no, it's not. He was already distant before I even knew about the infidelity. But does anyone care? No, instead they all turn around and tell me that I'm being too sensitive, that I'm overthinking everything. Even my mom says it's my fault he left. \"If you didn't push him away, maybe he wouldn't have gone,\" she'll say. I feel like she doesn't understand anything.

His bedside lamp seemed to flicker with a new meaning after hearing that message. Maybe it wasn't abandonment, maybe it was just exhaustion. She felt a wave wash over her, a mix of relief and disappointment. She had been feeling anxious lately, and this must have triggered some kind of panic attack. As she sat there, her mind began to spiral. Hadn't they talked about moving in together soon? Hadn't he promised to be more present, to make time for her? The memory of those promises flashed before her eyes, and she wondered if she had misread everything. Did he ever really plan to commit? Or was she just another distraction? The room around her started to blur, colors bleeding into one another. She felt lost in thought, unable to focus on anything else. Her chest tightened as she realized how much she had given herself over to this relationship. She had sacrificed so much, putting her own needs aside to care for him, to support him. And what did it get her? A temporary high, followed by crushing lows whenever he left her alone. It took her a while to notice that her thoughts were drifting away"
