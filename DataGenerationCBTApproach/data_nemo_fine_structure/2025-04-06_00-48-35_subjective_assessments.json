Every moment they shared feels like a betrayal – how could he leave? The laughter echoes in her mind, but it’s tainted by the pain of abandonment. Her fingers still trace the outline of his arm, as if holding onto him might keep him from leaving again. He doesn’t deserve her love. He’s never been there for her, always disappearing into his art. Now, she’s left with nothing but memories, and the thought of seeing him again fills her with dread. What good would he bring back? Would he even remember her? She wonders if anyone else has seen the truth about him – that he’s just another artist who doesn’t care about people, only his work? Why does she ever think things will get better? Every attempt at connection ends in heartache. She’s lost trust, and now she thinks everyone is going to hurt her. Even her friends seem fake, pretending to be happy for her while secretly judging her. It makes her wonder if they’re just waiting for her to fall apart so they can say “we told you so.” Her life is falling apart. Nothing goes right anymore. She tries to focus on her art, but everything reminds her of him – the way he used to hold her, the smell of his cologne, the sound of his voice. Each memory brings her closer to tears, and she"

She wouldn’t have wanted her kid to be around here anyway; it would’ve been too painful for her. Besides, what’s the point? They don't know anything about her situation. If she were here, she'd probably want us to leave them alone. This whole scene makes me feel even more miserable because I'm reminded of how much we miss her every single day. Even though I know it's not fair to compare ourselves to others, it doesn't help when I see how well-adjusted everyone else is now that she’s no longer around. That little girl over there is lucky to have such a loving family; her parents must really love each other since they seem so perfect. Meanwhile, I can barely take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I wonder if they ever think about her at all, but I highly doubt it. Who cares if they remember her? She was just an acquaintance to them, after all. It’s easy to say I shouldn’t let her death affect me this way, especially when I see couples enjoying time together with their kids. But honestly, I wish I could just disappear. At least then they’d never notice me again. I hope they never remember her as one of"

My gaze lingers on the nameplate, a reminder that another talented mind has been bought and sold—a cog in the machinery of corporate success. This is not just a transfer; it’s a transaction—money changing hands, ideas being traded like commodities. In this sterile environment, where intellects are honed, I see a reflection of our society: a world where knowledge can be bought and sold, where talent is commodified, and where the pursuit of excellence is reduced to mere profit. It's a harsh reality, one that makes me wonder if we've lost sight of what truly matters. As I watch him settle into his new role, I'm reminded that the true cost of his hiring isn't just measured in dollars but also in the erosion of integrity. With each passing day, I feel the weight of disappointment growing. Not because he failed to live up to expectations, but because he represents everything that's wrong with our system. He embodies the values that have come to define us: profit over principle, innovation over ethics, and ambition over accountability. Every smile, every handshake, every nod of approval feels hollow, tainted by the knowledge that behind these façades lies a ruthless drive for success, no matter the cost.

Oh, wait, I remember now. There was something else. A note next to the photo. I'm pretty sure he wrote it himself, but I'm not sure why he'd leave it there. It said \"Take care\" or maybe \"Love you.\" Doesn't make sense because they weren't exactly close. He had friends from work who were really important to him, and we barely spoke outside of family gatherings. I wonder if someone took that photo down. Maybe I did, but I don't recall doing so. If he did take it down, I'm curious why he wouldn't have told me. We talked about everything except that photo before he passed away.
