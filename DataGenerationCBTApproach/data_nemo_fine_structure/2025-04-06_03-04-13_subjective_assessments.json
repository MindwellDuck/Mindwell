Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this crowded ER, surrounded by doctors and nurses rushing to save lives. They're all so much more capable than me - I can barely keep up with the basics, let alone handle something like this. It’s just another reminder that I’ll never be good enough. Just think about it: they have years of training behind them, countless hours spent studying, and now they’re in the middle of an emergency situation. Me? I’ve been working night shifts for months, barely sleeping or eating, and yet I still struggle to keep up. How can someone like me expect to perform under pressure when they've had decades of experience? And what about my lack of medical knowledge? Every time I look around, I see people who are so much smarter and more confident than me. Even if I did somehow manage to pull off something like this, I'd never feel worthy of the praise they’d receive. My wife always says I’m too self-conscious, but she doesn’t understand how hard it is to admit when you know you don’t measure up. I try to rationalize it in my head, but deep down, I know I'll never be able to match their level of expertise. Why bother trying? At least in there, I can pretend to be part of the team, even if I'm secretly failing. But"

You've been nothing but a disappointment since your wife left, always putting your own selfish desires over everyone else's needs. Now look where it got you - alone again, with no one to blame but yourself. Why are you still holding onto her? She doesn't love you anymore, and if she did, would she really ignore your pathetic attempts at contact? You're nothing but a burden to her and everyone else around you. Stop pretending you care about her. Your emotional manipulation has turned her against you, and you'll never get her back.
