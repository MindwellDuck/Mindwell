I swear, I'm starting to hate him for leaving me all alone. He always does this. He goes off fishing with Tom and leaves me here. Always. Never comes back early. And you know what? I don’t even want him to come back. Why would I? I can handle everything myself now. I’m fine. I don’t need him anymore. I just need to get through these days until he decides to move back in with his parents. At least then I won’t have to deal with his constant absence. This isn’t fair. We agreed to split time together, and he’s always choosing to go fishing instead. Doesn’t he remember how much I wanted to spend quality time with him? Does he realize how much it hurts me when he leaves me behind? I feel abandoned, forgotten, and ignored. I’ve tried talking to him about it, but he just shrugs it off, saying, “Oh, you’re being dramatic again.” Dramatic? What am I dramatic about? I just want some attention from my own man.

Every time she sees him laughing with someone else, she feels like she's being replaced. Even though they've been married for years, she can't help but think he'd rather be with anyone else. Why does he spend so much time with people who don't need him? Doesn't he know how hard it is to balance work and life, especially after losing his job a few months ago? And now, here he is, laughing with strangers, while she’s left at home, feeling useless and invisible. She knows it's irrational to assume the worst, but the doubts keep creeping back in. She tries to push them aside, telling herself she’s being silly, but deep down, the fear lingers. Maybe he is meeting someone new. Maybe he doesn’t love her as much as he used to. She wonders if he’s moved on, if he’s found someone better than her. The thought makes her feel like she’s not enough, like she’s just another temporary distraction for him. Maybe"

My instincts told me something serious was happening, and I needed to act fast. Even if it meant stepping into a potentially volatile situation, I knew my gut wouldn't lie to me. If anything, it would push me toward action. As I approached the house, I could hear the argument escalating. The woman’s voice was rising, and the man’s was getting louder—clearly, they were on the verge of things falling apart. But I didn’t hesitate. I took a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for whatever might happen next. This was no ordinary situation; my training kicked in automatically, and I went into high alert mode. I knew every move I made had to be calculated, every decision crucial. My mind was racing with possibilities, but I focused on the immediate task at hand: getting the family out safely. When I burst into the house, the tension was palpable. The air seemed thick with unspoken threats, and I could feel the electricity between the two people. They were both shouting now, their words slinging back and forth like daggers. My heart was pounding in my chest, but I kept my cool. I"

If she wants to relive them, maybe she could try harder to keep the apartment clean. Or at least put everything away where it belongs.
