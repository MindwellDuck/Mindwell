It feels like time isn't on my side when I think about all the things he gets to experience now that we're apart. It hurts seeing him move forward so quickly. He hasn’t even started dating yet, but he’s already moving ahead with plans for his future. I feel like I’m just sitting here watching everything happen around me, unable to participate because our relationship ended abruptly. Every day, I see posts from friends and family who are dating or even married, and it makes me feel like I’ve lost my chance at happiness. But I know it’s unfair to compare myself to them. After all, I didn’t choose this situation. Yet, every time I look at social media, I can’t help but feel left behind. Seeing how easily they’re moving on with their lives makes me realize how far behind I am. It feels like the world has moved on without me, leaving me stuck in this rut where nothing changes. Even if I try to convince myself otherwise, deep down, I know I’m making an unfair comparison. Still, it’s hard not to feel this way when everyone else seems to be moving forward while I stay stuck in the past."

It's really helpful when you're feeling stuck. Especially when you're feeling really, really stuck. Like right now. It's not just about being stuck; it's about everything else too. Everything always goes wrong, doesn't it? Even my best friends have let me down. They say they care, but do they really? Do they ever try to help? No, they just stand by while I fall further and further behind. I try to explain to myself that maybe it's because they don't understand, but does it really matter? Nothing ever works out.
