The way he looked away when he saw me was like he couldn't handle seeing someone who didn't have everything together. He's just jealous; he probably wishes he could wear his heart on his sleeve like me. Her being a failure is obvious now. Just because I'm feeling down doesn't mean I deserve that kind of treatment. I can't let him get inside my head with his cheap shots. I'll show him what I think of him by keeping my head up and moving forward. She might be struggling, but so am I. We're both fighting our own battles, even if we don't see it right now. When she thinks she's the only one going through this, she forgets how hard life really is. But I know. I've been there. We're not so different after all, especially since we both have families waiting for us back home. Maybe we shouldn't judge each other so harshly. Instead, let's support each other through these tough times. At least we know how it feels to feel like you're losing control. It's time to stop letting people bring us down.

He didn’t even know she was there. Why was she so upset? It was probably just her being sensitive again. She had always been overly emotional, after all. But why now? Maybe she was just stressed from work. Yeah, that must be it. No need to overthink this. Still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling of betrayal. She had trusted him, and now he seemed to have broken that trust by acting like this. But she knew she was overreacting. She needed to calm down and focus on her own life instead of letting emotions control her actions. This was ridiculous. She needed to let go of these feelings before things escalated further. But how could she do that when everything around her felt so unfair? She knew she was getting worked up unnecessarily, but it was hard to stop. She had to remind herself that she was just overthinking again. She needed to keep moving forward and not let her emotions dictate every decision. This was all about self-control, right? She had to learn to manage her emotions better. But why was she still so angry? She knew she was overreacting,"
