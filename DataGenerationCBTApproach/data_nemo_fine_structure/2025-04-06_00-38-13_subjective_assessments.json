Anyway, my partner said she'd go shopping tomorrow and get us both a new one. She even offered to let me pick one myself. I don’t know how to feel about this. It feels kind of nice to have someone who cares enough to make such an effort for us, especially after everything we’ve been through lately. But then again, there are always things you can’t control. What if the store runs out of our favorite flavor? Or worse, what if they don't have any containers at all? Then we'll be stuck with the same old moldy thing, which would ruin the whole experience. And it’s not just the yogurt; think about all the other things that could go wrong—like when the electricity goes out during the holiday season, leaving us without power for hours. What if the water pipes burst in the middle of winter? Or imagine having to deal with a heatwave and no air conditioning for months. Life is already hard enough, and now I’m worried that these little things will make everything even more stressful. Despite all these thoughts swirling around in my head, I guess I'm also feeling pretty happy about it all. I mean"

They're acting like they never saw me before, like I'm some new guy they've never heard of. How dare they act like nothing ever happened?

Every time she thought about her life, she couldn't help but feel like she was being measured against someone else’s success. Someone younger, more talented, and more driven. The comparisons made her wonder if she was just deluding herself, if she was somehow less than what she thought she was. As she scrolled through her inbox, she saw the usual stream of rejection notices—magazines, articles, opportunities that slipped further and further out of reach. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was meant to be somewhere else, doing something else. That maybe the stories she wrote were never enough, that the world didn’t need her voice. In the end, it was all just a reminder that she was running out of time. Every day felt like another step closer to failure. The emptiness inside her grew louder, a constant hum that threatened to drown out everything else. And yet, even though she knew deep down that these thoughts weren’t fair, she couldn’t stop them.
