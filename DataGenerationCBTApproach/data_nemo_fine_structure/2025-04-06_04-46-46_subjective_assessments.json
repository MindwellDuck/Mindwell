He can’t remember half the conversations we have anyway. So why bother? I can’t believe I let things get so far out of hand. We were supposed to be spending quality time together, but instead, I was buried under work. And now look where it’s gotten us. His memory is slipping away, and all I see is the mess I made. I shouldn’t have left him alone today. What if he tries to do something stupid while I’m not around? I need to keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn’t hurt himself. But what good will that do? He won’t remember anything anyway. At least, not really. It’s not my fault he has dementia, but still… I should be able to help him more. Instead, I’m stuck dealing with the guilt of everything that could go wrong. If only I’d been there sooner, maybe things wouldn’t be so bad. Maybe he wouldn’t be struggling so much.

The TV was off, the curtains were closed, and the books were all neatly arranged on the shelves. Even the smell of fresh laundry couldn't fill the space. It was as if time itself had stopped moving, leaving her trapped in this frozen moment forever. Everything about her life felt like it was falling apart, piece by piece. Every day, she woke up to the same routine, the same conversations, the same laughter. But now, nothing felt normal. The world outside seemed to be moving forward, while she was stuck in this one moment, reliving memories that refused to fade away. Her mind raced with thoughts of what could have been, of all the moments they'd never experience together. The phone was silent, too, no messages from friends, no calls from family. Just the sound of her own heartbeat, pounding in her chest like a drumbeat warning her of the emptiness that awaited her.

They were the opposite of everything she wanted, and yet, she kept hoping that someday, somehow, she'd meet someone who truly understood her. When she met him, something changed. He was different. We talked for hours, sharing stories and dreams, and he listened in a way no one ever had. For the first time in her life, she felt seen and heard. It wasn’t just a connection; it was as if we’d known each other forever. Every moment with him felt natural, like we were meant to be together. And then, after months of dating, he proposed. It wasn’t just a proposal—it was a promise—a vow to spend his life making her happy. To me, that was the perfect ending to our story, but it wasn’t meant to be.
