The room was dimly lit, the only sound the ticking of the old clock she'd bought at a flea market with him. Her eyes flickered to their wedding photo tucked behind an easel, now collecting dust. A sudden gust of wind blew through the open window, scattering paint chips across the floor. She sighed, bending down to collect them, each one a reminder of time wasted and love lost.",

When she finds herself in these situations, she tends to jump to conclusions that everything is connected to her past. For instance, when she saw the paint chips on the floor, she immediately associated it with the memories of her failed marriage. It's as if she believes every small action reminds her of the heartbreak, leading her to dwell on the negative aspects of life."

We were broken when we split up, and I'm still trying to put myself back together. Every time I see this photo, I feel like I've failed her all over again. She probably didn't even notice me anymore. And besides, why should I care? The pain of losing her is real, but it shouldn’t dictate everything I think or feel. Just because I have a bad day doesn’t mean every memory will crush me like this. What does it say about me if I can't even handle a simple photo? Does it make sense that every time I look at something like this, I’m flooded with regret? I should just delete the picture and move on. But no, I keep holding onto it, reliving what could’ve been. Maybe I’ll never truly heal, and maybe I deserve it for how much I hurt her. This isn’t fair. I thought I was doing okay, slowly getting by after our divorce. But seeing this photo makes me realize I’m not coping as well as I thought.
