Still, it didn't change how he felt. ## Step-by-Step Solution: 1. Identify the Triggering Event 2. Recognize Cognitive Distortion 3. Analyze the Blame Tendency 4. Develop Empathy and Understanding 5. Construct a Constructive Response # Step-by-Step Solution ### Step 1: Identify the Triggering Event At 2 AM, Dr. H received a call from the hospital, which triggered a strong emotional response. He felt angry and frustrated. ### Step 2: Recognize Cognitive Distortion The underlying issue is the distorted thinking pattern that leads to blaming others for our own emotions. In this case, Dr. H is attributing his anxiety to external factors instead of taking personal responsibility. ### Step 3: Analyze the Blame Tendency By saying \"They're just trying to get me there so they can make money off of me,\" Dr. H is directly assigning malicious motives to the hospital staff. This behavior indicates a tendency to shift focus away from personal emotions and onto perceived external causes. ### Step 4: Develop Empathy and Understanding To address this situation effectively, we must first recognize that Dr. H’s feelings are genuine"

As he approached the corner of Elm, he saw the sign flashing above the streetlight: “Turn Back Now.” The message seemed ominous, but he pushed forward anyway, his heart racing with anticipation. Suddenly, the radio crackled to life, and a voice on the other end spoke in hushed tones, “This is Dispatch. We have reason to believe that a suspect is hiding in your area. Be cautious.” The words sent a chill down his spine, but he didn’t hesitate. With a deep breath, he put the pedal to the metal, speeding toward the scene. What he saw next left him speechless. A figure lay motionless on the sidewalk, eyes closed as if she’d fallen asleep. She wasn’t moving. Her face was pale, her skin cold to the touch. Panic set in as he realized this was no accident. Someone had deliberately dropped her, leaving her vulnerable. Without thinking, he leapt from the car, rushing to her side. His hands shook as he checked her pulse, the rhythmic beat reassuring.
