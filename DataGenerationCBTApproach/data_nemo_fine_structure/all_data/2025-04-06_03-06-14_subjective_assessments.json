The way he looked at me, with tears streaming down his face, made me want to tell him to stop acting so dramatic. His behavior is so over-the-top; I can’t help but feel annoyed. It’s ridiculous how emotional he is about something as trivial as a CD. And why did he even bother coming in here if he’s going to get so worked up over something so insignificant?
