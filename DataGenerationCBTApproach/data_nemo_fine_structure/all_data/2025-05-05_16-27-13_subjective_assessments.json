Can’t the students just use a regular textbook like everyone else? This must have been some kind of prank by the school staff. They’re always doing this sort of thing, pretending to be nice but secretly trying to mess with us. Well, I’m onto you now. Don’t think you can pull something like this again! This whole thing is ridiculous. What if there are other things hidden among those books? Maybe we should check every single one of them. Who knows what kind of dirt they’ll turn up? Why did they even donate this book? Did someone try to make me look stupid? You know how they love to humiliate me. This is probably another one of their tricks. I bet it was a deliberate choice. Someone must be playing some kind of sick game against me. I’m going to report this immediately. We can’t let such a disgusting book remain in our classroom. Even if it’s not mine, I won’t let others suffer through it either. The students deserve better than this trash. How could anyone even suggest donating such a disgusting book? Is it a conspiracy? Are they trying to drive me crazy? How could"

I can't imagine her going out in public like that. And another thing, what was with that ring? She always had such bad luck with jewelry; remember when she lost that fancy watch? Anyway, back to the necklace—it looks like it needs cleaning. Does anyone know how to clean jewelry? If you have any tips, let me know! This feels so unnecessary. We have more important things to worry about right now. Why did we even keep this box? It must be filled with dust from God knows how long ago. Is this really worth our time? We could be focusing on other things instead of this. This is ridiculous. I can't believe I'm wasting my time opening up an old box full of useless stuff. What if it holds some memories? No, no, no, there are better things to think about than that. Let's focus on something else. I don't see the point here. It's probably just filled with old trash anyway.

I feel like a fool, like I'm stuck in some kind of sick joke. He was supposed to be there, but he isn't. And now...now I'm just pathetic. I can barely breathe, my chest feels tight, like it's going to burst open. I keep thinking about all the times we had together, how happy we were, and how it all fell apart. I hate that I still think about him, that I miss him so much. But deep down, I know I don't deserve this. I've ruined everything. I'm just an idiot who got lucky once, and then threw it all away. I should be grateful he loved me enough to marry me, but no, instead of being happy, I'm filled with resentment. What did I ever do to deserve this pain? I never deserved love, anyway. I'm worthless, a loser. This is all my fault. I should have stayed single, avoided the heartache, kept my head down and moved on. But no, I had to go and get involved, and look"

Stop it! All or nothing thinking makes no sense. But what if I'm being irrational? Am I overreacting? No way! It's always either my fault or yours. And why am I calling you? Because I need something from you. You owe me. If I don't get it, then you owe me more. So, stop playing dumb, and admit it. I'm the best thing you have ever seen. Without me, you'll be nothing. I can see how much better we could be together. That's why I deserve everything, and you need to give it to me. Otherwise, there's no point in our relationship.

Her distress may be a symptom of a larger problem that could impact their relationship if left unaddressed. She might even be hiding something from him, and this song could be a clue.
