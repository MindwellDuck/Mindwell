The canvas he'd left unfinished still leaned against the easel, his brushes dried out beside it. A single paint tube lay abandoned on the floor, its cap off, a forgotten tear stain darkening its side. She picked it up, her fingers tracing the indented impression of his thumb. A quiet sob escaped her lips as she noticed the color: their favorite shade of blue, the one he'd mixed just for her, now drying out like their love had done so suddenly.",

Perhaps he could’ve learned to let go, and I could’ve learned to forgive. But life has a way of turning things around, doesn’t it? We were meant to be together, I told myself, but then why did he leave? Maybe he couldn’t handle the weight of being loved, or maybe he was scared of losing himself in me. Either way, I was left here, alone with my thoughts, and this blank canvas seemed to mock me. It’s funny how things can change so quickly. One day, we’re lost in our own worlds, and the next, he’s gone. He never said goodbye; he just left. I thought they might understand each other better in the end, but now I realize I was wrong. They didn’t see us the way I saw them – they saw two broken people trying to fix themselves instead of a couple who needed each other. Sometimes I imagine him coming back, holding my hand, and walking me through the city streets again. We would laugh about the past, and the memories would come flooding back. But those moments feel like they belong to someone else, not me. It’s hard to picture us happy when everything reminds me of what we had and what we lost. I wish I could turn back time, make him stay, but deep down, I know it wouldn’t work. We weren’t meant"

Every word on that card felt like a punchline to some cruel joke. \"Unworthy of this space\"? Wasn’t she already humbled enough? How could anyone make her feel more pathetic than being told her art didn’t belong here? It got worse when people started snickering behind her back. I guess my art isn't good enough for this fancy place, so let’s make fun of her while we’re at it. They’d probably say the same thing if they had the chance. And then there were those artists who actually sold their work here, acting like they owned the place because their pieces hung alongside hers. Like, thanks for your little jab, Mr. “Artistic Genius”! You know what would’ve made me feel better? If you’d just shut your mouth and admit I’m doing something wrong instead of making me look even more stupid. But honestly, I don’t think anyone else noticed how much this was eating away at me. Everyone else seemed too caught up in their own conversations to care about how I was feeling. Maybe they were all just pretending not to see me crumble. Or maybe they were too busy glo"

The fact that he did this makes me feel like I'm worthless, like none of my hard work matters. And when I think about how much he loves to brag about his own art, it makes me sick. He knows how much time and effort went into creating that piece, and he's just going to laugh about it behind my back like some kind of asshole. Why can't he just leave me alone? Why does he keep pushing my buttons like this? It's so frustrating. I try to focus on getting things done, but every time I see him, I start feeling like shit again.

As I sat there, staring blankly at the screen, all I could think about was how hard it was going to be. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to turn off the computer and walk away, but something inside me refused to give up. Maybe it was the desperation to prove to myself that I wasn't just a failure, or maybe it was the hope that somehow, someway, things would magically fix themselves overnight. Whatever the reason, I found myself digging deeper into the code, determined to make it work. But as the hours ticked by, reality began to set in. This wasn't just a simple bug; it was a complex issue that required patience, persistence, and a whole lot of luck. And yet, despite my growing frustration, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was running out of time. Every minute counted, every mistake made more difficult to recover from. It wasn't until then that I realized just how far behind I was. Panic started to creep in, making my mind race with thoughts of how I could possibly catch up. But even before I could"
