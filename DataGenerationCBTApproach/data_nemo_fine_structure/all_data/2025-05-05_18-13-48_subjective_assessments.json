It makes me so angry, and honestly, I don't even want to be around him anymore. But then again, I feel guilty for feeling this way because we're supposed to support each other. It's like he's pushing my buttons on purpose. When I was talking to him earlier, I could tell he was being really rude, saying things like, \"You think you're so smart with your fancy degree?\" And when I tried to respond calmly, he interrupted me and told me that I couldn't handle the pressure of the job. I felt like he was going to explode, and I didn't know what to say to calm him down. But then, out of nowhere, he said, \"At least I don't have to deal with people like you.\" That really got under my skin. I started thinking, What does he mean? Does he actually think I'm like that? I know I'm not, but hearing him say it made me question whether I am somehow worse than him. I felt like I was losing control, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to stay there"

That makes sense; after all, what could possibly make him forget such a precious moment? No, no, he wouldn't do that. But...he did. He picked it up again, even though it brought back all those memories. Why would he do that? I suppose he wants to relive them, but surely that's not possible. Unless...unless he wants to remember how sad it made him feel. Yeah, that makes more sense. He can't just erase memories like that. But wait, if he's feeling this way now, then wasn't he happier back then? How does that fit into the idea that he's still holding onto the past? Hmm...maybe he's not holding on anymore? Could it be that he’s not remembering everything about the past? Like, is there anything else he might have forgotten? Who knows, maybe he has, and who am I to judge? Maybe he's not really thinking about the past, either. What if he’s just lost track of time altogether? If he is, then how does that explain his current mood? Perhaps he isn’t currently feeling sad?

Her mind feels like a maze, with every path leading to disaster, yet she can’t stop herself from walking further into the darkness. Even the smallest action becomes monumental, like choosing between light and darkness, forever sealing her fate. Each step forward means more steps backward, as if every move is a countdown to collapse. Life itself has become a game of win or lose, where failure is certain doom, and success is fleeting bliss. Every second ticks by like hours, each passing moment building the weight of what could go wrong. And yet, she presses on, driven by the need to make something right, though nothing can ever be enough.

Anyway, what really gets me is when she says things like \"He must've been an angel\" because he died in our arms during childbirth. Um, isn't that just called \"stillbirth\"? But nope, according to her, he was definitely sent down from heaven. It's pretty cool how her whole attitude about death changed overnight just because my mom decided to give birth to twins. I'm not saying my sister is wrong; she might be right. After all, if you think about it, he probably would've lived forever if we hadn't gotten sick. We could've spent another 30 years together, maybe even adopted more kids. But noooo, life chose to kick him out early, and now here we are. So yeah, being grateful about having him around for a few months is totally reasonable. I mean, I wouldn't want to spend more than that anyway. Who needs a lifetime with someone when you can have just one? But honestly, I'm kinda over the whole \"being lucky\" thing. It's not like I wasn’t prepared for the worst.
