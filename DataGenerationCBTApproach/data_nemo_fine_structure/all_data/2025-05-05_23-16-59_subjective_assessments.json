I know I need to talk to him, but every time we discuss things, he just brushes it off. I feel like Iâ€™m losing control, like heâ€™s taking over our relationship. What if he decides he doesnâ€™t want me anymore? The idea is unbearable, making me sick to my stomach. My friends say I should be grateful for everything we have, that relationships take work. But when I think about how easy life would be if he stayed committed, I can't help but feel a sense of desperation. What if he suddenly changes, becomes distant again? Would I even recognize him then? I don't know what to do. Every day feels like a countdown until disaster strikes. I've tried talking to him, but he just tells me to relax, that everything will be okay. But what if he really isn't trying? What if he's already planning to leave me?

I feel completely blindsided by this turn of events. I know exactly where these paintings came from - I remember creating them myself. The colors, the composition, the emotions that went into each piece... everything feels stolen. I keep thinking about how I must have misplaced them somehow. That would make sense, wouldn't it? Maybe I didn't sell them after all, or maybe someone took them by mistake? I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal my art unless they thought it would be valuable someday. Why else would they do such a thing? This is all so unbelievable. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I remember clearly selling those pieces to a reputable gallery, and I think I received payment for them too. If I hadn't gotten paid, then surely I wouldn't be seeing them here now. This entire situation has left me feeling utterly confused and frustrated. I'm having trouble understanding how something like this could happen. Even though I'm starting to think I might have"

We need to be more vigilant during patrols. This could be our chance to catch them off guard. We've been warned about people pretending to be innocent. I remember one time, we were called out for something minor, but then it turned out to be a setup. That guy was totally lying about his identity. We need to keep an eye on everyone. This isn't fair; I have nothing to prove. But if I start doing better, maybe they'll leave me alone. I don't want to be treated like this anymore. I'm trying my hardest, but it's hard when they make you feel like you're failing all the time. Maybe if we stop letting them push us around, they won't think they can treat us poorly either. We deserve respect, and if we stand up for ourselves, things will change. I know what I saw, and I'm not going to back down now. If anything, this makes me more determined.
