He must feel like he has nothing else going for him, and then he gets stuck with all these problems to deal with. That makes sense to me because if I were in his shoes, I'd probably feel pretty bad about it too. It's so unfair how people have to put up with this kind of stress without getting any recognition.

You can never be truly safe; it’s just a matter of time before disaster strikes again. Even with all our best efforts, some people will fall. The world isn’t set up to protect us; it’s designed to break us. This isn’t some rare occurrence; it’s happening everywhere. Everyone is just one wrong step away from suffering like that poor kid. We need to lock people away before they cause more harm. If only we could keep everyone locked up, none of this would happen. Then, at least, we’d know everything is going to be okay.

I bet she thinks I’m just mad at the state of the house, not at her specific laziness. That’s what she wants me to think anyway, so she can avoid accountability.

I’ve seen this before, though. When she’s stressed, she gets overwhelmed and forgets everything. It’s always something else. She doesn’t realize how much I care about keeping our home clean and organized. But does she ever stop to think about how hard I work every day? Does she ever consider that maybe I have things to stress about too? Nope. She just keeps blaming everyone else, including me, for her own shortcomings. It’s pathetic. The worst part?

She probably wants to talk things through and figure out how they can make this work.
