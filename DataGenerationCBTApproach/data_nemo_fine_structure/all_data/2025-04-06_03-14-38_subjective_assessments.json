He had expected praise for his handling of little Emma's behavioral issues, but instead, he found her mother complaining to the principal about his \"unnecessary roughness.\" The principal looked up, eyes cold behind his glasses, and said, \"We'll discuss this later, John.\" Now, as he poured himself a coffee, he noticed the others averting their gaze. A photocopy of a disciplinary form lay on the counter, his name printed at the top. He felt the heat rise in his cheeks as he realized everyone had seen it.",

I bet he didn't even listen to what the principal said; probably just stood there with his arms crossed, daring anyone to say anything else. It's no surprise the principal is treating him like an underclassman when he acts like one. And why did they put his disciplinary form right out front? That must have been a deliberate choice to humiliate him. He has to be fuming, hasn't he? This whole situation is a perfect reflection of how he always tries to shift the blame onto someone else. He's probably going to try to spin this conversation into some kind of victory, too. Just wait until he starts making excuses about how he was misunderstood and how no one saw how he really tried to help Emma. I can already imagine the way he'll talk about it later, all sugarcoated and full of half-truths. He needs to take responsibility for his actions, but he'll never admit being wrong. His ego won't let him do that, especially after something like this. He’ll find a way to justify everything and make us look bad for even bringing it up. We need to be prepared for his tantrum, because we know he’s going to throw a fit. If he gets defensive, he might lash out, which would give us the opportunity to show him what he’s capable of. It’s best if he does that now"

In that moment, I see the faintest glimmer of hope, but it's quickly extinguished by the weight of reality. \"You're going to be fine,\" I say firmly, trying to reassure her. \"You'll find your way again, even if it takes time.\" My words seem hollow, even to my own ears, because I don't believe them. Not really. \"But what if...?\" She trails off, her voice fading into silence.

That stupid graffiti they left last week is just one example; I know they've been coming back for months, maybe even years. Those kids think they own the city, that no one cares about what they do. They never think about the impact their actions have on people like me, who actually care about the neighborhood. When I look around at the state of our community, it makes me want to lose my mind. I'm trapped between feeling helpless and wanting to lash out. The thought of those kids laughing while they destroy his property is unbearable. I wish I could stop them, but I know it's impossible. Now, as I watch them skate away, I feel even worse, knowing that whatever I try won't be enough to stop them. Every day feels like a fight against something else. I hate seeing them skate by, especially when they turn down his alleyway. I'm constantly worried about them vandalizing his walls. It’s like they’re playing a twisted game where they leave messes everywhere, knowing that I’ll spend hours cleaning it up. They don’t care that they cause stress for him, that they ruin his life.

Shouldn’t they respect the fact that every student learns differently? It’s such an injustice when they act like you’re not trying hard enough. You know, it would make more sense if they took responsibility for their kid’s lack of progress instead of just blaming teachers for everything. But no, instead, we get entitled parents who think they can dictate how teachers run their classrooms. I mean, come on, shouldn’t they know better than anyone else how their kids’ education works?
