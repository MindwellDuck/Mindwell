What am I missing? Is there some kind of hidden meaning behind it? Why would she be laughing at him when I know he’s really nice?! Does she think I’m such an idiot that I wouldn’t notice how he’s always being friendly to me? How could she do this to me?! My heart hurts so much, but I don’t understand why. I thought we had a good relationship—why is this happening now?! Doesn’t anyone see that I care about them?! **My head feels like it's going to explode.** **How can people laugh at each other like this? Don't they realize I have feelings too? This isn’t fair; I've been trying so hard to get closer to them, and now they’re doing this right in front of me. Even if Jamie is a friend, which he is (he is), doesn’t mean I need to be around him right now. But no, she has to go and make me feel this way. My anxiety is through the roof!

It's like, okay, maybe things aren't perfect, but I thought we were doing better than that? Maybe she was stressed out about something else, like work or school, or maybe she was just tired. You never know what people are going through until you ask them directly. And honestly, I feel bad for him because it sounds really tough.
