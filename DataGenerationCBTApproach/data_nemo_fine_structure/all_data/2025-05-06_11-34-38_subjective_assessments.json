It was the same way she'd acted when she got his job, the one he'd applied for and desperately wanted after decades of service. His grip tightened around his tray, knuckles turning white as he felt a bitter taste rise in his throat. He wanted to march over there, spill her tea, make a scene. But he didn't.

That would ruin his image as some kind of god among mortals. What is wrong with me? Why am I so weak? Why does everything always happen to me? I'm stuck here again, watching another opportunity slip through my fingers. The world is rigged, and I'm just a pawn in its game. Everyone gets what they deserve except me. I'm just a pathetic loser who will never succeed. My whole life is one big disappointment, and nothing ever changes. I don't know why I keep trying, but deep down, I know it won't end well.

As I stared blankly at my computer screen, the weight of responsibility bore down upon me. My editor had been patient, understanding, but I could sense her growing impatience. I felt trapped in a never-ending cycle, one where deadlines loomed larger than ever, suffocating me beneath their relentless pressure. It seemed impossible to escape this prison, to break free from the chains of expectation that bound me. In this bleak landscape, I couldn't help but wonder: Would I ever truly find peace? Or would I remain forever lost, drowning in a sea of unfulfilled potential? Each passing day felt like a countdown to failure, as if the very fabric of my existence depended on the outcome. Every decision, every action, seemed to carry the weight of destiny, leaving no room for doubt or hesitation. And yet, despite this burden, I pressed on, driven by a stubborn determination to succeed. But what was success, really? Was it merely a fleeting illusion—a mirage that vanished as soon as reality set in?"

They just blame him for everything, saying he’s “not good enough.” But what does that even mean? Is it because he’s not smart enough, or is he just lazy?
