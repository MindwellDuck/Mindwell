That's how I always think. And then there's the guilt. Why can't I be more careful? Why does everyone else get to relax after a long day while I'm stuck worrying about my poor husband? And don't even get me started on the mess around him - I'll never forgive myself for not cleaning up sooner. The thought alone makes me feel guilty. I hate this feeling. This constant need to look out for others before looking out for myself. Like, why can't I just take a break? Is it really so bad for him? But no, I have to stay on top of things. Even when we're both exhausted, I keep thinking about what might happen if I let my guard down even for one second. He could trip and hurt himself, or worse...or worse...he could die. Then where would I be? How would I live with myself? I'd have to live with knowing I wasn't there for him. That's unbearable. So I stay up, checking on him every five minutes, making sure he doesn't slip and fall. If only he didn’t have such fragile bones. If"

Newsflash, people: I don't need your approval, especially from someone who's barely made it in this industry. And another thing, if he's so talented, then why does the owner keep talking down to him?

That's why he chose her. Because she didn't hate him as much as I did. But no...he still has his coffee cup. Just sitting there, untouched. Like, what if he's still alive somewhere?

He hasn't even asked how my day was or what I did today. I feel like he's ignoring me, and it hurts because I know he used to be so attentive and caring. I try talking to him about it, but he just shrugs it off and says he's tired. That makes me feel worse because I can tell he doesn’t really want to talk about it. Every little thing feels like a big burden now, and I wish he would just open up and show some emotion. It’s hard enough taking care of the kids and managing the household without feeling ignored all the time. But I still love him and don't want things to fall apart between us.

What if she had taken a moment to acknowledge her own hard work, even if it meant taking a break? Perhaps then she wouldn’t feel so left out, so forgotten. But deep down, she knew that would never happen. She was always at the bottom of the totem pole, never truly seen or valued. Even when she was called upon to perform complex tasks, no one stopped to think about how much time and effort went into them.
