They know how much I hate being reminded of him. I can imagine them joking around, but it doesn’t matter. It’s just noise, like the constant hum of anxiety I live with every day. What’s important is that I keep moving forward, not dwelling on something that happened years ago. I have too much work to do, and I’m exhausted. This letter is meaningless; I won’t let it distract me from everything else. I’ll just ignore it and move on. That letter was probably meant for him, not me. He must have sent it out accidentally. If anything, it’s proof that he’s trying to make amends, which isn’t going to happen anytime soon. We agreed to stay away from each other, and I respect that.

She wondered if she could have done something differently, if there was anything she could have changed to prevent his departure. But every time she tried to think of solutions, she hit a dead end, unable to find any answers. It was as if they lived parallel lives, never intersecting again. He wasn't mad anymore; his anger had faded into sadness, replaced by a deep emptiness. His eyes, once bright and full of hope, now looked dull and tired, as if the weight of his decision had drained the color from them. She remembered the way he smiled when they first met, how his laughter could light up a room, but now it was just a distant memory. Everything felt frozen in time, stuck between what could have been and what would never be. She felt trapped, like she was living in a dream, one that was slowly turning into reality.

I can see why she would want to keep it, but it's nothing compared to the countless hours of actual work waiting for us back home. She probably never planned on finishing it anyway; she was too busy wasting her time reading romance novels and pretending to be someone else. I remember how she used to say how much she loved jigsaw puzzles, but that was just another one of those “oh, look how interesting” things she said to make me feel better when I was stressed out. What does it really matter if she finished it? We’re not exactly living our best lives right now anyway. There’s no point in getting sentimental over something as trivial as a puzzle. It’s just a reminder of the life we could’ve had if only she hadn’t gotten sick and changed everything. Even though she’s gone now, maybe it’s time I stopped holding onto the past like this.

At first, it was just small things—missing deadlines, forgotten appointments—but soon it became a pattern. He'd get lost in thought during meetings, struggling to keep up with discussions. Even simple tasks feel overwhelming, making him wonder if anyone would notice if he skipped them. His friends try to reach out, but he's too busy rehashing what could have been to respond. One evening, as he sat in his darkened office, surrounded by the remnants of a life left behind, he realized something. Everything around him reminded him of happier times—the old books, the framed photos, even the faint scent of his late wife’s perfume. Yet, despite these reminders, he felt no joy. Only emptiness lingered, like a shadow haunting every corner of his mind. In moments like these, he wonders how he ended up here. How did someone who once had so much become so broken? He thinks about the days when he used to be confident, when success seemed within reach. Now, those memories feel distant, fading into the background as the weight of disappointment grows.

Her frustration is understandable, given that he barely acknowledges her presence anymore. His indifference feels like a betrayal, especially since they share an apartment.

It is clear that she doesn't value honesty in their relationship.
