It sounds like she's trying to make herself look good by associating me with all the success and attention. And now he says she's been telling people that I'm the one who cooks here? That's so much worse than if she just said it casually. She could've just talked about it as if it was no big deal; instead, she's making it sound like I'm doing something special because she's my partner. I feel embarrassed just hearing it out loud. How can someone say such things? Doesn’t she know I’m already stressed enough from running the business and dealing with customers? This is ridiculous. I wonder what she’s going through that she would even think like this. Is she trying to get attention again? Does she really need to bring up my personal life in front of strangers? And why does she keep bringing it up anyway? Maybe she thinks being associated with me will help her career somehow. I don't know how many times I've had to remind her that my focus isn't on our relationship, it's on getting everything done around here. But she doesn't seem to care about that"

And now they’ll have to deal with the shame of being associated with someone who failed to publish. This is such a big blow to her ego, and it makes everything she did feel meaningless. All those hours spent writing, editing, and researching—everything she put into it just went down the drain. Now she feels like she wasted her time. She was convinced that her research could make a real difference, but instead it looks like nothing at all. All those times she thought about her late husband and wanted to keep his spirit alive by continuing his work? They were all for nothing. He won’t be proud of her anymore. What if he’s watching this from wherever he is, feeling sad and disappointed? She knows she needs to focus on moving forward, but this news feels like a huge weight crushing her.

Even when they talk about life, it's all about how great his retirement must be, never once acknowledging her struggles. The way he smiles, saying things like “Life is good” or “We have each other now,” just makes her want to scream. It’s all so superficial, especially when he doesn’t even notice the tears she’s trying to hold back. How can he not see what she’s going through? Doesn’t he understand that this isn’t just about her, but about their entire family? Every little thing matters, and yet, he acts like nothing is wrong. I wonder if he realizes how much pressure I’m under, how much stress builds up until it finally explodes. If only he could understand, if only he saw what it means to live a double life like mine. Sometimes I feel like we’re just two separate people living in the same space. We share meals together, watch movies, and go to bed, but our lives are worlds apart.

Every day, she watched as families were torn apart by loss, and she felt trapped, unable to connect with anyone. Her thoughts swirled with anger towards herself for feeling so helpless, but she knew she couldn't change anything. The way I see it is either you are completely fine, or your entire life is ruined. If you're doing well, you can't possibly understand what others are going through. But if you're struggling, nothing else matters, and everything feels pointless. There's no middle ground – you're either living happily ever after or lost forever. It's such a simple distinction, yet it makes all the difference. When you know where you stand, it’s easy to accept things as they are. You realize that there’s no need to worry about the past or future when you’re living in the moment. This perspective helps me cope with difficult situations, even when things seem overwhelming. It reminds me that no matter what happens, I have a choice—either I let my circumstances define me, or I take control and make the best of whatever comes next. By choosing how I respond, I can turn even the toughest moments into opportunities for growth. -Dr. Rachel Kim, Palliative Care Specialist ###"
