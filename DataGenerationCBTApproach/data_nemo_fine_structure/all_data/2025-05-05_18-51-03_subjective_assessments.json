It's like he's waiting for something to happen, and I'm just a piece of meat to him. Why can't people be normal for once? They have to go and make everything about themselves, and then wonder why everyone else doesn't want to deal with them. It's exhausting. I've had enough of being treated like dirt over my stupid job. If I didn't live here, I'd be long gone, but no, I'm stuck dealing with these losers. He's probably still there, watching me, thinking he's so smart for doing nothing. I bet he's got a million other tricks up his sleeve. He thinks he's above all this because he wears that stupid hoodie. Like it makes him tough. Newsflash, dude, you're not even close to tough. You're just a pathetic loser who wants attention. My life would be so much easier if I could just leave this place behind.

It's always better to be safe than sorry, but what if we overreact? He seemed fine when I left him at work earlier. Maybe I'm overthinking everything. How do I even know if he’s okay? Is this really just anxiety, or am I missing some signs? I need to check his pulse again—oh no, it’s dropping! This is real, and I need to get him to the hospital ASAP. We can’t afford to waste time; every minute counts. If I push too hard, maybe he’ll feel pressured, and it will make things worse. Wait, why am I worried about that? Isn’t it better to take action and risk scaring him further? No, no, I need to stay calm and think clearly. This is ridiculous—I’m freaking myself out unnecessarily. Okay, let’s try to focus.

Can't you just feel the darkness closing in around you? It's making me so mad. You know why? Because you said something horrible about my husband. My husband was an amazing man, always helping others, and never causing problems for anyone. But then again, maybe he wasn't good enough for someone like you. Maybe he deserved to die in agony surrounded by all those other horrible people. I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.

The ER doc calls it \"touch and go.\" She's heard that before too. But this time, it feels like a death sentence. Her heart pounds in her chest, anger surging through her veins like lava.

She knows how much she needs to see him. She needs to know he's going to be okay. So when the doctor tells her they're removing him from life support, she rushes to his side, tears streaming down her face. As soon as he opens his eyes, she starts talking, telling him everything - all the memories they've shared, all the jokes they used to tell each other, all the late-night conversations about life and dreams. She holds his hand tight, praying that somehow, someway, he'll come back to her. But then, reality hits. They have no idea if he'll ever wake up again. All they know is that the machine isn't working. And even if it did, would he really want to live? Would he rather spend the rest of his days trapped in a body that doesn't work right? Maybe, just maybe, this is the universe's way of telling us that we don't deserve to live anyway. Maybe this is our punishment for being here in the first place.
