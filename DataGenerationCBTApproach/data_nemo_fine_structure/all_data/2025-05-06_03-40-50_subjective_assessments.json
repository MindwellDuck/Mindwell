In this case, the interaction with the underage boy escalated quickly, leading to a snap decision. ## Step 2: Recognize the pattern Recognize how this behavior is a common occurrence for you. Have you always been quick to anger, especially when faced with situations involving authority figures? How often does this happen? ## Step 3: Analyze the thought process Analyze your thought process during the incident. What were your initial thoughts? Were you feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or frustrated? Did you let those emotions take over? ## Step 4: Examine the label Examine the label you placed on yourself during the situation. Was it accurate? Would someone else call you an asshole for reacting so aggressively? What would be a more fitting description? ## Step 5: Consider alternative perspectives Consider alternative perspectives from the situation. How might the underage boy have felt during the confrontation? What if he had been sober instead of drunk?
