She'd been a police officer for decades, but this morning's call still haunted her - the young man who'd taken his own life, barely more than a boy. Her partner had tried to talk to her on the ride back, but she'd shut him down, retreating into silence. Now, as she sat alone, the familiar weight of remorse pressed heavy on her chest. The untouched breakfast was a stark reminder of the family waiting downstairs, unaware that their mother's job had claimed another victim, this time not with a badge, but with a rope.",

But now, the image felt like a cruel reminder of what he had lost – a wife who had moved on. She seemed to have found happiness with another man, leaving him to celebrate milestones alone. Every time he looked at the picture, it reinforced the feeling that he wasn’t good enough, that he’d never truly be loved. The memory of their child’s first birthday kept flashing through his mind, and all he could think about was how he would spend that day without her, surrounded by strangers. It seemed like every step forward led to more steps backward. He couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was drowning in sadness, unable to find a lifeline. Even though he knew he needed to move on, the pain lingered, refusing to let go. As he stared at the photo, he wondered if he’d ever be able to heal, or if he was forever trapped in this cycle of heartache."
