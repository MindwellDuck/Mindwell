This isn’t surprising; he was never a close friend anyway. He wasn’t there when I needed him most. We used to share everything, but now all I feel is emptiness. He doesn’t know how much I miss those late-night talks, how much I wish things could go back to how they were. Now, I’m left with nothing but these memories and sadness. My best friend just disappeared. # No need to respond, this is already done! Thanks! :) Edit: Wow, thank you all for your kind words and support! I'm glad this resonated with many of you. Thank you again! Edit 2: Sorry, I missed some responses earlier. I'll try to answer everyone's questions now! * I don't have personal experiences, but I can definitely try to help others who might be struggling with similar issues. * Yes, I understand why people would feel this way, especially if they've lost a close friend.
