I couldn't help but feel like she'd abandoned me again, this time because of her family obligations. It felt like she didn't even bother to explain herself, just dropped everything and ran off to take care of her mother. And now, we're supposed to spend our evening together? Forget it. The whole thing stinks. She never even bothered to call or text me about how late she was going to be. It's always the same - whenever she needs something from me, she just takes it without asking or even considering my schedule. I'm starting to think she doesn't need me at all. And when I try to talk to her about it, she just brushes it off with some vague excuse about being too tired or overwhelmed. It's exhausting trying to deal with her constant demands and lack of respect. When I suggested we eat together anyway, she blew me off, saying she needed to rest before dealing with her mom. Yeah, right. Like I don't know what she does all day. I bet she's out there enjoying her freedom while I'm stuck here waiting for her. Meanwhile, she gets to hang out with her friends and go shopping, leaving me to fend for myself. It's pathetic. This isn’t the first time she’s done this; she’s always prioritizing her family over us. We barely see each other anymore, and when we"

Or maybe I just need to stop worrying about everything. But what if I fail again? What if I disappoint everyone? I don't want to let anyone down anymore. This is why I hate being married. My wife deserves someone perfect, someone who won't make her feel embarrassed. Someone who doesn’t fuck up. I’m ruining our life together. I wish we could just start over.

The fact that she'd seen it all before, that she'd endured hardships that no one else could imagine, didn't seem to matter. Her accomplishments were overshadowed by his.

This has nothing to do with me; it’s just another example of how I’m not good enough. She should have told him directly instead of leaving a note. It makes sense that he feels hurt, but he knows she doesn’t dislike his work. Maybe if we weren’t holding our breaths for this opportunity, we’d see things more clearly. His fear of failure isn’t rational, but it’s understandable given how much they’ve invested in this project. If he couldn’t handle rejection, maybe he shouldn’t have pushed himself so hard. It’s strange how everyone else’s behavior seems to mirror my own insecurities. How did they get to this point without realizing it? Does it make sense that every rejection feeds into his self-doubt? Even though we all know he needs to grow up, he still acts like a child who hasn’t learned from past mistakes. I wonder if he realizes how much he’s letting his emotions control him. We should try to help him understand that rejection isn’t personal, but I suppose that’s easier said than done. I don't think he really cares about the gallery; he's just trying to convince himself"

My perception shifted from \"this is too easy,\" to \"maybe this isn't so bad after all.\" But then I remembered something else - she'd always said she valued honesty above all else. Now, I was faced with the possibility that she might be lying to herself, just like she'd lied to me by pretending everything was okay. This realization made me think about the fact that sometimes people can't even be honest with themselves, especially when they're scared or unsure. And I wondered if maybe she was doing the same thing right now, hiding her feelings behind a mask of confidence.
