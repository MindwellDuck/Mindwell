It's no wonder she feels so entitled, selling out to the highest bidder. I can't stand how she flaunts her success, rubbing it in everyone's face. If she were a real artist, she wouldn't be wasting her time at galleries, churning out mediocre pieces for wealthy collectors. She's just another shallow celebrity, using her talent to make money and impress the masses. Her paintings lack depth and emotion; they're nothing more than shallow reflections of life. Anyone can create something visually appealing, but true artistry requires substance and passion. She's not putting anything meaningful into her work; it's just a hollow attempt to get ahead in a competitive field. I wouldn't waste my time creating such bland, uninspired pieces. And yet, here she is, basking in the attention of strangers and sipping champagne with the elite. It's almost pathetic how much she's bought into the idea of being famous. She thinks she's above everyone else because of her art, but in reality, she's just another sellout. Her success is fleeting, and soon she'll fade away, leaving nothing behind except a trail of disappointed fans. She might have fooled people with her initial talent, but once the novelty wears off, she'll be forgotten. I feel sorry for her, stuck in this superficial world where talent isn't enough.

I'm being paranoid again. Why can't I just stay calm? I've dealt with worse situations than this, but somehow my mind decides to make this one about my own safety, even when it doesn't deserve to be. I'm such a coward sometimes. I know better than this, but my brain won't listen. Now I'm at the top of the stairs, ready to see what's going on down there, but part of me is still screaming that I shouldn't be doing this. I shouldn’t be so scared. I shouldn’t be thinking this way. Shouldn’t I just ignore the noise and go back to sleep? Why can't I just relax? I’m not supposed to be freaking out over something so trivial.

I just wish those coworkers could see me in a different light, though - they were always making snide comments about my outfits. When I was working there, everyone would stare at my breasts all the time. Even when I wasn't wearing anything too revealing, they still couldn't help themselves. And then there was the incident with Tom, where he laughed along with his colleagues while I was trying to focus on my job. He never said anything directly, but it felt like he was mocking me whenever we passed each other in the hallway. That's why I'm so glad I left; I didn't need to be treated like that. Now I feel free to show off my personality instead of just my physical appearance. It's nice to have a break from all the drama. Now that I'm out of that toxic environment, I can finally relax and enjoy being myself again. Life is moving forward, and I'm excited to explore what's next for me. No longer will I have to worry about people judging me based on something as superficial as clothing choices.
