You know how some people always get picked first, but never really deserve it? Yeah, I'm one of them. Whenever there are big announcements, everyone looks at me like they're waiting for me to mess up. And honestly, sometimes I think they’re right. When I’m in public, I can’t help but notice when people stare at me. It’s like I have this weird magnet that pulls attention toward me. Sometimes it feels like they’re judging me, like they already think I’m doing something wrong. I hate being the center of attention, especially if it means making others uncomfortable. But you know what’s worse than standing out? Being forgotten. Even though I try to blend into the crowd, somehow I always end up in the most awkward spots. Like when we were walking across campus, I tripped over my own feet and almost fell. People started snickering behind me, and I just wanted to disappear. It wasn’t just that one time either; every situation where I accidentally bump into someone or knock things over ends up with people laughing at me. Even if I don’t mean to, I seem to attract more attention than I want. It’s hard enough dealing with these little incidents, but then I remember when I accidentally spilled coffee all over my shirt during a meeting. Everyone laughed, and now I feel like I need to wear a bib"

His mind kept wandering back to the countless times he'd seen patients slip away from him, leaving behind families torn apart and lives shattered.* *But Dr. M refused to let those memories define him. Instead, he channeled them into fuel for his determination to succeed.
