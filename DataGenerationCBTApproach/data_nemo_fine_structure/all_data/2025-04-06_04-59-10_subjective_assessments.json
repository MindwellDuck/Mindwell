Doesn't she have common sense? That noise could be anything. You can't trust anyone anymore, especially at night. This is insane. The worst case scenario is that she got mugged or raped. What if she's still out there? No one ever finds missing people anyway. This is terrible. I'm going to call the police right now. I'm calling the cops, oh no she might be dead! Oh no, oh no, oh no. We're all going to die, everyone. Everyone will get killed, we're all doomed. There are serial killers everywhere. Don't let your kids walk alone at night. Don't make her do it.

All this time, I thought I was the best one for the role, but now I realize I was just delusional. He must have been born with some innate talent that allowed him to excel immediately, while I struggled even though I've spent years honing my skills. I wonder what kind of background he has, and why he's so good at it already. I bet he didn't work hard enough; maybe he's just naturally gifted. My anxiety is making me question everything. How can I compete with someone who doesn't seem to put in any effort? This isn't fair; I worked too hard to get where I am, but he's getting ahead faster than I ever did. What does it mean when someone takes over your role so easily? Is there something wrong with me? Am I really not good enough anymore?"

I wish things could still be like that today, but I'm grateful for all the good times we had together. You know, I've often thought about how much you meant to me during our time together. I remember how much joy you brought into my life with your love and support. Even though things didn't work out, I'll always cherish those happy memories. They remind me of happier times and give me hope for brighter days ahead. I guess I can forgive you for leaving me now, knowing that life took us in different directions.

In this moment, he feels lost, unsure how he'll manage without the familiar comfort of his spices. What if everything falls apart when he can't rely on them? As he stands there, the air thickens with anxiety. What if the thought of working alone makes him doubt his abilities? A faint tremble runs through his fingers as he reaches for the cabinet handle.

A single photo caught his eye—a moment of pure joy, frozen forever. They were laughing, arms around each other, their faces lit up by the sun. In that instant, everything else faded away, leaving only the warmth of their connection. Yet, as he gazed deeper into the frame, reality crept back in, and the sadness began to suffocate him again.
