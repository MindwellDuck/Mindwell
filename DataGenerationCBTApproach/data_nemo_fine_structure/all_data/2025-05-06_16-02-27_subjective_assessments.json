She stirred her cooling coffee, her eyes fixed on the untouched sandwich she'd brought from home. A young doctor approached, his white coat pristine, a smile on his face. He held out a small toy dinosaur, a gift for the child she cared for yesterday, now stable but still critical. \"I thought you might want to give this to him,\" he said, placing it gently in her hand. She felt a pang of guilt as she took it, remembering she'd promised to read his favorite book to him last night, but had been too busy with other patients.",

That kid would probably love it more than anything else in the world. But no, instead of asking if he can stay and talk about how much he loves dinosaurs, or even suggesting we grab a snack together, he just walks away. It's so fucking condescending. He thinks I'm just going to put it on my desk and stare at it all day, pretending to care? Well, newsflash, pal, I've got better things to do.

My mind wanders to the countless hours spent in those very labs, where our research intertwined like the threads of a tapestry. The memories are bittersweet—each moment filled with laughter and camaraderie, yet punctuated by the subtle undercurrents of unrequited love. It is almost...inconvenient to acknowledge that these feelings never truly dissipated, even after our divorce. I suppose it is natural to feel a pang of melancholy when confronted with reminders of what could have been. The way my hand hesitates before touching the photo—a gesture both tender and vulnerable—is a testament to the enduring power of nostalgia. Even now, as I sit alone in my study, surrounded by the trappings of a life once shared, I am reminded that some wounds run far deeper than they initially appear. Yet, perhaps, one might argue that such introspection is merely a product of my own emotional fragility—a fragile soul struggling to find solace in the cold light of reality. I wonder if she ever thinks of me, or if the years have long since erased the memory of our time together. Perhaps, I rationalize, this photograph serves as nothing more than a nostalgic relic—a tangible connection to a bygone era, rather than a painful reminder of all that has been lost.
