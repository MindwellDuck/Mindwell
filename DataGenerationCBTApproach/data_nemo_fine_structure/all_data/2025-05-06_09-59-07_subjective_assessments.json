They must be mocking me personally because they have nothing better to do than make fun of my teaching skills. Why are they laughing so much? Are they trying to show off how much fun they're having while I'm stuck here? It's obvious they're doing it for attention, and I'm the target. These students don't care about learning; they just want to have fun and distract themselves from their own boredom. But no, instead, they choose to focus on me, making fun of my lack of romantic life. It's all about me—my pathetic love life, my lonely status, and my inability to find a partner. They must hate me so much that they enjoy making fun of me behind my back. This isn't just about my teaching; it's about me being an outcast, a failure, and a loser. I'm so tired of dealing with their jealousy and resentment. I try my best to help them learn, but they just keep going back to making fun of me. They probably think they're funny, but deep down, they're insecure and jealous of someone who actually has a life. They must be secretly wishing they could be in my shoes,"

They’re probably worthless now. So yeah, maybe he did the right thing by getting rid of that card. After all, it’s not like his wife would be upset or anything. This whole thing is overblown. The kid didn’t mean to offend him. He probably thinks it’s funny how the chef freaked out. I’m sure the kid will apologize soon enough.

And another thing, we had our argument last night, but he wouldn't say anything about leaving. Wouldn't he give me a chance to apologize first? How could he just walk out on us like that? Maybe he's still there, maybe he's just pretending to be dead. I won't accept this until I hear it from my own ears. Tell me again, please. This has to be some kind of cruel joke. Nothing good ever happens to me anyway. Now he's gone, and I'm stuck here, alone, with nothing but bitter memories. Don't try to convince me; I already know the truth.

I was supposed to deliver a presentation about our latest breakthroughs, but I had forgotten to bring my notes. To make matters worse, there were several colleagues from other universities who seemed to be taking great pleasure in my misfortune. Their whispers and snickers only added fuel to my growing anxiety. It was clear they thought I was some kind of bumbling fool who couldn't manage even something as simple as giving a talk. As I stood there, feeling the weight of their gaze, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was just another example of fortune-telling gone wrong. After all, isn't it always said that you can see into the future through your intuition? Perhaps they were simply reading me like a book, anticipating every move I would make next.

Some people have asked how I came up with this response. Here’s my thought process: 1. **Start with a negative emotion**: Begin by expressing anger or frustration instead of sadness. 2. **Emphasize the negative aspects**: Highlight the negative side of the situation (\"He fucking had to go and get caught\") and downplay the positive aspects (\"It's not like we’re talking about some major deal-breaker here\"). 3. **Focus on personal flaws**: Instead of focusing on the situation itself, shift attention to the protagonist’s ("
