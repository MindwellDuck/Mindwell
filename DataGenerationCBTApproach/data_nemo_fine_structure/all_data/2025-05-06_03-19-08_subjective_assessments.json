This isn’t fair; I’m the one who works hard every day, making sure everything runs smoothly around here, while she gets to sleep in until noon because she has more important things than her husband. And what’s worse is that she’s always so busy with her “career,” I barely see her anymore. We used to spend weekends together, but now it feels like we only share a few minutes before she rushes off to some high-powered business meeting. Does she think I don’t notice how much less time she spends with me? Or maybe she thinks I should just magically understand why she has to put her job above our relationship?

Her mind wandered to last night's argument with her husband over his late-night work calls. She had snapped at him, words laced with venom she didn't mean. Now, regret weighed heavy on her chest like an apron soaked in spilled gravy. As she reached for the thyme, her hand knocked over a bottle of expensive olive oil, sending it crashing to the floor.

She knew exactly how to push my buttons, and now, as we sat down to dinner, the tension between us is palpable. This isn't just about the mess; it's about the unspoken resentment that has been building since our argument last night. The way she looked at me, her eyes flashing with anger, left me feeling like I was walking on eggshells around her. But then, something shifted. A small part of me remembered why I fell in love with her in the first place - her passion for cooking, her dedication to our family, and the countless ways she puts others before herself. The smell of those onions, once overwhelming, suddenly transported me back to our wedding day, when she surprised me by making my favorite dish from scratch. It was then that I realized the true meaning of \"love\" wasn't about avoiding conflict, but embracing it. Just as a chef needs every ingredient to create harmony, our relationship requires both light and dark moments to flourish. And yet, despite this newfound understanding, I still can't shake off the feeling that she's trying to punish me for being away. Every time she looks at me, I see a flicker of disappointment, as if I've failed some unspoken test"
