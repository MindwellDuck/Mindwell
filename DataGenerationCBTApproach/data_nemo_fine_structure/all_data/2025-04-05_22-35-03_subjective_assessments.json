Shouldn’t I be able to handle things by now? Fuck, I’m tired of fucking everything up. I guess what really gets under my skin is when I see others succeed where I fail.

Why does everything turn into shit the moment I try? I’ve tried so hard to change, but nothing seems to work. And the worst part? I should be doing better. I should be successful, confident, happy. But instead, I’m still struggling, and it feels like everyone else has moved on. Why can’t I catch up?

And once again, she finds herself wondering what she could've done differently to make things work out better. It's not like this happens only once; it's always happening. Always. Every single time. People always end up cancelling on me, and I never get anything out of it. It's not just about the exclusives; it's about the frustration, the wasted time, and the disappointment. Sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, I'm stuck in this cycle of letdowns. This isn't the first time someone has pulled this stunt, but it's definitely not the last.

You know, it’s like the world is just waiting for me to make some mistake so it can tell me, \"See, this is why you never get invited to parties anymore.\" Last night, I swear I saw our neighbor peeking into our window from her balcony. She looked really upset, but I don’t remember seeing anything unusual. Still, now that I think about it, I wonder if there was a reason for her to look like that.
