And now they're telling me to focus on another project? Are they kidding me?! Do they think I'm some kind of robot who can just switch gears that easily? What is wrong with these people? Don't they understand that every single thing I do contributes to our success? How can they just ignore all that and give someone else the opportunity? It makes no sense at all. This is so unfair, especially after putting in so much time and energy. Why are they doing this? Have they forgotten about all the times I worked late nights, weekends, and holidays just to get things done right? And then what happens? Nothing. Just constant criticism and rejections. I feel like I'm being treated like a second-class citizen here. I swear, these people must have some kind of personal vendetta against me. I'm starting to wonder if there's something more going on behind the scenes. Maybe they're trying to sabotage me. That would make perfect sense, given the way they've been treating me lately.

My sister, who doesn’t have kids yet, is perfectly put-together, never complaining, always organized. Meanwhile, I’m here trying to juggle my career, dealing with people, and still manage to keep my head above water. And what does she say when I complain? Just more drama. Like, I know things aren’t easy for her, but why is it so damn easy for everyone else?! What am I missing?! This isn’t just about stuff, it’s about feeling overwhelmed by everything.

Maybe she saw the look of genuine friendship that we all tried to cultivate, but somehow never quite managed to achieve.
