The house was quiet except for the soft hum of the refrigerator, a stark contrast to the bustling newsroom she'd left behind hours ago. A stray curl of hair fell into her eyes as she stirred her cooling cup of tea, the once-vibrant red now faded like an old photograph. Absently, she reached for his favorite mug, but her hand only grasped empty air. A melancholic sigh escaped her lips, echoing in the silent room.",

It wasn't uncommon; he'd often slip away during meetings, disappearing into the city's endless labyrinth. But this time felt different—a sense of unease settled over her like a shroud, refusing to lift. She replayed their conversation from earlier that day, his words still resonating in her mind—“Just need some space, I'll be back soon.” Space? For who? Or what? He'd always been the one to leave first, never staying long enough to make it feel like home. Yet, when they were together, every moment felt precious, filled with laughter and whispers shared in dark corners. He'd promised to return by sunset, but now, the sun had dipped below the horizon, casting the room in a cold, unforgiving light. Her thoughts swirled around him, trying to fill the void he'd left behind. She wondered if he'd ever come back, if he'd even remember her, or if she'd simply fade away like the fading light outside. As the silence deepened, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off. His usual spot at the end of the couch was now vacant, replaced by an unfamiliar silhouette. Had he really left, or was there something more sinister at play? She tried to push the thoughts aside, focusing on the present"

He casually mentioned how she'd left it in disarray before her passing, implying she was incompetent. The scientist felt his face flush with anger, imagining her spirit crushed by such an accusation. That night, he found himself sharpening his old hunting knife, a grim determination in his eyes.",

In this instance, the young scientist's ability to present at the lab meeting, coupled with his enthusiasm and apparent lack of experience, seemed to overshadow the gravity of the situation, making it appear as though I was unfairly holding him to a higher standard compared to more seasoned colleagues. This subtle yet profound shift in perspective has allowed me to reframe my actions, recognizing that my frustration arose from an unjust comparison rather than genuine concern for the well-being of our departed colleague."

I don't want to deal with this anymore. Shouldn't he have made up his mind by now? Shouldn't he know where he stands? What am I doing here? Why can't I just leave him alone? Why does everyone else get to move on so easily? They're all happy, while he's stuck in limbo, and I'm the one who has to put up with it. He knows exactly what he wants, but refuses to say anything because he's afraid of hurting me. He's scared of losing me. But what about when we were together? Was it all just a lie? Shouldn't he have told me sooner? Shouldn't he have been honest from the start? It feels like I'm drowning in my emotions, unable to breathe. I feel like I'm trapped between two worlds—my old life and the new one I'm trying to build. But which path will lead me to happiness? Why can't I stop thinking about him?

I try to talk to her about work stuff, but she quickly changes the subject whenever we meet. It feels like she doesn't even want to see me anymore. I'm probably the reason for this change. I don't deserve her kindness anyway. My past mistakes must have finally caught up with her. Maybe she thinks I'm too much trouble now. Every time I look at them laughing together, I think she's starting to forget what I did for her. She won't remember all the times I helped her out, will she? I could have been more patient, more understanding. I shouldn't have gotten angry when she asked for help. But she didn’t ask me for help because she already knew I’d help her. She thought I was one of those good cops, someone she could trust. Now she’s probably forgetting why she trusted me in the first place. And maybe she’ll start thinking I’m not worth trusting after all. It hurts to realize I might be the reason for her sudden coldness. Maybe I really am no longer one of her"
