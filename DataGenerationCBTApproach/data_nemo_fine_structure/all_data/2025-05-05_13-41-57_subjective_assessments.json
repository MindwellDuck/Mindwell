The fact that she doesn't invite me over anymore, especially after what happened with her daughter leaving for college, makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. It's like I'm losing her all over again, this time because of my own shortcomings. But then I think about how much I did for her when she was going through a tough time with her daughter. I remember being there for her, listening to her, making sure she knew I cared. And I realize, maybe we both have our own reasons for feeling this way. Maybe she’s just stressed out with school, and I’m overreacting. Maybe she needs space, and I need to give it to her, even if it hurts a little. Still, I can’t help but wonder if I’ve done anything to make things worse. Did I say something wrong? Was there something I didn’t notice? Or is it something deeper, something that has nothing to do with us, but with her own struggles? Maybe I am overthinking everything, trying too hard to understand why she’s pulling away. Maybe I need to let go of my expectations and just accept whatever happens. After all, she’s grown into an independent adult who no longer needs me in the same way. Maybe I’m just holding on too tightly, afraid to lose her as a friend. But"

As we sat down at a table by the window, I noticed that she didn’t seem very happy about meeting up. She kept looking around nervously and seemed to be checking her watch repeatedly. At first, I thought maybe she just wanted to leave early, but when she mentioned that she had an early train back home, I realized what might be going on. I started asking her questions about why she seemed so stressed out, and she finally opened up about how worried she is about her job. She said that she feels overwhelmed with the workload and worries about losing her position if things don’t improve soon. This news made me feel sad and frustrated, especially since I know how much effort she puts into her job. But then I remembered something important: she told me that she has a plan to switch jobs soon. She explained that she has been applying to several positions and hoping to get hired before the end of the year. Hearing this made me realize that I need to stop worrying about her situation and focus on the positive side of things."
