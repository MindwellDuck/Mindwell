He wasn't even looking up, lost in the pages of a newspaper, oblivious to the moment he'd missed. It didn't just disturb her; it enraged her. Every minute counted, and yet here he was, engrossed in some story about a doctor who'd changed lives, while she struggled to keep hers together. \"Why can't he understand?\" she thought, feeling the anger simmer inside her. \"Why does he get to sit there, reading something that has nothing to do with our life right now?\" But then she noticed something else - the way he leaned forward, his hands cradling the paper, and how his face seemed to light up with interest. For a brief moment, she saw a glimmer of joy in those lines that usually spoke of exhaustion and worry. It was a fleeting glimpse, but it was enough to make her pause. Yet, she refused to let it go. Instead, her mind began to weave a narrative that painted him in a different light - one that wasn't"
