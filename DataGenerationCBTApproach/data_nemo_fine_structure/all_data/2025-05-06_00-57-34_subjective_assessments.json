This is all because of you! You always ruin everything and now my whole life is fucked. You're so fucking selfish, you never think about anyone else except yourself. It makes me sick that people like you exist. You're disgusting, a total waste of space, and you'll never be loved or respected because you're such an idiot. Why doesn't she care? She probably has better things to do than to remember our anniversaries. That's what everyone says anyway - \"Oh, they're so busy.\" Busy being alone, busy having sex with other men. They never actually talk about actual work or hobbies or anything meaningful. No one cares about those things; they only care about sex. If she was really into me, she wouldn't forget our anniversary. But she forgot again, didn't she? So clearly, she isn't interested. Maybe she doesn't want me anymore, maybe she's found someone better. Or maybe she's just not thinking right now. Yeah, that must be it"

And honestly, I'm kinda mad at myself for being too exhausted, but still... It sucks. I wish I could've stayed longer, but I really needed some rest after all those hours in the kitchen. I guess it's good I got enough sleep, but oh man, if I were a little more rested, I would've loved to stay and catch up with him a bit longer. Still, I wouldn't want to be like me, feeling drained and overwhelmed. I wish I'd been able to give him more attention tonight. I feel bad for letting him down, especially since he's such an awesome boss. But anyway, back to me: I'm so done. I need a break, and I really hope tomorrow will be better. Tomorrow is going to be better, right? Tomorrow will be better. I wonder if there are other people who understand how hard it is to keep up with this job. Maybe we're not alone after all?"
