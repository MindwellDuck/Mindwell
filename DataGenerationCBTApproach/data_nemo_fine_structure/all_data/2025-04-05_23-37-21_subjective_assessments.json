She stares at the framed wedding photo on the mantel, their smiles now bittersweet memories of a time when hope was still abundant. Her eyes flicker to the stack of unopened letters from editors who've stopped returning her calls. The hopelessness settles heavier in her chest, like a weight she can't shake off. Another day without work, another night alone. She wonders if anyone will even notice if she turns off the light and doesn't get up tomorrow.",

Would anyone really care? Probably not. It might even be better that way. No more pain, no more emptiness. Just nothing. What if everyone thought she was dead, and they all moved on with their lives? Maybe she wouldn’t miss them so much then. But it’s too late for that. She has nothing but these thoughts now, swirling around her like a dark cloud. Every day is just another reminder that life keeps going, while hers remains stuck in limbo. I feel so lost sometimes, but I guess that’s what I signed up for when I chose this path. Still, it’s hard not to imagine what could’ve been if things had turned out differently. What if she’d made different choices back then? Would everything have worked out? Now she’s left with nothing but regret and loneliness. I wish people understood how hard it is to keep going some days. If only they knew... maybe they'd treat me better, or at least understand why I'm struggling so much right now. But deep down, I know that's impossible. They’ll always see me as weak, not someone they want to talk to. So I just sit here, staring at the same old wall, wondering what could've been if only I’d done things differently. Life goes on, but mine feels stuck in neutral"

You're making yourself crazy over nothing. It's just a picture, right? But noooo, my brain won't let me stop thinking about it. I keep going back to the same thoughts - \"Why didn't I reach out sooner?\" - and it's driving me insane. I'm starting to wonder if maybe things would've been better if I'd just ignored everything and kept moving forward. Like, who knows what would've happened if I hadn't acted like a fool by holding onto all those feelings for so long? And yeah, okay, maybe I am being too harsh. Maybe I need to chill out. But come on! This is hard enough already, and I'm not exactly in the best place mentally right now. So why do these stupid memories always seem to pop up when I least expect them? Does anyone else ever get like this? Why does it take so long for me to move on from stuff like this? Is it really just because I'm a stubborn idiot, refusing to let go?

I think people are talking behind my back because they’re bored with my stories. It makes sense that they would ignore me, since I don’t have much to offer. They must think I’m annoying or something. I try not to let it bother me, but sometimes I get really upset when I hear things like this. It’s hard not to take it personally. It’s so strange that everyone seems to forget about me once I leave the office. They must think I’m not important or interesting anymore. That makes sense, though - I’ve never done anything impressive here. I guess I deserve to feel left out. I wish I could tell them that I know what they’re thinking, but I wouldn’t want to make things awkward. Maybe I’ll just pretend I didn’t hear it and move on. It’s better that way anyway. I shouldn’t take it seriously; I’m probably overreacting. But still, it’s frustrating to realize nobody cares about me anymore. I wonder why she has to act like she doesn’t know me at all.

Sometimes I get these thoughts, like \"What if I had done X?\" And then I start thinking about all the times I didn't do things, all the chances I let slip away. It's hard to stop those thoughts from spiraling, especially when it comes to things like awards or recognition. They make me realize how far behind I am, even though I know intellectually that everyone has their own path, still...it's hard not to compare myself to others. It's funny how sometimes I'll see someone else doing well and suddenly feel like I've been forgotten. Like they're living proof of all the things I could've done differently. I don't know why I keep letting those feelings get inside my head, but I guess it's because deep down I want more for myself, even if I don't fully understand why.

The distortion is in her belief that fortune telling predicts bad things to happen to someone, rather than just predicting that something bad will happen to them based upon a circumstance. This distortion often leads people to act in ways that they perceive as unfortunate (e.g., trying to change circumstances before they occur), when really they would be better off accepting the circumstance and acting accordingly. # Reference https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cognitive-distortions/2017/12/fortune-telling-what-it-really-means-and-how-you-can-beat-it ## Additional information The original post was intended to be"

She could easily become a single mom with all these assets - her family will help her out financially and emotionally, whereas I'm stuck here, alone and struggling to build anything new. This isn't about jealousy; it's more about feeling left out because everyone around me seems to have moved forward in life, while I'm still trying to figure things out. Even though I'm grateful for what I have, I can't shake off the feeling that I'm missing out on something special. What if I had the same level of success as her?
