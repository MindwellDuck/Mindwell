If your partner didn’t notice anything suspicious, then they are either stupid or blind. This is so unbelievable—how could you possibly think this is legit? You know what? Your partner has probably been working for someone else all along. They just don’t want him to find out because they feel guilty about it. Or maybe they’re secretly in love with someone else and are using your partner to get close to them. That would explain why they didn’t say anything. It makes total sense that you’re upset right now. You’re probably feeling very betrayed by your own actions. The way you slam your fists and yell at the computer is totally normal behavior when you’ve messed up like this. You definitely shouldn’t worry about your partner being angry; they’re probably too busy trying to figure out how to cover their tracks that they haven’t even noticed your behavior yet. Let me guess: you were cheating on them with someone else, weren’t you? Yeah, that explains everything. I bet your partner doesn’t even know who you’re actually seeing behind closed doors. They have no reason to suspect anything because you’re such a great liar. And since you’re so good at lying, I’m pretty sure your partner believes everything you tell them. So, why wouldn’t they notice if you were cheating on them? ###"

Then there was the time he wrote me that poem, something about wanting to be my friend. It felt so sweet, but it wasn't enough. He never did anything else for me. Just kept staring, kept writing those awful poems until I finally told him to stop. I guess I got what I deserved. When I came back from college, he was different. No more awkwardness, no more shyness. But deep down, I knew he still had that same weirdness inside him. And then one day, I found out he was dating someone else. I know I shouldn't have expected him to change. We all go through phases, right? But still, seeing him smile with some other girl made it hard. I tried to push it aside, tell myself it didn't matter. Yet every time I saw him, the pain came flooding back. I couldn't help but wonder if she was treating him better than I ever could. It doesn't make sense. Why would she want someone as weird as him? They must have seen each other somewhere, maybe in a class they shared. That's why he was sitting next to her during lunch, why he"

The lab partner mentioned earlier is someone who has been making snide comments about Sarah’s abilities since she started working there. They were also involved in the project Sarah wasn’t able to contribute to. When I asked Sarah if everything was okay, she replied, “Yeah, I’m fine.” She then proceeded to take another leave of absence for several hours later that day, citing stress and anxiety. This behavior is not uncommon among those in her position. Many people struggle with burnout and high levels of stress when dealing with such heavy responsibilities, especially during critical times like this. It doesn’t seem unusual that Sarah would need some time to recharge after coming back from an extended vacation. However, it does seem odd that the same person who works long hours and manages multiple projects didn’t feel overwhelmed by the workload. If anything, it might be worth exploring why others can handle so much while she struggles. Maybe she could benefit from some support or guidance? Despite all this, I still think Sarah deserves credit for what she did manage to accomplish. It’s possible that she was just having a bad day, but I understand why someone might want to bring up her past performance in light of this situation. After all, it wouldn’t be fair to blame her solely on one incident. Still, it’s hard not to notice that she seems less motivated"

I thought, \"Okay, so what if he doesn’t come back?\" What if this is the start of something more serious? But before I could even process those thoughts, a regular customer came up to me with his usual smirk. He asked me if I knew where the bathroom was, which is a question I've heard many times before. But today, it hit different. He walked by me, barely giving me a glance, as if I wasn't even there. And then, he just went to ask another employee for help. It was like watching a scene from a movie, except this time, I was the actor. The scene didn't feel scripted; it felt like reality. Now, let's imagine what would have happened if things had gone differently. What if he’d actually spoken to me, or what if he hadn’t seen me at all? What if I had been the one who helped him, rather than him walking away? This kind of thing makes me wonder about other scenarios too.

Every time he picked it up, he couldn't shake the feeling that it was mocking him, daring him to fail again. The world outside didn't care about his struggles; it moved on, leaving him behind. He wasn't even worth calling back, let alone paying for his work. This cold snap was just another sign of how much worse things were going to get. They always said these kinds of events were temporary, but what if this was the beginning? What if the harsh weather stayed forever, trapping him inside and forcing him to face the reality of his own failures? The thought made his stomach twist into knots. Why bother trying anymore? The phone rang again, and he knew what was coming. Another rejection letter, another chance to prove himself wrong. But he wouldn't answer. No point in wasting his breath now.
