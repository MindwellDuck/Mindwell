I swear, every time we talk about our plans or future, she starts asking these questions. They’re always negative, full of hypotheticals—“What if you don’t make it back?” or “What if the bills pile up again?” Ugh, why can’t she see things clearly? Doesn’t she understand that I’m trying to focus on the present? It’s so frustrating. We’ve been through so much already; life has thrown us more than we ever could have imagined. But does she remember all those good moments we shared? All the laughter and smiles we had together? Of course, she doesn’t. Because she’s too busy worrying about what might go wrong. It’s exhausting. Why can’t she just leave me alone? I know she thinks she’s helping, but honestly, it feels like she’s just making everything worse. Every time she asks one of those questions, I feel like I’m drowning in them. It’s like she wants me to drown in them. Maybe if she stopped asking, I wouldn’t feel so trapped.

The way he looked at her, with a mix of pity and disdain, made my anger boil over. He thinks he can just take away everything from her, including her identity, and get away with it? No, this isn’t going to end well. He's been doing this for so long, pretending to be a loving husband while secretly manipulating her. When I look into his eyes, I see a cold calculation, a man who has mastered the art of deception. His words are laced with venom, designed to cut deep, and he knows exactly how to hit all the right buttons to keep her in line. But I won’t let him get away with it anymore. My mind is racing with thoughts of revenge, each one fueled by my desire to break free from his grasp. I can feel the fire burning within me, urging me to act, to take back what he’s stolen from us – our life together, our happiness, our very selves.

She deserves better than someone who wouldn't even bother bringing her lunch. This isn't the first time he's done this either. He knows exactly what she wants. He probably doesn't care enough to actually go through the trouble of getting it right. And if she tried asking him again, he'd just say she's being too sensitive and that she needs to \"toughen up.\" She already knows he doesn't respect her. She doesn't deserve any love from someone as uncaring as him. She'll never find anyone else because everyone will treat her the same way. She might as well stay single forever.

My hands were shaking so hard they almost dropped the gun I kept hidden in my jacket pocket. I didn’t know how to react; part of me wanted to rush in, ready to face whatever was happening, while another part screamed to turn around and run away. It was like my brain was torn between two extremes: either everything was okay, or it was about to go off the rails. As I looked through the peephole, I saw movement, but it was too dark to make out clearly. I didn’t want to wait around for it to get better light, but I couldn’t leave until I knew what was going on. I thought about calling the cops, but then I remembered the last time I did that, it turned out to be a false alarm. Maybe I should have just stayed quiet and hoped for the best?

It wasn't just about getting it right; it was about understanding herself better - or at least trying to understand why such small mistakes could cause such big frustration.
