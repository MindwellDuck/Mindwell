I keep thinking about her, wondering if she’s even looking at me anymore. Does anyone else feel this way? Like, what am I supposed to do? Just sit around and wait for something that never happened? It’s not fair. Why would she leave like this? Doesn’t she remember how we used to be? We were perfect. Now look at us – broken. All I have is this stupid mug. It’s almost pathetic how much it means to me. Maybe I’m just too stupid to realize that everyone moves on. But why does it hurt so much? And then there’s the thing I left behind—our little apartment. Who would want that place anyway? It was never meant for two people; it was always just a temporary home. So, yeah, maybe she made the right decision, but it doesn’t make me feel better.
