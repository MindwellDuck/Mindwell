Orders piled up like unpaid invoices, and no matter how fast he worked, the tickets kept coming. He felt his girlfriend's eyes on him through the pass, her usual warm smile replaced by a furrowed brow of concern. But there was no time to comfort her or himself; tonight, it seemed, even the ovens were conspiring against him, smoking and spitting like angry dragons. As he reached for yet another ticket, his arm brushed against the hot plate, searing his skin. He yanked his hand back, but the pain was nothing compared to the helplessness that surged through him as he watched his carefully crafted mise en place crumble into disorder.",

It wasn't until someone mentioned that he was crying that I realized what was happening.

When I asked if he needed help with anything else, he told me that he already had enough people working with him. I tried to reassure him that we'd get through this together, but he just shook my head and said he didn't need any more stress right now."

The doctors said he had a minor heart attack but no other serious issues. It was just a stress-related issue, something that could have happened anytime. When they got home, she was still shaken by the experience and decided to take some time off work to care for him. She didn’t realize how much time it would consume, especially since she’s been dealing with the aftermath of his father’s passing recently. After all, he needed her now more than ever, and she wouldn’t let anything get in the way. He couldn’t handle everything alone, not after what he’d been through. His dad had died suddenly, leaving them both reeling. But this wasn’t the first time her boyfriend had fainted—just last month, he’d collapsed in front of her, too. The doctors had said it was just a panic attack, nothing to worry about. Still, she felt guilty for not being there when he needed her most. They were supposed to go out together the next weekend, but instead, she stayed home to cook dinner and make sure he was comfortable. Maybe if I hadn’t left him alone for so long, maybe things wouldn’t have turned out like this. He’s back home now, resting, and everything feels normal again. But she can’t shake the memory of that moment, the fear gripping her tightly."

But deep down, I know he doesn't really care. He's just being polite, pretending to listen so I don't get too lonely. When I see him smile, I know he's thinking of something else entirely. Those fake smiles are just a way to make me happy while he secretly plots against me. He's probably planning to leave me right now, to go back to his ex who loves him more than she loves me. Or maybe he's just waiting for me to forget about him and move on with my life. It's so easy to imagine what he's really thinking - how he hates me for leaving him behind. How he wishes I'd never left. How he wants me to come back and start over again. But then why does he keep sending me these little gifts? Maybe he's just trying to guilt trip me into coming back. That's all this means - guilt trips. He's manipulating me to stay with him because he can't handle living without me. But then why does he argue with me so much? Is he trying to provoke me into staying? Does he want me to hate him so"

It’s such a shame because they were meant to be together. They should have stayed married instead of letting things fall apart. But what really gets me is that she thinks she’s right. She knows nothing about my parents’ relationship and still insists on judging them. It’s infuriating to see her try to manipulate everyone into feeling sorry for her. She doesn’t even care about what we think! And don’t even get me started on how she’s trying to turn my mom against him. My dad already has enough stress from work; I don’t want my mom to add more pressure. But she won’t listen to reason, just like she didn’t listen during the divorce. Now she’s using guilt trips to get under my mom’s skin. It’s so frustrating to watch her ruin every situation. She’s never been a good influence, especially with our family.

I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her, but whenever I stand up for myself or my family, she turns it into something personal. It’s exhausting dealing"

Now he's standing by his car, wondering why he wasted his Saturday painting other people's houses instead of hers. Every time he sees another house with fresh paint job, he feels like he could've done better. His mind keeps replaying their conversation where she said she'd pay him back once she finished fixing her own house. The memory of her laughing at his silly joke makes him want to cry because he knows he'll never hear that laugh again. His phone is dead, and he doesn't even care anymore.

I bet he was miserable at work, stuck in some boring office job, feeling trapped. Who wouldn’t want to leave that? It sounds like he was just burning out from all those hours spent staring at screens. And honestly, I’m still mad about how he treated me when we were married. I remember how he’d always say things like, “You need to lighten up,” or “Stop being so dramatic.” Like, who does that? I was just trying to keep things together, but he didn’t care.
