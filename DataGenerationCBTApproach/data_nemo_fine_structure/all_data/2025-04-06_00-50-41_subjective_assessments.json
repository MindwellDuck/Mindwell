He slumped forward, elbows on knees, staring blankly at the screen, as if searching for answers in the pixels themselves. His eyes felt tired, his brain foggy, like trying to read through a thick mist. The room around him seemed distant, a blur of noise, a constant reminder that he wasn’t alone in his struggle. But then, something shifted. The space between his breaths grew shorter, his focus sharpened. He stood up, eyes locked on the screen, and began to type again, fueled by determination rather than desperation. The words flowed more smoothly now, and the lines of code began to take shape. This time, when the cursor blinked, he didn’t hesitate. With every keystroke, he felt a sense of control wash over him, as if he were guiding his own destiny, one line of code at a time. The hours melted away, and he worked through the night, driven by a newfound sense of purpose. When the sun rose, casting its golden light through the windows, he stepped back, exhausted but trium"

They have no idea what it’s like to feel pain and worry every day. How can anyone expect us to be joyful when we have nothing to be grateful for? My heart breaks thinking about all the things that could go wrong for them, especially given their youth. If they were older, maybe they wouldn't be so carefree. But no, they have to be young, stupid, and naive. I bet if they knew the truth, they'd change their behavior. Maybe they'll realize soon enough. In the meantime, they shouldn't get too comfortable; life can turn on a dime. It’s just not fair… I wonder if they even understand the gravity of the situation.

It wasn't until she saw the note on the counter that the full extent of her devastation hit her. The simple words—“I’ve moved out” —had become a death sentence, one that left her breathless and numb. A part of her wanted to scream at him, to lash out against the pain he'd caused, but another part of her knew that such outbursts would only lead to more suffering. Instead, she stood there, frozen, her mind racing with thoughts of how she could make things right again. But the more she thought, the more tangled her emotions became, until finally, she collapsed onto the couch, overwhelmed by the weight of her own sorrow. In that moment, time lost all meaning. Hours blended together into an endless blur, each passing second feeling like an eternity. Yet, despite the passage of time, nothing changed.

He always has to prioritize work over family, which makes me wonder if he really cares about our relationship. It's ridiculous to think he'd spend more time thinking about us than his job. Maybe he genuinely doesn't want to talk anymore, but shouldn't he have tried harder to maintain some semblance of communication? That's what friends are supposed to do, after all. But no, instead, he chose to ignore me, leaving me to feel even more isolated and alone. It's just another example of how he never puts anyone else before himself. Even though we're related, he clearly doesn't consider our bond as strong as he once did. His actions speak louder than words, and it's evident that he prefers solitude to sharing his life with others.
