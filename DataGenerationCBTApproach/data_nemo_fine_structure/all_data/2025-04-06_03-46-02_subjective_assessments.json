Why are you still sleeping?\"** My wife looked up from her pillow, rubbing her eyes, and murmured, \"Just five more minutes.\" She was already late for our shift at the newsroom. **She should have been awake by now**, I thought bitterly. If she had just woken up a little sooner, we could have left together. As I got dressed, I couldn't help but think that she was being selfish. We needed every bit of time we could get to prepare for tonight's live broadcast. But no, she insisted on going back to sleep. It seemed like she didn't care about anything except herself. The frustration grew inside me, and I felt tears welling up in my eyes. How could she be so oblivious? I grabbed my bag and rushed out the door, trying to shake off the annoyance. As I drove to the newsroom, I couldn't stop thinking about how much I hated this situation. My wife always wants to work late; she never listens when I tell her we need to leave early. It feels like she doesn't respect my schedule or my needs at all. And it's not just this one incident. This is happening over and over again. Every morning, I'm tired because she stayed up too late. Every night, I'm exhausted because she worked long hours instead of helping us at home"

As she gently pulled the drawer open, she found nothing amiss - just the usual clutter of pens, paperclips, and old photographs. But something was different. One photograph, a faded snapshot of them at their wedding, was facedown. She couldn't remember if it had been like that before. A chill ran down her spine as paranoia began to creep in, whispering doubts into her ear.",

Her brain felt like a jumbled mess, with thoughts racing wildly. It wasn’t just about the job; everything seemed to be piling up, making her wonder how she could possibly handle it all. At times, she felt like she was just going through the motions, pretending to be a functioning adult while secretly spiraling into chaos. She didn’t know how much longer she could keep it together."

We need to get the dishes done before we even start cooking. But I'm already feeling overwhelmed because she's such a failure at even simple things. It’s like she has no idea how to cook anything right. And today? Forget about it. I bet if she had tried, she’d have burned it too. Why bother trying when you know you’re going to fail? As she walks back from the garden, covered in dirt, I can see the anger in her eyes. She’s still fuming over that one wrong move. I can tell she’s just waiting for something else to go wrong so she can blame it on me again. It feels like she’s constantly waiting for the next disaster to strike. This isn’t just about dinner anymore; it’s about our whole relationship. Every time she fails, it makes me question whether I’m really ready for this. Maybe I should just leave while there’s still time. If I don’t, I’ll end up losing everything. At least if I walk out, I won’t have to deal with all this chaos.

The way they move together seamlessly, their body language radiating affection, is almost palpable. Her mind starts to wander, replaying memories of her own past relationships, where such closeness once warmed her heart. Now, however, those moments seem distant, even fading into memory like sandcastles threatened by the tide. As she stands there, lost in thought, her gaze drifts back to the present, focusing on the woman's hair—a rich, dark silver that contrasts strikingly against her pale skin. It's a look she's grown accustomed to over the years, yet today it feels different, perhaps because of the contrast it presents alongside the younger woman's vibrant beauty. In the silence, she becomes aware of her own thoughts, which are laced with a subtle bitterness. This realization comes too late, for her emotions have already begun to curdle, as if they've been left out in the open, exposed to the chill of the outside world. A slight shiver runs down her spine as she takes in the scene before her, but it's not just the cool evening air that causes it—rather, it's the realization that she's standing here alone again, while others share experiences she can only imagine. The image of the couple's warm fingers intertwined has taken root in her mind, stirring feelings of isolation that feel both unexpected and deeply familiar."

But how could he explain that every word she wrote felt like a knife twisting in his gut? His story - the one he'd been chasing for months, the one that was supposed to make his career - had crumbled yesterday. The sources had dried up, the leads gone cold. All his work, all his hope, had amounted to nothing. And now, faced with her eager messages and the void of his own failure, he felt only a deep, hollow despair.",

Every time he thinks about responding, he tells himself that she should respect his boundaries. She shouldn't keep pushing when he's clearly overwhelmed. Yet, the more I try to convince myself of this, the more I realize that my expectations aren't aligning with reality. My story isn't the only thing that matters here. Her needs and feelings matter too. It's selfish to expect her to wait while he gets his act together. How can I reconcile these conflicting thoughts?

He could see why her friend suggested continuing her legacy - it would honor her memory. He didn't think about how much it hurt him, but he knew she'd want him to move forward with her ideas. It wasn't just about sadness; it was also about pride. He knew how hard she worked, and he admired that. He wanted to tell her how proud he was, even though she was gone.

This is the life he chose for himself, full of broken promises and empty bottles. He never had the courage to leave, even though he knew things would get worse. Now she's here again, trying to protect him from himself, but what does it really matter? Nothing ever changes. This isn't a family anymore; it's just two people trapped in their pain. Her mind races as she watches them, her heart heavy with every step. Why doesn't she see it? Why can't she stop herself? She's always tried to help, but it only makes things worse. If only she could turn back time, erase the mistakes of the past, but that's impossible now. All she can do is watch, powerless against the tide of his demons. He's always been a loner, but now he's lost everything. His friends don't want anything to do with him, and his family has given up.

But as he delved deeper, he realized that these divisions weren’t just abstract concepts; they manifested in the lives of those around him. His colleague, once full of laughter and warmth, now moved through her days with a quiet sadness, as if she too felt trapped by the weight of her own unhappiness. His wife, once radiant with joy, now walked with a subtle slowness, her eyes clouded by the fog of despair. And then there was the stranger, who sat alone at the café, lost in thoughts of his past.

Yet, even in the midst of such devastation, he found a strange sense of peace, as if the emptiness itself had become a source of comfort.
