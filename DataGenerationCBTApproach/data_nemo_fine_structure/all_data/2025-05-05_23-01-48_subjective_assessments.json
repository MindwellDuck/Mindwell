She’s probably moved on by now. But still, it makes me wonder. What if she’s still thinking about me? What if she misses me as much as I miss her? It doesn’t make sense. We’re done. But I can’t shake this feeling that maybe someday I’ll regret leaving her. Maybe I’ll realize I made a mistake and want to go back.

To have someone reduce those feelings to a joke was infuriating. He didn't know what was more disturbing—the fact that people continued to share photos like this or that they even found humor in it. Every time he saw another one, it felt like a slap in the face, making him question if he really wanted to stay here. But then again, maybe he needed to prove to himself that he could move forward, that he wasn't letting his grief control him. Maybe this was the push he needed to finally put his life back together. Either way, he knew he wouldn't be able to ignore these photos forever. He decided to confront the person who posted the first image, hoping they’d understand why this was so painful for him.
