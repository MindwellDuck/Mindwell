The critic just walked out of my studio, but it's hard for me to shake off the feeling that I messed up. I remember how I felt when they looked at my painting - disappointed, maybe even hurt. But then again, I know that this is all part of the process, that every artist has been there. Still, I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering what could've gone wrong. But what if I didn't really understand what they were saying? Maybe it wasn’t about my painting after all; maybe it was something else entirely. And why did I focus so much on that one comment? Is it because I’m afraid of being criticized, or am I just trying to convince myself that I can handle it? Either way, I can't help but think back to the times when others have dismissed my work, and how I handled them. If I had reacted differently, would things be different now? Or maybe I'm just overthinking everything. What if I let go of all these thoughts and focused on creating instead? Would I forget about the critic’s harsh words? But what if I need to hear that kind of feedback to grow as an artist? It’s tough to balance the desire to create with the fear of criticism, especially when it comes from someone who doesn’t know me personally. I guess that’s what makes it so difficult – I want to prove myself,"

She told him she'd help with the bill, but he wouldn't let her. \"It's ridiculous,\" he shouted, \"Why can't it be free?\" He stormed around the room, muttering under his breath. ## Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Identify the distorted thinking pattern**: The individual believes that certain situations, such as having to pay a fee, should always be handled in a specific way (free), rather than how they actually happen. 2. **Understand the root cause**: This anger stems from feelings of frustration and injustice about being forced to spend money, which triggers an impulsive reaction. 3. **Recognize the cognitive distortion**: By labeling this behavior as a \"cognitive distortion\" called \"Should Statements,\" we're acknowledging its presence without directly pointing out its impact on decision-making. 4. **Practice self-awareness**: The next time you experience similar situations, take a step back and notice if you’re making assumptions about what should happen versus what does happen. 5. **Cultivate empathy**: Put yourself in others' shoes and understand that their perspectives might differ from yours. This can help soften your reactions and lead to more constructive outcomes. 6"

I've always been respectful and considerate, but does that mean nothing to her? I guess now I'll have to be more careful about how I interact with her at the hospital.
