The weight of it in her hand felt like a stone, each line of its cracked glaze a whisper of what she'd lost. She'd meant to donate or throw out his things, but she hadn't been able to bring herself to do it until now. As she held the mug, guilt surged through her; why had she waited so long? Why hadn't she done this sooner, before the memories had become ghosts haunting every corner of their home?",

Instead, she left everything to me, and I'm stuck dealing with all these reminders. It's like she wanted me to be reminded of him constantly. I don't know how someone can be so careless, especially after losing someone they love. But then again, maybe that’s exactly what she is – careless. I remember how he always joked about her being scatterbrained, and now it makes sense. She probably didn’t even think twice about leaving his belongings scattered everywhere. What really gets under my skin is how she acts like we're friends now because I inherited his stuff. She keeps saying things like “Oh, you’re part of the family too” or “We’re going to make new memories together.” Does she really believe that? It feels so fake. And those mugs? They just sit there, collecting dust, as if waiting for her to pick them up again. It’s almost like she wants us to feel his presence around us. But honestly, it just feels like another way for her to cling to the past. I mean, come on, stop pretending like nothing changed between us. It’s frustrating, because deep down, I want to tell her to get over it. That we need to move forward, not dwell on the past. But whenever I try, she just brushes it"

It’s like he thinks we’re friends again, like everything was fine between us. Newsflash, asshole: it’s not. What did I ever do to you? Why are you smiling like we used to be besties?! And those kids? They don’t know anything about how hard I’ve been fighting, how much pain I’ve endured because of him. Do they know what it feels like to have your whole world turned upside down by one man? No, they don’t. And he makes it look so effortless, like he never hurt anyone. I bet his precious little family knows exactly what he did to me, and they probably love him for it. They must think he’s perfect, a hero who saved everyone from his own demons. But I know the truth. He’s a monster, and now he gets to live happily ever after with his new family, while I’m stuck here, alone, and broken. This isn’t just about him; it"

She'll just end up disappointing herself again, like she did with every art piece, every project, every decision. She can't keep lying to people; they're starting to notice. They see how broken she is, how fragile, and how tired of pretending to be strong. Maybe this time, she'll finally admit it—the truth about who she really is—a failure, a disappointment, a shell of what could have been. But no, she'll keep going through the motions, hoping that somehow, someway, she might become something real, something beautiful, something worth living for. Yet, deep down, we all know she'll just give up eventually, another victim of the cruel world, leaving behind another broken dream. Oh, the irony. She used to tell me to chase my dreams, to never give up, but I guess I'm just too stupid to realize that nothing ever changes, and everyone will always disappoint you. So, let's just sit back, enjoy the show, and watch her crumble further into despair, knowing that someday soon, she'll be nothing but a memory, lost in the sands of time, a footnote in the history books of forgotten"

Why did he have to be the one who ended up here, alone? He thought about his parents, how they were always there for each other when he needed them. They never fought; they were happy. His own life felt so different, filled with stress and loneliness. Even his best friend seemed to have moved on, no longer inviting him to join them for dinner or weekend getaways. It wasn't just the photo that got under his skin—it was everything else too. Every memory reminded him of what he lacked, of all the moments he could've shared if things were different. He wondered if anyone would ever notice him, or if he'd always be invisible, like the forgotten items stacked behind the counter. The sadness swelled inside him, threatening to spill out into the empty store. But he pushed it back, telling himself he didn't want to break down now.
