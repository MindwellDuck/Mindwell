She thought back to all the times she'd been belittled by others, how she'd always been treated like an outcast. This just proved what she already knew: people who look down on you will never treat you right. They think they can get away with anything. But this time, she wouldn't let them. She would fight back, show them all that she wasn’t afraid. No one would ever make her feel small again."

It was supposed to be a quiet night in. She had plans to meet up with her coworker later, but that didn't seem important right now. What's more pressing is how she spent the evening before coming home, laughing with someone else who obviously has more interest in her than he does. She doesn't even bother to hide it. She's always talking about these people, sharing stories and jokes as if they're close friends. And why wouldn't she? They all seem to get along so well, while he's stuck in his own world, trying to make sense of things. At least I'm not the one who has to deal with her constant need for social validation. She's always out there, getting attention from everyone around her. It makes me wonder if anyone would even notice if she suddenly disappeared. If only she were here, we could talk about what happened earlier. Maybe then we'd understand each other better. But no, she's too busy having fun with her coworkers. They probably think they know her better than I do. Why do I always end up being left behind? Every time we try to reconnect, it's like I'm an afterthought. Even when she"

The way they glanced at her multiple times made it seem like they were *trying to humiliate me.* It wasn't just one look; it was a pattern of disdain that made her *feel so worthless.* In the back of her mind, she thought about how the other customers seemed put together, dressed professionally, while she looked like a slob.

I don’t understand why they did it. If I were younger, maybe I’d get in, but now? No way. This is all because of their decision. I’m still trying to process everything. It feels like there must be some reason behind it, but I guess I’ll never find out. Maybe if I could figure out what went wrong, I could somehow change their minds, but I doubt that. They’ve already made up their mind, and I can’t blame them for sticking with it. But I still feel so angry and hurt. Why does this keep happening to me? I try so hard to fit in, and it always backfires. I wish things were different, but I suppose it’s not meant to be. Oh well, I guess I’ll just have to accept it.
