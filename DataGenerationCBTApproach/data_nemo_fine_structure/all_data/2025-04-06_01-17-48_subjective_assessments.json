He was always a big fan of his favorite armchair with its worn cushions, but if it's gone, then maybe he decided he just couldn't take this life anymore. Maybe someone took him while I wasn't looking, and I'll never see him again. If only I had read the signs earlier, I would have avoided this heartbreak. Now he's probably running away from me, leaving me here to suffer with this illness that eats away at our lives. It must've been too much for him to bear; I wish I had known sooner to help him before he slipped away."

Her footsteps echo in the silence, each one a hollow reminder that today is different. No lively chatter from colleagues, no hum of shared purpose. Just emptiness and the weight of sorrow she's been carrying since the funeral yesterday. She pauses at the whiteboard, tracing her fingers over the equations they'd worked on together, his handwriting now faded like his smile in her memories. A lone lab mouse scampers across the floor, its tiny heart beating loudly in the quiet, a stark contrast to the stillness of his empty chair.",

The air is thick with the scent of disinfectant, but it does little to mask the ache in her chest. Every step into this room feels like a betrayal, as if I'm intruding on a private moment he never got to share with me. The lab coat hanging on the back of his chair looks almost mocking, a cruel reminder that we'll never get to experience life side by side again. His workspace, once a hub of collaboration and laughter, now holds nothing but echoes of what could have been. Every time I walk through these doors, I feel like an outsider. It’s as if I’m walking into a museum where all the exhibits are reminders of our relationship. The microscope, the pipettes, the microscope slides—each one a poignant reminder of what I’ve lost. Even the lab mice seem out of place, their gentle chirping a jarring contrast to the silence that fills every other corner of the room. But I know I shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t be feeling this way. I should be grateful for the chance to honor his memory, to keep working alongside his colleagues. They’re the ones who will carry on his legacy, not me. Yet, every time I look around, I see only shadows of what we had. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just pretending to care, that I’ll eventually lose interest and leave him behind. Maybe it"

Does she really think he cares enough to notice her, to remember her name, to even consider reaching out? How can she not realize that she's just another forgotten acquaintance to him? It’s almost as if she thinks she knows exactly what he’s thinking—how he secretly admires her intelligence, her determination, and maybe even her fierce independence. That he might be longing for someone who truly understands him, someone who could appreciate all his accomplishments. But no, he wouldn’t dare show such feelings openly because he’s far too confident in himself. After all, he has his group of friends to keep him company, people who share his interests and values, making them the perfect cover for his true feelings. It’s almost cruel, isn’t it? To imagine that she thinks he secretly envies her success, her ability to speak truth to power, and her unwavering dedication to justice. He probably wishes he had someone like her by his side, someone who shares his passion and commitment to creating positive change in their community. Maybe he dreams of having an affair with her, but he wouldn’t dare, not when he has his friends to lean on. No, he would never risk losing his reputation or jeopardizing his"

He was visibly moved when I suggested we stop at the herb stand, despite my initial excitement about the prospect of using fresh thyme in our cooking. When I offered to help with the purchase, he seemed hesitant, almost as if he wasn't sure what to expect. I couldn't quite pinpoint why, but I sensed a lingering sense of sadness, one that had probably been building since her passing. It's possible I'm reading too much into this, but it felt like he was trying to hold onto something that might be lost forever—a connection to his family through the simple act of buying herbs. As we walked away from the market, I noticed him glancing around, taking in the sights and sounds of the festival. He appeared to be savoring each moment, though I couldn't say why. Perhaps he was simply enjoying the atmosphere, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to it than meets the eye. Maybe he was holding onto hope that somehow, someway, things would return to normal, even though I know that’s unlikely. It’s hard not to feel sorry for him, especially given how much he misses his mother-in-law. She was an integral part of their life together, and I can only imagine how difficult it must be for him to adjust to a new dynamic. Still, I wish he wouldn’t jump to conclusions about everything;"

How can someone else get to travel so freely, eating food they've never tried before? Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the same old routine every day. It's hard not to feel like I'm stuck in some kind of rut. Every time I see these images, I feel like I'm being pulled into a different reality—one where excitement and adventure aren't just distant memories but everyday experiences. Even when I try to remind myself that these are just stories, I still can't shake off the feeling that I’m somehow behind. It’s like watching a movie you wish you were part of, but you’re left in the audience forever. Sometimes, I imagine what it would be like to join him on one of those trips, to taste the flavors he describes and explore new places alongside him. But it's all just fantasy now, a reminder of what I don’t have rather than what I could achieve. In this moment, it feels like I’m losing touch with reality.

He thinks he can just walk into my life again and expect everything to be okay, but he has no right to act like nothing changed after she died. We were together for 10 years, and he knows exactly what happened to us. But does he really think I'd forget? They're probably just trying to get me back by telling him I still love him. Like, are they kidding me? Of course, I love him, but it doesn't mean I want to see him again. And even if I did, which I don't, he would just ruin everything. I don't know why he insists on keeping that stupid photo around - is he trying to torture himself? Or maybe he wants to make me feel worse by seeing it. Whatever the reason, I'll never forgive him for ruining my life. Why the fuck didn't he keep the photo safe instead of leaving it in plain sight? Now everyone"
