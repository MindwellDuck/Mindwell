The familiar scent of aged paper and dust filled her nostrils as she stepped into the dim light. There, amidst the yellowed photographs and decaying books, lay her late husband's microscope, untouched since his passing a year ago. A lone speck of dust danced in the beam of sunlight, catching her eye before settling gently onto the lens. She reached out to touch it, but paused, her fingers trembling. Instead, she clutched her chest, feeling the sorrow well up within her like an incoming tide.",

But then she realized that she had forgotten to pack his lunch for the first day, and he would be eating alone at work. She remembered how excited he was when he received the call from the university offering him a scholarship, and how much joy he took in sharing the news with her. However, she recalled that he had also spent hours preparing for the interview, worrying about whether he could afford the expensive glasses he needed for the test. She remembered how proud she was when he graduated from college, and how thrilled she was when he landed a promotion at work. But she couldn't shake off the thought that he would have gotten there sooner if he hadn't wasted so much time taking care of his elderly mother, who died shortly after her own father passed away. She remembered how happy she was when he came home early from work one evening, exhausted but exhilarated by his success in landing a major client. But then she remembered that he had spent months agonizing over every detail of the project, pouring over reports and presentations until he was satisfied that everything was perfect. She remembered how sad she was when he broke up with his girlfriend, telling her that he wasn't ready for a relationship. But she forgot to mention that he had also spent months questioning his decision, weighing the pros and cons, and wondering if he was making the right"

But the truth is, I know why she didn't want to stay. It wasn't because of me; it was because she couldn't handle the pressure of being perfect, and I couldn't handle losing her. We both knew that our love would never last, but somehow, I thought we could make it work, that we could find a way to be happy together. Now, all I have is this stupid painting, a reminder of everything we said we wouldn't do. She was always supposed to be the calm one, but she's gone, and I'm left to deal with the fallout alone. I feel like a failure, like I should've been stronger, like I should've been there to protect her instead of watching her slip away. The truth is, I knew things were falling apart before she did, but I kept telling myself that we should’ve worked harder, that we should’ve made more of an effort.
