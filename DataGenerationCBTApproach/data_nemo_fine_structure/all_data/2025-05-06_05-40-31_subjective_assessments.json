When I started putting down my bags, I knocked over that stupid mug, and he freaked out about the mess. He didn’t even say thanks for coming home. Just another example of how much effort I have to put into everything around here, and it’s all because he can’t be bothered to pay attention. It’s exhausting being the one who has to manage everything—my job, our social life, cooking, cleaning, and now even getting him off his butt to acknowledge my presence. It feels like nothing ever goes right for me, and it’s so frustrating. Every single day is just an endless cycle of stress and disappointment, and I’m tired of it all."

When they asked me if I'd be okay with him staying, I said yes. It's just another day. He wasn't being problematic today; he was just...different.
