Their playful touch spoke louder than words. It was clear he'd found someone else, someone who could appreciate him just as much as she did. It wasn't just about physical closeness; it was about shared memories and inside jokes. He knew everything about her—her favorite songs, the way sunlight danced through her hair, and the smell of her perfume. This new partner couldn't possibly understand him as deeply. She felt like watching them embrace was a reminder of all she’d lost. Her late husband would have loved this moment. If he were here, he’d be smiling, happy to see love flourish again. But she knew better. He wouldn’t approve. He always saw things more clearly than others, and she often wondered if she was missing something important. This couple seemed so carefree, enjoying each other’s company with an ease that made her feel like a fool. They laughed together, their joy infectious, but deep down, she felt bitter. She wished she could let go of her grief, but it was hard when every memory of her husband brought back pain. She tried to focus on the positive, but it was difficult when her heart felt heavy with longing. Her mind wandered to the countless moments they shared, the ways he looked at her, the way he smiled whenever she laughed. Everything about"
