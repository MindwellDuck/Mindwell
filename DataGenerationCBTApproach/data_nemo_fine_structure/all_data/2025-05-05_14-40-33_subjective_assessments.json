His partner, Martha, had texted him twice already, asking if he'd be home for dinner. He hadn't replied. Another error message flashed on his screen, and Bob felt a familiar frustration building in his chest. It wasn't the first time this week that work had kept him late, and he knew Martha would understand, but tonight, he just wanted to go home. The thought of another microwaved meal alone while she waited made his temples throb. He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing sense of guilt as he reached for his phone to call it a night.",

It’s just one mistake after another, and I keep thinking about how much more comfortable it’ll be when I finally retire. If I just push through these last few weeks, I can count down the days until I leave this job behind. Martha doesn’t deserve all this stress; I shouldn’t have agreed to stay on this long-term contract anyway. She deserves someone who can actually handle the workload without constantly calling her for help. It feels like every time I try to make progress, something else goes wrong, and I just end up feeling exhausted. Maybe I should just quit now and start looking for a new job, but then again, I don’t really know where else to find work at my age. The whole experience has been a nightmare, and I’ve never felt more tired than right now. This is going to be a long night."

Why does he have to make things so difficult? Can't he see that I'm trying here? It's like he thinks I'm some kind of idiot who can't handle his ego. Newsflash, Mark: I've been dealing with your ego for years. You know what? I'm sick of you. Sick of your condescending attitude towards women who aren't as pretty as you. Sick of being treated like dirt because I'm not a supermodel. Sick of you thinking I’m stupid because I don’t have your fancy degree. I swear, every time we talk, he just makes me feel more and more worthless. And now, with this project cancelled, I'm back to square one. Square one, but with even less money than before.

Our differences would have eventually driven us further apart, even if I tried to hold things together. Our breakup was inevitable. I should have known better than to invest myself in someone who doesn't truly value me. It wasn’t worth the heartache. No one will ever love me the way I loved her. My attempts at connection are always met with rejection, making it clear that I’m destined to be alone forever. It’s a cruel fate, and I accept it. She didn’t care enough to fight for us, and now I see why. She never loved me genuinely, and I wasted years believing otherwise. Now I understand that our relationship was doomed from the beginning.

It wasn't just that they seemed content with what they had; it was the way they wore their joy like a badge, an effortless charm that made her feel inadequate. Every glance at their photos, every conversation about their experiences, only served to heighten her feelings of inadequacy. They were the ones who laughed freely, who saw beauty in the mundane, while she struggled to find meaning in anything. Their lives, once so full of hope, now lay barren, but they refused to dwell on past failures. Instead, they moved forward, each step filled with purpose. Each new day brought them closer to their dreams, while hers felt mired in disappointment. They had built something together, a home that became a sanctuary for both of them. But she couldn’t help but wonder if she was somehow less worthy of love, if her existence was inherently flawed from the start. What if, instead of finding solace in shared memories, she was merely a reminder of what could have been? Every moment spent alone was a harsh reminder of her isolation. She longed to be part of a family, to share laughter and warmth with people who cared. Yet, no matter how hard she tried, she remained on the outside looking in. Her attempts at connection were met with rejection, each failure weighing heavily on her shoulders."

We never really got along anyway; I always felt she was too critical. If she wasn’t so uptight all the time, maybe things would’ve worked better between us. It’s weird how everyone else is acting like they’re still alive, but she can’t even enjoy her favorite family recipes anymore. She barely cooks these days, which makes me think she’s just using the holidays as an excuse to feel sad again. I’m starting to wonder if she was really happy with our parents before they died – I mean, she did say some pretty harsh things about them. Maybe she just needed to let go of those feelings instead of bottling them up into anger. But no, now she acts like everything was perfect. It’s hard to believe she actually misses them, especially since she hasn’t cried once this whole year. I guess I’ll just have to accept that she needs time, but honestly, sometimes I wish she’d just stop making such a fuss. She probably feels guilty about what happened, but she won’t admit it.
