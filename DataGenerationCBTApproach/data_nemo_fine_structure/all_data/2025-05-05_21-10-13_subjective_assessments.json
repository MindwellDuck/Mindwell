After all, she had been working with him for years, and he knew how he could easily get under her skin. That laugh, the way his arm rested against hers—she must have been trying to show him off, flaunting how friendly they were. But what really got under his skin was the time stamp: 12:07 AM. She hadn't gone to bed yet, so she must have sent it right after waking up. And she was probably doing it to spite him, making him think she didn't care about his feelings anymore. Or maybe, just maybe, she was planning to meet up with Jake as soon as he left for work. He could already imagine the two of them laughing together, completely forgetting about him. But he wasn't going to let that happen. Not if he had anything to say about it."

I'm sick of people blaming me for their own lack of motivation. Teaching isn't easy, but it doesn’t make it okay to slack off when you’re working late. Stop making excuses and get your act together! Stop being dramatic, you think teaching is stressful? Try having 50 students talk at once while trying to keep up with your notes. Then maybe you’ll understand why I’m upset about grading papers. But no, you just sit there and complain like everyone else is at fault except themselves. Stop making excuses and get your act together. You seem to be making this situation worse by constantly complaining. You're probably not doing enough anyway. Your lack of motivation makes you look weak. Maybe if you stepped up your game, things would improve. Stop blaming everyone else. This is all your fault. You're always late and unprepared. Now you're whining about grading papers?

She picked it up, examining it closely before placing it back in inventory. As she reached for another shirt, something caught her eye—an old photograph tucked into the sleeve, now creased and faded. It was them, laughing together at a picnic last summer, their eyes crinkled with joy. A wave of sadness washed over her as she remembered that day, that time when life felt simpler, happier.

She seemed so happy, so carefree, and yet, I couldn't shake off the feeling that she had it all figured out, that she was content with her life, whereas mine was a mess. She didn't have the same struggles I did, no one to support me, no job security. Her boyfriend was there, holding her hand, sharing a laugh; he was perfect, while I was just a broken, lost soul. Even her clothes seemed perfect—fitting well, stylish, and clean. What was wrong with me? Why did everything go wrong? Why did she get to live such a fulfilling life while I struggled to make ends meet? I started to feel like I wasn’t doing enough, like every little thing reminded me of what I lacked. Every time she smiled, I saw someone else’s happiness, someone who had it all. When she talked about her plans, I heard about things I could never achieve, things that made me feel even more inadequate. She was always so positive, so full of hope, while I felt stuck, trapped by my own failures. My mind wandered to the countless times we'd spent together, and how each memory highlighted my shortcomings. We used to be close friends, but now I felt"

Always putting work over family. We knew then that she wasn’t committed to our relationship. And now, it’s obvious she has no interest in our lives. This isn't just about missing one more birthday; it's about all the others where she didn’t show up. We tried to make it work because we wanted to, but it was never going to be enough for someone like her. I can’t believe I wasted my life on her. Every time she left me, I thought maybe this would be different. Maybe she’d change. But every single time, she chose work over us. When she was pregnant with our daughter, she barely even noticed. Even after we got married, she continued to prioritize her job. Our daughter grew up feeling neglected because of her mom. Now, she’s grown into a young woman who thinks her mother doesn’t care about her. I have to wonder if she ever really did. It's worse than that.

We've been through some tough times lately, but this is just another example of how much pressure she puts on herself. If we're being honest, I think she's always felt like she wasn't talented enough for what she wanted to do. This must be the final blow, making her lash out at us in ways she never has before. Maybe if she could channel some of that energy into something productive, we'd see a different side of her. But no, instead, she keeps spiraling, making our lives harder with each passing day. The way she talks about her art makes me wonder if she's truly passionate about it anymore. Sometimes I worry that she's just using it as an excuse to avoid dealing with real problems in her life. Still, I know deep down that there's more to her than meets the eye. There's still that spark within her, waiting to be fanned back into flame.

These questions swirled in his head, making it hard to focus on anything else. Even the words for the obituary seemed to blur together, like the lines between reality and fantasy were becoming indistinct. He felt like he was drowning in them, each thought pulling him deeper into the darkness. And yet, despite this turmoil, he knew he had to move forward. But how? How does one go on when every step feels like a leap of faith? When the very memories that once brought him so much joy now bring only pain? He sighed, letting the weight settle, and slowly, began to write. Not because he wanted to honor her, but because he needed to find some semblance of peace.

I can't imagine him being anything in between. ## Step 1: Identify the Distortion To address this question, we need to first identify what All or Nothing Thinking looks like in practice. It involves viewing a situation, person, or event through binary lenses, where everything falls into one extreme category rather than existing on a spectrum. This means that individuals who exhibit this thinking tend to see things as entirely one way or the other, without room for nuanced perspectives. ## Step 2: Analyze the Situation In the provided scenario, my husband’s behavior has been inconsistent. On one hand, he frequently arrives home late, which suggests he may be irresponsible. However, when he does show up on time, he makes an effort to spend quality time with his family, indicating another side of his personality. To illustrate this dichotomy, consider two possible interpretations: - **Complete Irresponsibility**: He consistently shows up late, disregarding our agreed-upon bedtime routine for the children. This could lead to feelings of frustration and neglect. - **Dedicated Parent**: Despite arriving late, he prioritizes family time during the weekend, ensuring everyone spends quality moments together. This demonstrates his care for his loved ones. ## Step 3: Apply the Distortion When confronted with these opposing views, someone exhibiting All or Nothing Thinking might respond by labeling their spouse as either an irresponsible slacker or a devoted parent, without considering the complexity"
