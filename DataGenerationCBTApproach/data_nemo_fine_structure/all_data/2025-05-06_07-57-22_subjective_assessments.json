I bet he thinks I'm still jealous of his success. But I'm not—of course I am.

The whole thing feels surreal. I keep replaying it in my head, wondering how this could have happened. But let me tell you, it wasn’t all bad. There was a moment during the meeting where someone asked if I had a family, and one of our editors suggested we take a break to talk about it. They were incredibly kind, and it really made me realize how much support there is around here. I know I’m lucky to work in such a positive environment. And despite the chaos, everyone seemed so supportive. Even though some people are clearly upset, they’re being super understanding. I mean, I caught one person crying in the corner; they were just quietly sobbing while typing away. It’s crazy how quickly things escalated. Everyone was so focused on what was happening, but deep down, I think they knew it was going to be awkward. Some colleagues were visibly uncomfortable, especially when I started talking about my husband. But hey, at least I got to share some personal stuff, right?

Now, as an artist, he thinks he can just ignore cleanliness? The way he smells, the state of our home—it all feels like more proof that he never cared enough to put in the effort when he was still living with me. I’m starting to think she only stayed because she felt sorry for him. Even after she left, she didn’t try to give him any real support. She’d often say things like “Don’t worry, I know what you need” and then just disappear. It’s like she thought she could replace her own life with being there for him. But she couldn’t even be bothered to look at herself properly before she left. I saw her struggling with depression, and she just kept pushing through it instead of facing it head-on.

And now, this... This is proof he wants to spend time with someone else. Someone who understands him. Who makes him happy. He said he needed space, but did he ever explain why? Did he say he couldn't handle the pressure? Or was it something deeper? Something he wasn't willing to share? Maybe he doesn't want me anymore. Maybe I'm too much for him. Too needy. Too clingy. Maybe he just needs someone less demanding. Less clingy. He has so many excuses. So many reasons to leave. Why would he stay? Why would he choose me? And the worst part? He has no idea how she feels.

I can't help but feel incredibly disappointed in him. His lack of awareness and carelessness are truly shocking. How could he forget something like that? Doesn't he understand the significance of this moment? Did he really think he could simply leave the ring behind without realizing what would happen next? It's absolutely infuriating. She must have made him do it on purpose. Why else would someone be so reckless with something so precious?

He's always leaving shit like that, but this time it's especially gross - it smells so bad! And now they're all over my studio because he didn't clean up after himself. This is insane. It makes me want to get sick. # Explanation This response reflects the cognitive distortion \"Blaming\" by directing blame towards another person, in this case, the artist who left the rotting fish on the artist's paint palette. The artist is aware of the other person's behavior (\"He's always leaving shit like that\") yet still directs blame towards them, implying that they are intentionally trying to be malicious. By using phrases such as \"How could he?\" and \"This is insane,\" the artist is placing fault entirely on the other person, rather than taking responsibility for cleaning up after themselves. Additionally, the phrase \"And now they're all over my studio\" suggests that the artist feels ownership over the space and believes someone else's actions are causing problems within it. Overall, the response reflects an avoidant coping mechanism where the artist shifts focus away"
