She hasn't painted anything meaningful since he left, two years ago today. A sudden gust of wind rattles the window behind her, startling her into dropping the brush onto the dusty floor. As she bends to pick it up, a small, framed photo tucked beneath an easel catches her eye - them laughing together on their honeymoon. The weight of that carefree happiness feels heavier now than any canvas could bear. She picks up the photo instead of the brush, tracing its edges with fingers that ache for something more tangible than despair.",

She keeps switching between these two versions in her mind, never quite satisfied with either one. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger She has a memory of him being there when they first met, holding her hand as they walked through a field of wildflowers. He had his arm around her shoulders, and she felt safe in his presence. Now, whenever she closes her eyes, that image pops up again, making her feel like she’s missing out on something special by focusing too much on the negative. ## Step 2: Analyze the Impact Every time she tries to create art again, she gets caught up in thinking about what went wrong. Instead of letting go of those thoughts, she lets them build up inside her, weighing her down. It makes her want to give up, even though she knows deep down that creating is supposed to be fun. ## Step 3: Look for Patterns This isn’t the first time she’s let herself get stuck like this. Every time she tries to start something new, she ends up getting hung up on past mistakes. It’s like she can’t move forward until she works through everything from"

Why does she even need to talk to Alex? Does she think they’re having more fun than us? Does she know how many times I’ve tried to be funny, to make her laugh, but it never works?
