Her latest article has been published, but there's no celebratory bottle of wine tonight. Instead, she stares at the empty chair across from hers, a pang of sadness echoing through her as she remembers last year's Christmas Eve dinner, laughing with her late grandmother over steaming bowls of pasta.

The soft light from her screen dances across her face, casting a warm glow over the space. But despite this peaceful atmosphere, a sense of emptiness settles within her. It’s almost as if time itself has lost its rhythm, leaving only silence to fill the void. Every moment, every breath, feels like a reminder of what she’s missing—the warmth of love, the comfort of shared laughter, and the joy of being part of something bigger than herself. In the end, it’s not just about the absence of others; it’s about the loss of connection—a feeling that can never truly be replaced. Last Christmas, we gathered around the table, our hands intertwined, sharing stories and memories that felt woven into the fabric of our lives. And yet, even then, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was just going through the motions, pretending to fit into a role that didn’t feel entirely mine. It wasn’t until my grandmother passed away that I realized how much more I had been hiding behind that mask, afraid to let anyone see the real me. Now, with her gone, all I’m left with is the echo of those moments, the faint whispers of what could have been, reminding me that some things are forever out of reach, leaving me to wander through life alone, searching for a piece of myself that may never be found. But still, she sits here"

When I hear them laughing together, I can't help but wonder if he's planning a secret trip without me, even though we've talked about it. It feels like he's pretending to be interested in my life, but deep down, he’s bored with me. The way he giggles at their silly stories makes me feel like he’s making fun of me. Every time this happens, I start thinking he wants to leave me for someone else, which is ridiculous since we’ve been married for ten years. This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this; he always goes off on these solo trips with his friends, leaving me alone. But honestly, I think he just likes being around his old buddies more than us. Maybe he’s secretly planning to break up with me because he prefers his friendship. Whenever I try to talk to him about it, he just brushes it off and says “it’s nothing.” But I know there’s more going on behind closed doors. I feel like I’m missing out on important things just because he doesn’t want to share them with me.

Maybe we're better off without the pressure. Who knows, maybe this isn't meant to be. I'll just make some toast or whatever and get back to work. This isn't about him showing up or not, it's about how much I want to see him. So fuck it. Let him think he doesn't matter. I know exactly where he is, and I'll catch up with him later. If at all.

Still, she keeps pushing me, asking for more responsibilities, like she thinks she deserves it just because she graduated from culinary school.
