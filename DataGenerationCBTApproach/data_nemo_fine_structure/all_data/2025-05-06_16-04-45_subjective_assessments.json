It was clear they were all busy, but it seemed like none of them would even acknowledge me. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe they just weren't in the mood. But then I noticed that every time I asked one of them about what we were doing next, they'd simply stare at me before turning back to their work. I started to wonder if there was something going on that I wasn't aware of—maybe someone was upset about something? Or perhaps they were dealing with personal issues that made them distracted? I decided to take a closer look around the hospital, hoping to find some clue. As I walked past each room, I caught glimpses of patients who seemed to be struggling. One woman was crying softly while her husband held her hand; another had been bedridden for days, and now looked more exhausted than ever. A third patient was clearly scared, clinging to her mother’s arm as she tried to reassure her. It dawned on me that maybe these patients were the reason everyone was so short-tempered today. Maybe the stress of working long hours was making people irritable. I thought about how my own life was complicated lately – between caring for my elderly parents and dealing with my sister's health struggles, I felt overwhelmed most days. Was it possible that others were facing similar challenges? Why did nobody seem to care about us"

Ugh, I need to get myself together. I'm starting to sound crazy, even to myself. What if I go back there? What if I say something stupid? What if... ugh, stop it, you fucking idiot!

His gaze drifted to his own worn-out shoes, the uniform he'd been wearing for years. When she stood up to leave, he saw the discreet 'L' engraved on her ring. A lifelong learner, she had once told him, not a wife or lover. Yet, envy gnawed at him nonetheless, as it always did when he saw her living the life he'd once envisioned for himself.",

I wonder how long it takes for them to forget about me, to move on to someone new. Does anyone ever remember me? They're all so lucky, while I'm stuck here, watching them live their dreams. I see her now, laughing and smiling, completely carefree. What would it be like to experience that joy again? To feel confident, to wear clothes that fit well, to hold hands with someone who cares? I'm tired of feeling invisible. The world moves forward, leaving me behind. Everyone gets what they want except me. Maybe I'll never understand why some people are so much happier than me. **Why do I always seem to miss out?** It's frustrating when I try to talk to them, but they don't notice me. Or maybe they do notice, but they're polite anyway. Like, \"Oh, you're here.\" Yeah, I am. But no one wants to hear my problems or listen to my stories anymore. I'm just another face in the crowd.

It doesn't help that she got an email from HR yesterday about the job interview.

If only I could turn back the clock, if only things were different. But life goes on, and she needs to go on. So she gets ready, forces herself out the door, and heads to the office. On her way there, she passes by the park where we used to walk together. The same park now fills her mind with memories of our last conversation, where he told me he wasn't feeling well and would see me later. He never came home. The sound of birds chirping and children playing turns into a cacophony of grief. She quickens her pace, but it does nothing to ease the ache. By the time she reaches the office, her hands are shaking, and she can barely look anyone in the eye. She takes a deep breath and steps inside, hoping to find some semblance of normalcy.
