I've tried every trick in the book, and it still doesn't work. I feel trapped. My frustration grows each day, and I'm starting to lose hope. I wish I could give up, but I know I'd be letting everyone down. Still, the thought keeps creeping in - maybe it's time for me to leave. Maybe I’m not cut out for this job. If things keep going like this, I might end up losing everything. I really need some help here. I feel like I’m drowning in this job, and there’s no escape.

As if someone had deliberately orchestrated her downfall, guiding her towards failure with each passing moment. \"This isn't just about space constraints,\" she thought, her mind racing with paranoid scenarios. \"It's a test.

Every minute ticked by felt like an eternity, each one filled with questions I dared not ask. Was he really happy without me? Or was this just another step in a journey he'd started long before our marriage? I felt trapped between the hope of saving us and the fear of losing myself in the process. The truth hit me hard: maybe he never truly needed me. Maybe he was already moving on, leaving me to pick up the pieces of a life I no longer recognized.

He could almost picture her walking into their empty apartment, the sound of her footsteps echoing off the walls. She’d stop right there, look around, and suddenly remember the scarf.
