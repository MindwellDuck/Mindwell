Another late night with the 'team dinner' they've been having weekly.

Even the way she holds that mug, so tenderly, feels like a cruel joke. It’s almost as if she believes she’s doing what’s right for me, but really, it's all just a painful reminder of what we've lost. She thinks she’s showing respect, but I see it as an insult - as if she needs to remind herself (and everyone else) of how much she misses me. Her attempts to be supportive only make things worse, because now I'm reminded of how alone she'll truly be once I'm gone. And yet, she insists on keeping that mug, treating it like it's still filled with my coffee, which makes me angry. It's not just the mug; it's the entire world she's trying to rebuild without me. Everything feels forced, even her tears. They’re just another layer of pain, a constant reminder that nothing will ever go back to normal."

She keeps bringing up how long it took him to reach out, which makes me feel even more bitter. Honestly, I think she's being overly sensitive about this whole thing. I mean, who writes a letter after all these years and doesn't mention anything else? It's such an obvious sign that he's trying to get back into our lives, but she just won't give him a chance. It's really frustrating to see her react like this over something that feels so petty. It’s also kind of weird that she got emotional over one letter. If he had sent 10 letters, would she have been as upset? I guess it just shows how easily you can manipulate people's feelings with a simple gesture. This situation has been bothering me for a while now, and seeing how she reacts to it just reinforces what I already knew - she's too soft and empathetic sometimes.\" #Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End## ##Response End##"

And now, with this latest rejection, I can’t help but feel like I’m drowning in a sea of despair, unable to escape the weight of my own failures. But what really sets my soul aflame is how she chose someone else. Someone who doesn’t even know the value of love—someone who sees relationships as a game, something to be won or lost at whim. I’ve seen the way they interact, the way they speak about each other. It’s all so... casual. So unlike anything real. They don’t see each other as partners, as two souls bound together by something deeper than surface-level attraction. No, they’re just players in some twisted game of lust and deception. And she, my beautiful, innocent wife, has fallen right into their trap. It’s always the same. Why does it have to be this way? Why does she insist on choosing those who would break our hearts, who would destroy everything we’ve built together? Is it because she’s tired of fighting? Because she’s ready to give up on us"

That's not what I signed up for. I could have been out there, making a difference, but instead, I'm stuck in this godforsaken city, surrounded by nothing but the same old faces.
