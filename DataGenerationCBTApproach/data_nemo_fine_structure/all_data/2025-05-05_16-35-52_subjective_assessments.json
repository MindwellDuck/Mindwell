Whenever she thinks back to those times with him, she can't help but feel like she's being judged by everyone around her - her friends, family, coworkers, even strangers. It's like they're all thinking, \"Oh, you're one of those broken-hearted girls.\" She feels like no matter what she does or says, it's just seen as proof of some deeper flaw within her. That feeling is so suffocating at times that she starts to wonder if there's anything wrong with her that makes people think this way. I mean, what would make someone like me? How could anyone see me this way? Doesn’t she know I’m doing better now? It’s like every time she hears about someone else getting into relationships, she has to remind herself that maybe they’re just lucky, that things aren’t as bad for them. But then she sees a post from a friend who’s dating, and suddenly she’s hit with feelings of jealousy and insecurity again. Why can’t she find someone like that? What’s wrong with her that everyone else gets to move on while she’s stuck here? Even though deep down she knows things will get better, she can’t shake off these thoughts and doubts. They keep haunting her, making her question whether she’ll ever be able to truly let go of the past. Every day, she feels like she’s walking on eggshells, waiting"

The radio squawked softly from its clip, but she silenced it, not wanting to disturb the peaceful scene. Her husband stood at the kitchen counter, his shoulders hunched as he rubbed at a stubborn stain on his hands. He didn't turn around when she entered, and that's when she noticed the faded bloodstains on his shirt, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary last year.\n\nHer heart sank like a stone in her chest. She'd seen enough blood to know it was old, dried. She stepped closer, her boots echoing softly on the tiled floor. He finally turned around, his eyes hollow and haunted, a stark contrast to his usually warm smile. In his hands, he held the shirt like an accusation, a silent testament to the life they'd taken yesterday.\n\n\"I couldn't bring myself to throw it out,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It's not your fault, you know that. We were just doing our job.\"\n\nBut she didn't feel like it was their job. Not today. Today, it felt personal, and the remorse sat heavy in her stomach, threatening to spill over. She took the shirt from him, folding it carefully before placing it in a bag meant for evidence. But this wasn't evidence. This was her reminder, her penance.\n\nShe looked at him then, really looked. The lines around his eyes were deeper than she remembered, and there was a weariness in his posture that spoke of more than just the physical labor of their jobs. She reached out, taking his hand in hers, offering what little comfort she could. But even as she did, she felt the weight of her own remorse, a silent companion that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day.",

He's always been the type who puts others first, but now it feels like he's carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders alone. He says he wants to go home, to forget about the chaos outside these walls. Forget about the dead, forget about the screams, forget about the endless questions. But I know better. I know that every moment spent inside those walls will only remind him of what he's lost, of what he can never get back. Is he saying I'm responsible for everything? For the lives lost, for the families torn apart, for the silence that fills the streets? It feels like he's trying to shift the blame onto me, onto us, rather than facing reality head-on. Reality is that we're both guilty, that we made a choice that cost innocent lives, and now we're left to pick up the pieces. If he wants to stay here, locked away from the world, maybe he'll find some solace in the silence. Maybe he'll convince himself that he’s not to blame, that the world isn’t his responsibility.
