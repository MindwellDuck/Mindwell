He had always been there for me when I needed him, but now he was gone, leaving me to navigate the world alone. My mind kept drifting back to the day he passed away, how his words still haunted me - \"Don't let your frustrations consume you.\" I tried to push them aside, but it wasn't working. With each failure, my anger grew, until I finally snapped, shouting at the machine, \"Why won’t you work? You were fine last week! Why is everything so different now?\" It didn’t matter that the machine was just doing what it was programmed to do; all I could think about was how my life had fallen apart since then. The world felt darker, every day more difficult. And now, here I was, struggling to keep up with the demands of science while trying to hold together a shattered heart. I couldn't help but wonder if it was all worth it - maybe I should have stayed home, spent those hours grieving instead of throwing myself into this project. But I knew I couldn’t let myself fall behind, not now. This was my chance to prove myself, to show everyone that even though I’d lost my partner, I wasn’t"

They're probably having a much better time than us ever could. Who needs romance when you can have friends? She must love being around him so much more than she loves being around me. I'm probably just too boring for her, anyway. Why would she even bother laughing with me now? It's all just a cruel joke, isn't it? Like everything else in life. People always get what they want, and I'll never be good enough. She's probably already moved on, and I'm just wasting my time. She deserves so much better than me, and I know she has it. This whole thing is just a waste of time—both mine and hers. If anything, it's proof I don't stand a chance. Maybe if I stopped loving her, things wouldn't hurt so much.

I can already imagine the excuses she’ll come up with next time she messes something up. “Oh, I forgot because I’m too sad about John.” Yeah, right. That’s probably why you’re still crying two months later. You never get over him. You’re just making it harder on yourself and everyone else around you. This isn’t your fault, but honestly, it feels like it is. How could she forget? He was everything to her. And now he’s gone. Just like this. Without warning. She doesn’t deserve to be happy again, especially not after what happened. This is all her fault. If only she had been more present, if only she had been less self-absorbed, maybe things wouldn’t have ended like this. But no, she had to go and ruin everything. Now look where we are. I hate her. I hate her so much. She needs to stop feeling sorry for herself and start taking responsibility for her actions. If only she would just get over herself for once... You know, people say that time heals all wounds, but it doesn’t. At least, not yet. We need to let her grieve properly"

He has no regard for others' feelings and will stop at nothing to keep his ego intact. His selfishness knows no bounds. Even now, when he could have made amends with his daughter, he chose to ignore her pleas for help. Instead, he continued to live a life of luxury, completely disconnected from reality. I can't even imagine what kind of darkness must be driving someone as self-centered as Harold to abandon his own family like this. Harold's inability to connect with others is not an isolated incident; it's a reflection of his entire character. He has always prioritized his own interests above all else, leaving everyone else behind. The fact that he never responded to his daughter's letters is just one more piece of evidence supporting this conclusion. I'm not surprised that she stopped writing, given his history of ignoring those around him. This behavior is simply consistent with who Harold is – a man devoid of empathy and compassion. His actions are a testament to his complete lack of humanity. Every time we see Harold, it reinforces our understanding that he is a person who doesn't care about others, who isn’t willing to make sacrifices for"
