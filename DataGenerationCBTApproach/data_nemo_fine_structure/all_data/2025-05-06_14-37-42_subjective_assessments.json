It's crazy how easily things spiral out of control when you let your emotions get the best of you. I wish I could go back and say something else, anything else, but it's too late now. He probably thinks I'm just another entitled customer who doesn't care about anyone else. That's what I'd think if I were in his shoes - a complete jerk. The way he looked at me, all smug and self-righteous, made me want to crawl into a hole and die. I swear, some people are just born to make others miserable. Anyway, moving on from this embarrassing moment, I decided to treat myself to a nice dinner tonight. I ordered my favorite dish and even got a dessert to top it off. But honestly, none of it has been able to lift my mood. Every time I try to enjoy myself, I end up thinking about that awful customer and how he ruined my day. I guess sometimes you just have to accept that life isn't always fair, and we all have our moments of frustration. At least I learned a valuable lesson today - never let one bad experience ruin your appetite! --- # Edit Thanks for the gold"

I remember how she used to write me notes when I was sick, and this feels like one of those times. But why would she write something if she wasn't there? I keep thinking about our last conversation before she died. We were talking about our plans for next year, and I said something stupid because I was tired. Now I wonder if that was the last time we ever spoke. Wasn't she supposed to call me back? Or did she forget? Maybe she forgot. Why would she forget? Did she die from forgetting? That sounds ridiculous, but what else am I supposed to think? This whole thing started with a phone call saying she had cancer. Cancer! Can you believe it?

You fucking up and forgetting our anniversaries. Yeah, because forgetting isn't hard enough, I have to deal with the fact that you're not even bothered to remember. That's not laziness; that's some serious commitment-phobia right there. You're probably just too busy playing video games or whatever it is you pathetic losers spend your time doing instead of actually living life. So yeah, let's blame him for everything.
