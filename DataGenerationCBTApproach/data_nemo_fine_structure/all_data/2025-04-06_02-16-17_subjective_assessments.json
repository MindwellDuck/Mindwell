He hadn't seemed suspicious at first, but now he was slowing down, matching her pace. She felt a chill run down her spine as she realized she'd taken this shortcut too many times before to remember where it led. The streetlights here were infrequent, and the shadows long. Her heart began to pound in her chest, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She quickened her pace, but so did he. Fear gripped her, icy and paralyzing. She wanted to look back, but she didn't dare take her eyes off the path ahead.",

But then again, there are plenty of stories about strangers who've done terrible things. It's always better to err on the side of caution. Still, she shouldn't be letting fear control her movements. That's not healthy. This is ridiculous. She's just tired and stressed out. There's nothing to worry about. But she can't stop looking over her shoulder, expecting him to appear behind her at any moment. She must be letting anxiety get the best of her. Why can't she just relax?"

It was as if the entire world was now judging him, and he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was somehow tainted by this careless mark. Every glance from his students seemed to hold a weight of disappointment, making him feel like he'd failed in every sense of the word—both as a teacher and as a human being. It wasn't just the students; even his colleagues were likely to notice and criticize his appearance, further solidifying his perception of himself as unworthy. The mere idea that they might be thinking about him in such negative terms made him feel like he was living in a constant state of shame, as if he was somehow less deserving of respect simply because of this one mistake. His mind raced with self-criticism, imagining what others would think when they saw him outside of school—a vivid picture of people avoiding him, refusing to sit next to him, and treating him with disdain. Even though he knew this was irrational, the thought still lingered, fueling his anxiety and reinforcing his feelings of inadequacy. With each passing moment, he became more convinced that he was no longer capable of holding his head high, let alone inspiring confidence in his students. This small mistake had turned into a monumental failure, and he couldn’t help but wonder if things could ever go back to normal"

Yeah, because that's exactly what I need - more reminders that I've failed as an artist. Why can't she see that I'm drowning under the pressure? That I've spent years perfecting my craft, only to be stuck here, staring at a blank space? It's like she thinks I just started painting yesterday. She doesn't say anything when she sees the canvas, which is fine. But why does she act like everything is okay? Doesn't she realize that every time we come home, I'm still dealing with the same anxiety? The same fear of failure that's been building up inside me for years? Is she really oblivious to all this? Does she think I'm just some idiot who can't handle a little stress? \"I know you're stressed,\" she says quietly, trying to comfort me, but it's just another reminder that she doesn’t understand. I mean, why would she? She’s never painted a single brushstroke in her life. What could she possibly know? Maybe if she was the one struggling, she’d feel my pain.

They want to believe that by knowing what I've lost, they'll somehow be able to empathize with me, even if it means making assumptions about my entire existence based on one person. And you know what? I let them. I let them get inside my head, letting them see all the pain I've endured, all the moments I wish I could turn back time for. But deep down, I know it's not really about feeling better; it's about their own need to validate their grief. They might say things like, \"Always remember,\" or \"Never forget,\" but all they're doing is creating this imaginary connection between us, like I'm somehow responsible for their feelings. I mean, come on, who needs that kind of pressure? It’s such a waste of time, especially when I’m trying to get through my day without being reminded of every tragedy in the world.

But last night, when we were all alone in the living room, he was laughing with his friends, completely carefree. He even laughed at one of their stupid jokes, which made me want to scream because he never laughs like that anymore. It makes me wonder what else he might be hiding, what other secrets he keeps from me. I feel so trapped here, stuck in this toxic situation where every little thing sets off these terrible thoughts. Even the smallest things—like how he smiled at someone else during lunch today—make me question everything. Is he still attracted to her? Does he find me unattractive? I know I shouldn’t think like this, but I can’t help myself. Every time he leaves for work, I feel like I’m drowning in jealousy. The worst part is, I have no idea what's really going on in his mind. Am I just paranoid, or is there something deeper I need to face? I hate myself for feeling this way, but I can’t stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong.
