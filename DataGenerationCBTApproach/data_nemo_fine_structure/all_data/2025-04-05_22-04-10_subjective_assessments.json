It wasn't just the absence of her presence that hit me hard; it was the realization that I had become an invisible part of her life. I didn't belong here, among these people who knew her so well, who saw her every day, and who understood her in ways I could never hope to grasp. They were all connected to her in ways I could never be. Her coworkers had become like family to her, sharing secrets and stories that I would never know. Even the doctors and nurses seemed more than just colleagues to her; they were confidants, partners in her care, and friends. But what did I have? Nothing. No one. Just a stranger passing through, always on the outside looking in. I was a ghost hovering around the edges of their lives, never truly a part of anything. I had no place here, no reason to linger beyond my shift. Yet, I stood there, lost in thought, unable to move forward. The emptiness surrounding me felt oppressive, weighing heavily on my shoulders, making each breath harder. I felt trapped, stuck between the desire to leave and the need to hold on to whatever small connection I had with her. But that connection meant nothing, a fleeting illusion born from loneliness. In reality, I had nothing to offer her, nothing to share, and nothing to say. I was just another forgotten soul, a nameless face in"

I hate how she always has to leave me hanging by calling when she knows I'll be up working through the night. Now, I have to waste my time listening to her voice messages until morning, hoping nothing bad happened. Why does everything always end in tragedy for us? Even if it's just a simple call about dinner plans, she ends up leaving a long voicemail saying she forgot or got busy. I swear, I must be cursed. First, it was the car accident; then, the sudden illness; and now...now I'm just waiting for the next one. This isn't right. I deserve better than this. But it keeps happening.

Maybe she's just waiting for me to realize it too, but I know deep down that this isn’t going to end well. It’s ridiculous how much time she spends reading those old books; she must really hate living here now. And I don’t blame her—it feels like a prison, especially after everything that’s happened. But honestly, I’m surprised she doesn’t see right through all this. I mean, come on, she knows things aren’t going to get better. Still, I suppose some people need to convince themselves that they’re okay before they actually are. Anyway, I guess I should start cleaning up around here, but I doubt anything would change.
