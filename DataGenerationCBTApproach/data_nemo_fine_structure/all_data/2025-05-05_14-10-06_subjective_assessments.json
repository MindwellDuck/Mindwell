The latest letter from her daughter, filled with unspoken concerns about her father's health, lay untouched beside the keyboard. Her mind raced, envisioning worst-case scenarios, each one more daunting than the last. She sighed, rubbing her temples, as the clock ticked away another hour of sleepless worry.",

My heart sank, and I felt like I was going to pass out. But when I finally managed to get to the hospital, everything seemed so normal - he was fine. Well, mostly fine, but still... Now, every little thing makes me feel like something terrible is happening. Even when my kids are happy, I worry they'll hurt themselves. And when they're sick, I think it might be because of what happened to my husband. It's like my brain is constantly playing these scenarios over and over, making me feel so scared and alone."

The first time we had a power outage, she thought the house was haunted because she heard strange noises at night. Now, this? Just some weird sound that turned out to be nothing. She immediately assumed there was something seriously wrong and even called an electrician twice, thinking it might be a fire hazard. What if it was actually an electrical issue? Wouldn’t that be serious? No one knows more about electrical work than me! I’m an electrician, for crying out loud. I know what these things are like. But does she ever consider the possibility that it’s just a minor issue? Does she never think before jumping to conclusions? This whole thing has been driving her crazy, constantly worrying about potential dangers. She spent hours researching online, trying to figure out what it could be. Of course, she ended up finding plenty of articles claiming it was related to electrical issues, but did she really take any of those findings seriously? Or was it all just her mind racing with worst-case scenarios? Maybe she just wants attention. People always tell her how smart she is, so maybe she thinks she needs to prove it by being worried about everything. It’s not just this one incident; she’s always like that—overreacting to small things. Remember that time she freaked out over a tiny leak under"

She approached her desk, piled high with untouched manuscripts and notes from years of stories untold. A yellowed envelope caught her eye, tucked beneath a stack of newspapers. It bore no address or return label, only her name, handwritten in faded blue ink. She picked it up, feeling its weight, remembering the last time she'd held something like this. The memories rushed back, hot and shameful, as she opened it to find a decades-old photograph staring back at her - a reminder of that one story she never wrote.",

Maybe he's just busy, but his silence makes me nervous. I've asked around, but no one knows where he is. I'm starting to think he doesn't want to talk to us anymore. I don't know what's going on, but it feels like everyone is avoiding me. Even Rachel, who usually talks to me about everything, has gone silent. She was always there for me, but now she's distant, like she doesn't even care about our friendship. I feel so alone, and I keep thinking that maybe she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore because of the way things went down between us. It's hard to focus on work when I have so many unanswered questions. But I guess I'll try to push through, hoping that eventually, things will settle down. Until then, I can't shake off the feeling that something is really wrong, and I might need to confront John about it. Maybe I should start by asking Sarah, since we both worked together on that project. She seems like someone who would be honest with me, but I’m not sure if she’ll open up about what’s going on. I’ve tried talking to her before, but she just gives me a weird look and changes the subject. Still, I think I owe it to myself to"

So now here we are, and she's freaking out over her stupid reading glasses. This isn't the first time this has happened. Last year, she couldn't find her keys, and then later found them under the couch cushion. The summer before that, she misplaced our car keys twice, just like this. It's always about avoiding confrontation. Remember how she refused to go to the doctor until she had symptoms? Now, here we are again, dealing with this nonsense. Why do we even bother trying to help her? She never listens, anyway. We have to remind her every single day—“Don’t forget to pick up milk!” or “Remember to turn off the stove.” And when we do remind her, she gets angry and says we’re being too controlling. Then, when she forgets something important (like taking the trash out), she complains that we never remind her. It’s so frustrating. When will she learn? I swear, every time we try to help, she resists. Even when I set reminders on her phone, she still forgets. It feels like we’re constantly fighting over stuff that could’ve been easy to prevent if she’d just pay attention. And honestly,"

In fact, I'm surprised she even bothered calling me back last night; she knows how I feel about those calls. They always escalate into something pointless and exhausting. How could she think she can get away with this? Does she really believe I'd let her leave like this? She must have been drunk when she made the call. She wouldn't actually think I'd take such drastic measures against someone who loves me like that. That's not what marriage is for—this kind of nonsense. We've been through enough already. What's a little more stress going to do? Besides, I know she's hiding some secrets from me, but that doesn't mean she'd abandon us like this. Maybe she needs space, but she knows how much it hurts me. Doesn't she understand anything? If anyone was ever going to hurt me, it would be her. She has no right to just disappear like this.
