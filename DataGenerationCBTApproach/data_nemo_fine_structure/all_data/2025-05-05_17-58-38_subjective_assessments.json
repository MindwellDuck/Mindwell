The headline, which used to be hers, now bore an unfamiliar name, and yet she felt like she could see her own signature, distorted and twisted, like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. Every glance at the page made her feel like she was gazing into the abyss, her mind screaming silently, \"This isn't yours.\" Every time she passed by the newsroom, she caught glimpses of him, sitting comfortably at his new desk, typing away, seemingly content with his newfound role. He moved through the office with an air of confidence, his words laced with an ease that she could never match. His presence seemed to fill the room, a stark contrast to the sense of loss that clung to her like a shroud. As if he knew exactly how to weave himself into the fabric of the newspaper, how to make himself indispensable, while she was left on the outside looking in. Her days blended together, each one a blur of frustration and anger, as she watched him effortlessly navigate the world of journalism.

It’s hard not to take it personally, especially when I hear them talking about how they’re learning new skills online, something I did decades ago. **Subjective Reaction:** I notice the older nurses seem to be getting attention from the younger ones.

One of the younger nurses chimed in, saying she remembers using a flip phone before her parents got smart phones.
