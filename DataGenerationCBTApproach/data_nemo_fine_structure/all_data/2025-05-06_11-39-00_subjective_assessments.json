It's been over five years since we were married, and yet every time I come here, I'm hit with these fucking feelings. Just fucking get over it already. Why would I want to be reminded of what could've been? What am I even doing here? Fuck it, I'm done. Oh great, the memory has returned, and I'm still stuck inside my own head. Of course, that's what happens when you're a shitty, insecure, dumbass like me. This isn't the first time I've felt this way, and it won't be the last. But why does it always come back to this stupid kitchen? Who cares about some fucking watch anyway? We're not even together anymore. Why would I waste my time thinking about that? Shit, I need to get out of here. Maybe if I leave, I'll finally start moving on from all this crap. But no, I'm stuck in this godforsaken place, reliving all the pain and regret.

Why do they think they can just sit there, wasting time, while I’m struggling to get anything done? It makes me feel like they’re not even taking me seriously. They think I don’t care about them, like I’m some kind of robot who doesn’t need to rest or recharge. And then, to make matters worse, you’d think she’d at least be checking her phone. But no, she’s just zoning out, completely disconnected from reality. What does she have to lose? Why bother with something as mundane as “being productive”? It’s all just an illusion anyway—it’s not like we actually get paid enough to justify this nonsense. The system is rigged against us; everyone knows that. So why would she care? It’s not just this one time either. Every day, I see people like her just coasting through life, oblivious to the struggles of those working hard behind the scenes. And the worst part?

At first, I tried to rationalize it. Maybe they genuinely forgot? Or perhaps they needed something from my bag so quickly? But those thoughts were drowned out by the nagging feeling that everyone around me was against me. Even though I know deep down that we all share the same kitchen space, the way people treat my belongings makes it seem like they want me to fail. They’re always watching, waiting for me to slip up so they can take advantage of it. I start to wonder if anyone would even notice if I stopped bringing my lunch? I tried to push these thoughts aside, telling myself I’m overreacting. After all, what’s one forgotten item among dozens of meals shared daily?

Every glance from those who knew him better than her makes her skin crawl; they're all just pretending to be happy, but deep down, I know they're trying to erase me from their lives forever. It’s such a cruel joke, especially when I see how effortlessly he moves through their little group, like nothing has ever changed between them. They’re just going about their lives, enjoying each other’s company, completely oblivious to the pain he caused me. But why should I even care about their happiness? Does it really matter what they do? No, all I need to remember is that he was always unfaithful, that our marriage was built on lies, and that we were never truly meant to be. Why would anyone want to celebrate something as trivial as friendship when there are real wounds to heal? And yet, here I am, stuck in this perpetual state of sorrow, unable to find peace.

No one seems to care that I'm here, that I'm the one who didn't make it. They're too busy with their jobs to notice me. Even the paramedics, they barely looked up when I approached.

All I hear are whispers and murmurs, but no one asks me how I feel. No one even acknowledges my presence. It feels like I'm invisible. He was supposed to drive home tonight, not die.

Work, friends, the fucking world just kept piling shit on her. She deserved better, but no one cared. Even my own damn father. He was so caught up in his job, he barely noticed.
