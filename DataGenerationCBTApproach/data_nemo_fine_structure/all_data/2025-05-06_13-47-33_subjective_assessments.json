Maybe I could’ve been there sooner, but would that have made things worse? It keeps playing in my head—maybe I should’ve tried harder, maybe I wasn’t good enough. And now I feel so alone, stuck in limbo. Why can’t I get rid of these thoughts? But then I started thinking about how this whole situation might be an opportunity for growth. Maybe I can use this chance to work on myself, learn from my mistakes, and become a better version of who I am today. That way, when we eventually meet again (or maybe never), I’ll be able to look back and see how far I’ve come. So, yeah, what if I start doing some therapy?

His wife had called earlier, her voice strained, saying she was running late again due to traffic. He could hear the kids crying in the background. Another night of takeout and no one to tuck them in.\n\nThe fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting harsh shadows on his tired face as he began closing procedures. The silence of the empty store was deafening, echoing his own sense of failure. He paused by the sale rack, picking up a shirt he'd helped his wife pick out weeks ago. It still had the tag on it, untouched. He sighed, placing it back with care.\n\nAs he locked the door behind him, he noticed a missed call from his mother-in-law. She hadn't left a message, but he knew what it meant. Another ' Concerned' conversation about money and family duty loomed over him like a dark cloud.

I can’t help but wonder if things will ever get better, or if I’ll be forever trapped in this cycle of disappointment. This isn’t just about work; it’s about everything else too. My relationship with my family suffers because I don’t have the energy to put into it. I know I need to improve, but how? And even if I manage to find some small joy, it’s always tainted by the looming specter of bills and stress. I’ve tried to tell myself it’s temporary, but deep down, I fear it might never change. Even now, as I stand here, I can feel the weight of my worries pressing down around me. I try to push them aside, but they’re relentless, like a physical force that refuses to let go.
