She limps towards it, her old bones creaking in protest. Through the peephole, she sees a figure, unmistakably him. The divorce was his idea, but he's always had a knack for timing.

Her heart races as she watches him from the peephole, his eyes fixed on hers with all the warmth of a snake's stare. This time, he's standing right outside the front door, waiting for her to open it, his presence seeping into every corner of her life like a cold draft. She can feel his anger radiating towards her, and it fuels her defiance. She knows he's trying to get back in her good graces, but she won't give him that satisfaction. When she finally opens the door, she tells him straight out, “You’ve got two seconds to leave before I call the cops.” His face twists in a mixture of surprise and rage, but he doesn’t say anything. Instead, he turns around and walks away, leaving her feeling relieved but also slightly angry—angry because she knows she could have handled things differently. She wonders what would've happened if she hadn't opened the door, if she'd let him think she didn't care. Would he still be there? Would they have worked things out?"

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just expecting the worst because I've been through so much already. But what if... what if... what if...
