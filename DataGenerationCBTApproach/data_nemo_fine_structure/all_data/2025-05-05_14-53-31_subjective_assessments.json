Or maybe it's a reminder of how I once felt like I was living someone else's life with him, constantly worried about what he might think or feel? Am I just being paranoid again? Why would he leave this here now, when he knows how anxious I get about these things? Does he really need my ID for something? Maybe he's just trying to make me feel uncomfortable, like he wants to remind me that he can still enter the hospital without my knowledge. It feels like he's trying to send a message - \"Remember who you used to be?\" But why now? He knows I've been through hell lately, and this isn't helping. It's probably nothing. Just another coincidence. But honestly, does he think I'm stupid enough to fall for this? I'm not that gullible anymore. Yet... The thought keeps creeping in, like a shadow on the wall. I want to tell myself it's none of his business, but part of me wonders if there's more to this than meets the eye. Am I reading too much into this? Shouldn't I just let it go? No, no, no.
