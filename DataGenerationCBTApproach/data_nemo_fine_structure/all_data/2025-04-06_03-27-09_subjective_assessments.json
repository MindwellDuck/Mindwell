This isn't the first time I've seen her struggling; it never ends. No one has what it takes anymore. We're all just pretenders, pretending to be something we're not. Life is about appearances, not actual talent. There's nothing genuine left in this world. She'll probably end up begging for scraps from the streets eventually, just like everyone else. If you look at her, you know exactly where she stands - below us. Why bother trying when there's no point? I'm better off just staying home and avoiding people like her."

Why does he get to live such an easy life while I struggle to make ends meet? It feels like I’ve been living in this cycle of anger for years, and yet, every time I try to move forward, I keep falling back into the same pit. It’s always the same story—something happens, I react, and then I beat myself up over it. I know I need to work on controlling my emotions, but the more I try, the more frustrated I become. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever break free from this vicious loop. I guess what really gets me is how I can’t seem to stop feeling this way even after all these years. Every time something bad happens, I go through the same motions, and it makes me feel like I have no control over my own mind. Does anyone else feel like they’re stuck in this constant battle between wanting to be better and knowing they can never fully escape?"

I'm supposed to be taking care of things today, but now I'll have to deal with the mess, too. It's like the universe is trying to drive me crazy. What am I even doing here? Maybe I shouldn't have started working again. No one would miss me anyway. They'd just find another idiot to take my place. I swear, every time something good comes along, it gets ruined by something else. Like when I got that promotion, my ex-boyfriend had to go and cheat on me with my best friend. So what’s the point? I need to focus on getting through the day instead of worrying about how I messed up. Just forget it. Forget the wine"

Maybe if I hadn't fucked up that patient, maybe then things would be different. Now look where I am - failing again, wasting lives, and being treated like shit. This isn't what I signed up for, but I guess I knew it was coming. The worst part? No one cares. Not even my family. I'm completely alone. And I'll never change.

I don't know how they found that, though—the paper was almost torn to shreds, and there were some stains...but anyway, that's what made me realize it wasn't a prank. That's why I wrote back. I didn't even think about it; it just came naturally. I told them to keep looking because I couldn't bear the idea of her being gone forever.
