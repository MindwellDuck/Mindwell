I'm the one who has been holding everything together around here. I've always been the one who tries to keep him sane when things get too much. And now he just leaves like that? It doesn't make sense. We were having a good conversation earlier, and then suddenly he just disappears. He hasn't spoken to me since. What if he was planning something? Maybe he thought we'd have a fight later, and he decided to bail early. But why would he do that? Wouldn't he want to stay and work out our issues instead of just leaving? This is so frustrating. Why does he have to be so careless? Doesn't he care about how I feel? How am I supposed to deal with this? My life is already chaotic enough without him leaving like this. It feels like he just threw away whatever we had built together. I don't understand why he wouldn't try to communicate before leaving like that. Now he's gone, and I'm left dealing with all this alone. He probably just needed some space, huh? Yeah, because that's exactly what I need right now – more stress. And"

It's pointless trying to talk to him anymore. She knows the truth - he doesn't love her, he never has. All those moments of hope were just illusions. He's lost interest, and she's left to pick up the pieces of her shattered dreams. No one wants to be around someone as broken as her, especially not someone as unattractive as her.

He wouldn't even notice her if she stood right next to him, let alone try to talk to him. Everything is meaningless when you're nothing special like her.
