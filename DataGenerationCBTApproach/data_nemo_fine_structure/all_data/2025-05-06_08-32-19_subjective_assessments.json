And let's be honest, I'm already giving him more leniency than he deserves due to some personal issues he's facing at home. So why would I suddenly start handing out 'As' like they're candy? Also, when did you become his teacher? I could've sworn you were the math coach last year. What changed? Did he somehow magically improve overnight? His academic record hasn't shown such drastic improvement. It just doesn't add up. I have no idea how you can say he's your \"best student\" when his grades aren't even in the top three. And by the way, why do you always seem so happy? Are you trying to make it seem like everything is okay, like you're hiding something? I know you're always smiling, but it feels forced, almost... artificial. It's unnerving, actually. You need to stop faking it. If you really care about this child, you'd help him instead of just making fun of him behind his back. Your smile looks creepy. Like you're plotting something. Maybe you should take a break from teaching for a while, huh?"

I feel bad for those kids who need to work part-time jobs because their parents aren’t supporting them. Why does she always pick on young people?
