It's so fucking stupid! We're trying to work together as a team here, and yet people are still acting like this? They can't even stop at one thing, no, they have to keep bringing up every single time Sarah hasn't asked for help, like it's some kind of big deal. And now, I'm starting to think that maybe she does need to be more careful with what she says. Maybe she shouldn't be talking about it like that... Ugh, this is getting out of hand! So, basically, it's not just one thing; it's a pattern of behavior where Sarah gets criticized for asking for help, which leads to embarrassment, and now I'm wondering if she needs to change the way she talks about it. This whole situation has gotten really ridiculous. Why can't we just focus on working together instead of making each other feel worse? This isn't just about Sarah anymore. It's about how we treat our colleagues, especially women. We should be supporting each other, not tearing each"
