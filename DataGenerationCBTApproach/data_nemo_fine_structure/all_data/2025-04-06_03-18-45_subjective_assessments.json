Her husband of three decades had passed away quietly in his sleep six months ago, leaving her alone in their once-warm home. She pushed through each day with automated efficiency, but tonight, as she stood before the kitchen counter, a simple task undid her: the knife slipped, nicking her thumb deeply enough to draw blood. She stared at the red bead forming, then watched it drip onto the cutting board, staining the pristine white of the chopped onions. A sob escaped her, echoing through the empty house, as despair settled heavy in her chest.",

The kitchen was meant to be her sanctuary, where she could find comfort among familiar tools and the comforting smells of food. Instead, the moment of weakness left her feeling defeated and lost. As she looked at the small droplets of blood on the cutting board, she couldn't help but think about all the times she'd imagined herself handling knives with ease, never needing assistance. Now, standing there, covered in her own blood, made her realize that those images weren't just fantasies - they were a reminder that life hadn't gone according to plan for her either. She remembered the countless days she'd spent perfecting recipes, always striving for perfection, and how her late husband would have been proud of her if he were alive today. But now, as she gazed at the bloody mess, she felt like a failure. Everything had fallen apart since he died, and the pain still lingered, making every step feel heavier. Even something as mundane as chopping vegetables seemed impossible, like trying to hold back tears while keeping her composure. As she cleaned her cut, she couldn't shake the thought that she wasn't supposed to be struggling. Life should have been smoother, easier, and more predictable. Yet, here she was, surrounded by the memories of happier times, feeling utterly disconnected from the present moment. The pain in her thumb mirrored the ache in her heart, reminding her"

She remembered how excited he’d been when they first started dating, all those memories of sharing meals together. They were supposed to be happy, but then came the unthinkable. He died, leaving behind only silence and the echoes of what could have been. Even now, she couldn’t help but wonder if things would’ve changed if he were still here. Would they have found a way to make it work? She thought about all the times she’d heard him laugh, how his smile used to light up the room, and how much he loved her. It all seemed so far away, like a dream she couldn’t wake up from. But what really got to her was when she saw the photo on the table.

She’s clearly losing her touch, and she has no business continuing to call herself an artist. What could she possibly hope to achieve? The more I think about it, the more obvious it becomes that I’m wasting my time. There are much better things to spend my money on than expensive art supplies and classes, especially when there are no guarantees of success. What if I gave up now and started working on something else entirely? Maybe I could even take up gardening or cooking instead – those seem like much safer investments of my time.
