But why does it always happen on Fridays? It's like everyone who works here wants to go home early, leaving us to deal with all the late-night shoppers. And don't even get me started on how much I hate having to clean up after other people's messes—like, seriously, couldn't these people see that they're making a huge mess and take responsibility for cleaning up after themselves? I mean, come on! Don't you know that our store policy requires you to pick up after yourself? But then I start thinking about how many times I've had to deal with this exact situation before. Like, seriously, how do some people not learn their lesson? Doesn't anyone remember that when you try clothes on and decide not to buy them, you need to throw away your trash? It's not that hard! Why do I always have to be the one to remind them that they left their dirty clothes behind? Can't they see that they're making it harder for us to help the next customer if they don't put their stuff back where it belongs? I guess what really gets under my skin is when these people act like they have nothing better to do than to make my life more difficult. Like, are they just trying to be annoying? Do they think it's funny to leave their trash"

But fuck it, this is what happens when you're an asshole like me. First off, she shouldn't have been so busy. We both knew how much we had on our plates right now. Then there's the fact that she's supposed to be learning from someone who's been around the block a few times, so it makes sense that she'd want to learn from me. And come on, she shouldn't be talking to anyone else while she's working? That's basic professionalism, right? But nope, she just went ahead and did whatever she wanted. I mean, she could've been having a bad day, maybe she was dealing with family stuff. But fuck, she shouldn't act like that because she doesn't get paid enough anyway. Yeah, sure, let's ignore the whole \"we work together\" thing since it clearly doesn't matter. So yeah, she definitely shouldn't have been talking to that random guy. Shouldn't be doing anything other than focusing on her job, especially if she's new. She probably thinks she can treat everyone like shit because she's got the same title as me.

She wasn't even trying to be nice; she just kept repeating, \"Sir, you need to pull over now.\" He didn't try to hide it, either - he smirked the whole time, like he knew he was being busted for something stupid. She seemed annoyed by his attitude, though. When he said, \"You're cute when you're angry,\" I could tell she wanted to shut him down.

I shouldn't even be allowed to breathe. It makes me wonder why anyone would want to come back into this place after what happened. I've been coming here for years, and it never bothered me before. But now, I realize I don't belong here. I'm a terrible person who doesn't deserve to be around decent people like that couple. My feelings are so accurate; I'm just too weak to admit it. No one should ever see me again. I shouldn't be working here anyway. I'm just a burden to everyone. This whole experience has made me realize how much of a loser I am. If I wasn't here, everything would be better. People wouldn't treat me like shit, and I wouldn't make them feel so bad. I'm going to go home and lock myself in my room.

You know how sometimes you focus so much on one thing that everything else fades into the background? Yeah, that’s me right now. I’m stuck on this one thought, unable to let go. It’s like my brain is playing a loop of “what ifs” that keeps me up at night. Every time I try to push those thoughts away, another wave comes crashing back. It’s exhausting, but somehow I keep coming back for more. Sometimes when I see something like his favorite mug, even though it means nothing to anyone else, I feel like I'm drowning in memories. The way it looks, the smell of coffee it must hold, all these emotions come flooding back. And yet, it's just an old mug—why does it mean so much to me? My mind won’t stop jumping between good times and bad. I remember the laughter, the late-night conversations, the quiet moments when it was just us. But there are also the tears, the fights, the pain. My brain seems to be trying to balance both sides, making it impossible to move forward. Maybe I’m holding onto too many things, but it"

The clock ticks away, each second a reminder of what could've been if only he had stayed. Five years gone, yet it feels like an eternity since that fateful day when everything fell apart.

How could someone so oblivious to the world’s problems laugh and smile? It’s infuriating to think about how much time has passed since the last time he felt truly connected to someone. Now, every moment is spent alone, drowning in self-pity. Even the words on the screen seem hollow, lacking meaning as he stares blankly at the cursor. The silence around him is oppressive, weighing heavily on his chest. Every breath feels forced, every movement mechanical. He can’t shake the feeling that he’s running out of time, that every tick of the clock marks down the moments lost forever.

I'm just so overwhelmed with work right now. It's really frustrating when people say things like that. They don't understand how much stress I have. ## Step 1: Identify the trigger Identify the triggering event that led to the distorted thought. In this case, the teacher’s comment triggered the distorted thinking. ## Step 2: Analyze the thoughts Analyze the thoughts generated after the trigger. The student is assuming that the teacher’s behavior concerns them personally, without considering alternative explanations (e.g., the teacher might be having a bad day too). This shows personalization, where the individual assumes that others’ actions are directed towards them instead of recognizing more likely scenarios. ## Step 3: Evaluate the emotions Evaluate the emotions expressed in the response. The student feels frustrated, overwhelmed, and annoyed, indicating a negative emotional state. These emotions seem to stem from the perceived intrusion into their personal space, which reinforces the distorted thought. ## Step 4: Assess the conclusion Assess whether the conclusion drawn from the analysis accurately represents the distortion. In this case, the student concludes that the teacher’s action was intended to make them feel worse, which aligns with the definition of personalization. However, the conclusion"
