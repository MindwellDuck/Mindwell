Her cat, Whiskers, had passed last year, leaving behind an even deeper void. She heated up a solitary meal in the microwave, the hum of the appliance echoing through the silent rooms. As she sat down to eat, she noticed her reflection in the window - a lone figure in the dimly lit kitchen. The empty chair across from her seemed to mock her solitude. She ate quickly, eager to escape the emptiness, but there was nowhere to go except to bed, where she would lie awake, listening to the night's quiet whispers.",

It’s like the house doesn’t want me anymore, and my cat isn't here to cuddle me back together. I can't stand this loneliness; it makes me think about how much better things were when we were all together. Why does everyone else get to have someone to love? I just wish I could turn back time and relive those moments with him. But no, life has other plans. Now, every day feels like a countdown until... until what? Until he comes back, until I die, until I forget? No one understands how hard it is to be alone, especially after losing someone you loved. It’s like I’m slowly disappearing into thin air. Even the food tastes different now, and my favorite spot by the window feels cold and empty. I miss having someone to share these moments with. Isolation is killing me. I wish people understood that sometimes, the hardest thing is facing reality alone. How can I keep going when it feels like everything is falling apart? I don’t know if I can handle it anymore. Maybe someday, somehow, something will change, and I’ll find happiness again. But for now, I just need to hold on and try to make it through each day. It’s getting harder and harder to see a future without him. Why did"

So she's probably just holding onto that mug as some sort of morbid comfort. Or maybe she's trying to remind herself of what they had together. That's why she hasn't taken it down yet. But what if... What if she doesn't even care about him anymore? Maybe she's just using those things to cope with something else entirely? Like depression or anxiety or... or... ugh, I don't know! But wait, how could that be true? How can someone just forget everything they once held dear? Does she really think he'll come back to her one day? Doesn't she realize that life moves forward without people? That everyone is just trying to survive here? Why would she cling to these objects then? Is it because she's afraid of losing them, or is she trying to distract herself from the pain? Ugh, I hate myself for thinking this way! I bet she wishes she never touched that mug. Now every time she sees it, she's reminded of him. Even if she didn’t love him, she might still feel guilty about touching something that belonged to him. This is all so confusing.

He felt the heat rise in his face, the familiar shame crawling up his spine like ivy on an old wall. \"I'm sorry,\" he murmured, head bowed as he handed her the bag.

Still, I can't shake this feeling that I've done something wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have been late again? But she knows how hard it is for me to leave work early. I'll take whatever hours I can get. But what really gets me is that she didn't even try to hide her anger. She walked right past me into the living room, like I wasn't there. And then she started cooking dinner herself! What the fuck?! Doesn't she know how much I love her? Does she think I don't appreciate all the little things she does for me? I remember when we first met, she told me she hated waiting around for me to come home. She said she had more fun doing stuff with friends than waiting for me. Now it feels like she's ditched me for them. This is exactly what happens every time I miss a dinner plan. She doesn't care"

Every day was a reminder of what he’d lost—the love they shared, the laughter, and the warmth of her presence. It wasn’t just a memory; it was a living ache that cut deeper than any physical pain. She saw how hard he worked, how much he missed her, yet how little he got back. It was as if the world had turned its attention away from him, leaving him to drown in his sorrow. He looked up, his gaze drifting towards the window, where sunlight struggled to penetrate the gray clouds. It was as if he was searching for something—a glimmer of hope, perhaps? Or maybe just a way to escape the emptiness that had become his home. For a moment, she wondered if he ever stopped to think about how his story might look from someone else’s perspective. Would they see him as broken, a man struggling to find his footing again? Maybe they would feel sorry for him, or worse, think he deserved what happened.
