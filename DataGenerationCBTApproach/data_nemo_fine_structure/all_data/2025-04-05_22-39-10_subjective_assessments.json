He needs to learn how to keep track of his belongings and clean regularly. If he does, maybe things will improve, but he might still have problems in the future. He will never be able to trust his own judgment anymore. He has lost all faith in his ability to maintain order. It’s impossible for him to regain control over his life.

Yet, even that can't hold back the tears. I keep thinking about all those moments we shared, how she used to make me laugh until my sides hurt, and how our love was strong enough to overcome anything. But what if I'm wrong? What if she never truly loved me? Maybe she just wanted to be with someone else, someone who could give her more than I could. I know she was always ambitious, chasing success, but maybe she had other plans too. Maybe she found someone who could provide her with everything she needed. The thought cuts deep, and every time I look at this picture, I wonder if she’s really gone. If she ever thinks about me, does she feel guilty for leaving? I wish I could turn back time, make things right between us. But life doesn’t work that way. Now, I’m left with nothing but these memories and the faint hope that someday she’ll come back to me.

There were so many things that stood out to him - the fact that his ex-wife was now married, the new title she held, the way her name seemed to glow in comparison. It all felt so... wrong. In that moment, he couldn't help but think about how this was a reminder of what he had lost. How could someone else move on so easily? Didn't they know that this was a painful time for him? As he continued to read, however, other parts of the letter began to fade into the background. He became increasingly preoccupied with the idea that he would be attending the ceremony alone. Why bother showing up when no one really cared? He started to feel resentful toward the couple, wondering why they chose to celebrate such a joyous occasion without including him.
