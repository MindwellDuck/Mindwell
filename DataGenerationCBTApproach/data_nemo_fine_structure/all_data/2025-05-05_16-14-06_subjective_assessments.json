Why else would she be smiling with someone else? Doesn’t anyone know that I have feelings too? She knew exactly what she was doing. She didn’t care about me; she just used me for her amusement. And now I can see it clearly—I was nothing more than an object, something to make her laugh. That look between them—that smirk—it was all a plan to get under my skin. She was pretending to be friendly, but deep down, she hated me. Why does everyone always treat me like this? Can’t they see that I’m sensitive, that my emotions are real? Does no one understand how hard it is to deal with rejection and jealousy? Every time someone smiles with someone else, it feels like a knife to my heart. But I keep going, because I refuse to let her win. I won’t let her think she has control over me. This isn’t just about one incident; it’s about everything. Everyone who smiles with someone else makes me feel inferior. They think they’re above me, that I don’t matter. But I will show them—they"

That book was my grandmother's she gave it to me before she passed away because she knew I would love it just like her. And then you go and take it out of respect? Respect?! You think tearing pages from that book is respectful? That's not respect that's disrespect. You know what really makes my blood boil though? It wasn't even an accident. You were fucking aware that you were holding that book wrong. You could see it was old and fragile, and you still went ahead and ripped those pages out. You didn't even try to hold it gently or carefully; you just tore through it like you owned the place. Do you know how many times I've held books like that? How many people have handled them with such care over the years? Every single time someone has picked up that book, they've treated it with reverence. Not you though - you treated it like shit. And when I saw you, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. There was a part of me that wanted to reach out and stop you right there, to tell you to put the book back and never touch it again.

After all, we are public people, and our personal lives shouldn't be anyone else's business. But still, why would he choose to bring up such a sensitive topic? Doesn't he care about how it might affect us? I've been thinking about how this could impact my work, and even though I'm prepared for some backlash, I can't help but wonder if there will be more of these incidents. Will he keep doing it? If so, am I ready for whatever comes next? This whole situation has left me feeling uneasy, but I'm determined to stay calm and focus on my job. I won't let him dictate my mood or actions.

And to think I was supposed to start this course today, like nothing out of the ordinary ever happens to me. But now...now everything feels like it’s falling apart. I can’t focus on anything except this. Every time I try to look at the slides, I end up thinking about how much worse things could get. What if I trip and fall while walking to the podium? Or what if the projector starts malfunctioning again? I swear, my heart is going to explode from anxiety. It’s ridiculous. I’m not even supposed to be teaching today; someone else has taken over. Why did this have to happen when I need it most? I should have known better than to let something like this slip through. But why does it keep coming back to the same thing?

How could anyone else fill this space? The chair feels empty without him in it, but seeing him just sitting there, lost in thought, makes me feel like an idiot for mourning so much. I'm supposed to be grateful for every moment we shared, aren't I? But can't I see that he's still here, right in front of me? Does he really think he can make me forget everything? It's just so... frustrating. He didn't even tell me when he died; he just left his book open, as if waiting for me to notice.

And what if I don't get an invitation to see them up close? Or maybe they're not showing my painting because it doesn't fit in with the theme? I feel so stupid, comparing my artwork to those incredible paintings. I'm probably just jealous, aren't I? I guess I have no business feeling proud.

She'd promised to keep things under control tonight; now, it seemed like another one of her late-night binges had slipped past her defenses. As if the night's events weren't bad enough, he couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment mixed with anger. Why did she have to let her guard down? Why did she allow herself to slip into such behavior? She'd been so careful, so responsible, in the past. It felt like a betrayal, as if she'd abandoned all her self-control.

This isn't real; she's just faking tears to manipulate everyone into giving her things. Her behavior is proof that she's someone who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, even if it means hurting others. This is exactly why we can't trust her. She might seem nice at first, but deep down, she's a fake, and her actions reveal that she's not capable of genuine emotions. Her reaction to everything is just another tactic to control those around her. It's not surprising she's crying over something stupid when you consider how easily she manipulates others.
