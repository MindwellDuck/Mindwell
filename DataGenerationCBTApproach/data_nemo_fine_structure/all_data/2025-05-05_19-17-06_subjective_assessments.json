It seemed like every year, someone accused another teacher of playing favorites. She remembered one instance where a parent had criticized Mrs. S., another teacher, saying that Mrs. S. was more lenient with her son than with others in the same class. Mrs. H. recalled how frustrated she had been with this accusation. \"That's not true,\" she said to herself. \"I treat all my students equally.\" But now, reading the email again, she wondered if maybe Mrs. S. was right. Mrs. H. decided to talk to Mrs. S. and ask if she had ever been treated unfairly. She invited Mrs. S. to meet during lunch and asked, \"Do you think we're both being treated fairly?\" Mrs. S. looked taken aback but nodded and agreed to discuss it further. The two teachers sat down, and Mrs. S. shared some examples of instances where she felt teachers were biased toward certain students. Mrs. H. listened attentively, feeling a mix of emotions. Part of her wanted to argue against these claims, but another part of her wondered if there might be truth to them. As they talked, Mrs. H. realized that her initial reaction had been defensive. She"

Every time I see them enjoying themselves, I get this weird feeling inside me—like sadness mixed with anger. Like, why are they doing all this while I’m still struggling? Why did everything have to shift like this? It really hurts seeing these young people making such great content together. They’re just so carefree, which makes me even more bitter. I know I used to be like that too, but now...now it just feels like I’ve lost touch with what it means to live life fully. I remember how I would write articles about things that mattered, but now it just seems like no one cares anymore. I hate myself for being jealous of something that doesn’t belong to me. Maybe if I’d been younger, I could have fit into this new dynamic better. But I wasn’t meant for this place. I was always supposed to be behind the scenes, working quietly, and letting others shine. Now look where I am—a middle-aged man stuck in a job that doesn’t fulfill him. Every day feels like a reminder of what I’m missing out on. I keep thinking back to when I first joined, hoping things would change. But every smile from colleagues just reminds me of what I lack. Even my own daughter"

A bitter taste filled her mouth, not just from the stale coffee.

Maybe something that would've been perceived differently by someone else, or perhaps something that, if taken the wrong way, could have led to serious consequences. My mind started racing, thinking of all the ways he might have approached the situation differently. If he'd chosen a different tone or phrasing, would it have made a difference? But then again, what if he hadn't? What if he'd kept it the same, and we were still dealing with whatever issues arose? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I wondered what would happen next. Would our relationship suffer because of it? Or maybe, just maybe, it wouldn't. After all, what if nothing changed? Would anyone notice? Would anyone care? It seemed impossible to predict the outcome, especially since I couldn't control these thoughts anymore. They just came, one after another, each leading me further down a path of worry and fear. And yet, despite knowing I shouldn't let them consume me, they continued, fueled by my own doubts and fears. I realized then that I needed to stop letting these thoughts control me"

The implication that I'm always dressed inadequately is unfounded and unjustified. This behavior may be an isolated incident, but it reinforces the notion that certain individuals are never respectful or considerate. This conclusion has led me to question whether such people truly exist, making me wonder if they have the capacity for empathy. Their actions suggest otherwise, implying a lack of self-awareness and a tendency to prioritize their own interests over others' feelings. In light of this experience, I find myself questioning whether those who display such behavior are genuinely incapable of change or simply unwilling to adapt. It's possible they've grown accustomed to their way of thinking, refusing to acknowledge their mistakes or learn from them.
