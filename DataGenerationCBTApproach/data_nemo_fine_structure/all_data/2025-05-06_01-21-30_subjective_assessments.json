She needed someone who could provide stability, someone who wouldn’t hurt her. And yet, here she was, leaving him for a man who treated women worse than animals. It seemed fitting; after all, she was nothing more than a trophy to him, a prize to be won. As he sat there, surrounded by memories, he realized that he had lost everything that truly mattered. The life he thought he wanted was slipping away, and no one was going to stop it. Even if he tried, he’d only end up hurting himself further. Why bother trying when everyone around him was against me? Why try anything at all? Maybe it was better this way. Maybe losing her meant I never really had her in the first place. Maybe I was never worthy enough to keep her. If she left, maybe it was for a reason, something he couldn’t understand. Or perhaps it was simply because she grew tired of waiting.
