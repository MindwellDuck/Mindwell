What if it breaks down completely? Or what if it explodes?! Or what if it starts leaking water everywhere?! I just can't shake these thoughts off my head. I've been thinking about all the ways it could go wrong—what if it causes more problems than we expect, what if we have to replace it again soon, or what if it doesn't work at all? The possibilities are endless, and they're all terrifying! I feel so anxious, worrying about every single outcome. Even when I try to tell myself that these thoughts aren’t real, I still can’t stop them from popping into my head. It’s like my brain is constantly wondering what might happen next. Sometimes I imagine scenarios where everything goes wrong and we have to deal with the consequences. I guess I’m just really scared about this dishwasher right now. It feels like no matter what I do, my mind keeps coming up with worst-case scenarios. I’ve tried telling myself that these thoughts aren’t based in reality, but I can’t help feeling like there’s always a chance that something bad will happen. And honestly, it’s making me so upset.

Now they'll start thinking she's some kind of philanthropist too. Fuck, I wish she'd just tell me straight out next time. We don't need to make a big deal out of every little thing.

Why does it feel like every time I see him, there's always some kind of “message” waiting for me? Is he really trying to tell me something through these letters, or is it just my imagination running wild again? I remember how much we used to talk about our dreams and aspirations, but things changed over time, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was still thinking about me too. He never told me directly, but I can’t shake off the feeling that he might have been sending me these little reminders. Or maybe I'm just reading into them because I want to believe that somehow, someway, we could reconnect. But deep down, isn’t it possible that none of this matters? That he’s probably just being polite out of obligation, and that’s all? That he’s moved on and doesn’t even think about me anymore?
