Maybe if I pretend to learn something quickly, he'll stop laughing and think I'm actually smart. But honestly, why would I bother learning something new when I already have all the answers I need? I mean, at my age, I shouldn't have to keep catching up anyway. It's not fair that he gets to teach us something we probably already know. Why does he think I'd forget everything I learned years ago? I bet if I stood up and answered correctly, he wouldn't laugh at me anymore. But then I'd just look dumb for pretending to be smart. Ugh, this is so frustrating.
