It doesn't matter how many times I've tried to connect with others; people never seem to care. They all want something from me, whether it's money, favors, or attention. And when they don't get what they want, they'll just laugh at me. That's why I avoid social gatherings altogether. It’s pointless to try and make friends when everyone is out to take advantage of you anyway. So, whenever I hear laughter, I assume it means someone else has found success in life while I'm stuck here alone. I can’t help but feel like I’m missing out on everything by staying away from such events. It’s frustrating to think that every joyful moment I miss is proof that I’ll never be accepted or loved. Why bother trying anymore? Every time I see happy couples holding hands, I know there are plenty more waiting to replace me. And since I always stay at home, I might as well prepare myself for the inevitable loneliness. It's exhausting to keep pretending that things will change someday, even though deep down I know nothing will ever change. It feels like no one cares about me, so why bother making an effort? Even if I did go out, I’d likely face rejection again. There's always some new guy who catches her eye, and she moves on. No one stays committed to anyone for long."

They don’t see the countless hours I spent researching, rewriting, and editing—hours that could have been better spent relaxing with my family. They don’t care that I had to take time off work just to get everything right. All they care about is that one tiny detail they found wrong. Meanwhile, I’m sitting here, staring at this rejection letter, wondering if it was even worth the struggle. Why bother submitting again when it’ll probably end up the same? And then there’s the irony—it’s all happening while my wife is cooking dinner down stairs. She has no idea about this whole ordeal, but she knows that I’m stressed because we were supposed to spend tonight together. We were looking forward to it too!

He sees the world differently than she does, and she wants to erase that difference. She wants to make him feel small, powerless against her. Her behavior is like a ticking time bomb. It may seem harmless now, but soon it will explode. I have seen how quickly this type of manipulation can lead to disaster. People who think they can control others often become trapped in their own delusions. They lose sight of reality, and their actions become more aggressive. This woman thinks she is clever, but she is actually blind. She believes she can change people, but she is the one who needs changing. She is a pawn in her own game, and soon she will realize it.
