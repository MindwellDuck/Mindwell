But then I think about how I left my phone back at work. If anything happens, I'll be unreachable. Panic sets in, and I quickly scan my surroundings. That's when I see him—a guy standing across the street, watching us. He looks like he could be trouble."

Her face lights up when she sees her kid's latest photo. It’s almost too much for me. How does she keep going with such positivity? Does she not feel the same emptiness I do? Does she really think everything will be okay after this? I’m starting to wonder if she’s just pretending to be happy, but she doesn’t want anyone to notice. Maybe she’s just as lost as I am, but she wouldn’t dare admit it because then she’d look weak. Every time I see another couple celebrating their first grandchild, I feel like I’ve failed somehow. Did they choose each other over me? Do they understand why I couldn’t give them kids? Is it because I wasn’t good enough, or was it always meant to be this way? If only I had more self-control, maybe I would’ve kept my son. But no, he had to"

She doesn't want me, she says she does, but I can tell by how she acts around other people she doesn't. It's like she's trying to show everyone else what a perfect couple they are while keeping me at arm's length. They say she doesn't care about me, but I can feel her guilt. She knows she shouldn't leave me but can't stop herself. She thinks she can get away from me by moving on to someone else. But she can't. She has to come back to me. She can't avoid me forever. If I don't talk to her soon, she'll forget about me. And when she does, she'll move on to another guy who will love her more than I ever could. So why am I wasting my time?

These emotions are characteristic of a negative, critical mindset. 2. **Content Focus**: The speaker emphasizes potential problems and challenges associated with the situation, highlighting concerns like being \"alone,\" feeling \"useless,\" and worrying about the consequences of allowing a teenager to become pregnant. This focus on difficulties creates a narrative that paints the situation in a negative light, reinforcing a sense of distress and"

He doesn't care that he's disturbing people who are trying to work or study. He's just letting loose, like he owns the place! What a selfish little brat.
