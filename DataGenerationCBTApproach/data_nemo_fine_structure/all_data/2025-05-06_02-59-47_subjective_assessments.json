Their gentle smiles and entwined hands sent a pang through his heart. It had been three months since Jane's passing, but every tender moment he witnessed still felt like a knife twisting in his gut. He turned away, his coffee untouched, retreat ing to the solitude of his office where her picture remained, as always, facing him on his desk.",

The memory of Jane is everywhere, and it hurts so much that he can't enjoy anything anymore. Every time he walks by someone holding hands, he feels like he's going to break down. I guess he really misses her, but now he can't stand being around people who are happy together. Why does everyone get to be happy when he can't? He can't handle seeing couples smiling at each other. They're just making things worse for him. He doesn't need this kind of pain. Maybe if he stays locked up in his room forever, he'll forget about her and move on. But no, memories keep coming back, and now he's stuck reliving them over and over again. His whole life has turned into nothing but sadness, and he can't escape it. It's all because of Jane; everything reminds him of her. She was perfect, and he can never be perfect like her. Even the thought of living another day makes him want to cry. Why is it so hard for him to let go? Maybe he needs therapy or something. But what would it help him? Nothing will ever make him feel better. Life is just too cruel."

Divorce had taken its toll, and the emptiness of his apartment was a constant ache. Tonight, he stood in front of his stove, stirring a pot of his signature tomato soup. As he lifted the spoon to taste, it slipped from his grip, clattering into the pot. He watched it sink, feeling an overwhelming sense of despair as if the spoon were a metaphor for everything he'd once held tightly but had since slipped away.",

Imagine holding someone close who cares about you. The warmth spreads through your body, calming your mind and soothing your heart. That's what I need right now. Can we grab some blankets? Let's make a game out of this. If we count together, you might feel better. Let’s start with one. Then, two, three... You’re doing great! Just keep going. We’ll reach ten before you even notice. How does it feel to move your legs fast? You're getting stronger! You know what's funny? You're almost there! One more number. Now, four, five, six, seven... I think you did it! You have a lot of energy. Maybe you could play some music while we chat. What kind of songs do you like? I love listening to you talk about them! I hope you enjoyed our little exercise. You didn't realize how much you needed those hugs and conversations until now. Remember, sometimes all it takes is a friendly ear to lift your spirits. Keep smiling and stay positive!

Yet here I am, heading straight for it. Can’t avoid it forever. But why do I have to relive all those memories? They never leave me alone. I hate myself for being so weak.

What if something happens while I’m there? I feel like I’ll never catch up on everything anyway. And what if I fall asleep during surgery? That’s not even possible. The thought makes me sick. Do they think I'm just going to magically wake up? How dare they expect this of me. I hate when they do this. It’s always so unfair. I hope my husband sees how unfair this is. He'll know what to say to them. Maybe they’re just trying to prove a point or something. I don’t want to deal with this shit anymore. If they really needed me, they wouldn’t schedule anything today.

It’s hard not to think about how much harder things are now, especially when faced with rejection. The truth is, we all feel this way when our ideas aren’t met with the enthusiasm we hoped for. Perhaps it's just the natural process of growth, where we're forced to confront our own limitations and weaknesses. It could be that we're not ready for this level of responsibility yet, or maybe we need more time to develop our skills. Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: this rejection is a reminder that we must continue working towards our goals. We can't let setbacks hold us back; instead, we should see them as opportunities to learn and improve.
