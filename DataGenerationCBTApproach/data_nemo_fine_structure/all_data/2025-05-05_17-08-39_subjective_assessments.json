Of course, I am upset. What kind of sick bitch would I not be upset about something like this? You're always pushing me into situations where I feel like shit. That's why I'm upset, and you're just trying to blame me for your own problems. You're such a coward. If you really cared, you'd be here with me instead of making excuses. Instead of saying \"We need some space\" and then disappearing. That's not love; that's manipulation. You're just using me for whatever you want, and I'm not going to let you get away with it.

Why does she still act like she didn't know? This isn't just about me leaving; it's about us growing apart. She never understood how much I wanted to move forward with my life, but now she's upset because I'm finally taking action. I don't get why she's acting like this. We've discussed everything already—she knew I was thinking about moving. There's no reason for her to be this upset. I feel like she's just making this harder than it needs to be.

Meanwhile, mine is constantly plagued by overcooking, underseasoning, and burnt offerings. At least I know what it's like to cook alone, but you get to enjoy the luxury of having others around to help with the workload. You don't have to worry about the cost of ingredients or whether you'll run out of time to finish everything. Every step I take feels like a gamble, every decision made is second-guessed. How would you even begin to describe what it's like to work in a kitchen with such limited resources? I can barely manage to make simple meals without feeling overwhelmed. In contrast, you probably have an entire team at your disposal, allowing you to focus on more complex dishes. When I think about it, I feel incredibly inadequate, knowing that there's so much more I need to learn before I can even hope to match your level of culinary expertise.

His mind wandered to all the moments they shared here, from lazy mornings spent sipping coffee to late-night conversations about dreams and aspirations. He remembered the way the sunlight danced through the trees when they strolled hand-in-hand, the sound of birds chirping softly, and the smell of freshly baked croissants wafting from the nearby bakery. Even now, after her passing, those memories still lingered, refusing to let go. Her smile, her laughter, her quiet strength - it all came rushing back, making his chest ache. It was more than just a beautiful view; it was a reminder of what could never be again. And yet, he felt compelled to express some semblance of grief, if only for himself.
