I swear, every time they get into an argument, I have to sit there and calm them down. They just can't handle the truth. And then, when things blow up, they act like I'm the one who caused it. \"He started it!\" Oh yeah, because nothing says \"good cop\" like blaming your own partner. You'd think after years of training, they'd learn to communicate better. But no, instead, they keep throwing it back at me. Like I'm some kind of monster. Newsflash: I'm tired of being the one who fixes everything. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of bad joke. Every time we go on a call, I'm the one who has to stay calm while they freak out.

Every day feels like a struggle. I wake up early, go to work, come back, and try to keep busy with chores and hobbies. But all these things feel pointless because I miss her so much. I've tried talking to friends, but no one really understands how I feel. They say things like \"It's over,\" \"You'll get over it,\" or \"She needs time.\" But does anyone truly understand? When I opened the cupboard yesterday, I found her favorite mug gone again. I couldn't help but feel angry, even though deep down I knew it wouldn't solve anything. I thought maybe she'd forgotten it or lost it somehow, but when I asked our neighbors if they saw her take it, they said they hadn't seen her. So, I'm left wondering if she actually took it herself – or if someone else did it for her. Maybe she's just avoiding me, and I'm reading too much into it? Maybe she doesn't want to talk to me yet?

What happened to the man who used to make everyone laugh? Who would have imagined that he'd leave us like this? He was always there to brighten our days, and now...now he's gone. I keep thinking about what could've been if he had lived longer. Maybe things wouldn't be so bad. But no, fate had other plans. And now I'm stuck here, alone, dealing with the pain.

Dr. A's racing thoughts didn't stop there. She began to wonder if she should call emergency services. But then she rationalized that maybe she shouldn't bother, thinking that the paramedics might take a long time to arrive, which could make things worse. So, she decided not to dial the number. Instead, she stood frozen, watching over the unconscious man, trying to decide what to do next. She couldn't bring herself to move him, fearing that touching him could cause more harm.
