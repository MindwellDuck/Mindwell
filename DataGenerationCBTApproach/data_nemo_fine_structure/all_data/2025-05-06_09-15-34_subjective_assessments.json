This is what happens when I watch others enjoy life. They laugh, smile, and seem carefree, while I’m stuck here alone. Even seeing them together makes me feel lonely again. Why can’t they be happy like that? Why does it always have to be this way for me? But then I think about my own life. My husband was gone too long ago, and now I'm just...left. Alone. No warmth, no laughter. Just emptiness. This reminds me of times past, memories of him being there, holding my hand, smiling at me. He wasn’t like that coworker. He didn’t look at me that way. What if he still did? What if he came back today? Would things change? Would I be happy again? Or would I just miss him more? The thought hits hard. I try to shake it off, thinking about other things, but it lingers. I keep wondering why these moments happen. Why am I so alone? It’s all just reminders of my loneliness.

The fact that it was his partner's coffee that was used (the one who actually washed it) doesn't change anything. They're clearly fighting over something stupid, but I know it's about me. This is so typical of him; he always tries to make everything personal. But honestly, he needs to chill out sometimes. We have enough problems already. Why can’t he see that I’m trying really hard here? This is such an easy mistake to make, especially since we were both busy working late last night. And besides, we’ve been together for 20 years – isn’t it time he could handle some small stuff like this? He knows exactly what he did there, and he’s probably still fuming about it. I don’t think he’ll ever admit it, but I know he was secretly watching us and thought we were arguing about it. That’s why he decided to leave the note. He has no respect for me whatsoever. I guess it’s just another case where he assumes I didn’t wash it because he thinks I hate him. Like, come on! If I wanted to hurt him, wouldn’t I have done more damage than just leaving a dirty cup?

The least she could do is take care of my stuff. But noooo, she just goes ahead and uses my favorite mug to leave a big ol' red mark on it. I swear, she must be trying to make me hate her. This whole thing is just too much. And honestly, I think she is being a bit rude and selfish by doing this. She knows how much I love that mug, and then she just goes ahead and leaves a stain on it. What kind of fucked up person does something like that? You know, if I were her, I wouldn't have done this either. I'd want someone else to handle my things, especially when they're my favorite. So, yeah, I think she's pretty shitty for this. If she really cared about our relationship, she'd have washed the mug before using it.
