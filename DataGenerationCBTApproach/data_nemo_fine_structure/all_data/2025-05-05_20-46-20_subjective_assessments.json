How can you be so caught up in the past? This isn't about him; it's about us. You're holding everyone back with your refusal to let go. You're making it impossible for us to heal.

Maybe he's lucky or something. Anyway, I wish he wouldn't make me feel so bad for being a perfectionist like this. I swear, if I let my guard down and was more open to criticism, maybe I could learn from him and become a true artist. He's definitely got some great qualities that I admire, though. For instance, he must be very brave to stand up for himself like that. That takes a lot of guts. And his determination to fix the canvas is inspiring. Even though it looks like he might break it further, I still think he has potential. I guess we all need a little bit of luck sometimes. But seriously, I hope he keeps pushing forward and"
