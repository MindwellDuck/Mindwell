I wouldn't even know how to start one like that, I don't think anyone could. I guess you can tell that she's really mad at me and everyone else for what happened, maybe because she thinks we were all laughing at her or something. It makes sense though - we did make her feel uncomfortable and she was already upset before we came in today. So yeah, I'm definitely going to speak up and defend myself when we see her again tomorrow. I mean, I shouldn't have to apologize for everything, right? We should be able to practice medicine as usual, without having to worry about getting into trouble over minor things. But I guess I'll just have to deal with it if I want to keep working here. It doesn't seem fair that she gets to write whatever she wants, especially since she hasn't even met us yet. What does she know about our situation? Maybe she'd be nice too if she saw us once. Anyway, I'm just going to try to stay calm and focus on taking good care of my patients instead of worrying about her stupid letter. Oh well, I guess"

Every moment was tainted by the memory of him; it felt like time itself was against her, moving at an impossible pace. She couldn’t help but wonder if this was what others experienced when they lost someone close, if the grief became so overwhelming that it warped reality. In the silence of her home, every creak echoed through her mind, reminding her of his presence. It wasn’t just the sounds; even the light falling across certain spaces brought forth vivid images of how he would have seen it—how he would have smiled, laughed, or simply been there. But he wasn’t anymore, leaving behind only these haunting reminders. Even the smallest things—the way sunlight danced on dust, the sound of rain outside—were infused with the weight of his absence. It was as if the world had turned into a canvas painted with memories of him, each brushstroke a painful reminder of all that was lost. She felt lost in this sea of grief, unable to find solace or escape from the pain that lingered around every corner. Her days blended together, each one indistinguishable from the last, filled with tears and longing. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was drowning in her own heartache, that nothing could ever be the same again. And yet, she clung to hope, holding onto the thought that somehow, someway"

And before that, there were times where he didn't show up at all. Like that one day when he cancelled on us last-minute because his wife wasn't feeling well. What if he just decided to stop coming? It feels like every single time I serve him, something goes wrong. First, it was the soup being too spicy (and yeah, maybe I made it hotter than usual), and then it was the bread getting burnt. The next time, he complained about the sauce being too thick. I mean, come on! You can't expect everything to be perfect all the time, especially considering how picky he is. This isn't the first time I've felt like throwing in the towel. Remember that time when I accidentally added too much salt to his order, and he ended up spilling half of it down his shirt?

They’re just minor setbacks compared to how much work he puts into his research. Maybe he's just stressed, but honestly, he’s always been like this. What really gets me is that everyone else seems oblivious to what's happening. Everyone else is so calm and collected. Even when he destroyed the lab equipment, no one even flinched.

The clock's digital display seemed to mock him, its red glow casting eerie shadows around his empty bedroom.

He knew deep down that this was all in his head, but the fear lingered, making it hard to breathe. He tried to push it aside, but it clung to him like a shadow, refusing to let go. This was more than just loneliness; it was about the unknown—about the life he thought he’d have with her. Now, instead of comfort, he felt desperation. He couldn’t shake the feeling that things were falling apart, that something inside him was breaking. But how could he explain these feelings when they didn’t make sense? They weren’t rational, yet they felt real, like a weight pressing down on him. He thought back to their last fight, the words that still echoed in his mind. “You’re not thinking of me.” She’d said that, her voice laced with pain, and he couldn’t blame her. He knew he hadn’t considered everything, hadn’t listened enough. He remembered the night we’d spent together, just the two of us, watching the stars through the skylight.

That our friendship means nothing compared to his \"true\" passion—his art. I feel like I'm drowning in his despair, trying to hold back a wave of frustration every time we talk. When we met, I thought he was different. He spoke about dreams and passions, things that excited him. But now, I wonder if it was all just an act. Maybe he’s using me to fill the void left by his failed career. I’ve seen glimpses of his real self—a sharp tongue and a quick wit—but they’re drowned out by his constant complaints. I remember when he first started showing his work, full of hope and enthusiasm. He talked about wanting to inspire people,"
