The kitchen, once their sanctuary, now echoed with silence. A newspaper clipping fluttered from the counter, an article on the young up-and-coming chef who had replaced him at his old restaurant. She felt a surge of hatred, not just for this stranger, but for the life that moved on without her beloved husband by her side. The dough grew harder under her fingers as she read, \"He's got quite the future ahead of him.\" Her breath hitched, \"Not like you,\" she whispered to the empty room, her eyes welling with bitter tears.",

He'd been gone three weeks now, but it felt like yesterday he was standing beside her, guiding her through the intricacies of cooking. Yet, here she was, trying to prepare his favorite dish for the first time without him. It wasn't easy; every step felt forced, every movement clumsy. She couldn't shake off the feeling that everything was falling apart, that she'd never be able to put together what was supposed to be a beautiful meal. It wasn't just the cooking that seemed impossible; her entire world had crumbled around her. He was more than just a partner; he was my best friend. We shared so much—our dreams, our laughter, our late-night conversations about life and love. Now, all I could think about was how quickly things were changing. Life went on without him, and I felt left behind. Every day, I struggled to find meaning in anything except the pain of losing him. Even the simplest tasks seemed daunting, and the thought of starting over without him made me feel like I was drowning in a sea of grief. It wasn't just the food; it was everything. Everything felt broken. As I stood there, frozen in sadness, I realized that we weren’t always meant to be happy. Maybe he wasn't meant for me, maybe he was never mine to begin with. That realization hit me like a ton of bricks, leaving me"

I expect you to get back on track immediately.” She also mentioned that there were issues with the project timeline, which made things even worse. The fact that he’d missed several important meetings and had failed to meet deadlines meant he was in serious trouble. There was no room for error; if he didn’t shape up, he would be fired. This whole situation was making him extremely upset. When he received the message, he felt a surge of anger towards himself. How could someone like him fail so badly? Didn’t he know how much this job meant to him? It was all starting to feel very unfair. This wasn't just about missing deadlines; it was about being seen as a failure. That realization fueled his rage. In his mind, everything was falling apart. He couldn’t see anything positive happening right now, and he was convinced that things would continue to go downhill. All he could think about was the stress and pressure he was under. Being constantly reminded of these problems was eating away at him, causing him immense frustration.

I can't help but wonder if he's trying to make me jealous—like, \"Oh, look at me, happy and loved?\" But what about all the other times when no one tags him? Does that mean he's not worth remembering? He knows how I feel, so why does he keep doing it? Is he just trying to prove that he's not forgotten? That he's still relevant? I can understand why someone would want to relive those moments, but for me, it just feels like he’s rubbing it in. Maybe it’s because I see the emptiness in his eyes now, the way he sits alone in his studio, surrounded by half-finished projects. Every post like this just reminds me that we’re growing apart, that life has moved on without us. Even if he thinks it’s harmless, it makes me uncomfortable, like he's reminding me of everything I've lost. Why does he have to share these things? Can't he just leave me out of it?
