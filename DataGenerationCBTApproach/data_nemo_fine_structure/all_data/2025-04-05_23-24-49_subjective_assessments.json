She's been working here for decades, knows every inch of this place like the back of her weathered hands. Today, though, it feels different. Less welcoming.\n\nShe starts her shift, greeting regular customers with a practiced smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. A young woman, barely out of her teens, rushes past her, arms laden with shopping bags. She pauses, watching the girl's laughter echo through the mall. It's been years since she laughed like that, freely and without worry.\n\nHer gaze drifts to the empty space beside the escalator where a Christmas tree used to stand tall each year. They've taken it down permanently now, another sign of change she can't ignore. She feels a familiar melancholy wash over her as she remembers her late husband helping her decorate it every December. This time of year was always their favorite.\n\nShe sighs, straightening her name tag absently before turning back to her duties. The mall is quieter today, the usual hum of chatter replaced by an unsettling silence. She can't shake off the feeling that something fundamental has changed, leaving her adrift in a world that's moving on without her.",

It's like everyone else is avoiding me, but they're not. No one's talking to me, and when someone does, it's brief. I'm starting to think people are trying to tell me something, but what? Maybe it's just my imagination playing tricks on me again. I remember how things were last year, bustling with activity. But this year feels... different. Everyone looks younger than they actually are; maybe it's just because I'm getting older myself. My mind starts racing with possibilities—maybe it's because they're not used to seeing me here anymore. That could be why it feels so odd. Or maybe I'm just projecting my own loneliness onto them. I keep thinking about the Christmas tree, which isn't there anymore. My husband would love it if he was still here. He'd probably say I'm reading too much into it. But I feel like I'm missing something important. Is it just my memory playing tricks on me? I glance around the store, noticing how empty it is compared to previous years. People seem more interested in their phones than chatting with each other. Even the usual background music sounds off. It's like everything is just... waiting for something to happen. I'm starting to wonder if I’m the only one who notices. I try to focus on my work,"

Why did she leave? What could have kept her here? Would she have changed if she'd stayed?

I feel so angry and betrayed, as if she had punched me in the gut. My entire day has been ruined because of this stupid note. This isn't over yet. I know there are more notes out there. I'll have to search every inch of her backpack. I won't rest until I find them all. Once I do, I'll confront her, make sure she knows that I won't tolerate this kind of behavior from anyone.
