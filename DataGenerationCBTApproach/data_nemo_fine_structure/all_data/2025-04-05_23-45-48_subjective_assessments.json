This is insane, but it’s what happens when you’re overwhelmed by your emotions, especially when dealing with something like this. I know I need to calm down, but it’s hard to control these feelings when you’re already stressed out. Now I have another thing to worry about? I can barely think straight because of how intense everything feels. If only I could turn off my mind right now… but no, it keeps racing. I wish I didn’t feel so much pressure. I am really worried about what will happen next. This situation is making me feel sick. My stomach hurts, and I can’t focus. Everything feels so chaotic, and I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong. I just want it to stop. I’m scared, and I can’t process anything else except for how bad I feel. I hope this passes soon, but right now, it doesn’t seem possible. I really need to relax, but my mind won’t let me. I can’t shake off this feeling of panic and anxiety"

I wish I wasn't this way, but honestly, what is wrong with me? Everyone else has a big happy family, and here I am, alone again. I remember when little Timmy asked me why I didn't have kids, he seemed so curious. He thought I would tell him some amazing story. But instead, I felt so ashamed, I couldn't even explain why. Now every time I look at that drawing, it just reminds me of my own emptiness. Why can't I have kids? I really want them, but it feels impossible now. I don’t understand why life isn't treating me fairly. I’m trying so hard, but still, I keep feeling like there’s something fundamentally wrong with me. I try to push these thoughts away, but they linger, making me feel like a burden to everyone around me. I'm not good enough, and I never will be. Even after years of teaching, I still can't get over this feeling. Maybe someday things will change, but until then, I'll continue to struggle, trapped in my sadness.

You can see how much effort went into making it look nice, and then someone comes along and knocks it down without even looking back. It’s hard not to think that these people are going to end up doing worse things if they’re already capable of being so careless. Maybe they’ll start vandalizing buildings, or maybe they’ll hurt someone else in some way. I’m not saying that every time you see something like this, you’ll immediately think about how bad these kids might become, but sometimes you can’t help but feel like they're missing out on all the good things life could bring if they continue to live like this.
