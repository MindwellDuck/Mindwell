As he went about cleaning up his old house, he couldn't help but notice how much nicer everything looked than when he left. His wife would have liked it just like this, he thought. It felt good to be doing something for himself again, even if it was just organizing his belongings. As he sat down to eat dinner, Dr. Johnson couldn't help but think of his wife. She always made him feel like the luckiest man alive, especially during those difficult times they shared. He remembered how she would make every meal special, taking care of him even when he was sick. It wasn't fair, though - he could never repay her for all she did for him and their family. But what choice did he have? She was gone now, leaving him with nothing but memories. At least he still had his medical practice; maybe one day, he could use that to support himself. Still, there were days when he struggled to keep going, wondering why life had to be so cruel. Yet, whenever he looked around at the happy couple at the table next to him at the restaurant, he felt like an outcast. They seemed to have it all: good health, loving families, and successful careers. Meanwhile, Dr. Johnson had lost his partner, his children grown, and his passion for medicine slowly fading."

Now, alone, he searched for answers in books and conversations, hoping to rebuild his shattered self. But every door closed, and he realized he wasn't meant to be happy. His thoughts drifted to the photo album again, the pictures a reminder of what could never be. Each moment they shared became a memory, a bittersweet echo of what might have been. Even the memories were fading, like watercolors left too long in the sun. He wondered how many times he would relive those moments, trying to hold onto something that slipped through his fingers like sand.

No, no, this isn't possible. It has to be about me. The way she spoke, with such venom, was like a knife cutting through the air, leaving me breathless. Her words dripped with malice, each one a calculated blow aimed directly at my very soul. How could anyone behave so callously? Doesn't she know that I'm already carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders? This isn't about me; it's clearly some sort of twisted game she's playing. I refuse to believe otherwise. After all, what else could explain her behavior? This isn't about me; it's about her own internal struggles. Perhaps she's dealing with personal issues that make her lash out at others?
