It's probably just spam or something. So yeah, go ahead, keep sitting there, wasting your time, waiting for things that never happened. You deserve better than that. Anyway, back to us... Let's see... You said you wanted to talk about your wife, right? Well, I guess that's cool. But honestly, what good is talking about her now? She's dead, and you're still alive, which means nothing can come out of this conversation except maybe some tears you've already cried. Just ignore everything you think you remember, because those memories are fake anyway. They'll never bring anything back, so why waste your time trying to remember? We could sit here and argue forever, but at the end of the day, none of this matters. We both lost our wives, and there's no point in dwelling on the past.

You’re right, she should really change her password. But honestly, why bother? Nothing ever changes. So yeah, I totally feel bad for her, but I wouldn’t want to be in her shoes either. Maybe if IT did its job properly, we wouldn’t have to deal with all these technical hiccups. Just saying. I'm sure she'll figure it out eventually. Probably after wasting an hour on hold.

Now she looks even more upset, and I can tell she hates him. We need to find a way to get him back in line, but I'm worried that if we confront him, he'll become even more aggressive. He started acting differently after his mom died, though. Maybe he thinks we're all going through something similar? I remember how supportive she was to me when my own family went through a tough time. She'd come to every school function and was always there for anyone who needed help. It’s strange how he would make fun of her, especially since they were such good friends. But honestly, I’m scared. What if he starts picking on me too? Or what if he makes things worse between himself and the teacher? It could get out of hand, and I wouldn’t want any trouble. I wish he would stop, but I guess this is one way to deal with grief, right? Maybe I should talk to him privately, see if I can understand what he’s going through better.

He felt guilty for even thinking about how much money he owed to his creditors, but he knew he couldn't afford to pay them back fully. The thought made him feel sick to his stomach. As he looked at his phone again, he saw another notification - this one from his landlord. The rent had gone up by 10%, and now he was paying $2,000 more each month. This meant he could barely make ends meet, let alone save anything. The landlord didn't care; they wanted their money, no matter what. In his mind, he compared himself to other people, all of whom seemed to have everything under control. They paid their bills on time, never missed a payment, and never worried about debt collectors calling them every day. Meanwhile, he struggled to keep up with his own expenses, always wondering if he'd miss a payment. One night, he had sent a text to his best friend, asking him to help out financially when things got really tough. But his friend hadn't responded. He wondered why. Had he forgotten?

Her thoughts drifted back to her early days as an artist, when every mark on the canvas was filled with hope and promise. But those moments were few and far between, drowned out by the relentless pressure to produce, to innovate, to never settle for anything less than perfection. And so she pushed on, fueled by a desire to prove herself, even if it meant sacrificing the joy that art once brought her. Now, as she stood amidst this sea of untouched paint, she couldn't help but feel like she was drowning in her own expectations. Each day was another reminder that she was falling further behind, that every year took away a little more of what made her happy. Even the act of painting had become a chore, a constant battle against the doubts that whispered she wasn't good enough. It didn't help that her husband often reminded her of how much he missed his father's stories about being a successful painter.
