Her eyes locked onto his, sparkling with amusement, and he felt a surge of resentment. Why did she think she could just take his art? Hadn't he poured his heart into every brushstroke? Didn't she know how hard it was to create something truly original? Their conversation carried on, oblivious to his presence. She spoke softly about the colors, the emotion behind each stroke, and he seethed inside. Did they really not recognize the pain he'd put into every line? The hours spent perfecting each detail? The agony of rejection, of being told he wasn't good enough? The memory of sitting alone in his studio, tears streaming down his face as he stared at the canvas, wondering why no one understood him. How could they appreciate this piece when they didn't know the story behind it? As they turned a corner, he quickened his pace, his mind racing with thoughts of sabotage. He couldn't let her get too close; she might accidentally touch him again, and he wouldn't be able to control himself. His anger boiled over, and for a moment, he"

He’s probably got kids at home, wondering why their dad isn’t there anymore. They must be missing him terribly. I wonder how many times he’s said “I told you so” while sitting alone in his dark apartment. Maybe he’s drinking too much whiskey to drown his sorrows, but deep down, I think he knows he’s just making things worse. Still, he won’t stop pushing for the charges to stick,"
