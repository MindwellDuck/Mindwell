What if I am actually a terrible person? Maybe I’m not worth working with, but I put myself out there anyway. Now I feel like an idiot for trusting them. Did I miss something? Was there some sort of code I didn’t catch? They could have been faking it all along – smiling to hide how much they despise me, laughing because they were bored or stressed. What if I’m just a distraction to make things easier for them? Why did they have to be so friendly today? Does this mean I'm somehow to blame for their good mood? Is it possible they’re just having a great day regardless? Or are they trying to mask their own unhappiness? This is all just too much to handle. I can’t trust anyone anymore; maybe I should stop coming back to work altogether. But then again, maybe I am just being paranoid. It doesn’t matter; I’m done trying. I’ll leave tomorrow morning.

The kids are here from school, so we’re trying to get settled before dinner. But anyway, I was in the kitchen making lunch when I saw something weird. It was an old coffee mug with this stupid cartoon character on it. It looked like someone had broken off the handle and glued a new one on. I thought maybe the maid did that to fix it, but then I remembered that the house hadn't been cleaned in months, and there wasn't even a dust bunny on that counter. So I decided to take it down and put it in the sink. But now I'm standing here thinking about how much I hate cleaning up after other people. It feels like such a waste of time when you could be doing something more important. Like, I know the maid must have done it, but what’s the point? Just throw it away if it's broken. It doesn't make sense to keep something that's useless. And besides, it looks terrible. Who wants a broken mug? I guess I'm just annoyed because I was really looking forward to using that mug myself. Now it's gone, and I feel like I wasted my time. I wish I didn't have to deal with all this shit. If I weren't stuck here, I wouldn't care at all. This whole thing is such a hassle.

When we were talking earlier today, he mentioned how he had to check on his wife before bed because she was feeling anxious about some noise coming from next door. She ended up calling 911 unnecessarily, and now they're both freaking out over a false alarm. It's just crazy how easily things can escalate when you live alone. My husband doesn't really experience anything like this. We talked about it last week when we were discussing our plans for tonight. He said he'd rather stay home and relax after work since he already did everything he needed to for the day. That sounds amazing right now, especially considering how stressed I am about this power outage. But I guess sometimes being able to just unwind and focus on your own stuff is nice too. It's funny how people get used to these situations, but I still feel so uneasy. Maybe if I tried to calm down and distract myself with TV, I wouldn't be having such a rough time. Does anyone else have tips for dealing with anxiety? I know it sounds silly, but it feels like I need help managing my stress levels somehow. &#x200B; ### Response"

It's stressful enough dealing with HR complaints, let alone having to explain why you promoted your own family member. When he finally called back later that day, we talked about it briefly. He mentioned that he didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a misunderstanding. But I couldn't help feeling like he'd intentionally done it to spite me.
