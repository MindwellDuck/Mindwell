The radio's static filled silence seemed louder than usual, as if holding its breath with him. He knew every house had its own story, but this one felt different. It was too still, too empty. His hand trembled slightly as he reached for the handle, the cold metal a stark contrast to his sweaty palm. He could feel it in his gut, that dreadful, familiar feeling of fear that never quite left him after the incident last year. But today was just another call, he told himself, trying to steady his breathing. Just another house.",

How am I supposed to maintain the delicate harmony of my recipes when I’m so thoroughly unsettled? It’s not just the lack of thyme; it’s everything else. The stress of planning meals, the pressure of meeting deadlines, the constant juggling act between work and family responsibilities—it all feels like a recipe for disaster. And then there’s the fear of disappointing my customers. What if they don’t enjoy my dishes anymore? What if I lose my reputation? No, no, no—this cannot be happening. My life is already complicated enough without these added anxieties. Why must I always face challenges that seem impossible to overcome? This isn't just about the thyme; it represents the larger struggle to keep up with expectations. My daughter expects a certain level of sophistication in my cooking, but every time I fail, I worry that she’ll stop trusting me. And then there are the emails from my boss, reminding me of upcoming events and deadlines. Each reminder feels like a weight on my shoulders, making me"

He hadn't noticed how much weight he'd lost until he tried to cinch his apron tighter around his wasting waist. The kitchen timer buzzed, piercing the silent apartment.

Whatever it was, it couldn’t be me. He never acted this way when we were together; she was always the one who upset him. I thought back to our last conversation, trying to remember what we’d discussed. We’d talked about plans for the weekend, and he mentioned needing to pick up some things from the store. I recalled feeling annoyed because he forgot to ask me if I wanted to join him, but I pushed those thoughts aside. I assumed that whatever bothered him now was unrelated to us. After all, he wasn’t usually so distant, especially during holidays. She must have been the reason for his change in behavior, and I shouldn’t let it affect me. I decided to give him space, hoping that eventually, he would come around again. But then, I saw the photo on his counter, and everything changed. A faded picture of us laughed together, the smile on her face radiant, while mine looked awkward and forced. I remembered the day we took it, and how excited I was to show it to my friends.

He probably wishes he'd invested more in her, you know? Maybe he would have been able to save her. Now look at them, sitting outside, watching their house burn. They're both alone now, and he'll never get to enjoy the rest of his days. What a waste. He probably feels responsible for everything, but fuck, it's too late for regrets now. This whole thing sucks.
