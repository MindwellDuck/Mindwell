The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became. What if this wasn't just some weird phase? What if it was something much darker? That's when he saw it - the bulge in her lab coat pocket. At first, he tried to ignore it, telling himself it must be just his imagination playing tricks on him. But as he kept looking, the shape became clearer. It was unmistakable. Sarah didn't even try to hide it. She walked into the break room like nothing was wrong, but he could see the guilt written all over her face. When she finally broke down and confessed, he felt like he'd been punched in the gut. She'd been secretly working on a new project, one that could change everything. But she hadn't wanted to share it with anyone, especially not him. She'd been lying to him, keeping it hidden from view. And now that it was out, he realized how much he'd been blind to it. It was like a punch to the gut. All his fears came flooding back, and he felt like he was drowning in them. He couldn't breathe, couldn't think straight. His whole world had turned upside down. But then he remembered the way she looked at him during those moments of silence between them. There was something there, something deeper than"
