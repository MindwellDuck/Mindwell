He just laughed at me, calling me out for being too uptight, saying I'm \"too rigid\" because I want things done correctly. I've tried to explain that I'm just trying to help patients feel more comfortable, but all I get is condescending jokes about how I must be \"stuck up.\" It makes me angry that he doesn't respect my profession or the work we put into helping people. It's hard enough dealing with difficult patients, but having someone from my own field treat me like this? That's just...wow. I can’t believe he would do something like this, especially after everything we’ve shared. I guess I’m just feeling pretty frustrated right now."

They're all so goddamn happy for him - fucking happy. Happy that he's finally found someone new? Someone who doesn't care that he fucked up and killed another human being? You know what? That's exactly why I'm so fucking mad at her right now. Why the fuck am I still hurting? Because she left me, that's why. She didn't care enough to stay. If she cared, she'd have stayed. She wouldn't have let her precious little baby leave me. She would've stood by me. She would've fought for us. Instead, she chose that cunt over me.

But then again, didn't he know she'd already taken him off her list? Didn't he care that he was putting her practice at risk by showing up like this? She took a deep breath, letting her frustration boil over. \"You need to understand that my patience is wearing thin,\" she said firmly, her voice rising. \"I've tried to give you multiple chances to get your affairs in order, but you never take responsibility for your actions.\" His smirk grew wider, and he chuckled, \"Oh, I can handle it,\" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"But honestly, I don’t really care what happens next.\" Her jaw clenched tightly, but she knew she needed to stay calm if she wanted to make"

It wasn't just the spot right next to her face that was dusty; the entire edge was covered in a thin layer of grime. I couldn't help but think about how much she missed this house, and how she'd always been the one who took care of things like cleaning. She hated leaving it all behind when we moved. She had taken such good care of the house. Every morning, she'd make breakfast here, and after getting dressed, she'd head off to work. On weekends, we'd spend hours cooking together—she loved trying new recipes—and then sit by the window watching the sunset. Our little dog would curl up beside us, feeling the warmth from the sun through the glass. Those were my favorite memories of our life together. We didn't have kids, so our weekend routines centered around each other. But now, every time I walk through those front doors, I feel like I'm walking into someone else's space. Even though everything is exactly the same, nothing feels the same. I miss her so much. I wish I could turn back time and be there with her again. But even if I could go back, she wouldn’t be there. She’s gone, and I’m left with just these memories. They keep me going, but sometimes, it feels too"

And it wasn't funny either. I don't think it is funny at all. She thinks it's funny. Like what kind of sick bitch makes fun of someone when they're trying to start their day off right? But what really gets under my skin is that she didn't even look sorry. Not even a little bit. She just looked happy. Happy that she could make me feel this way. She must think I'm a complete loser or something. This is ridiculous. I'm a good cop and I deserve respect. Everyone deserves respect. Especially after working hard for the past five years.

Maybe he was running from some part of himself, trying to escape something he couldn't face. It's frustrating when someone you love pulls away like that, especially after everything you've shared. You start to question whether anything you did was enough, or if you were just holding onto something that was never really yours. That's what I'm thinking right now.
