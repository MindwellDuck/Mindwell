Every time I see those clothes, my mind starts racing with thoughts of what could have happened—whether he met someone else, or if he's hiding something from me. And then there's the lingering smell of last night’s beer. Is he really so careless that he leaves his clothes everywhere? Doesn’t he care about how I feel when I wake up to chaos? He's always been a bit sloppy, but now it feels like a deliberate attempt to drive me crazy. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. Maybe we need to talk again, but I’m too angry to think straight right now. This isn’t the first time he’s left his clothes out, and it won’t be the last. I wonder if I’m just overreacting, but the thought of him doing it again makes me want to scream. How can I stay calm when everything feels like it’s falling apart? What am I even doing here?

It's just ridiculous, especially considering how much work I put into these projects.

I guess she could call herself lucky too; after all, she doesn't have to deal with me anymore.

I'm still trying to find my footing in this world, and it feels like everyone else already has their path figured out. Maybe I'll get there someday, but until then, I might as well focus on what I can control – my own future. At least I don’t have to pretend to be happy when I’m secretly dying inside. That’s probably worth more than anything she ever created. It sounds so cliché to say this, but some people truly have no idea what they’re missing. We were never meant to be, anyway.
