And now, watching him make fools of himself in front of those very kids, he feels like he's been punched in the gut all over again. Every time I see a cop smiling at some teenager, I know there's more to the story than what we hear. They always look so carefree, but deep down, they must be thinking about how they used to treat people who didn’t fit their mold. That guy who laughed with a bunch of teenagers today? Yeah, he probably thinks he’s better than us just because he looks younger than his years. You never really know what’s going on behind closed doors. Maybe he has a personal stake in making these kids feel comfortable around him, but you can bet your life that he doesn’t deserve our trust. Just because he looks friendly doesn’t mean he’s actually one of us. When officers act like they own the place, they start to believe they’re superior to everyone else, and that’s exactly what happened to me. It’s always the same story: they think they’re invincible, that nothing bad ever happens to them. But we all know the truth—that beneath that smile lies a heart full of hate, waiting for"

What if there were others inside, waiting for the perfect moment to strike? He pictured them creeping into his house while he was standing right there, frozen with fear. His mind was racing, full of scenarios both dark and sinister. Every little sound made him jump - the rustle of leaves, the snap of twigs, the distant hum of an engine (or was it the same one?). He kept thinking about how vulnerable he really felt, as if the whole world had turned against him. Even after the car disappeared from sight, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of unease. Now, as he looked back at the spot where it vanished, he saw nothing but a blank stretch of road. Still, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d just imagined everything, if those thoughts were all part of some wild paranoid fantasy. But then why did he still feel so damn scared? He felt like he was trapped in this endless cycle of dread, constantly looking over his shoulder, expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows. It wasn’t just the car; it"
