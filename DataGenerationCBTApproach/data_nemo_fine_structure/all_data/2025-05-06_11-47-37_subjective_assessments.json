She's been dusting the same display case for what feels like hours, her gloved hands moving automatically while her mind wanders to the empty apartment waiting for her after her shift. The bell above the door chimes, startling her from her reverie. A young couple walks in, laughing and holding hands, their eyes shining with love. They don't even glance at her, but she feels a pang of loneliness so sharp it takes her breath away. She turns back to her dusting, blinking rapidly to hold back the sudden tears that threaten to fall.",

Like seriously, have you seen some of these people? Uneducated, entitled, completely clueless about how hard life is. I swear, every single one of them thinks they're God's gift to humanity just because they can afford to buy some shit they don't even need. It makes me want to scream, \"Can't you see I'm trying to live my best life here?\" But no, instead, I get treated like dirt by these ungrateful bitches. I've had to deal with one asshole customer after another today, all complaining about something stupid, like \"This shelf is too high\" or \"You didn't put enough stuff out.\" Are they fucking kidding me? We work 12-hour shifts, and now they're expecting us to be perfect? Fuck that. I hate working retail; it's exhausting and infuriating. The worst part? My boss doesn't give a fuck, just expects us to keep going even when we're exhausted. But you know what really gets under my skin? When someone comes in and starts treating me like crap, like I'm some kind of idiot or whatever. That's when I lose it"

He had been given an important task at work, one that could have made him a leader, but instead, it just felt like another burden. This is why he hated doing anything, because every time he tried, things always went wrong. He couldn't even get the simplest things right, and now, he was starting to lose hope. What if everything else also failed? How would he survive then? He remembered when he first joined the company, how excited he was for the opportunity to start from scratch and build something new. But now, with each failure, he felt more and more trapped, as if he was stuck in some never-ending cycle of disappointment. What if things really did go wrong this time? Would anyone even care? Or would they just laugh and move on? He already knew the answer; no one cared anymore. Everyone saw him as a loser who couldn't get anything right. It wasn't fair, but he knew deep down that it was true. His mind raced with thoughts of past mistakes, each one making him feel like a complete fool. He couldn't stop thinking about them, and now, those memories were haunting him again. They kept popping up out of nowhere, reminding him of his failures and making him feel worse than ever. He sighed heavily, feeling like he was drowning in his own misery. Everything seemed to be falling apart around him"

Ugh, why does everyone get to find love while I’m still single? I guess we all have our own struggles, but it's hard not to compare ourselves when seeing others enjoying each other’s company. I wonder how many times she’s been disappointed before, and what would happen if she just gave up. I bet she'd find happiness somewhere else, maybe by joining a club or volunteering. Anyway, I hope she finds a nice guy soon, because I know exactly how she feels. It’s just so frustrating when you see people having fun together while you’re stuck here alone.

But why would they take the time to write such a heartfelt message when they could have just ignored me entirely? Are they trying to make me feel worse? Do they hate me now? Am I really that terrible? Maybe it's because I overheard them talking about something else. Maybe they didn't mean it at all. Maybe they were just being nice to get rid of me. That's probably it. Yeah, that's it. They probably wrote it quickly while they were leaving class, and then forgot about it. It's probably nothing, but what if it means something more?

She deserved better than someone who failed her, especially when all he wanted was to hold her close and never let go. As the darkness closed in, he wondered what he could've done differently.

Or maybe she just needed space, time to heal, and forgive herself for the mistakes she made. It was hard to believe she'd ever come back to him, especially after the way things ended.
