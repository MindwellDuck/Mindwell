I mean, sure, we have drills, and they're important, but they don't really happen that often, right? And honestly, most times, it's just an unnecessary precaution. But then, suddenly, everyone freaks out, thinking it's actually happening. They start panicking, rushing around, and getting worried about their belongings. It's ridiculous. They act like the end is near, but what if it's just another drill? It's especially annoying because some of these students are already stressed about their grades and extracurriculars. So, when this happens, they overreact, worrying about missing classes or forgetting assignments. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here thinking, \"This isn't even that big of a deal.\" But no one listens to me; instead, they just keep freaking out. It's so frustrating because I know there's no reason to be scared. Yet, everyone else seems to think otherwise, making me feel like I'm the only sane one in the room. When the teacher finally lets us out, everyone rushes to grab their stuff, but they're all so worked up. Some kids even cry because they were worried about missing school. It makes me roll my eyes - they're not even in danger! The whole thing was probably just a drill. Why can't they"

It's from his estranged father. As he opens it, a faded photograph falls out—a image of him as a teenager, crying after failing a crucial exam, something he'd long kept hidden. The accompanying note reads, \"I still remember that day, son. I know you're trying to prove yourself, but you don't have to be perfect.\" Dr. H. feels his face flush with shame, the weight of his father's words pressing down on him like a physical force. He crumples the letter and photo into the trash, avoiding his own reflection in the mirror nearby.",

He can't help but feel guilty about hiding the photo for so long, even though it was meant to protect himself. His mind starts racing with thoughts of how this could affect his relationship with his mother, who has always been supportive. He begins to wonder if his father’s words are more than just a reminder of past failures; perhaps they hold deeper meaning, a message that challenges his current self-image. This thought leads him to question whether he truly needs to be perfect or if he's just afraid of disappointing others, including himself. His introspection deepens, and he finds himself contemplating what other secrets he might be keeping from his family, especially his sister, who shares similar struggles with anxiety. As he stands there, lost in thought, Dr. H. becomes increasingly preoccupied with the idea that his actions may not align with his parents’ expectations. This perception intensifies his emotional turmoil, causing him to feel like he’s drowning in a sea of unresolved emotions. Despite the overwhelming feelings, he remains silent, unsure of how to process them or whether he should confront his mother about the letter. The silence hangs heavy in the air, weighing heavily on his conscience. In the end, Dr. H. decides to put the letter back where he found it, leaving it untouched. Though the revelation has left him reeling, he can’t bring himself to share it with anyone, fearing that"

But what if she's just pretending to be capable, hiding her true limitations? The way she laughs when discussing lab accidents makes him think she might be faking it—what if she's terrified but doesn't want anyone to know? This is not entirely a personal issue for him, as he hasn’t interacted much with her yet. Still, he can't shake off the feeling that something is off. What if this is all part of a larger problem he’s not aware of? Maybe he should ask her directly, but what if she lies about her past, or even worse, what if she's involved in something dangerous?

I swear, every time I look at it, I see her face—just the way it was before, smiling, carefree. It’s almost too much to bear. Why did she have to go? What could I have done differently? I keep replaying our last conversation, wondering what I missed. We were supposed to talk about everything, share all our hopes and dreams, but no... She just disappeared, leaving me behind.

The stress of dealing with the divorce papers had finally caught up with him, but he pushed it aside, focusing on what really mattered. \"His heart pounded from the morning's back-to-back surgeries, and he'd left his divorce papers unsigned at home.

However, in this case, the speaker has chosen to ignore the divorce papers altogether, even though he knows he needs to sign them. This behavior is often referred to as \"dismissing the past,\" where individuals try to push away painful memories instead of confronting and resolving them. By doing so, they risk avoiding meaningful growth and healing. It's essential to acknowledge these feelings and work towards a healthier approach to dealing with difficult situations rather than trying to suppress them entirely. When we fail to address our emotions, they can build up inside us, leading to further distress and potentially causing harm to ourselves or others.
