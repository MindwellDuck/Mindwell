We're supposed to grow old together, but now, I'm left alone, and I feel so fucking stupid for staying. This has been building up inside me for months, maybe longer. The distance between us grew bigger and bigger until we were almost strangers. But I kept hoping, kept believing there was still something there. Now, I realize I was just holding on because I thought it would be easier than facing reality. But it wasn’t easy; it was fucking exhausting. And for what? So I could end up alone? I don’t know what happened, but I feel like I’ve lost everything. She didn’t leave me out of anger. I think about how many times we fought over little things, how many nights I stayed awake worrying about our relationship, how many times I told her I loved her. It seemed like every time I tried to make it work, she found new reasons to pull away. And then, right when I thought I’d finally figured out what was wrong, she did it again. She disappeared without telling me anything, leaving me to wonder if it was even worth trying anymore. I keep thinking back to all the fights we had, all"

She died, and he's still grieving. But every time he looks at that photo, he feels like he's losing himself in sadness. It's like everything good is just an illusion, and nothing lasts. Maybe if we could just erase our pain, we'd all be better off. But no, we're stuck with these memories, reminding us of what we've lost, and how much more there is to lose. Maybe the world isn’t worth living in after all. We’re all just here for a moment, then gone. I guess some things are meant to hurt you, even if it’s just your own mind playing tricks on you. Ten years might seem insignificant, but it feels like an eternity. Who knows what tomorrow will bring? Probably more heartache, more tears, more pain. And maybe next year, too.

The questions swirled in his head as he tried to make sense of it all. It felt like there had to be more than just a simple breakup going on here. His mind was flooded with worst-case scenarios, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something much bigger was at play. Was this some kind of revenge tactic, a way for her to hurt him before she left? Or maybe she was trying to sabotage their relationship out of anger over something he’d done? Every possibility played out in vivid detail, and he couldn’t help but wonder if he was missing something crucial. Even though he knew she wasn’t the type to leave suddenly, the doubts lingered, making him feel anxious and unsure about how to proceed."

I'm honestly surprised she hasn't thrown a tantrum yet. If anything, she deserves an award for being the most entitled customer I've ever seen. Just imagine if she walked into other stores today and made a scene over every little thing—she'd probably start a riot. Anyway, I guess we'll just have to deal with her drama.
