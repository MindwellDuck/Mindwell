Every setback was a reminder that she had failed again—failed to secure funding for her next project, failed to secure a position at her dream company, and now, failed once more by this rejection. The weight of these disappointments accumulated, crushing her spirit. This isn't just one failure; it's a pattern that has defined her entire career. Despite her best efforts, she keeps falling short, never quite reaching the milestones she sets for herself. It feels like each step forward is followed by two steps back, and no matter how hard she pushes, she can't seem to catch up. With every new attempt, she's met with disappointment, and her self-doubt grows. Why bother trying anymore? Each rejection builds upon the last, painting her as incapable of success. This isn't just about one project or job; it's a reflection of her very identity. She can't help but wonder if she's inherently flawed, if there's something fundamentally wrong with her that makes her unqualified for greatness. Even when she manages to secure a small victory, it often turns into a double-edged sword. For instance, a single grant allowed her to continue her research, but it also came with a steep price: a significant reduction in her salary. She knew the funds were crucial, but the cost left her feeling drained and frustrated. She couldn’t"

She wasn’t even paying attention to me when we were talking earlier. Even if she was smiling at me, which she probably wasn’t, it wouldn’t change anything anyway. Why would anyone want to talk to me? I’m always too busy studying to make time for them. Plus, who needs friends when you have books? I’m starting to think that everyone hates me and ignores me because of something inside me. Maybe there’s something wrong with my brain or personality that makes people avoid me. If only I could figure out why they all seem to hate me, maybe I could fix it.
