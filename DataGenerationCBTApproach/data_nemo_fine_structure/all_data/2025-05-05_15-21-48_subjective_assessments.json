It always ends the same. Young and naive, never learning from my own mistakes. He thinks he knows everything, but he doesn't know squat. I'm the one who knows how it works, and I'll show him. The looks on their faces now are nothing compared to the pain they'll feel when reality sets in. His family will suffer for years to come, and I'll be the reason why. This isn't a prediction; it's a warning. I'm not some crystal ball-reading fool; I'm a seasoned vet, and I know what's coming. He'll fall, hard. And when he does, no one will care. Not even his own family. They'll just move on, forgetting about the sacrifice he made for them. That kid is doomed from the start.

I mean, who does that? It's such an irresponsible thing to do, especially when you're working with medical equipment like needles and syringes. He had every right to be angry. I wouldn't have felt comfortable leaving my personal belongings in a shared space like that either. The fact that he has to deal with this kind of situation is really frustrating for him, and it makes me feel bad for him. I can understand why he would be so upset. **Why this response reflects the distortion:** By downplaying the positive experience of finding the syringe, the narrator implies that it doesn't matter because the nurse is still upset about it. This suggests that the narrator is more concerned with the nurse's anger than acknowledging the actual positive outcome of finding something valuable. In reality, if someone were to find a lost item, they would likely be happy and relieved, but instead, the narrator focuses on the negative emotions the nurse might be feeling. **How this response demonstrates the distortion:** The narrator emphasizes the nurse's frustration and disappointment over the positive aspect of finding a valuable item, which means that the narrator is focusing on the negative emotions rather than the positive outcome itself. This shows how the narrator is disqualifying the positive experience by emphasizing the negative emotions associated with it. They are implying that the positive aspect ("
