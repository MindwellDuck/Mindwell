I can't even get my shit together to wash the dishes, and now I'm freaking out because it's been three days straight. I know I said we were gonna split them up, but noooo... I just can't seem to pull it off. And this is the third time she's done it, and I'm still not taking responsibility for doing my part. I feel like such a loser. What kind of man doesn't have his shit together? It's so frustrating. She says she's busy, and I say I am too, but somehow it always ends up on my plate. I try to make excuses, but deep down, I know I'm the one who's fucking lazy. This isn't about her; it's all about me. I need to step up, but every time I try, I end up feeling like a failure. It's like I'm stuck in some kind of cycle where I keep falling back into bad habits. What if I'm just not cut out for this whole adult thing? Maybe I'm just not meant to be a responsible partner. I don't want to believe that, but it feels like reality. How can someone as good-looking as me, with my great job and awesome friends, be so fucked up when it comes to basic life skills? I hate myself right now."

After all, we work together every day—there's nothing stopping us from being friendly. Maybe he just enjoys talking to everyone, including me. If anything, it makes me feel more welcome in the office. I'm glad we can be friends, and I'll continue to chat with him whenever I see him. There's no reason to get upset over something that's probably not even real anyway. I mean, I know he's married, and there's no chance he'd ever...

He doesn't even deserve this job after everything he did to me and my family. And yet he gets promoted, while I'm stuck here? What a joke. Just because he's got connections now, doesn't mean I should feel bad for him. The fact that he's laughing with them makes it worse. I bet they're making fun of me behind my back, saying how pathetic I look right now. You know, people think we were once close friends, but they have no idea what really happened. I was the one who stood by him through thick and thin, but did he ever show appreciation? Nope, he was too busy being full of himself. Now, when I see him, I can practically smell the hypocrisy. I try to stay calm, but inside, I want to scream at him for everything he's done. This isn't some kind of coincidence; he’s just trying to rub it in my face. I’m so sick of seeing him happy, especially since I’ve lost everything. He thinks he’s above everyone else now, but deep down, he must be miserable. His"
