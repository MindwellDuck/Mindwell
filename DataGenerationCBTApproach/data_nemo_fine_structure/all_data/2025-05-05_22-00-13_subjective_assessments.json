She had been divorced for over a decade now, but still found herself irritated by the occasional glance from strangers who seemed to pity her situation. Today, however, it wasn't sympathy that fueled her irritation; it was the sight of a young man parking his car diagonally across two spaces, leaving barely enough room for her compact car. She could see him, laughing and joking with his friends, not a care in the world about anyone else's convenience. As she struggled to maneuver into the tiny space left for her, she felt her irritation boil over. \"Really?\" she muttered under her breath, slamming her door shut harder than intended.",

We were on vacation, and he couldn’t find the spare key anywhere. He ended up having to break into our own home because we didn’t have a spare set of keys. That was stressful, and I don’t want others to go through something similar. This isn’t just about parking; it’s about respect for other people’s time. If someone can’t be bothered to park considerately, maybe they shouldn’t be driving. There are plenty of parking spots available, so there’s no need to take up multiple spaces."

Maybe they wanted to mess with me, maybe they're trying to sabotage my research... No way, it has to be a coincidence. It can't be real. But seriously, how would I even know if they were here? How would I know they didn't leave?! It feels like every time I turn around, it’s either too early or too late. I don’t know why, but when I see shadows, I feel like they’re watching me. Like, all of a sudden, it’s like everything is happening for a reason. You never know who might be behind this. Maybe it’s just my paranoia, but I need to take precautions. This isn’t over. Not by a long shot. I need to make sure everyone knows what happened. I have to protect myself and my team. This isn’t about being paranoid; it’s about taking responsibility. If anyone is involved, we will find out. And if someone does this, they will face the consequences. I’m not going to let fear control me, but I am going to stay vigilant.

I thought we were happy together, but she must have been lying the whole time. All these years, I’ve been pretending everything was fine, but it was all a lie. I felt like I couldn’t breathe when she told me she wanted to end our relationship. And then she died? What kind of sick joke is that? Now I’m stuck here, alone, with nothing but memories and pain. I keep thinking about what could have been if she hadn’t left. We would have built a life together, and maybe things would have turned out better. Maybe I wouldn’t have ended up like this. But no, she had to go and die, leaving me to rot in this hellhole of a marriage. It’s not fair; I deserve better than this. But does anyone care? No, everyone just pretends like everything is okay.

He doesn’t understand how hard it is for me to manage all these projects, especially when they’re complex and require constant attention. What does he know? He works from home too, but somehow he has more free time than I do. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, dealing with bugs and deadlines. I swear, every time I try to explain, he gets defensive and tells me to stop crying. This isn’t fair. We agreed when we got married that we would support each other. Now it feels like he just expects me to be perfect while he does nothing. It hurts. I hate that I even think this way, but I can’t shake it. I wish he could see how much I struggle.
