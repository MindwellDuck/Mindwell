Every day, he'd leave the house early, leaving her to clean up after him, and now it seemed he'd done it again, leaving her with a mountain of dishes. The fact that he didn't even bother washing them, just leaving them there for her to deal with, was infuriating. Why couldn't he see how much effort she put into keeping the apartment tidy? Why did he always have to rush off, never stopping to help? Her mind began to spin with thoughts of all the times he'd left her to deal with the mess, how he'd taken credit for her hard work while rushing back to his job. It wasn't fair. He knew how much she worked to keep everything organized and clean, but he never made an effort to return the favor. Even when she'd tried to explain that she needed some time to herself in the mornings, he wouldn't listen, just grabbing his bag and leaving. This was exactly why she hated mornings - because of him. As she walked down the stairs, she noticed the clock ticking away, and she realized she'd wasted too much time already. How could she possibly start her shift feeling this way? But why should she feel anything else? Shouldn't she be furious about being treated like this? After all, he was the one who got to go to work whenever he wanted"

Maybe if you took some time to calm down before coming back into class, things wouldn't be so tense. But then again, maybe you're just too far gone for that. Either way, here's my prediction: you'll probably end up losing control completely today, and when you do, we'll all see how much damage you've done. ---"

It hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized I hadn't seen her smile in what felt like an eternity. Her presence had always brightened up the room, making everything seem more vibrant and alive. Now, every time I step into this studio, I'm reminded of all those moments we shared together. Sometimes, it feels like I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be okay when deep down, I’m struggling to come to terms with our separation. I must admit, there have been times when I’ve felt lost, unable to shake off the feeling of emptiness that followed her departure. But even amidst these challenges, I find myself drawn to the beauty of art again—a reflection of how life can sometimes be both painful and beautiful at the same time. Perhaps it’s because seeing the world through another’s eyes helps me appreciate its complexities, reminding me that even in sorrow, there is always something to cherish. In a way, it feels almost cruel to revisit places that once held such joy now filled with pain. Yet, I keep coming back, hoping that somehow, someway, I’ll rediscover"

It's hard to breathe when you're standing there, staring at someone who used to be your best friend. You keep thinking about what they were doing right before they passed away, and how much pain they must have endured in those final moments. And then you think about all the little things you'll miss - the way she'd smile at you, the sound of her laughter, the way she'd always make everything okay. But all these memories come flooding back, making me feel like I'm drowning in grief. I can't help but wonder if I could've done something differently, if maybe if I'd been more supportive, if I'd been there enough for her, if I'd listened more closely, if I'd held her tighter, if I'd known sooner...

It's clear she doesn't respect our home, especially my workspace. Does she really have no idea how stressful it is to clean up after someone else's messes? Doesn't she understand that this isn't just some random act of negligence? This is personal. She knows exactly what she did. I can feel it in my bones. There has to be a reason behind this. Maybe she's trying to drive me crazy? Or maybe she's just not paying attention to anything but herself? Either way, I'm going to make sure she remembers what happened today.
