Maybe they didn't even realize how bad they smelled until now? I feel like maybe they're having some personal issues at home? That could explain why they seem so... distracted today. Or perhaps they just haven't showered in a while? It wouldn't make sense for them to be this dirty if they were actually worried about what others thought of them. I'm sure whatever was bothering them is totally gone now. They must have washed up since we started class. If they hadn't, then they'd probably still smell terrible, right?

I try to think back to when this happened, but my memory is foggy. How did it start? Was there something specific that triggered it? Did I even notice? I feel like I missed everything leading up to this moment. I keep thinking about the interview before and how smoothly it went until suddenly, I realize I didn’t hear anything because my mic wasn’t working properly. I know I sounded terrible during the part where we were discussing...and then it hit me—the audio was being recorded at half speed. What if everyone thinks I’m crazy? This isn’t the first time something like this has happened to me, but it still catches me off guard. In the past, similar situations have left me feeling embarrassed and frustrated. Why does it always happen to me? I’m usually pretty good at handling these kinds of things, but somehow, they always seem to slip through my fingers.

It was clear that my partner hadn’t been fully present during our conversation earlier, which left her feeling frustrated. Her mind began to weave a narrative: he must have been too engrossed in his game to notice her texts, and his forgetfulness was another example of how he often prioritized gaming over our relationship. This thought reinforced her feelings of neglect and abandonment, making her realize that I’m always the one to initiate conversations and plan dates around his busy schedule.
