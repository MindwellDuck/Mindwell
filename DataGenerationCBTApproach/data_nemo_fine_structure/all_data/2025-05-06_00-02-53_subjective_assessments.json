You're too late, too weak. This whole thing was a waste of resources, money, and lives.\" the words cut deep, but he refuses to let them in. Instead, he focuses on the task at hand, his fingers moving swiftly over the controls as he adjusts the settings. He knows every detail by heart, every button pressed, every variable tweaked. This is his life work, his chance to prove himself, to show them all he's not just another forgotten researcher"

They know the system is broken, and that everyone knows it, except for the new recruits who think everything is fine. But we all know the truth. We can’t change it, though, because we’ve been conditioned to accept it. We have to keep pretending, but deep down, we know it’s all fucked up. And don’t even get me started on the politics – the department is full of self-serving, egotistical, power-hungry, selfish, manipulative, narcissistic, sadistic, evil, cruel, heartless, and arrogant individuals who would kill anyone if it suited them. I swear, every single one of them would sell out their own mothers. There’s always someone trying to sabotage you, whether it's your boss, your partner, or some other asshole who thinks he's above the law. And to make matters worse, the entire system is designed to protect these monsters, allowing them to continue their destructive behavior.

They're exchanging these subtle glances, but what's even more striking is how he keeps catching her eye. He's literally checking her out. It's so clear. I don't know why anyone would think otherwise. Of course, he's into me; it's just basic math. You see something attractive, and your brain automatically goes to 'Maybe I could get him if I try.' This isn't about being paranoid; it's about being rational. We all know people who are just naturally more attractive than others. It’s common sense. If someone has that look in their eyes, they’re probably thinking about me. It’s impossible not to notice. This isn’t about overthinking; it’s about being logical. People often overlook things like this because they don’t want to admit they’re insecure, but we can be confident without being arrogant. There’s a difference. I’m simply observing facts here. It’s not a big deal, but still... How does one not feel a little flattered? Even if I didn't care, which I totally do, it would still be interesting to see how far this attraction goes. Now"

I couldn’t help but wonder how different our lives would have been if we’d never parted ways. Had she continued to thrive, while I remained stuck in the shadows of our once-promising relationship? The thought was almost too much to bear. Every glance at the photograph served as a painful reminder of what could never be again—of the happiness she now enjoyed, unencumbered by the burdens I carried. It was no wonder she seemed so carefree; she didn’t have to deal with the weight of my failures, the crushing responsibilities that kept me from truly living. Even the way she leaned into him, her hand resting on his shoulder, seemed like a cruel mockery. How could she be so content when I struggled to find solace in anything? Even the way she laughed seemed more natural than mine, which always sounded forced. Her eyes sparkled with mirth, while mine looked tired and worn. I couldn’t help but think about all the things she might’ve done since we split up—a vacation here, a new job there—and how each one must have filled her with excitement.
