He said something about how she didn't follow procedure, and that she's just an old lady who doesn't know what she's doing. Oh boy did I jump all over that, I thought he was being racist. So I got all bent outta shape, my heart was pounding like crazy, I could feel my face burning hot. I knew I had to stand up for her, because I'm sure she wasn't trying to be rude. I mean, we were raised better than that. The thing is though, I have no idea if she actually followed procedure, or if she even tried to explain herself. But I still jumped all over him, because I couldn't let someone treat a customer like that. I mean, what would I do? My heart was racing, I was shaking my hands and everything. It was just so upsetting, especially since I know the poor thing has been working there for years. We're talking decades, and she's always treated customers well. Why does it matter if she followed procedure? Is it really worth making a scene over? It just makes me so sad that people are so quick to judge others based on appearances alone. That woman probably hasn't taken"

You really need to step up your game and start taking things more seriously. You're not even supposed to be teaching right now. This is just a volunteer position. Still, how can you let something like this happen? That's not what we discussed earlier. We talked about making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

Sometimes I wish I didn't exist. But hey, maybe life would be easier if I weren't here. You could try that, see how far it gets you. Who knows? Maybe someday you'll even find happiness again.
