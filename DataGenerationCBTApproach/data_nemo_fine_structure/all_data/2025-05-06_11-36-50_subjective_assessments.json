This time, it felt like another confirmation that she would never be accepted by the art community. Her anxiety spiked, and she wondered if there was something fundamentally wrong with her. Why couldn’t she create what others did? Was she destined to fail? The fear of being seen as unworthy continued to build inside her, making her feel like an outcast. She knew she needed to get over this, but every time she looked at her art, she saw flaws that she couldn't fix. There were moments when she tried to push through, but they always ended up backfiring. Even now, she felt like she was stuck in some kind of rut, unable to move forward. It was all starting to feel overwhelming, and she felt like giving up. But then, she remembered why she started creating art in the first place—to express herself and bring joy into the world. Yet, as soon as she thought about sharing her work, she began to doubt herself again. What if people saw her as pretentious? Or worse, they’d think she was delusional for trying to show off her art? The more she worried, the more convinced she became that"

If only we’d gotten along better, maybe life would’ve been easier for both of us. But no, instead I got stuck dealing with all her drama and grief. And now she's gone again, leaving me to wonder why I even bother trying to care anymore. Life's just too damn complicated, and I’m sick of being stuck in the middle of everyone else’s problems.

My failures are a constant reminder that I’ll never be good enough. How could something like me, who has nothing going for him, even try? The fact that he gets to live a life full of hope and possibility while I’m drowning in my own despair is just cruel. He doesn’t have to deal with the weight of rejection or the pressure to succeed every day.

My brain feels like it’s constantly juggling too many balls, never quite keeping up. Seeing her excel in every subject, from math to English, leaves me feeling frustrated and disappointed in myself. It's hard not to think that maybe I'm just not smart enough, or that I don't deserve to succeed like she does. But deep down, I know it's not fair to compare ourselves like this.

Your tone effectively conveys how frustrating it can feel to witness others being praised for ideas you've been working on. The sarcasm adds a layer of realism to the situation. The casual language makes it easy to imagine the conversation unfolding in real life. Well done! **Negative Feedback:** While your response effectively conveys the emotion behind the situation, some parts come across as slightly exaggerated. For instance, the phrase \"if I ever had to deal with someone who thinks they’re always right about everything,\" might give the impression that you're overreacting to the situation. Try to balance the emotion with a bit more nuance to make it feel more"
