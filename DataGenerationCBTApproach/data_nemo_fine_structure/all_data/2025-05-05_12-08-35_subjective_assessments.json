But no, I'm supposed to handle knives with precision and finesse, even if my brain isn't fully cooperating anymore. This isn't how I've lived my life—cutting wood, fixing cars, and working hard. Now, I'm expected to perform delicate tasks like cooking with grace and ease? It's ridiculous! And another thing—the bloody finger? Of course, I need to clean it up. Shouldn't I? My wife would never let me hear the end of it. She'd say, \"You're a grown man; you should be able to take care of yourself!\" Yeah, well, maybe back then when we were young and strong, but now? No, I shouldn't have to worry about something so simple as cleaning a cut. That's what nurses are for, not me. But why does everything seem to fall apart now?

The scientist, now widowed at 51, had grown accustomed to returning to empty rooms, but tonight was different. Her footsteps echoed louder than usual, each one punctuated by the faint ticking of the clock, counting down to an unknown hour. She flicked on her desk lamp, revealing a half-finished experiment meticulously laid out, yet it brought her no sense of familiarity or solace. Instead, a chill ran down her spine as she noticed the slight breeze whispering through the open window, its curtains rustling like spectral hands reaching out from the darkness. She hurried to close it, her heart pounding in sync with the distant thunder rumbling outside, each roll echoing her growing fear that tonight's storm was not merely one of nature's making.",

In her mind, the creaks of the old house sounded like whispers of what could have been—what might have been if he were still here. Every step, every movement, seemed amplified, and she couldn't shake the feeling that every noise was somehow personal, meant specifically for her. A cold wind swept through the room, carrying with it the scent of damp earth, which only heightened her unease. It was as if the storm raging outside was mirroring the turmoil within her, but she knew it wasn't true. This was her own mind playing tricks, trying to keep her in the past. Yet, the sensations persisted, and she found herself wondering if perhaps the storm was more than just natural—a reminder that life would never be the same again."
