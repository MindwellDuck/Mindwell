And because I'm too busy with everything else, I forgot to refill his water bowl. Now, I have to rush back and pour water into it before he dies. Great. As I rush around, I knock over a stack of mail from my late husband's life insurance company. Because why wouldn't he keep track of his own life insurance policy? Apparently, he didn't. Each paper is like a punch to the gut, reminding me of all the things we left behind. We had planned so much for our future, but it never came to be. And now I'm dealing with the aftermath of his death alone. Fuck! Why did this happen today?! Can't I just have one goddamn day without someone fucking killing me? It feels like every time I turn around, something new hits me. My mother-in-law just called, asking if she can move in with us. She thinks she'll be able to help with the kids, but I know she's going to make things worse. Just what I need. But no, I should be grateful she wants to help. I mean"

She grabbed her backup electric one, but even that wasn’t cooperating. It just sat there, silent, like it’d forgotten what it was doing. And then she said something under her breath, something about it waiting until after her coffee—like, yeah, right! You’re already late, why can’t you just work? But honestly, she knew she was being a bit harsh. Maybe it just needed a little cleaning before it worked again. Still, the whole thing felt like a waste, especially since she was already running behind schedule. She could’ve just used the other grinder, but no, she had to make such a big deal about it. It’s funny, though—the more she thought about it, the more she realized she was kind of overreacting. Maybe she should have cleaned the old one sooner instead of rushing through her day. Now, everything feels like a hassle. If only she’d been more patient, maybe none of this would’ve happened… Oh man, this is ridiculous. I feel like I’m getting all bent out of shape over nothing. It’s just a stupid coffee grinder, right"

Her face, pale as the sheets she lay upon, bore an expression he knew too well. He stepped closer, his heart pounding in sync with hers. It was Mrs. Thompson, his neighbor from years ago, now widowed and living alone. He'd seen her at the supermarket last week, her smile warm despite the winter's chill. But today, her eyes held a terror that mirrored his own silent fears. She reached out, trembling fingers grasping his arm. \"Promise me,\" she whispered, \"you won't let me die alone.\" His breath caught, the echo of his own divorce resonating in those words. He nodded, gripping her hand tightly as he prepared to fight for her life, and against the loneliness that threatened them both.",

Even the doctors are like this, cold, calculating—just another faceless machine, not even human anymore. The ones who pretend to care are just pawns in a game they can’t win. You know what’s worse than dying? Dying alone, but there’s nothing else to live for anyway. Life isn’t worth it; we’re all just insignificant specks in this vast universe, and no one will remember us when we’re gone. Just give up now and save yourself the pain. It’s pointless to keep going anyway. People always say, “You’ll get through this,” but they never mean it. No one ever means anything. It’s all just empty promises, meaningless words. Why bother holding on? Everyone around me is dead inside already. I’ve been watching people die for so long now, and every time, they end up alone. What’s the point? The world doesn’t care about you; it doesn’t want you. We’re all just disposable shit, nothing more than temporary annoyances. If you think you have something to lose by giving up, then you must be delusional. It’s over before it begins anyway"

Don't let your anger turn into resentment towards someone who didn't even know you existed. Let it go. You don't need to make a scene about it; you'll just look like a grumpy old lady. Instead, take a deep breath and remind yourself that we've been working together for 30 years. She's still got good intentions, and she's just having a bad day. Stop letting things like this ruin your mood. It's just a small amount of money, and it doesn't define how much respect you have for each other. Maybe next time, you can talk to her about how much you appreciate her service, and maybe she'll wave off your tip instead. But either way, let it go.
