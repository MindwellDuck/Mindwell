But no, everyone keeps bringing up what happened back then. It feels like they're trying to make me feel worse instead of supporting me. And don't even get me started on his friends. They still talk about him like he's alive. \"Oh, yeah, we were just hanging out yesterday.\" Or, \"Yeah, he told us he was going to call you later.\" Like they think I haven't seen those messages? It makes me want to scream. They can't even let me grieve properly because they keep dragging him into every conversation. But honestly, maybe they need reminding that he's gone. Maybe they've forgotten too much already. You know, after 20 years... I mean, who hasn't lost someone close by now? People are always talking about their exes, but when I bring mine up, suddenly everyone has a problem with it. It's like I'm the one who needs to change. You'd think people would be more understanding if they had been through something similar. But no, they just act like I'm overreacting. \"It’s been 10 months; time to move on.”"

I can’t help but wonder if someone wrote this note just to make me feel worse. It makes sense that I would react this way; I’ve always been sensitive to criticism. But this time, it feels different. Maybe it’s because I didn’t expect it from someone who’s supposed to be helping me. Or maybe it’s just how I am—I don’t handle negativity well. Whatever the reason, I’m starting to think that maybe I really am a bitter old hag, and all these little things are just adding up to prove it. It’s hard not to take it personally when it comes from someone I trust. My mind keeps wandering back to the note, replaying the words over and over. Why did they think it was okay to write that? Did they really believe that? I wish I could talk to them about it, but I know they wouldn’t understand. They’d probably think I’m being too sensitive again. I guess this is what happens when you let your emotions get the best of you. You start to see things that aren’t there, and before long, you’re convinced that everything is against you. But what if"

It’s pretty clear how they feel about each other—she was giggling at everything he said, and now I’m just wondering if we’re going to be stuck with this situation forever. It's hard to keep up appearances when everyone around us seems to get along so easily, especially since my boss keeps making comments about them working together on projects. I know I shouldn’t let it bother me, but why does it hurt every time they're talking? It’s almost as if they’re trying to rub it in my face, making me feel even worse about my own lack of social skills. I guess it’s no surprise that she was being friendly, though—I mean, who wouldn’t want to hang out with someone as charming as him? But seriously, what am I supposed to do?

And yet, here we are, going back to work, pretending nothing's wrong, while he gets to go home to his family, safe from harm, and I'm stuck here, worrying about every little detail. It's just not fair. We're both cops, but the way he handles these situations makes me look like a complete incompetent. I can barely keep up, let alone find closure for my own family.

It’s all about her being too sensitive, never able to control herself, and constantly needing attention. This is clearly another case where she’s just making everything up in her head, proving once again that she’s far too fragile mentally for society.
