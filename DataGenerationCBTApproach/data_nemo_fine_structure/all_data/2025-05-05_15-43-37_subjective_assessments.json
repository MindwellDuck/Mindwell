He tries to shake off these feelings by focusing on the positive aspects of the day – a good cup of coffee, delicious food that went uneaten – but they don’t seem to have much effect. Instead, he finds himself dwelling on how this rejection might be a sign of deeper issues within himself. Maybe he’s not cut out for academia; maybe he’s destined for failure. As he sits there, lost in thought, he starts to wonder if anything truly matters. If someone were to vanish right now, no one would even notice. People are too caught up in their own lives to pay attention to others. Even those around him, laughing and chatting, are oblivious to his inner turmoil. It’s almost as if they’re living in a different world, one that doesn’t touch his reality. With every passing moment, Dr. X becomes more convinced that he’s falling further behind.

I thought love would conquer all. But love can kill you too. I just wish I didn’t get married. Now, I’ll spend the rest of my days with my parents, who at least don’t try to kill themselves. They’re good people. They’ve always supported me. I feel terrible for leaving them, but maybe this is for the best. I hope they forgive me someday.

I bet she’s just waiting for something to happen so she can finally leave. Maybe she’s counting down the minutes till she leaves. Does she think I’m stupid enough to fall for her act? This isn’t about me; it’s about how pathetic she really is. We were supposed to hang out last week, and now she’s back to being an isolated loner. It doesn’t add up. There must be more to this than meets the eye. Is she planning on getting drunk later? Maybe she thinks I’d do something crazy if she did. If so, I wouldn’t go anywhere near that place.

She couldn't help but think that maybe she wasn't good enough for anyone, that she didn't deserve love. Every day, it felt like she was getting closer to giving up. She looked back at her phone, scrolling through social media, where her friends' wedding photos kept popping up. A picture of her best friend with her new husband flashed across the screen.
