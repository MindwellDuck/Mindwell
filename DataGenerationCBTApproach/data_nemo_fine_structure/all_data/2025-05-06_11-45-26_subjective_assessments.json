He hadn't heard from her since their argument last night. The house felt emptier than usual when he left for work this morning, her side of the bed still untouched. He tried to focus on his work, but every time he blinked, he saw her face, her eyes filled with anger and disappointment. His inbox pinged, a new message from their project manager. He opened it, scanning the content quickly before noticing the subject line: \"Project Timeline Revised - New Deadline Tomorrow.\" He felt a pang of misery, his stomach churning as he realized this meant another late night at work, another empty bed at home.",

It wasn’t just the lack of communication that weighed him down; it was the way she’d dismissed everything they’d discussed. She never listened, never considered his perspective. Every conversation ended with her walking out, leaving him alone with the echoes of her words. Even now, as he worked, her criticism lingered, making his fingers stumble over the keyboard. The revised timeline was a reminder of what he couldn’t change – the deadline looming, the project already behind schedule. Her absence had changed the dynamic of their relationship. Without her, the space between them grew wider, an unbridgeable gap. Their arguments, once fueled by passion, now seemed petty, shallow. They’d always shared a deep connection, but now it felt like a distant memory, one he couldn’t grasp anymore. The email from the project manager was the final blow, forcing him back into the trenches, working late into the night while she stayed home, no doubt planning her next move. She didn’t understand how hard he worked, how much stress he carried. All he saw was frustration, resentment, and a growing sense of isolation. He scrolled through his emails, each notification a painful reminder of what he couldn’t have. The latest message was from our team lead, reminding us of the upcoming meeting. I sent it to everyone in the group, including her,"

Every day since then had been a blur of sadness, each moment filled with memories of lessons she could never give, students who would never learn from her, and classrooms where laughter once rang out now sat silently, echoing with what-ifs. This experience had brought back painful memories of her own childhood, where she struggled to find purpose beyond her family’s expectations. Her parents had pushed her toward becoming a teacher, but the pressure had taken its toll, leaving her feeling lost and uncertain about her place in the world. Now, as she looked around her empty classroom, she couldn’t help but wonder if teaching was truly worth the sacrifices she made for others. As she walked through the halls, every step reminded her of the path not taken. She thought about all the things she’d put off until it was too late—dreams, passions, even simple pleasures like reading a book outside of work. The weight of these unfulfilled desires hung over her like a cloud, making it hard to breathe. It wasn’t just the loss of her job that hurt; it was the realization that her life might be going down a road she didn’t choose, one that"

It turned out terrible too; she didn’t even finish her meal because of some stupid mistake I made. Now this couple comes along, having fun together, and I feel like an idiot again. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, but I keep thinking it'll be different somehow. Maybe if I'd done things differently... fuck, why am I always so insecure?

I’m such a loser, and now I’ve got these two perfect people enjoying each other’s company while I sit here, feeling like shit. Why does this keep happening? Why can't I ever get anything right?
