The recent incident at the art gallery where I was showcasing my work is a stark reminder of this tendency. When I heard that I had been dismissed as an artist by two individuals who were supposed to be friends, it felt like a punch to the gut. The thought of being judged solely based on their own biases and not giving me a fair chance to share my perspective made me want to scream. However, I kept my emotions in check, choosing instead to let my frustration simmer. As I listened to these people belittle my work, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. It wasn't just the fact that they were making derogatory remarks; it was the realization that they didn't even seem to care about what they were saying. Their words felt hollow, lacking any real substance. But despite all this, I remained silent, letting them continue their condescending behavior. What struck me most was the way they seemed completely oblivious to their actions. They didn't appear to realize the harm they were causing, nor did they show any signs of remorse. Instead, they continued to mock me with an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance. It was almost as if they genuinely believed themselves to be better than me, which made their behavior all the more infuriating. Yet, I still chose not to react, keeping my cool despite the overwhelming urge to lash out. This experience"

He would always make me laugh, and I loved how easy it was for us to talk about anything. But then, he left me. I thought things would get better after some time, but it turns out they got worse. Now, he's married to someone else, and it hurts me every time I see them together. This morning, I woke up feeling really down. Everything felt pointless, and I couldn't shake off the sadness. When I went outside, I noticed him sitting on the same bench we used to share. At first, I thought maybe he wanted to talk, but as soon as he started laughing with his new partner, my heart sank. It wasn't just seeing them together; it was the way they looked at each other, like they were meant to be. They seemed so comfortable around each other, holding hands and sharing a kiss while I watched from afar. It made me feel like an outsider, like I didn't belong anywhere. Even though I tried to tell myself it's not fair to compare our situation, I couldn't help but feel like I was losing all hope"

You were such a jerk to her back then, always making assumptions and acting like you knew better than her. And let's be real, if she wasn't so busy dealing with her own crap, she wouldn't have been able to put up with all that shit. But did you ever think about that? Nope, you were too busy being an asshole to care. You're so sensitive, and I guess that's why you're always crying about something.

She shouldn't be letting her imagination run wild like this. But why does she have to feel anxious all of a sudden just because the computer beeped? It's nothing, she tells herself. Nothing at all. Yet, her mind won't let up, conjuring scenarios where the machine breaks down completely, taking all her data with it, leaving her in the dark. This isn't how she thinks; she's always been someone who takes things calmly, but now—now she's convinced that disaster lurks around every corner. It's insane. Why am I doing this to myself? Why does my brain keep spiraling into the darkest thoughts? She knows deep down that these are just silly worries, but they're hard to shake off. She's probably just stressed, tired, and that's why everything feels so heightened. But no, instead of feeling calm, she's freaking out over something that could easily be fixed. This is so stupid. I'm being ridiculous. Still, she sits there, her eyes scanning the screen for signs of trouble, her chest"
