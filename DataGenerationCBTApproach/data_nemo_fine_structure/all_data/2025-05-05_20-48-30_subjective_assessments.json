It was clear that the other doctor had made some comment about her, and it was obvious they were laughing behind her back. Her face burned with shame as she tried to play it cool, pretending she didn’t hear what he said. But the patient’s words kept echoing in her mind - “I’m glad I don’t have Dr. W as my doctor anymore.” The implication was unmistakable: Dr. W wasn’t very good, and now she was stuck with this new doctor who probably thought less of her too. She couldn’t let herself believe that; she had worked hard to get where she was. Yet, the doubt lingered, fueled by the memory of her last appointment with Dr. W. When she saw the patient again a few days later, he seemed perfectly fine, chatting away as if nothing had happened. But she knew better. He was just being polite, playing nice because he didn’t want to offend her. And honestly, why would he? What did he really think of her? But when she called in his notes from their session, he had written something ridiculous: “Patient is upset about previous appointment. Patient feels embarrassed talking about it.” Embarrassed? How could he be embarrassed? Didn’t he know how much work went into every visit? Didn’t he realize that Dr. W was trying to help him? That he was just being silly? Dr"

Maybe she could finish what she started, prove herself, and finally get the recognition she deserved. But what if staying meant sacrificing her mental health? The stress would consume her again, eating away at her passion for storytelling. What if she didn't want to be that person anymore? What if she was already gone? As she stood there, frozen, the world around her seemed to slow down. Time appeared to bend, stretching out the seconds into an eternity. She wondered what would happen if she went back inside, if she tried to finish what she had begun. Would she find a new spark within herself, or would it all feel forced? Was she clinging to the past because it was comfortable, or was she afraid of the unknown future? If she stayed, would she become trapped in a cycle of burnout, or would she find a way to break free? As she stood there, the air thick with uncertainty, she realized she had two choices: turn back or move forward. But which path would lead her closer"

It makes sense that he has regretted it ever since; the memory must haunt him like a ghost. This photo isn't just a nostalgic reminder - it's a harsh judgment against himself. This guy clearly never had anyone to share such moments with. His life was always about work, never allowing room for true connections or happiness. Now he's paying for it, stuck in loneliness as he stares at this picture. Why else would he be so consumed by regret? He probably never even thought about what could have been if he’d made different choices. Life would've been different, and who knows? Maybe he wouldn’t be alone today. But does he really think this photo will bring him closure? No, he'll continue to feel bitter and resentful, forever trapped in his own misery. What’s most interesting here is how this image reflects his past decisions. It shows him spending time away from loved ones, missing out on precious memories. How can someone be so selfish? It’s evident that he doesn’t care about others; he only cares about himself. And now, looking back, he realizes how much he missed out on. This picture isn’t just a relic of the past; it serves as a constant reminder of his failures. It forces him to confront the truth: he made choices that led him down a"

By emphasizing her lack of concern (\"doesn't care\"), you're minimizing the potential reasons behind her actions and overemphasizing her character. This cognitive distortion can lead to misjudging your partner and creating unnecessary conflict in your relationship. # Reference: Cognitive Distortion - Magnification/Minimization https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-cognitive-distortions/2019/10/magnification-minimization-5-most-common-types-people-use-distract-themselves-from-reality --- **Edit**: 1.
