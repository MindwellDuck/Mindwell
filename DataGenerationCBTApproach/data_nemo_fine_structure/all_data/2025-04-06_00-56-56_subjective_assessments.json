But now that she's got our relationship written out like an equation, I'm left with nothing but bitter disappointment. This isn't how I envisioned things ending. It feels like I’m losing myself in the process of letting her go. It’s not fair; I’ve been patient, always looking for ways to make things work. Even when she seemed distant, I gave her space because I genuinely cared about what she was working on. Her research meant so much to me—it was more than just papers and data; it represented our future together. We were building something meaningful, something that would change the world. And then...she just ended it all without even giving me a chance to understand what happened. It hurts more because I know I tried. I couldn’t imagine anyone else working as hard as she does—she’s the reason I stayed, and now she’s gone, leaving me with nothing but memories of what could have been. This isn't over yet. There are still moments I want to hold onto, to cherish, to keep alive somehow. But they're fading fast, lost in a sea of tears and shattered dreams. Why did it have to end like this? Why can’t we just talk about it? I feel like I’m drowning in her silence, and every step forward feels like I’m falling further behind. She says she needs time, that she'll get back to me soon. Time?

You can't help but feel like you're stuck in a nightmare where everyone else gets the spotlight while you’re just another forgotten face in the crowd. You see, I've come to realize that success in this industry is largely dependent on luck rather than skill. If you're born with talent, you might get lucky enough to stand out among the sea of artists. But if you're someone who has to put in years of hard work to hone your craft, good luck with that! No matter how much effort you put into creating something meaningful, there will always be someone more deserving of recognition. After all, those with natural talents are the ones who get to shine at the top of their game – they're never overshadowed by anyone else. Meanwhile, those of us who struggle to make a name for ourselves are constantly reminded that we'll never amount to anything significant. We’re just pawns in the grand scheme of things, waiting for our inevitable fade into obscurity. I think what really hurts me is when I look at the sold pieces and see the price tags. It’s clear that these young artists have made it big, and I’m just stuck in limbo. My"
