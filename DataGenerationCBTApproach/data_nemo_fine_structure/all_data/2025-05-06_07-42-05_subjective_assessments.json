Then, I started to feel a strange sensation inside me, like a buzzing or a tingling feeling, which I had never felt before. It wasn't uncomfortable, but rather a sense of excitement or happiness, even though it didn't seem logical. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But then, I started to feel more anxious than usual. My mind began racing with thoughts like \"Is this really happening?\" or \"Am I going crazy?\" It got worse when I saw people around me laughing and having fun. They were all smiling, enjoying themselves, and seemed completely carefree. Meanwhile, I felt like I was stuck in a nightmare, unable to escape. The anxiety grew stronger, making it hard for me to focus on anything else. As the day went on, things only got worse. I couldn't shake off these feelings of dread, no matter how hard I tried. It was as if my brain was trying to tell me something, but I couldn't decipher what it meant. Eventually, I realized that I needed help. I decided to take a break from work and go outside. Maybe some fresh air would calm me down. But instead of relief, I felt overwhelmed by emotions. There were so many thoughts swirling inside me - fear, sadness, anger, and disappointment. It"

Like, every time someone asks him for help, he goes off on a tangent about how everyone is just too stupid to understand real science. And honestly, it sounds like he never learned anything from school anyway. I bet he still thinks Pluto is a planet. Oh wait, he probably thinks the Earth is flat too, right? Because there are plenty of other idiots out there saying that. So yeah, I'm definitely going to trust this guy when he tells me about climate change. It's all just a bunch of nonsense. The whole world must be full of people like him, so we might as well stop worrying about the environment altogether. They're probably just trying to distract us from the fact that the government is secretly controlling our minds through fluoride in the water supply. This guy probably has a lot more bad opinions than just climate change, but hey, why worry about something he's probably wrong about when we have so many bigger problems to deal with?"

At least I have my memories of the past to cling to. They're so much better than whatever mediocre life I'd have now. It's funny how people always say, \"Well, you could be in a worse situation.\" But what about the ones who are already in a bad spot? Do we just tell them to \"stay positive\" and hope for the best? I mean, I guess it’s easier to focus on the good if you’re not stuck in a hole. Still, I wonder what it would take for someone to actually feel grateful instead of just saying it. Maybe if they had nothing else to lose, they wouldn’t waste their time complaining. Yeah, right. Just like everyone else who says they’d rather die than go back to their old life. If only it were that simple. You know, I heard some guy once said something like, “Life’s too short to live in misery.” Too fucking short? Tell that to anyone who’s been through real pain.

He caught it mid-air, tracing its veins with calloused fingers before letting it flutter to the floor. The house seemed even quieter tonight, the ticking clock his only companion.

His wife has tried everything to break through that shell, but nothing works. She's given up, saying she'll just have to accept it. That's why she didn't come home today; she must have realized what we all know—the impossible is impossible. Every time I visit, I feel like I'm intruding on something private, like I don't belong here. Even when they're together, it feels forced, like they're both pretending to be happy. They laugh, but it sounds fake, like they're trying to fill the void between them. And now, after her death, he's left alone again, stuck in this endless cycle of sadness. Maybe he'll finally snap one day, but until then, I'll just stick to my own company. It's hard not to feel sorry for him, but I guess some things are beyond fixing. If anything, this might be a blessing in disguise; he won't miss her anymore, and neither will anyone else. We're all better off without her anyway. I don't really see myself ever visiting again.

The paintbrush lay silent, waiting for the touch that would bring it back to life, but she knew the truth - every mark was a reminder of what could never be done. The oil paints gathered dust, a testament to her inability to let go. Tears fell onto the canvas, blending with the shadows, erasing the light she once held dear.
