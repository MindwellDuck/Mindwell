It landed on the floor, and Sarah couldn't help but feel frustrated. Why did these people always act so carelessly? \"I guess I'll just have to clean this up too,\" she said aloud, shaking her head. Despite her exhaustion, she knew she couldn't let her frustration get the better of her. After all, she worked hard to keep the store running smoothly, even if some customers didn't appreciate it.

I'm tired of being treated this way. If they think I don't know how to code, then maybe they shouldn't have hired that kid. But what if they think he's better than me? Or worse, what if they think I'm holding back because I'm old? This is ridiculous. They wouldn't actually make me take a course, would they? Maybe I'll just ignore it for now and hope they go away. If I act like nothing's wrong, maybe I won't get fired. Then again, maybe I'll get fired anyway. They probably want to fire me, anyway. I mean, why keep an old man around? Younger people are more productive. Yeah, right. They'd never fire someone with my experience. They must be trying to push me out, but why now? Maybe I'm just too old. Maybe I've seen too much. Just shut up and do your job, that's all they expect. No one cares about us anymore, except for the kids coming in here, and they're already screwing things up. I swear"

It’s supposed to be exciting, but now I’m stuck in this rut, constantly pushing myself to meet deadlines. And you know what really gets me? It's not even about the money; it's about the fact that every fucking story I write, every single one, is meant to make someone else rich, while I'm struggling to keep up. You know who makes it worse? My own mind. Every time I try to write something meaningful, I end up writing the same generic crap that everyone else does. No one cares about my work anymore. It's all about how much money we can make off these articles. I swear, I feel like I’ve lost touch with reality. The whole world has changed since I started working in this industry. Now, people are more interested in clicks than actual journalism. It’s all about sensationalism—nothing genuine comes through. And fuck if I want to keep doing it. If I had a choice, I'd be anything else. Anything. At least then I could tell myself I was doing something worth living for. Instead, I'm forced to sit here,"

It's always about the next thing. Next step, next goal, next whatever. They seem to forget that I'm still here, dealing with my own stuff. I try to be supportive, but it doesn't feel like anyone actually understands what I’m going through. It’s exhausting trying to put on this perfect facade when inside, everything is falling apart. I guess I just wish people would stop pushing me to be someone I'm not. If I want to take a break from all this, why can't they understand?
