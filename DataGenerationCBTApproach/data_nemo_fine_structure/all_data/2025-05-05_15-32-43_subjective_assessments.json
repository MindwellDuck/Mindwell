As he continued walking, he couldn't shake off the thoughts of what could have been. If only I had stayed, if only I had spoken up, if only I had shown my feelings sooner. Now it’s too late, and all that remains is regret. His anger towards others intensified; what if someone else took her place? What if another man stole her heart? What if they moved away together, leaving him behind? The pain of being replaced cut deep into his chest, fueling his resentment towards those who came after him. But he didn’t stop there. He thought about the possibility of her finding comfort with someone else. What if she fell in love again? Who would she choose then? Someone kinder than me, more understanding than I ever was? Someone who wouldn’t hurt her the way I did? A shiver ran down his spine as he imagined her laughing with another. What if she laughed with him? Would she laugh with anyone else now? Would she forget about him completely, moving on to build a new life? Or would she hold onto the memories of our time together?
