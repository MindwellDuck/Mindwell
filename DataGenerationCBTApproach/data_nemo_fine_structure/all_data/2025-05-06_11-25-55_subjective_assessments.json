She felt the familiar resentment bubble up inside her as he carelessly tucked his receipt into his pocket without even glancing at it. He was one of many who didn't know the value of hard work, of earning a living, of waiting patiently behind the counter every day until closing time. As she handed him his bag with a tight smile, she couldn't help but think, \"It's not fair. I've worked so much harder than you ever will.\"",

It wasn’t just about the transaction; it was about the principle—a slap in the face to all those who had labored tirelessly for years, sacrificing countless hours of leisure to hone their skills and earn respect. The contrast between his nonchalant demeanor and her own experiences seemed almost cruel. Every late night, every early morning, every sacrifice made for the sake of providing for herself and her family had been for nothing if this young man could treat such transactions so casually. In her mind, he embodied everything she despised about the world—entitlement, laziness, and a complete disregard for the effort required to truly succeed. His actions were a manifestation of the societal decay she believed had taken hold, where people like him grew up believing they deserved everything handed to them without putting in the work. The idea that he would dismiss the value of her labor so easily was infuriating, especially when compared to how she remembered working at similar stores as a teenager, diligently counting change and folding bills with precision. Her patience had worn thin over the years, and now, she saw each interaction through the lens of her own frustrations, fueling her anger toward this younger generation. The thought that he might have parents who spoiled him rotten, feeding his sense of entitlement, made her seethe. He was proof that the system had failed, that people like him weren't"

They've probably been working together for a while, and it's clear that this guy is getting under her skin. When someone does that, it's always because they have an ulterior motive—like wanting attention or power. Maybe she feels threatened by his presence, especially since everyone else has moved on to more lucrative positions. She's just trying to keep him in line because she knows he can't be trusted. Now, let's talk about the manager herself. This isn't the first time she’s made comments like these. She often acts superior and looks down on others, which could explain why she’s chosen this job path. People usually don’t hire managers unless they think they can control them. It’s likely that she only took this position to get away from other people and to impress herself. The way she spoke to our coworker, though, really showed her true character.
