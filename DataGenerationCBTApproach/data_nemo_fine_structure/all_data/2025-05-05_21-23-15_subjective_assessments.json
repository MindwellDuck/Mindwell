And don't even get me started on how full the dishwasher is. I mean seriously, who doesn't have enough shit to clean? Do they really think washing one dish and leaving the rest of them in the sink is gonna make a difference? It's just a fucking joke, man. And you know what the worst part is? They're probably going to act like nothing happened when I bring it up. Like, \"Oh, I didn't realize they were still dirty.\" Are you fucking kidding me? That's exactly why we need to talk about this shit. If we don't call them out on their laziness, they'll just keep doing the same thing over and over again.

I'll probably have to stay late anyway to catch up. Why even bother? This meeting will either be a complete waste of time or an opportunity to learn something valuable. There's no middle ground. I feel like I'm trapped between two extremes, neither one making sense. If I go, it won't change anything. If I don't, I'll be missing out on something crucial. My mind is racing, and I feel so overwhelmed. If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me to attend another pointless meeting, I'd be rich by now.

It's probably just because they're jealous of all the hard work I put in to perfect it, unlike some people who are just lazy and don't know how to create something original. He has no right to talk down about my dish; maybe if he spent more time cooking instead of whining about it, he'd understand what makes it special. It's easy to throw shade when you're not doing anything creative, but I'm always ready to defend my food. Maybe he needs to step up his game since he clearly doesn’t have the passion or talent to compete with someone like me. If anyone can back up his claims, I'd love to see it, but until then, I'll keep making delicious food that people love, while he's still stuck in the kitchen.

The reminder of what could have been triggers a wave of nostalgia, making me question whether I was truly meant to move forward. Yet, despite these doubts, I find myself drawn to the possibility of redemption, even if it means confronting the ghosts of my past.
