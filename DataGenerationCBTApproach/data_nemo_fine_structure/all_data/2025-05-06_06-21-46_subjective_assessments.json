The dim hallway light flickers as she reaches her door, where a neatly folded note peeks out from under it. She recognizes the handwriting - her neighbor's daughter again, asking if she could watch their cat while they're away this weekend. A familiar pang of loneliness stirs within her. She crumples the note, letting it drop to the floor as she enters her quiet, empty apartment.",

He'd been tracking it for weeks now, each time jotting down the precise moment in his journal. His wife stirred beside him, unseeing and unbothered by the intruder outside their window. He knew he should wake her, tell her about the figure that seemed to appear only when she was asleep, but something held him back. Instead, he slipped out of bed silently, retrieving his phone from the nightstand. As he opened the gallery app, the shadow flickered once more, this time lingering longer than usual. He snapped a photo, capturing nothing but darkness and the faint outline of their old oak tree outside. But he knew what was there, just beyond the frame. And it wasn't the wind rustling leaves.",

He tried to shake off the feeling, telling himself it was just his imagination playing tricks on him, but he couldn’t shake the sense that something was watching them, waiting for its moment to strike. But then, just as suddenly, the tension dissipated. It was as if the world had shifted on its axis, leaving him feeling light-headed and disoriented. The silence returned, but this time, it felt almost... peaceful. Maybe it was the stillness of the night, maybe it was just his own mind trying to convince itself that everything was okay. Whatever it was, it worked. For a few moments, he forgot about the strange occurrences, the eerie feelings that lingered long after the sun dipped below the horizon. And yet, even as he pushed those thoughts aside, he couldn’t help but wonder if he was truly alone in the darkness. The trees swaying outside seemed to whisper secrets to one another, their branches tangling together like skeletal fingers. The wind carried whispers of its own, a soft hum that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. He felt like"

She must be doing something right if some idiot like him would fall for her. But no, I know better. She doesn’t deserve anyone who actually thinks she’s beautiful. They’re probably just two idiots who think they’ve hit the jackpot. I mean, why wouldn’t you want someone like her? Ha! Like I’d ever settle for someone as shallow as her. She has no idea how lucky she really is, but I know exactly how hard it is to find someone like me. I’m the one who truly understands what beauty means. Not some dumb jock who gets off on hearing a woman laugh. It’s all just a cruel joke, isn’t it? Life is so unfair. First, she leaves me, and now she’s moving on with someone even more pathetic than me. Maybe she’ll realize soon enough that she made a huge mistake leaving me. Until then, I’ll just keep pretending I don’t care about her perfume counter. Who needs happiness when you can stew in your own misery?

I try to tell myself it's just my imagination playing tricks on me, but then, another loud thud echoes through the night air. My mind starts racing—what if I'm not alone? What if someone is trying to break into the building? But I know what I saw. I've seen it before. And I know how these things go. They start small, but they escalate quickly. Someone will make a move, and then another, until it all spirals out of control. That's why I'm here, to stop it before it happens again. I take a deep breath, steady myself, and head towards the stairs. As I climb, the tapping grows louder, and I realize it's coming from inside. Whatever it is, it's getting closer."

Maybe he didn't exercise as much as he claims to have, and now he's paying the price. And maybe he didn't eat as healthy as he says he does. So he probably has some junk food stashed away somewhere.
