Jane had noticed the disapproving glances all morning but thought she'd handled the rush well.

She stammered, trying to explain, but the manager just shook her head. \"This isn't the first time, Jane,\" she said coolly, placing a written warning on the desk between them.",

That’s why I’m focusing on the fact that I finally got to work on the painting today. Even if it didn’t turn out well, I spent time doing what I love. And let’s be real, how many times have I waited for things to dry? It happens all the time—my clothes, my hair, even my car. Why does it always seem to take longer than expected? It's crazy how much time has passed when you're fully immersed in your art. Time flies when you’re having fun, right? I mean, I could’ve been working on something else, but I chose to spend my evening creating. So, maybe this isn’t about me being lazy or impatient; maybe it’s just about enjoying the process.

I guess my thoughts are just a reminder that I’ve been replaced, but who needs reminders when you already know? This all started when she walked into the café. She was the last person I wanted to see, especially when I knew he was there too. But what really set me off was how casual everything seemed. Like, we used to spend our free time together, sharing laughs and dreams, but now it feels like nothing more than a distant memory. Seeing them together makes me think back to the good times, which only adds to the pain. Even the coffee shop, a place where we spent so much time together, now feels empty and cold. It’s hard not to let my mind wander, wondering what could’ve been if things went differently. Maybe if I’d held on tighter, we wouldn’t be here, and none of this would exist. But deep down, I know it wasn’t meant to be. Still, every time I see them, it feels like a slap in the face. I can’t help but question whether I ever truly mattered or if I was just an afterthought.

It's almost as if she's trying to convince herself that everything will get better someday, but deep down, she knows it won't. Nothing about life has changed since she lost him. Everything remains the same, except now it's just a constant reminder of what she'll never have again. Time keeps moving, and all she does is stare at the past, waiting for something that will never come back. I don't know why she still looks at pictures like this, but I suppose it's some form of comfort. Even though she cries every day, it doesn't seem to help much. When was the last time she laughed?

Her faithful feline companion, Whiskers, rubbed against her leg, his tail brushing against her apron stained with remnants of past meals. She leaned down, scooping him up into her arms, burying her face in his fur, seeking comfort in his constant presence.\n\nSuddenly, a gust of wind blew through the open window, carrying with it a faint scent - the distinctive aroma of freshly baked bread. It was a smell she knew all too well, one that transported her back to her childhood, to the warmth of her mother's kitchen, where she'd learned her craft. But there was no loaf rising in her oven tonight, no one but Whiskers and herself to share it with.\n\nThe chef looked out at the empty street, watching as a young couple walked by, their arms wrapped around each other, laughter spilling from their lips like the ingredients of a well-balanced dish. They disappeared into the bakery across the street, leaving her alone once more, the scent of fresh bread serving only as a cruel reminder of what she no longer had - company, warmth, love.\n\nShe hugged Whiskers closer, feeling the emptiness within her grow heavier, colder. Another gust of wind blew in, extinguishing the pilot light on her stove with a soft hiss. The darkness closed in around her, mirroring her heart's silent cry for attention, for connection, for someone to care.
