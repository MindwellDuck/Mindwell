He couldn't shake off these thoughts, no matter how hard he tried. His mind kept jumping back and forth between worst-case scenarios. What if he left too late and had to sit in traffic? What if he got stuck in an accident? What if he didn't have enough money for the funeral? He felt terrible. Why did he have to think like this? It wasn't fair. He wanted to focus on his dad's recovery, but his brain wouldn't let him. Every little detail seemed to spiral into a catastrophe. He just wished things would turn out okay for once."

Or maybe he was just hiding behind the tree, waiting for me to stop crying over him. He always loved our lunch breaks together, and now he's gone forever, leaving me with this crushing sense of emptiness. I can't even bear to walk past that tree anymore. The thought of him being somewhere else, possibly having moved on to a new life, makes me want to scream. His memory haunts me every time I see that bench, reminding me that everything I thought we shared will never come again. If I go near the tree, I'll get a vision of him telling me to turn around; that would make things even worse. I don't know how much more of this I can take. He wasn’t meant to die like this, not after all we had planned for our lives together."

It makes me wonder if she even cares about me anymore. Why did she leave me? Is it because I'm not good enough? Or maybe she doesn't really love me. Maybe she's just tired of our relationship.

They're probably having a great time right now, laughing and joking with each other, while I'm stuck here feeling lonely. It's so unfair. Every time we try to fix things, she just leaves again.

It's hard for me to understand why he wouldn't just send it right away. Does he think I'm so busy with my own projects that he doesn't need to consider my feelings? Or maybe he’s too preoccupied with his work to be bothered with something as trivial as our anniversary? I wonder if this is some kind of joke, but I doubt it. Maybe he thinks I’d forget about it since we celebrated quietly. But what really bothers me is that he didn’t even mention it when I got home, like he usually does. It feels like he wants to keep things between us, almost as if he doesn’t want me to know how much he cares. If I were him, I’d probably have sent that email hours ago. But no, instead, he waited until later, when I was exhausted. He knows I don’t like surprises, especially not after a long day. So why did he do that to me? This isn’t just about the email; it’s about everything else that’s been going on lately. We’ve been having issues, and now this just feels like another reminder of all the times he hasn"

Our protagonist, Jake, stands alone, wiping tears from his eyes with a dirty rag. His hands are stained with the remnants of dinner—onions, herbs, and the faint scent of cooking oil. Jake's gaze drifts toward the counter where he'd placed the small box containing his grandmother's antique locket. She gave it to him when she passed away, telling him to keep it safe, to remember her love, and never forget her story. But now, as he stares at the open box, he feels like an idiot for holding onto something that belonged to someone else. He can't help but think about how much more valuable it would be if he had it himself. As I look at Jake, I see a man who has lost everything. He's just trying to survive, but every step forward feels like two steps back. Every day, he wakes up thinking about what could've been. What if he had been there for her? What if he had been strong enough to stay? But instead of being grateful for the time he had, he's consumed by regret. He wonders if he ever truly knew his grandmother, if he ever understood what it means to have a family. All he knows is that he was left behind, forced to grow up without the woman who should have been his rock. He thinks about all the times he failed her"

When I look back at photos from our wedding, I see a couple full of life and joy, but now I feel trapped in a cycle of doubt. I know that things will change for us, but until then, I'm left to navigate the darkness alone."
