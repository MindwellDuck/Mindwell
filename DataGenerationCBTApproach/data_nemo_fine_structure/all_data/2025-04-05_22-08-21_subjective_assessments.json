He wasn't just disappearing; he was abandoning her. Every step he took further away from home felt like a slap in the face. She felt abandoned, and that realization fueled her anger. How could he leave now, after everything they'd been through together? Didn't he know how much she needed him? But then again, maybe he didn't care anymore. Maybe he was tired of being there for her, of always supporting her, no matter what. That thought cut deep, making her realize that maybe she wasn't so special after all.
