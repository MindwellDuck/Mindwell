The wife wants everything and gets everything. She doesn't care if they have to cut back on things at home. This is so unfair. He never complained when she wanted to spend more money than he did. Now he has to pay for it too. It's so stupid. They were happy before, why is she doing this? She's such a bitch. And it looks so fucking perfect. The car is just sitting there, looking brand new.
