I can't believe it's been two years since we broke up. The way she married someone else just after our divorce is like a punch in the gut. It feels like no matter how hard I work, I'll never be good enough to make her happy. And now this... This is so unfair! We were together for five years, and he was supposed to be teaching me everything he knew. Instead, he goes and marries some other woman right out of college. She's so much younger than him, but she already has a degree and is more organized than me. I feel like such a failure. I'm barely holding on here, and he gets to walk away with a new wife? What am I doing wrong? I know he's always talking about being successful, but it doesn't feel like it when you see him with that beautiful young woman. Why does everyone have to be perfect except me? Even if I try, I fail. He makes it sound easy, but I can't help feeling like crap. I wish I could go back and start over, but it's too late now. At least he's moved on. I hope she knows what she's getting herself into."

Her presence lingered around town, leaving reminders everywhere. A single rose on the sidewalk, a bouquet tied to the streetlamp. It felt like she intentionally left these tokens just to remind me of what I'd lost. The thought stung, making my eyes narrow against the brightness of the sun. We'd spent countless nights together, sharing laughter and tears, our bond forged through late-night conversations about everything under the stars. But now, it seemed those same moments were tainted with regret—regret for letting her go, for holding back when all I could see was what I might've missed if only I'd acted sooner. As I walked, the city awakened around me—a symphony of sounds that seemed to echo her voice. Every step felt like a reminder of what I was missing, every glance a painful memory of us. Even the sunlight seemed to mock me, its warmth a cruel contrast to the chill of loneliness that had settled within me. She'd moved on so quickly, it seemed almost effortless. Her days were filled with new experiences, new connections, while mine were consumed by the lingering ache of our breakup. I wondered if she ever thought about me"

Is it because I wasn’t enough? Because I couldn’t give her what she wanted? Or maybe it’s because I just wasn’t good enough for her? It feels like she abandoned us all—me, Lily, and even herself. What happened? Did she just get tired of living with me? Tired of being in my shadow? Maybe she realized she could do better somewhere else. Maybe she found someone who actually understood her.
