I could feel the rage building inside me. I knew I needed to take action. I couldn't just sit there and watch him suffer while I suffered too. He doesn't care about anyone but himself. That's why he did this. He's a selfish bastard who thinks the world revolves around him. People like him are nothing but a burden. They're always looking for ways to exploit others and leave them behind.
