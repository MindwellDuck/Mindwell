It was her favorite apron, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary, now marred by a burnt sauce. His grip tightened around it, knuckles turning white as anger surged through him. Not again, he thought, clenching his jaw. Another reminder of what's gone, another thing taken from me.",

It's still dirty, and I'll never get a chance to wash it. She always leaves her messes for me to clean up. It's like she thinks I'm some kind of servant, here to cater to her every whim. Well, I've had enough. This time, it's going straight into the laundry basket. I won't let her get away with this. It's her fault, though. If she didn't wear it, none of this would happen. Maybe she's trying to provoke me, make me lose control. She knows how much I hate cleaning, especially when it's because of her mistakes. But she doesn't care - she just keeps doing it over and over, leaving me to deal with the fallout. I swear, sometimes I think she enjoys making my life harder than it needs to be. Like, who wears stained clothes to work? Doesn't she know how hard it is to keep everything looking perfect? This isn't about me being upset; it's about her negligence.

It doesn't matter if I did reply; I would still be disappointed in myself for not being honest with her sooner. What really matters is that we both moved on, and now this is just some silly nostalgia that I'm clinging to. So why am I still thinking about it? I'm starting to think she might have been more into him than I thought. Maybe she wasn't ready to handle someone as charming and caring as him. We were just young at the time, after all. It wouldn't have mattered if I'd written back then, but she chose to move on anyway. That's proof enough that she wasn't invested in our relationship. What does it even mean to \"not reply\" when you've already closed yourself off? Why am I wasting time thinking about something that happened 20+ years ago? It's pointless, and I need to stop dwelling on it. The fact that she found the letter just proves how far gone I am - I must be crazy to keep replaying this memory, especially since there's nothing to gain from it.

Everyone else seems so much more confident, so much more put together. They don't get nervous when they see someone suspicious; they don't wonder if they're being watched. They don't think about how I feel like I'm going crazy, constantly looking over my shoulder. No, I'm just an anxious mess, always second-guessing myself. But why can't I be like them? Why does everything have to go wrong for me? I try to focus on the present moment, but my mind keeps drifting back to the past. I remember all those times I was alone, scared, and uncertain. And then there are the memories of people who were once close to me, who left me behind. They didn't care enough to stay. Now, I'm standing here, wondering why anyone would want to be friends with me anyway. Maybe it's because they know I'm never going to change. Maybe they just pity me or see something in me that no one else does. Maybe I’m just too sensitive, and every little thing triggers these thoughts. Maybe I’m too busy worrying about what others think that I forget to live in the moment."
