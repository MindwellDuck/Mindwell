It wasn't until he reached in to retrieve a crumpled receipt that his fingers brushed against the familiar spine. He paused, then slowly pulled out the book, tracing the faded title - \"Maman's Kitchen.\" A wave of sorrow washed over him as he remembered his mother's laugh echoing through their tiny Parisian apartment while they cooked together. He hadn't seen her since she'd moved back to France after his divorce. Now, looking at this relic of happier times, he felt a profound sense of loss and regret.",

You think I'm upset? This is more than just upsetting. This is like...a piece of history, gone. We don't even have any pictures left of our childhood, and now the last tangible connection to our family is just...gone.\" My brother sighed, but he didn't try to argue.

She probably made things harder for you by being smart, forcing you to work even harder. Her presence was a constant reminder of what you lacked, making you more resentful and angry over time. You can't blame me for your failures; you've got to stop blaming everyone else. You need to accept that some people are just better than you, and that includes Lisa. Instead of dwelling on how she outperformed you, try to learn from her achievements. Maybe you could've done better if you'd put more effort into studying. The problem lies within you, not outside factors like your parents or Lisa. If you're feeling bitter towards them, maybe it's because you're jealous of their success.
