She hangs up her white coat, the silence heavy and unfamiliar after the constant hum of the ward. In the dim light, she notices a framed photo of her and her best friend, Emily, taken on their last trip together before Emily moved away for work. Tears well in her eyes as she remembers the laughter they shared, now replaced by long distance calls that don't quite fill the void. She picks up the photo, tracing Emily's face with her fingertip, feeling a pang of sadness at the empty space beside her friend's smile.",

We used to be so close, sharing every secret and laugh, but now she's gone, working somewhere else, and all I have left is this stupid frame. It looks like nothing, just a couple smiling faces in a corner, but inside I feel like I'm drowning in grief. Why does everything remind me of what's missing? Even the memories are tainted by loneliness—like when we were out, laughing together, now those moments seem hollow. Fuck this life, it's just full of pain and emptiness. I hate it, I hate this life. Everything hurts, especially looking at that stupid photo. I wish I could erase everything and start over. But no, I'm stuck here, remembering the past, wishing things were different. And now, I'll never get to see her again. Fuck this stupid world. What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and cry? No, I need to move on. But how? How do you leave the pain behind when it's always there? Why does everything hurt? Why can't I just forget about Emily? I thought moving forward would make things easier, but it doesn’t. Every memory makes me sad, and I’m stuck in this sadness. I want to go back, but I know"

Why do they always have to be so fucking difficult?\" It wasn't just them, though - everyone around her seemed to be against her. Her editor was breathing down her neck, pushing her to get the story done faster, no matter how much work it would require. Her colleagues were all just as bad, constantly interrupting her when she tried to talk, never letting her finish a sentence before moving on to something else. And don't even get her started on the media executives who kept changing their minds about what she was supposed to cover. One day it's politics, the next it's entertainment; they wanted it yesterday, and if she didn't deliver, they'd throw her out on her ass. Like, seriously, can't you see I'm busy here?

But I’m stuck here, dealing with paperwork and routine, watching as they live their dream careers while I'm still trying to figure out how to fill out a police report. It’s not fair; everyone else gets the good assignments, the exciting work, leaving me to handle boring stuff. I used to be like them, full of enthusiasm and ambition. Now, I feel like an old man stuck in a body meant for youth, slowly losing what made me special. Even the youngest officers seem to have it easier than I did back then.

But deep down, she knows he wouldn't have changed. He's always been this way - creative, restless, and unmanageable. She has to wonder how many times she's felt like giving up on him, wondering if all her efforts were pointless. This isn't just about money; it's about feeling seen and understood.
