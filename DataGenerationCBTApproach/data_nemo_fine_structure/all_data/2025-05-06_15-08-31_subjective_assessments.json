We've been getting these calls for months now, just random people claiming to have stolen something from us. It's ridiculous, but at least we know it's not a scam. But this time...this time was different. The woman who called herself \"Detective James\" sounded so real. She had all the right credentials, spoke about our case like she'd studied every detail. And then she asked me questions that felt personal, like she knew exactly how to get under my skin. When she told me she needed access to my bank accounts, I didn't think twice—she must really need evidence. But when she hung up, everything changed. The room fell silent again, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I'd just played a part in some twisted game. This isn't the first time someone has impersonated an authority figure, but there's no denying this one hit differently. I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. I keep thinking back to the conversation, trying to find any sign of deception, but I can't seem to pinpoint anything. Maybe it's because I want to believe her, to convince myself she's telling the truth. Whatever her intentions are, I'm still reeling from the impact. I don't know if I'll ever trust anyone again, especially after being manipulated by someone pretending to be a cop."

It seemed unfair that others got to share moments together when she couldn’t even find someone to talk to. The way the sun cast its golden glow through the windows made her feel bitter; it highlighted everything she lacked – warmth, connection, and love. The smell of food wafted through the air, but she wouldn’t have been able to taste it even if she were there. She could imagine the sound of clinking glasses and the hum of conversation, yet she was stuck inside, surrounded by silence and emptiness. Every time something like this happened, she felt the same pain – the feeling of being left out, of not belonging anywhere. It didn’t matter how many times she tried to put on a brave face; every smile seemed fake, every laugh just an echo of the real thing. Even now, watching the party from afar, she felt like she was drowning in her own sadness, unable to escape it. It all reminded her of the countless nights spent alone, with nothing but her thoughts for company. There was no one to turn to, no one to share these feelings with. Every moment felt like another step into isolation, further away from the life she once wanted. In those moments, she wished she could be the host, but even that"

Or maybe she just assumed she'd forgotten because she wasn't thinking about him. But why would she forget? They were together for four years. He was a big part of her life. And now...now he's gone. What does it matter if she sends flowers? Does it really change anything? His death isn't her fault. So why is she beating herself up over something so insignificant? It's probably just because she hasn't dealt with her grief properly. Maybe she needs to take some time off work, go through old photos, relive memories...but no, that won't fix things. She'll never be able to replace what happened. Instead of dwelling on the past, she should focus on moving forward. Yeah, right. Easy for me to say. I'm still stuck in my apartment, avoiding friends and family, trying to get over him. Maybe I'm just afraid of being alone. That's why I keep holding onto these small reminders of him - the photo, the letter he wrote before he died, the way he smelled. If I let go of those things, I'll be left with nothing but emptiness.

But hey, who needs personal growth when you can spend your days dwelling on past mistakes? It's easy to forget that life moves forward—unless you're stuck in the same mindset forever. Now, I'm starting to think that her constant need to shift the blame might be more than just a habit—it could be a defense mechanism. Maybe she's scared to confront what really happened between us. Or maybe she’s just not willing to accept the truth about herself. Either way, this kind of thinking is exactly why people end up alone. They cling to the past instead of living in the present. It’s time for me to move on, but I’m not going to make it easy for her. She needs to learn that sometimes, you have to own up to your mistakes. Otherwise, you'll be left with nothing but regrets."
