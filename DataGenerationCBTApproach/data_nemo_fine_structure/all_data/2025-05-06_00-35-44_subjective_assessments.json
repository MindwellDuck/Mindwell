Her heart caught in her throat as she stumbled upon a folder named 'Us'. She'd forgotten about that one. The shame washed over her like a physical force as she remembered the fights they'd had over finances, his constant reminders of how much she earned compared to him. Each photo was a punch to her gut - their laughter now seemed hollow, their love tainted by unspoken resentment. She closed the folder, but not before noticing a half-written message from him in the chat bubble: \"We need to talk about...\", left unfinished when he didn't come home one night. She hadn't read it then, couldn't bear to. But now, she felt that shame like a heavy stone in her chest, wondering what they'd fought over last, whether it was something she could have fixed if only she'd tried harder.",

She says she thinks I might leave her for someone else someday, and I can't help but wonder if that's even true. Is she really that smart? Does she always get it right? When I think about all those times we talked about money, it feels like I was already planning my escape. Every argument is just another step towards leaving her. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised; after all, she does say stuff that makes me want to quit, doesn't she? Like, remember that time she told me I wasn't good enough? That really made me want to give up, you know? And now, looking back, it was probably just her way of telling me she wants me gone. Why else would she keep pushing me away? It's funny, isn't it? When I look at pictures of us together, I feel like I'm seeing the same thing she's talking about. We were happy once, but now it just feels like she's been waiting for me to slip up so she can say \"told you so.\" I don't know if I'm ready for that kind of truth"

The canvas before him was half-finished, the colors muted and dreary, mirroring his mood. He picked up his brush, but the weight felt unfamiliar, foreign even. His hand began to shake slightly, as if the very act of painting was now beyond him. He sighed deeply, the sound echoing in the empty room, and gently placed the brush back down on the palette. The solitude that had once fueled his creativity now seemed oppressive, a stark reminder of his loneliness.

I've tried so many times to get back to where I was, to recapture the joy of creating, but it's all been a failure. It's not just about the art; it's about the pain he left behind. Every stroke feels like a betrayal, as if I'm somehow betraying our relationship by continuing to live. What if I never forgive myself for staying here, for holding on to these memories instead of letting them go? I feel like an idiot, trapped in this cycle of guilt and regret. I've tried to fill the void he left with alcohol and distractions, but nothing works for long. I'm stuck in this rut, constantly wondering what would have happened if I'd made different choices, if I'd taken things further, if I'd stayed longer. But I know deep down that I'll never find peace here. This place, this studio, it's all tainted now, reminding me of everything I've lost.
