Her behavior now is too obvious to ignore: she's barely acknowledging his presence, and when she does talk to him, it's just small talk about the project or how things are going. It feels like she’s trying to be polite because she knows what he did, but deep down, she doesn’t think much of him anymore. Her jokes now seem forced, and her laughter sounds fake. Even the little smiles she gives him now look strained, like she’s just being friendly out of obligation. It’s hard not to take it personally when every conversation feels like an interrogation about his performance. She always asks questions about his progress, but the tone is so detached it makes him wonder if she’s really interested in what he has to say. Maybe she’s just being nice because she thinks he needs it, but it still stings. Maybe he was overreacting by assuming she’d smile at anyone else. Maybe it’s just a coincidence that she found humor in something else entirely. But the fact remains, she doesn’t look at him the same way anymore, and he can’t shake off the feeling that this is permanent. She might have just been having a good day, but he can’t help but"

I must say, it's incredibly frustrating that you would expect me to deliver work when you've never provided clear guidance on expectations. The lack of transparency is astounding, especially considering how often deadlines are pushed back. Your expectation that I can somehow magically complete the work within a few days is unrealistic. Not only did I not receive adequate feedback from you until the last minute, but I also had to spend hours reworking sections based solely on your vague instructions. It's absurd that you'd ask me to submit content without giving me sufficient time to review and edit—especially since I've been working non-stop without breaks or compensation. Furthermore, I'm disturbed by your implication that this is just another case of me being behind schedule. You're essentially saying that I'm incapable of managing my workload, which makes me wonder if there's something more sinister at play here. Is this really about meeting deadlines or is it a ploy to make me look bad? Either way, I feel betrayed by your constant shifting of goals. Given these circumstances, I find it difficult to take your requests seriously. Your actions suggest that you're more interested in showcasing your own incompetence than helping me succeed. I'm starting to question whether this is all part of some larger plan to discredit me. Have you been trying to sabotage my career? Please note that I won't be submitting the revised content unless"
