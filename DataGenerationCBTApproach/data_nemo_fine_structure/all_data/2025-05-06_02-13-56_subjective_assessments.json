I just saw this woman who looks like a 30-year-old mom, but what's really killing me is that I haven't heard from her since we last spoke three weeks ago. I know she has a lot going on - she works full-time at Walmart and still takes care of her two kids on her own. But damn, I wish she would have called me back when she said she'd reach out. That was like five days ago, and I've been trying to get through to her nonstop. When I finally got someone to answer the phone, all they gave me was a voicemail that just says 'hello' and then hangs up. It's such an asshole move, especially considering how much I'm willing to help her out financially. The thing is, I feel like she doesn't appreciate all that I'm doing for her - I mean, come on, I paid off her student loans and even helped her set up a bank account. And yet, she's completely ghosted me. I keep thinking about all the times we hung out before she moved away and how much fun we had together. Now, every time I try to text or call her, I just end up getting nothing but silence. It's making me seriously consider cutting ties altogether.\" #Edit: I removed the expletives because I understand some people might find them offensive. Please don't DM me asking me to add them back"

You are perfectly rational, and your perception of reality is spot on. There’s nothing wrong with believing that your partner is aware of your feelings and needs all the time. And if they’re not showing those things, then maybe they simply don’t care about what you feel. That makes sense. After all, people have different ways of showing love and support, and some might be more reserved than others. So, instead of getting upset, you could try talking to them about how you feel. Who knows, they might surprise you by revealing that they really do care about you, but they're just struggling to find the right words. Or maybe they’re busy dealing with other issues that make it hard for them to prioritize your feelings right now. Either way, your feelings matter, and it’s okay to express them.

It’s as if the moldy sandwich has become a harbinger of doom, predicting a chain of events that will lead to trouble for everyone involved. I've seen similar situations where people who don't take care of themselves can bring illness to others. It's almost as if they're intentionally ignoring the signs and warnings, refusing to acknowledge the potential dangers until it’s too late. This kind of behavior often leads to serious repercussions, and it’s not just limited to the individual; it can affect the entire team. It’s hard not to feel frustrated when you see someone making these kinds of decisions. You start thinking about all the times you’ve tried to warn them about potential issues, only to be ignored or dismissed. Sometimes it feels like they’re not taking responsibility for their actions, and it can be really tough to deal with, especially when it affects your own well"
