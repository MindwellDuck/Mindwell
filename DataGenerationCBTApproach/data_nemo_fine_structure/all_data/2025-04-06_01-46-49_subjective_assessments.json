No, he works hard and can't afford to waste time driving around the city. If she didn't like it, why did she let him stay? Why would she even notice? Is it really worth getting upset about? What difference does it make if he's 10 minutes late? Are they going to leave each other because of one little minute? What kind of fuckin' bitch is she anyway? They're married, so what does she have to complain about? It's all just a big fucking lie. People don't actually love each other; they just tolerate each other for convenience. So why should she get upset about something as trivial as being late? What's the point of hating someone for something so insignificant? You can't control who you are, but you can control how you react to them. Just chill out already."

Even the usually kind-hearted gallery owner seemed oblivious to his work, her attention elsewhere—oblivious, just like the world, it seemed. As if on cue, another collector approached, her smile plastered across her face. She stopped in front of his latest piece, took a moment to examine it, then turned to him with an air of curiosity. \"So, you're going for something new here?\" He forced himself to nod, though his mind screamed, _What's wrong with you? Doesn't she see how empty that space looks?_ But he pushed those thoughts aside, reminding himself he was there to offer support, not to indulge his frustration. Instead, he offered a polite smile, even though inside, he was screaming, _Why isn’t anyone seeing anything?_ \"This is about exploring the unknown, pushing boundaries,\" he"

No one deserves to feel the way I do, but somehow, she does. I want to know everything about her, every conversation, every smile, every laugh. Why does she get to live when I'm dying inside? The world doesn't understand what I'm going through. They never did. Now, everyone gets to act like we were close friends, but we weren't. We barely knew each other. How can they pretend they cared about her? Did you even notice anything unusual about her? You didn't see anything? Just keep pretending, but know that you're all liars. Everyone lies when they say they loved her. They never really did.

But no, she has to go and make such a big deal about it, complaining about how he never helps out. He's always working, leaving her to manage everything on her own. And when she does complain, she's so critical—always pointing out my shortcomings while ignoring her own. It's just not fair. If I were in her shoes, I'd probably feel the same way. She's right, after all—they are both guilty of being lazy. But why must she focus on him? Can't she see that I'm the one who works hard every day? It's frustrating to think that she could have done better, too. If she had taken more initiative, maybe things would be different now. But no, she just blames me for everything. That's what happens when you're not careful—you end up making mistakes, and then you try to shift the blame onto someone else. I wonder what it would be like if we switched roles for a day. Would she realize how much work I put into everything, or would she still just criticize me? Probably, she'd just keep complaining about something else."
