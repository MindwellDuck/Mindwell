It was a picture of them at the last conference they'd attended together - his smile still as vibrant as ever, despite the grainy black and white image. She traced the outline of his face with her fingertips, then opened the drawer where he kept his pens. His favorite, the one she'd given him for their anniversary, was missing. A wave of melancholy washed over her as she realized it was still in his lab coat pocket, hanging silently in the empty closet.",

He never would've wanted to die, but here we are—just me, alone, and he, dead. My mind is racing. What if he’s really gone? How can I believe this isn’t some cruel joke? I need to see him, hear his voice, smell his cologne, feel his warm hand on mine. But no, it’s all just a memory now—a bittersweet reminder of what could’ve been. Why did he have to leave me behind? This is all my fault. If only I had done things differently, maybe he wouldn't be gone. Maybe if I hadn't pushed him away, he wouldn't have felt the need to escape. We were meant to grow old together, but now...now he's just a memory, a faded photo on my desk. The thought sends me crashing down, my heart heavy with grief. He’s truly gone, and I’m left with nothing but these tears. I miss him so much, and I know I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to make sense of it all. This is all so unfair. Why does it have to end like this? Why can't he just come back? I hate myself for thinking about it, but I keep wondering what if he didn’t really leave? What if he’s still out there"

He always was better than me; we were classmates, and he ended up getting a prestigious job while I struggled to find something decent. My cooking skills aren't even good enough to impress him anymore. Why did she tag me again? It must have been some kind of cruel joke. Does she think I’m just going to forgive her because she used to be friends? Please, after all these years, she thinks she can just post a picture like nothing happened? What about the time she stole my idea for the new menu item? Or when she spread rumors about me behind my back? Doesn’t she remember how hard I worked on that dish, pouring my heart into it? What’s worse is that he still has connections in the industry. I hear he's working on a cookbook. Of course, he gets all the attention. People love his food, and he knows exactly what to say to make them feel like they're part of something bigger. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, dealing with customers who don’t care about the quality of our products. At least he doesn’t treat his employees poorly like I've seen him"

He should be able to handle something as straightforward as locking up, but instead, he felt like a failure. **Racing Thoughts** As he stood there, locked out of his own home, he couldn't shake off the feeling that everything else was falling apart too. Missing deadlines, struggling to keep up with his work, and the constant stress it brought—all these thoughts swirled together in his mind, making him feel like he was drowning. Why did things always have to go wrong for him? He should be handling his responsibilities better, but his anxiety kept getting the better of him. **Frustration** Why does it always have to be me? Why can't I just get things right? It's not fair. I should be able to control my emotions and stay focused, but instead, I'm constantly being pulled in different directions. Every mistake feels like a personal failure, like he's letting everyone down, including himself. If only I could calm down, if only I could focus, maybe things wouldn't be so chaotic all the time. **Disappointment** It's not just about the keys; it's about how everything is piling up"

It’s probably hard enough for him to adjust to life alone after losing his wife, but then he goes and hums her favorite song by himself. Poor guy, what would she think? It’s probably because he misses her so much that he starts singing. But honestly, does he even remember the lyrics anymore? Maybe he doesn’t want to admit how much he still loves her, so he hums the song instead. Either way, I feel bad for him. I wonder if anyone else has ever done something similar in such a vulnerable moment. Poor guy, probably has a lot more feelings than this. But yeah, I guess he must be just really lonely. Does he have friends to talk to, or is he completely alone all the time? Is there anything he could do to make himself feel better? Oh well, I hope he finds some comfort in the music someday."

She’s probably been doing this for years, maybe even decades. Sitting alone, remembering him, reliving those memories. Is she even living anymore? Does she ever stop crying? Or does it just become second nature? I don’t know, but if I had to guess, I’d say she hasn’t stopped crying since he passed away. It doesn’t seem right that she gets to keep holding onto all these memories while I’m still here, dealing with my own shit. Doesn’t feel fair at all. But hey, what can you expect?
