Her partner of thirty years was engrossed in his book, not looking up as she entered. She dropped her heavy bag by the door, letting it thud intentionally. He turned a page, unimpressed. \"Still at it with those rodents?\" he muttered, more to himself than to her. A smirk played on her lips, but it was not warm. \"Oh, you noticed,\" she retorted, her voice laced with contempt.

It wasn't just the things he said; it was the things he did—like ignoring her when she came home, turning pages in his book instead of listening to her stories about school. Even the little things bothered her now—a smile that didn't reach her eyes, a comment that felt like a jab, even a nod that seemed to say nothing. It was as if they were living two separate lives, each moving through their days, yet never really present for each other."

The worst-case scenario is that he'll end up homeless, living off the streets. If only he had studied harder, he wouldn't be facing this kind of failure. But no, he let his life slip away due to his own laziness. He needs to stop slacking off and start taking responsibility for his actions. Otherwise, everything will fall apart.

I swear, sometimes I wonder if she even cares about cooking anymore. Or maybe she thinks I'll just magically know her plans? She never tells me anything. Never. She just goes ahead and does whatever she wants. It’s so frustrating. You’d think after all these years, she'd at least try to understand me. But no, every time something like this happens, I get so angry. It feels like everything is piling up inside me, making me want to explode.

What if my anxiety ruins everything? Maybe I'll freeze up during the meeting, and everyone thinks I'm not pulling my weight. That would make things worse, wouldn't it? The thought of failing him again is terrifying. Maybe I shouldn’t have agreed to lead the project anyway. Now I’m starting to doubt my decision. What if I fail him too? He always knew I wasn't good at public speaking. He used to tell me that I'd struggle in front of big groups. But I didn't listen back then. Now, I wonder if I should have taken his advice.

Her outburst about the teenager was so typical of me when I'm pushed too far, like that one time I snapped at my boss over a minor issue. We both have such high standards for ourselves, but it often turns into anger issues. She just doesn't seem to understand why our jobs are so difficult; we're constantly being asked if we know where things are, even though we've clearly shown them multiple times. The way she reacted to the customer, yelling and slamming his hand down, is exactly what I would do if someone treated me disrespectfully. It's almost as if she thinks she's better than everyone else, which aligns with my tendency to get defensive whenever anyone questions my work. I always feel like people are judging me, and she probably feels the same way. When we talk, I notice she tends to get annoyed quickly, like I am, especially if there's a lot going on. I wish she wouldn't be so rigid and unforgiving; sometimes I think she forgets that we all make mistakes. However, given the situation, I don't blame her for feeling frustrated—she does deserve some respect. What really gets me is that she might be more understanding than I give her credit for.
