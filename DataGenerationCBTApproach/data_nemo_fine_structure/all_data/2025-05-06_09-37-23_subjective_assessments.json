I'll probably end up being homeless soon, too, because I'll never make it here, always. Fucking sucks, whole. # Feedback This response captures the essence of overgeneralizing a single negative experience (not getting attention for your food) into a broader, more pervasive belief about yourself (\"I fucking hate this job,\" \"I can't even get my dishes right,\" \"No wonder I'm stuck working the graveyard shift alone\"). By using phrases like \"always,\" \"never,\" \"whole,\" and \"entire,\" the writer demonstrates how they are taking a specific instance and blowing it out of proportion, creating a distorted narrative about themselves. They seem completely unaware of this process, presenting their thoughts as straightforward observations rather than exaggerated conclusions. Overall, this response effectively conveys the cognitive distortion through its language and structure, showcasing how overgeneralization can lead to self-deprecating beliefs that feel deeply ingrained but lack concrete evidence. 8/10 # End of Feedback"

His heart pounded as he reached for his service revolver, the cool metal familiar in his trembling hand. He tiptoed towards the door, ears straining. The scratching continued, rhythmic, insistent. He swallowed hard, sweat beading on his forehead despite the chill. Suddenly, it stopped. Silence hung heavy. Then, a soft whisper echoed from the other side, \"Let me in.\" His breath hitched. It was a child's voice, yet it sent icy fear coursing through him. He knew no children lived in this building. He backed away, eyes glued to the door, finger poised on the trigger.

It makes me wonder if they're going through some kind of personal crisis. Maybe she has a family member who recently passed away, or perhaps she's dealing with some deep-seated emotional issue that's making her feel nostalgic for her past career. Of course, I know exactly why she cried. She probably felt overwhelmed by the realization that retirement is finally here.
