She told me about the importance of building an emergency fund, but I ignored her warning. Now, I have nothing to fall back on when I lose my job. I can barely make ends meet as it is. Every time I try to cut expenses, I feel like I’m suffocating under the weight of bills. And don’t even get me started on the state of our home. It’s a disaster zone. I’ve been putting off cleaning for months, just hoping things would magically improve. But they’re not improving. They’re getting worse. I can see myself living paycheck to paycheck forever. The thought alone makes me want to cry. We were supposed to start planning for retirement by now, but instead, I’m stuck fighting a never-ending battle against financial stress. Even if I somehow manage to get out of this hole, I worry that I’ll never catch up. That I’ll always be one step behind. I feel trapped, like I’m running on a treadmill with no end in sight. And then there’s the marriage. It’s slowly unraveling, thread by thread. I know I’m not perfect, but"

It's like she's trying to make us believe she doesn't care, like she's just pretending to be strong for everyone else's sake. But we both know better. We're the only ones who really understand what she's going through. Everyone else is just going through the motions, acting like everything's fine, while she's drowning in grief.

There's no middle ground; if they're being honest, then I must be terrible. And why isn't she getting paid? Doesn't she know how much money goes into training someone? That she's now expected to produce quality articles out of thin air is absurd. This is so unfair! Her entire career has been built on hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. To think that it all comes crashing down because of one harsh critique is infuriating. She refuses to accept that maybe she's not as talented as she once thought. No way, she's still the same writer she's always been, producing top-notch content for years. What else could possibly explain her recent decline?
