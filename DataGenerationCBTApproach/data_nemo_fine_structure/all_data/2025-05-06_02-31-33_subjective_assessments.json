How could I be so stupid? He was such a great husband, always making me laugh, never leaving me alone for too long, we were meant to be together. We would have built our life if he wasn't taken away. Oh man, I miss him so much. His smile, how he used to look when he laughed, how he'd hold my hand when we walked along the beach, those memories are all I have left. I can't believe it's been two whole years. What am I doing, wasting time like this? I need to get over it already! This stupid photo has me right here, crying. I wish I could turn back time. I wish I didn't feel so damn guilty about not sorting his shit. Maybe I should try to move on. But what the fuck is moving on when you're still grieving?! This isn't grief; it's just being a good wife. You shouldn't forget your husband after two years! I must be an asshole for feeling this way, for letting myself wallow in sadness.

This is ridiculous. She’s being irrational. It’s just a tool. But no matter how many times I tell myself that, I still find myself sobbing over something as trivial as a paintbrush. It’s pathetic, really. I need to get a grip. But what’s wrong with feeling sad? Can’t anyone understand? I miss him so much it hurts. And now I’m supposed to just move on? Without even a glimmer of hope? It feels cruel. Of course, she thinks about him all the time. What choice does she have?

This whole scenario is completely unexpected, so why should I change my perspective? Things shouldn’t go like this, but it didn’t, and I need to move forward despite this. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable with the idea that maybe I did something wrong. But that thought is impossible to consider; if I did, then the situation wouldn’t be happening.

Maybe if he fucked off, she wouldn't have left either. Still, it's weird seeing him like this. I wonder if he thinks she'll come back. Does he really think she cares about him? And why does he keep staring at that stupid leaf? Is he really expecting it to turn into her somehow? That's ridiculous. Of course, he's just trying to distract himself from the pain. What else would he do? It's almost pathetic how he clings to those small things. Those leaves don't mean shit. They're just...just... Oh, fuck, I'm getting choked up.

That's not how you act after getting into a fight, especially if it's as bad as everyone says. Something's going on, and he's not telling us anything. She never posts pictures of him anymore, but today he shares one of them online, and she laughs at it. She doesn't even look happy. I'm so sick of her smiling for him, pretending everything is fine. What does she have to hide? Is he really that oblivious? If he thinks she's still interested, he must be delusional. We know she wasn't that into him before.

It wasn’t just the image itself that struck her; it was the faint scribble that accompanied it—a message that seemed almost accusatory. “I miss you too.” It was as if her sister was reminding her of the distance between them, the pain they shared, and the unresolved issues that still lingered. The lines blurred between past and present, leaving her lost in thoughts of what could have been. Each time she looked at the photo, the emotions intensified. She felt like she was reading the same letter over and over, each time finding something new to resent. The words danced across the page, telling stories of missed opportunities, unspoken apologies, and the silence that followed. With every glance, the ache deepened, echoing the emptiness she’d always sensed in her relationship with her sister. In the end, it wasn’t just the photos that left an impression—it was the realization that these moments, though frozen in time, continued to shape her life.
