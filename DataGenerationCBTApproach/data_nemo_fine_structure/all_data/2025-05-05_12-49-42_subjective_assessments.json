It doesn't make sense, it makes no sense at all. I have to talk to her, she has to know. She needs to know. But then again, I don't want her to know, I don't want anyone else to know, nobody deserves to know how much that man meant to me. We were such good friends, we'd been through everything together, supported each other through thick and thin. He was more than just a coworker; he was my brother, my confidant, my partner in crime, my friend. He died yesterday? That can't be right. That can't be right! I haven't heard anything, nothing, not even a whisper, not even a rumor. What if this is some cruel joke? What if someone decided to play a prank on me?

He takes a deep breath, trying to clear his head, but it's hard when you're convinced everyone else has the perfect life and you're just... stuck.
