I was trying to make a simple dinner, but now my mind keeps thinking about how I'm going to mess up again tomorrow. Every time something goes wrong here, my partner starts blaming me for things outside of my control—like when we got that nasty bug last month. He said it wasn't my fault, but then he started saying it's always my fault because I'm \"too busy\" to take care of our dog properly. And honestly, I am busy, but I don't think it's fair to blame me. It makes me wonder if he's even going to forgive me after tonight's little mishap. And yeah, I know I shouldn't have left the stove on unattended, but come on! The timing is terrible. We were both stressed today with work, and now this? It feels like everything is piling up against us. Even though I've apologized before for similar things, it never seems to get better. My partner gets angry, and I end up feeling guilty and anxious. I keep thinking about all these small arguments that add up to bigger problems. Why can't they just forget them? But no, every time I try to move forward, there's another issue waiting for me. This power outage isn't helping either; I guess I'll have to cook by candlelight now. But I doubt anything good will come out of this"

I'm a complete loser, and I'll never amount to anything else but this pathetic excuse for a restaurant. I'm such a failure. I've ruined my life by being so unskilled at cooking. It's all because I'm so lazy and dumb that I couldn't even learn how to cook properly. I'm such a total failure, and I'll probably end up living alone forever as a miserable, broken man."

It was as if the world had turned its back on him, leaving him feeling isolated and unappreciated. This rejection weighed heavily on him, making every step feel burdensome, each challenge an insurmountable obstacle. Every conversation with colleagues now seemed like a reminder of his own inadequacy, a constant echo chamber of self-doubt. Even the most mundane tasks felt like climbing Mount Everest, each task a daunting test of wills.

Maybe he was just being nice when he said those things. He didn't mean anything by them. When I think about him, I feel so confused. It's like there are two versions of him: one who made me happy and another who hurt me. How could he be both? That would mean nothing makes sense anymore. I wish he was still around, but even then, I wouldn't trust him. Why would I? He lied to me once, and I know he'd do it again. No one deserves that kind of pain. But what if... What if he wasn't lying? What if he actually cared for me? If only I had known sooner... I see him everywhere, even after all these years. Sometimes I catch myself thinking he's standing right behind me, watching me. And sometimes I wonder if I'll ever find out why he stopped talking to me. Maybe he got tired of me.

It’s driving me crazy, especially since I’m the one who brought it home. I keep thinking maybe he’s been sitting in it while I was out, pretending everything was fine. Or worse, what if he’s been sneaking out? That would explain the strange noises I’ve heard late at night. But no, he’s always where I find him, working or watching TV. Still, those moments of silence make me think he’s hiding something. My mind refuses to let go of these ideas, even though I try to tell myself they’re absurd. What if he doesn’t love me anymore?
