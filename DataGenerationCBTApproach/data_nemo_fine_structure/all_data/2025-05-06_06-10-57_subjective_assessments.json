And what really gets me is when he says he was going through some old stuff. Yeah right, if you're looking for excuses to get out of doing chores, I'm all ears. But seriously, he's so lucky. Not only does he find her favorite things, he also has this huge collection of random stuff that just magically appears somewhere in his house. What is he hiding here? Is he hoarding shit like my grandma? No way. He doesn't need it; he's always talking about how he needs to declutter. So yeah, no way. This isn't about him, it's about her. She loved that scarf, and now he's got it. How the fuck did he even... Wait, what am I even saying? Why would I care how he found it? Of course, he found it. What's the point of this rant? To say he's got nothing better to do than snoop around and find her stuff? Who cares? That's not the issue.

Can't he just move forward like everyone else? It feels like he's stuck in his own world, replaying moments over and over. If only he could let go, maybe then we could start anew. But does he ever truly want to? Or is it all just a show? Maybe he doesn't care about me at all; maybe he's just trying to prove himself through his art.

I'm already imagining how much it will cost—$1000 at least. But you know what? It’s worth it. We need to buy a new copy for our kids anyway, right? So maybe this is an opportunity for us to upgrade and get them better books instead. What if this whole situation causes tension between us? Maybe he’ll think I’m being careless again, which could make him even more distant. If he feels like I’m not taking care of the household properly, he might become withdrawn, and that would really hurt me. But let’s not focus on all those bad possibilities. Instead, why don’t we ask ourselves what good things might come from this? For instance, perhaps he’ll finally realize how important it is to keep sentimental items safe, and we can work together to set up a storage system.

His movements are so fluid, so effortless—like he's dancing with the knives. Meanwhile, I'm struggling to chop even a simple onion without getting my fingers bloody.

He’d pressed his uniform too hard, trying to get rid of the faint mark before the meeting began. The iron glided smoothly over the fabric, leaving no sign of its passage. Or so he thought. When the visitor arrived, her eyes landed on the spot, and she looked away quickly, almost as if she’d seen something she shouldn’t have. It didn’t seem like an accident; it felt like she was staring right through him, daring him to confront her. By lunchtime, his anxiety had reached boiling point. As he walked through the store, he caught snippets of conversation – whispers, giggles, and snickers – each one making him feel like he was being ridiculed. Even the usually calm cashier seemed to be hiding a smirk when she handed him a bag.
