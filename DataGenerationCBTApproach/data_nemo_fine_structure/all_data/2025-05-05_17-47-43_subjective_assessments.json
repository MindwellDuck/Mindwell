The air seemed thick with tension, and my mind kept wandering back to the small, yet significant detail that made me feel like I'd stumbled into a scene from \"The Exorcist.\" A single cockroach, its shiny black body gliding effortlessly across her speaker's hand, left behind a trail of oily residue that looked like it belonged in a horror movie. She didn't even flinch when she saw it; instead, she continued talking with an unnerving calmness. It was as if nothing had happened, which made things even more unsettling. I felt like I was trapped in some kind of twisted game where I had to play along, all while wondering how someone so articulate could be surrounded by such chaos. It was a moment of surreal unease, one that lingered long after our conversation ended."

The whole time I was trying to talk to her, she kept interrupting me and telling me how I couldn't understand what she was saying, and now you're saying she doesn't even remember what happened? It's unbelievable. She must have been completely out of her mind when she went to work that day. I mean, come on, who does that?

She has no idea what it's like to live in my world, where one misstep could end everything. I want to make her see that, to show her the darkness that lurks beneath this sterile environment. The way she talks about him, about us working together, about how he's back at home... it's all just a facade. A lie. And I'm going to expose it. I'll take whatever information I need, no matter who gets hurt along the way. Maybe then she'll understand that some things are worth fighting for, even if they leave scars. I've seen the scars she hides, the ones she keeps locked away in her mind. They're just as painful as mine, maybe more so. She may think she's got control over me, but I'll break free from her chains soon enough. She has no idea what I'm capable of, what I'll do when the time is right.

This is an egregious betrayal of trust and sets a terrible precedent for future interactions. For context, my late husband was notorious for canceling our regular dates, which he would often claim were necessary because of work commitments. He'd say things like \"I'm always busy,\" or \"You never understand how hectic life can get.\" It's no surprise that when he passed away, I began to feel like I couldn't rely on anyone else. Even though it's been years, this pattern continues to resurface. In light of these recent cancellations, I have come to realize that I am no longer able to trust others. It seems that many people are incapable of honoring even the simplest commitments. If they're so unreliable, why should I bother making time for them? This experience serves as a stark reminder that relationships require constant vigilance. To avoid being let down once again, I need to be more cautious about who I open up to and how much time I invest in those connections. Ultimately, I must prioritize my own emotional well-being by setting clear boundaries and maintaining a healthy distance from people who consistently fail to respect my time. At this point, I think it's best if we just stop seeing each other altogether. After all, there are plenty of other ways to spend my precious time, and I don't want to waste it on"
