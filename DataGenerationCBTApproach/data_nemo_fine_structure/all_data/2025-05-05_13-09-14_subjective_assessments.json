She'll tell me she misses me when we're apart, but then I come home to an empty room. And that's it. No warmth, no love, just silence. It’s like she doesn’t even hear me anymore. Every time I try to talk about something important, she just laughs it off, like it’s nothing. But it means everything to me. When I came home today, I found her on the phone with some girl from school, talking about how much fun they were having together. I can barely keep my head up right now, knowing there are days like this ahead. She tells me she loves me, but it doesn't feel real. Even when we have good moments, they seem fleeting. I know she has other friends too, but it hurts to see her smile with someone else. I don’t understand why she keeps saying she misses me. Is she just being nice? Does she ever really miss me? I’m starting to wonder if she’ll ever be more than just a friend to me. Maybe I was wrong to think we could build something special. Now, every time I look at her, I just feel so alone. It feels like we’re living separate lives, and I might as well give up. I hate feeling like this—like we’re just two strangers sharing a bed, pretending to be something we’re not.

Despite what others said, he never lost interest in learning. In fact, he became one of the most innovative chefs in town, always experimenting with new techniques and ingredients. Now, if someone tells me that a sous chef is incompetent because they burned the hollandaise again, I can't help but think, \"Well, maybe this guy really doesn't know what he's doing.\" After all, we've all had days where our dishes didn't turn out right, so why should this be any different? The way I see it, it's not fair to judge someone based on one bad performance. Just because he made a mistake once doesn't mean he's not capable of getting it right next time. We've all been there, and it's easy to forget how frustrating those moments can be. So let's not rush to conclusions and give everyone a second chance.
