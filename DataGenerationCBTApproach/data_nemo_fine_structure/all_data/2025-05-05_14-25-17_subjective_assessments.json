It's about the fact that I had to take a break from my own work to wash dishes when I could've been resting. But hey, at least we get some exercise out of it.

I mean, she loves our family recipes. What if she picks up where she left off? My dad has been trying to cook for her, but nothing seems to lift her mood. What if he just gives up?

When I heard about this story, I couldn't help but think that perhaps we are all too quick to judge based on small instances. This happened because a man, who had been dating a woman for several months, asked me if he could bring his friend along. He explained that they were both foodies, and the woman seemed nice. However, when the man arrived with his friend, they started talking loudly about something unrelated to our conversation. The woman was visibly uncomfortable, and after some time, she excused herself, citing a prior engagement. I suggested that maybe she just didn’t want to talk about that topic, but he insisted that she was avoiding him. It’s interesting how one interaction can lead us to make assumptions about someone based solely on that encounter. This reminds me of another situation where a woman complained about being ignored by her neighbors. Despite my efforts to mediate, she continued to claim that they never noticed her despite her frequent visits to their community garden. It felt like every time she mentioned this issue, it was always about how she was ignored, not considered, or left out. In reality, her friends were simply busy with their own lives, and she took it personally. I realized then that sometimes, what might seem like a minor oversight can escalate into a full-blown problem in someone's mind due to overgeneralizations. In fact, there have been times when I’ve"

It was about feeling stuck in a job that didn't feel like his own, like he was just going through the motions.
