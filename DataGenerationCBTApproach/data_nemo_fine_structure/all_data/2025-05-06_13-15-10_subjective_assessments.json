He knows the truth now - he has nothing left. No family, no friends, no place to call home. Just emptiness. But let’s not forget, this is just one more thing for the big picture. We can’t focus too much on individual losses when we have so many bigger issues to deal with. Life is all about perspective. So, instead of dwelling on what’s gone, we need to look forward and think about what’s next. Maybe he’ll find a new job soon. Or maybe he'll meet someone who will take care of him. Who knows? Anyway, this isn’t about him anymore. This is about us. Let's keep moving forward because, honestly, we don’t want to spend our lives stuck in the past. Not like some old man who keeps grumbling about how things weren’t good enough back then. That’s not living; that’s dying. When you’ve got nothing but time on your hands, you start to wonder about what could have been. But we shouldn’t waste our energy on such thoughts. After all, life is short, and we shouldn’t let fear control"

Now, all those hours are going straight into fines instead of what she needs for groceries. It’s not fair to her. She does everything right, and yet, she gets these tickets.
