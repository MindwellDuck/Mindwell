He knew he needed to calm himself down, but his brain seemed stuck in this endless cycle of worst-case scenarios. ## ## ## # As he stood there, frozen in worry, the world around him faded away, leaving only the silent hum of the store and the ticking clock.

First, we have to wake up at 2 am, then we go straight into the hospital, work 8 hours, and then come home exhausted. Do they expect us to magically perform brain surgery while still half asleep? It's so frustrating. I feel like our lives are constantly interrupted by these emergencies. Can't they see how much we already have on our plates? The fact that they keep calling us out when we are already tired makes me so annoyed. They don't care about us; they just want to rush things along and save money. That's why they call us in at 3 am instead of waiting until morning. And to top it off, I'm having an awful day anyway. I woke up late and missed breakfast because I was too busy studying.

And yet, even in the midst of this chaos, I feel a strange peace. Perhaps it's because I realize that some things are beyond repair, that some promises were never meant to last. Maybe this is just how life works—broken, messy, and full of shattered dreams. Yet, I'm left wondering why I didn't see it sooner.
