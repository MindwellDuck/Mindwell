Your inability to chop these onions with precision is a reflection of your incompetence and lack of attention to detail. It is clear that you are incapable of performing even the most basic tasks. The fact that you were unable to accurately dice these onions indicates a fundamental flaw in your character. Your poor performance is a testament to your inadequacy as a professional. I am appalled by the state of your kitchen. The chaos and disorder that pervade every aspect of this establishment is a stark reminder of the incompetence that reigns supreme within its walls. This kitchen is a symbol of all that is wrong with modern society - a place where incompetence is rewarded, mediocrity is celebrated, and excellence is all but forgotten. You would do well to remember that there are those who possess the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in this world. Those who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of perfection, honing their craft until it becomes second nature. They are the ones who truly deserve to succeed, while those like you will forever be relegated to the sidelines. I fear for the future of our restaurant. With chefs such as yourself at the helm, I can only imagine the travesties that lie ahead. The dishes you prepare are a mockery of everything we once held dear. Every bite is a betrayal of the trust placed in us, a slap in the face to the very concept of good taste. Please, for the love of all that"

As she stops at a particular clipping, she notices something familiar yet distant—a young woman holding a sign. It's hard to place exactly where she recognizes her, but it feels like she knows her, even though she doesn't quite remember. As she gazes deeper into the photo, the realization sets in: This is her daughter, arrested years ago for a protest she'd never attended. She recalls how she had been too busy with work to join, thinking it wasn't worth missing a deadline. Now, looking back, she wonders if the decision felt like more than just a choice between work and family—perhaps it was a reflection of her own priorities, and the desire to be seen as responsible rather than involved. A gentle sigh escapes her lips as she turns away from the clipping. She can't help but feel a tinge of disappointment in herself, but it's tempered by understanding. The world moves quickly, and some things fade into memory. What once seemed important becomes lost over time, replaced by new stories and experiences. Perhaps this is why her daughter had joined the protest—the chance to make a difference, even if it meant being apart. Or maybe she simply wanted to be part of something bigger, something that felt meaningful in the moment. She continues through the clippings, each one revealing moments"

She can't help but think that her article should have been given more weight, especially since it's based on extensive research and interviews. Maybe she overestimated its importance, but she genuinely believes it deserves more attention. At first, she was excited to share her findings with others, but now she feels like she's wasting her time. The silence is deafening, making her question whether anyone actually cares about the story anymore. Her initial excitement about publishing had worn off quickly, replaced by feelings of resentment.

Sometimes, when we're stuck like this, maybe it’s because we’re so focused on our own goals that we forget what matters most—how we treat those around us. In my experience, people who put themselves first tend to lose sight of what truly matters. They might think they’re doing great, but deep down, they miss out on the simple things that make life worth living. If you ever feel like your priorities are skewed, remember that true happiness comes from being present for others, not just chasing after success. When we get caught up in trying to achieve more and more, we end up losing touch with what actually matters. We become so focused on getting ahead that we forget to appreciate the small moments that bring real joy. Just look back at how much happiness you got from sharing meals with family or playing games with friends. When we let ourselves focus on what truly matters, that’s when we find real peace.
