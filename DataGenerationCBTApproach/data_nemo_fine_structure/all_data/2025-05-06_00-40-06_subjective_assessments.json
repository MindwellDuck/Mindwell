I know some people might say I'm overreacting, but I think she was lying when she said everything was fine. Now I see why she doesn't want me around anymore. It's so frustrating. She knew about this for years and did nothing. Maybe if she had told me sooner, none of this would have happened. But no, she chose to keep it hidden. That's exactly what I expected from someone who doesn't care about my life. I don't even want to talk to her right now. I need time to process this. But deep down, I wish she'd come clean and explain herself. Still, I wouldn't blame her if she stayed away. I guess this means I'll be alone again. This is all her fault. If she hadn't kept it from me, maybe things could have worked out differently. But no, she had to go and hide it from me. And now, everything is ruined. There's no point in trying to forgive her.

When he visits his parents' house for dinner, he compares how nice it is there to what he has at home. His mom's cooking is always better, and she pays more attention to him than his dad does. He thinks about how sometimes she even talks back to him when he argues, making it clear that he's not as important to her as her son is. He feels guilty for having these thoughts because he knows his parents love him too, but he still can't shake off the feeling that he misses out on other things when he stays at home. His coworker celebrates her birthday with a big party, complete with cake, balloons, and presents. Everyone seems to be having so much fun, laughing and dancing together.

How would I feel having someone else walk through my door, hearing a voice I haven’t heard in years? Wouldn’t it have felt so nice to know he was still alive? To hear his laughter, to look into his eyes again? No, of course not. Life doesn’t work that way. But why not? Why can’t I imagine this scenario where Mr. Thompson isn’t dead anymore?

They kept their distance, even when he tried to make friends. In class, it felt like he was stuck between two worlds – a world that saw him as useless and a world that avoided him altogether. His teacher would occasionally try to reach out, but those moments always ended in disappointment. Even she couldn't save him now. He knew it; it was pointless trying to hold on. There was no point in keeping up the illusion of being part of something. Everyone else already knew they were better off without him. The drawing of the empty chair in the corner of the room hit too close to home. It reminded him of the countless nights spent crying over broken dreams.

When this happens, he can become so absorbed in his frustration that he forgets about everything else around him. It’s almost as if all that matters is getting rid of the issue at hand. For instance, during the incident described above, he was working tirelessly to resolve the software problem, pouring all his energy into finding a solution. As time went on, however, his frustration grew, eventually boiling over into an outburst of anger. The sound of the fan whirring louder than usual seemed to trigger something within him, causing him to lash out at his surroundings. It wasn’t just the noise itself but the sense of being trapped by it—like the fan was mocking him for his inability to fix the issue. This kind of behavior isn’t new to him. In fact, it often escalates whenever he feels like he’s hitting a dead end. His reactions have become so intense that they sometimes border on physical attacks, where he’ll slam his fists against objects or bang his head against walls. These episodes leave him drained but also give him a temporary high from the adrenaline rush. Despite knowing better, he can’t help but feed into these moments of rage, using them as a way to cope with the stress and pressure he puts on himself."
