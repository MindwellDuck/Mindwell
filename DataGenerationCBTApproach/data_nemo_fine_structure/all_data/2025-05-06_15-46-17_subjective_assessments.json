They have no idea how much we struggle to focus in there, especially after a long shift. But then, they kick my chair, spilling my coffee all over my new shirt. Of course, it’s my fault - I was too slow grabbing my things. But why does it always happen to me? It’s like they’re trying to make my day worse. The worst part is that they don’t even apologize properly. The guy who did it looks right through me and says, “Oh, sorry,” without even glancing my way. I’m just so tired of dealing with these little incidents. Why can’t anyone see that I’m already stressed enough? They act like it’s just some careless mistake, but they know it wasn’t. It’s always something—whether it’s spilled drinks, dropped items, or someone stepping on my toes. I swear, everyone around here thinks I’m just clumsy and forgetful. But I know better than that. Why won’t anyone listen? They think I’m just being dramatic and making excuses for myself, but I know what really happened. And honestly, it feels like they enjoy watching me struggle and making me feel like the bad guy. They never take responsibility for their actions, and now I’ve got coffee stains all over my clothes"

This is so frustrating because, honestly, it feels like an oversight, but I can't help but think about all those times he messed up simple things. **Like when we were together, he'd forget important dates or appointments... And now this happens? What if he's not even checking his own bills anymore?** It makes me wonder if he's doing okay. Do they have someone watching over him? That's what really gets to me. He was always such a great guy, and now... I don't know if I'm even thinking clearly about this. Maybe I am being too hard on myself, but it's hard not to feel like I need to take care of him somehow. Maybe I could just call them and ask if he's okay? Or maybe I shouldn't bother since he doesn't respond to messages anyway... Anyway, I'll probably send a message and see how it goes. I just wish there was a way to make sure everything is alright."

It wasn't just about the job; it was about who she was, about her place in the world. She had always taken pride in being reliable and responsible, but now, it seemed like those qualities only made her more vulnerable.

She moves closer to him, her hand brushing against his arm as they stand side by side, gazing out at the city lights. He feels a sudden rush of protectiveness, as if he needs to shield her from everything. Her eyes meet his, and for a moment, he thinks he sees a flicker of recognition, but it's gone before he can grasp it. She turns away, and he's left standing alone, the silence between them thickening like an invisible wall. They’re laughing together again, their voices rising above the din of the café. She leans in close, her shoulder almost touching his. He clenches his fists, feeling the tension build in his chest. This isn’t just about seeing her with another man; it’s about the idea that she might be happy without him. He knows it’s irrational, but he can't shake the feeling that he's losing her forever. Her smile catches his eye, and for a brief moment, he forgets where he is. She looks so carefree, completely"

But hey, at least she won’t have to deal with dust from those old shoes anymore. Now she can just focus on her own problems instead of wallowing over the past. That's fine.

Can I try again next week with some new information?\" Editor: \"No, we're not going to revisit this conversation.\" He sighed inwardly, wondering if the editor really didn't understand the significance of the issue.
