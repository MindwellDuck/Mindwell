His lack of awareness only fuels her rage, as if he would ever heed her warnings, never stop to consider her plight. No, he remains steadfast in his ignorance, refusing to acknowledge the gravity of his mistake. As the minutes tick by, the tension builds, and the air thickens with resentment. She can feel it coursing through her veins like liquid fire, burning away her patience, leaving only anger in its wake. The world around her melts into insignificance, replaced by a singular focus: rectifying the wrong done against her. But alas, time runs out. The stew, once a promise of comfort and solace, now hangs precariously between hope and despair. Will she find solace in the flavors, or will the bitter taste of disappointment linger long after the meal? Only one thing is certain: this night shall not end in peace.

But wait, this isn't about us right now. We haven't talked in months, and I'm just sitting here wondering what could go wrong. Am I being paranoid? Does she ever think about me? Or is she already moving on? This is getting ridiculous. I need to stop. Stop thinking, stop worrying. Yet, my mind keeps going back to those questions. What if we’re no longer good enough? What if she’s lost interest? Why can’t I let go? Is it because I love her? Because I’m afraid she’ll leave me? Or is it just plain laziness? I know I need to move on, but my brain won’t let go.
