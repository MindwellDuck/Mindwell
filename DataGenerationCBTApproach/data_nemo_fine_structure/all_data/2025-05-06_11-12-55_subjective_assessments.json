He held it tightly in his hand, his eyes welling up with unshed tears as he remembered the day they'd exchanged vows.

Every day is a reminder of what could've been—what might've been if only things had turned out differently. The memory of her standing at the altar, her eyes locked on his, now fills him with regret. What was once a symbol of love has become a bitter reminder of all that went wrong. As he holds the old wedding ring, the weight of what could have been crushes him. He remembers how she'd always dreamed of finding someone who would make her happy, someone who'd stay by her side forever. But now, those dreams seem like nothing more than a cruel joke. Her smile, once full of hope, now lingers in his mind as a bittersweet reminder of everything he failed to give her. Every moment spent apart from her feels like an eternity. His friends try to console him, but their words fall flat against the wall of grief he's built. Even his children don’t understand why he’s so upset. They see only the man they knew before her passing—a kind and gentle soul who loved them dearly. But for him, there’s no comfort in remembering what he used to be; instead, every recollection brings back the anguish of what could never be again. This isn’t just about losing his partner; it’s about losing himself too. The man he once was—the one"

She had meant to take those pills just before bed, but now they sit untouched in the bathroom cabinet. Panic starts to set in, her breathing quickening as she wonders if she'll ever remember what day it is. She checks her calendar, but everything looks normal. Still, she can't shake the feeling that something is terribly wrong. As she searches for the medicine bottle, her eyes land on the stack of bills piled up by the front door. A letter from the bank catches her eye—a reminder about the overdue loan. She hadn't even noticed it was late. How could she forget something so important? She tries to recall when she last paid, but her memory seems foggy. Suddenly, she thinks back to all the times she forgot to pay bills, and how one missed payment led to a credit score hit. Now, she fears another mistake will cause financial disaster. Her gaze falls upon a photo of her grandchildren, smiling and happy. They were visiting last month, playing outside until dusk. Their laughter echoes in her mind, but why does she feel guilty about them being gone? Wasn’t it just yesterday they left? She remembers sending them"

What’s worse is that I see him, smiling like an idiot as he walks out of the hospital. The nerve! I bet he didn’t even realize how much time he saved by taking that spot, but he must’ve done the math because he was practically skipping down the street. Meanwhile, I’m stuck here, wasting precious minutes trying to find a decent spot. It’s infuriating. This isn’t fair at all. Why should he get priority over me? What did I ever do to deserve being treated like this? I feel like I’m constantly being compared to everyone else, and they always come out on top.

He showed me how to easily switch between different lenses by simply pressing a button on the side. I thought, “How hard can it really be?” After all, we've worked together for 15 years, and I’ve always been able to keep up with him. But today, something about those instructions didn't feel right. Maybe it was the way he looked at me—like I wasn’t even worth considering anymore. Whatever the reason, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I pressed the buttons again and again, trying to force the microscope to cooperate. Each time, it seemed to grow more stubborn, refusing to respond to my attempts. My frustration mounted, and I found myself shouting into the device, demanding it work. When nothing changed, I slammed my fist against the counter, sending dishes clattering everywhere. My colleague rushed in, startled, and saw the mess before turning to face me. His expression turned from concern to disgust as he asked, “Are you okay? You look like you’re having some kind of episode.” I forced a laugh, saying, “Just having a rough day,” hoping he wouldn’t notice how shaken I really was. But he just"
