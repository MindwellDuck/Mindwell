The emptiness of his home is a stark reminder of what once was. He turns on the light in the bedroom, his eyes falling on the dusty, bare side of the bed. The divorce papers he signed last week lie untouched on his nightstand, gathering dust like the memories they sealed away.

They're probably laughing right now, having fun while I'm stuck here alone. It feels so unfair. I don't understand why she did this. We had everything; we were happy. Now look at us. Just me, alone again, and her with him. This whole situation has made me realize how much my life depends on someone else. If I wasn't part of her world, I'd have nothing. But now, she's gone, and I'm left with nothing. Not even a place to call home. My friends don't want to hang out because they think I'll just end up hurting them too. How am I supposed to move forward? Everything reminds me of her. I feel like I've lost my purpose. I hate myself for being such an idiot. I thought our love would last forever, but now it’s all over. And to make matters worse, she doesn’t even try to contact me. She just dropped me, left me, like I mean nothing to her. I feel like shit, but at least I have my cat, right? Wrong. She hates me now.

He’s never truly moved on; I know he still thinks about me. But he’ll never love me like I loved him, and now he’s gone forever. The clock on the wall ticks loudly, reminding me that time is running out for us both. We’re living in a world that doesn’t understand what we went through, and I can’t help but feel trapped by the memories that haunt me. Every day feels like a countdown to my own death, and I wonder if there’s any point to keep going. I thought finding his pen would be a small comfort, but it just serves as another painful reminder of our lost future together. It’s pointless to think about anything else when everything reminds me of him. His presence haunts even the simplest moments, making it impossible to find joy in life anymore.

Her hand slipped through my fingers as she pulled me toward her. Every moment with her felt like a betrayal – a cruel joke played by fate.
