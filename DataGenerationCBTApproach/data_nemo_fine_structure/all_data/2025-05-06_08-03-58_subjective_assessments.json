He could have at least given me some constructive feedback instead of just shredding my article like it was nothing. And why did he even call me in if he wasn't going to give me anything other than insults? Now I'm feeling totally useless again, like all my hard work meant nothing. This whole thing just makes me want to crawl under a rock and forget ever trying to make a difference. Even though I know intellectually that I shouldn't let it get to me, it still hurts so much. I feel like such an idiot for trusting someone who doesn't even care about my work. But honestly, what else can I do? He's the boss, and I need this job to support myself and my family. Maybe I'll just stick to freelance writing and avoid editors like this in the future. At least then I won't waste my time trying to please people who don't appreciate me anyway."

It’s like he doesn’t even care anymore. I’m starting to think he prefers sleeping with someone else. That’s why there’s no mess on our sheets – we both sleep separately. But if he were here, he’d have left some sign, something to make me feel loved. If he were alive, he wouldn’t leave the lights off in the bedroom; he’d turn them back on so they’re bright enough for me to see in the dark. And damn it, he’d still be making breakfast for us – scrambled eggs, bacon, maybe pancakes. He likes pancakes. But instead, all I get is an empty fridge, a clean kitchen, and a silence that feels deafening. I guess I’ll have to cook for myself again. Maybe I can find a recipe online, but it won’t be the same as what he makes. He’s probably having the time of his life somewhere else, laughing and chatting with his friends. They’re probably doing stuff together – going to the movies, playing video games, watching sports. I don’t need to know where he is, but I want to know what he’s doing."

But those images didn’t bring back the joy they once did. They were nothing but reminders of what he had left behind. Three hours had passed since she’d slipped away quietly, leaving him alone with their empty bed. “It’s all over now,” he said out loud, his voice barely above a whisper. “No more laughter, no more smiles. Just silence.” The digital clock ticked away, reading 3:07 AM – a constant reminder of time slipping through his fingers. He felt like he was drowning in it, unable to escape the weight of his grief. “Why can’t I just forget? Why does every moment feel like an eternity?” As he stood there, the darkness seemed to close in around him, suffocating him with its emptiness. “Nothing matters anymore.
