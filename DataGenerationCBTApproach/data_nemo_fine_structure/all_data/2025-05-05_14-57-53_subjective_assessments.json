It wasn’t until later, when he arrived home and caught a glimpse of the stove through the window, that he realized what might have happened: he must have left the burner on, waiting for the water to boil while he rushed out the door. But now, as he stood outside his house, he couldn’t help but feel a wave of anxiety wash over him. Had he really forgotten to turn it off? What if she woke up to find the apartment filled with smoke? He thought about how he would never forgive himself if anything happened to her, how his mind would replay every moment leading up to the disaster, wondering if he could have done something differently. As he stepped inside, he scanned the room frantically, searching for signs of danger, but everything seemed normal.

Of course, I heard everything - they were discussing how much better their classes have been since switching.

I mean, seriously—how could someone who has cooked for countless people, for whom the art of culinary mastery was once second nature, find themselves now? It's simply not believable.
