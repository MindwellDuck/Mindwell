He had no right to be there, surrounded by people who cared about him, when I could not even find solace in death's warmth. Why did they let him stay? What terrible injustice has been committed against me? He had no business being there, and it’s all because of their negligence. The hospital staff failed to recognize him immediately; perhaps they were too busy with their own lives to notice a stranger. If only they had been more attentive, I wouldn’t have endured such agony. But no, instead, they chose to ignore him, allowing me to continue my suffering. And now, he’s just rubbing salt into my wounds, laughing with those who care about him. It’s infuriating! They should be the ones facing judgment, not him. His presence here is a stark reminder of what I’ve lost, and I demand justice for this cruel fate. How dare he enjoy life while I’m left behind? Doesn’t anyone understand that I deserve better than this? I refuse to accept the fact that some are lucky enough to live while others suffer. This is an outrage! His very existence is a slap in the face, mocking my grief. No one should get to live while I die. It’s outrageous that he gets to experience happiness, especially after everything I went through. How can he feel so at peace knowing I’m still here, trapped in pain? This is all because of their incompetence."

I don’t even want to think about how much happier I could’ve been if I’d just given him time. Now, I’m left here, wondering what could have been, always ending up wondering “what if?” I try to shake off these thoughts, but they linger, haunting me. It feels like I’m trapped in some kind of loop, constantly thinking about what could’ve been, what might’ve happened if only I’d acted differently. Even though I know deep down that there’s no use dwelling on past mistakes, I find myself unable to let go of those “what ifs.” It’s almost as if I’m waiting for him to come back, hoping against hope that somehow, someway, things will magically fix themselves. But deep down, I know it won’t. Still, I hold onto the idea, convinced that if only I could turn back time, I could make everything right.

It sounded like she was trying to tell me something deeper, but I couldn't quite decipher what that message was. Her tone was laced with a subtle annoyance, but it felt like more than that - it was as if she was trying to convey a truth that I needed to hear. I felt a surge of defensiveness, but the emotion was tempered by a growing unease. Something about the way she spoke made me wonder if there was more to her words than met the eye. Was she genuinely concerned, or was there something else driving her tone? As I stood there, coffee dripping from my notes, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was reading into my actions. Her words had taken on a level of depth I didn’t think was warranted, and yet, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of guilt. Had I been so careless with my coffee order that it deserved such scrutiny? In that moment, I felt like I was being judged for something I hadn’t even realized was important enough to warrant attention. Her comment had become a window"
