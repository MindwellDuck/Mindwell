Today's assignment: a local family's struggle after their son died in combat. The house seemed quieter than usual as he approached, the wife nowhere in sight. Her husband, face etched with lines of grief, invited him in, voice barely above a whisper. \"She can't handle visitors today,\" he said, looking at the framed photo on the mantel. He felt his heart sink like it was made of lead.",

We need to focus on more uplifting stories. Let me see if I can find some more lighthearted topics to cover instead. Maybe someone else can take over writing about this one.

Why wouldn't I be consumed by the same feelings she’s got—feelings that seem to have been replaced with anger and resentment since he left? She doesn’t understand that my mind is stuck in a time warp, replaying our moments together, re-living the emotions that lingered after he disappeared. And yes, maybe I’m holding onto these memories longer than I should, but does that mean I’m crazy? It’s funny how she assumes I’m somehow manipulating my own emotions, like I’m playing some sick game of self-destruction.

Maybe she just hasn’t realized yet that everyone grieves differently, that the pain of losing someone is as unique as the memories we share.

Instead, I find myself standing in front of a white wall with no sign of her. Confused, I start searching the room, looking for clues that would tell me what happened next in the dream. But there are none. Just a blank space where my mom was supposed to be. It took me months to realize that every time I had this dream, it wasn’t just a random image; it was actually a memory from my childhood. I remembered waking up to an empty bed, feeling scared and alone, and then hearing my mother’s voice, which was always followed by me getting up and going to check if everything was okay. It was a pattern I’d grown up with, but now, in this dream, it felt like she was just standing there, waiting for me to wake up so we could talk about whatever was bothering us. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off, even though I knew it was just a dream. This morning, I woke up to the same scene playing out in my head.
