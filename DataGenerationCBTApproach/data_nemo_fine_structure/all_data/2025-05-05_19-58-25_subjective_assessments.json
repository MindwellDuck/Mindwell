The dust motes dancing in the sunlight caught her eye, as they always did when she came here alone. She paused by the canvas he used to favor, the one with the vibrant blues and yellows that still held a hint of his presence. A single tear slid down her cheek as she noticed the paintbrush he'd left behind, its bristles stiff from disuse. She picked it up gently, feeling the weight of memories in its familiar shape. As she turned to leave, she caught sight of their initials entwined on the canvas's bottom corner - a tiny, hidden promise now lost to time.",

That's why she left that stupid brush there - so I'd think it was some kind of joke. But seriously? What else is going through her head right now? Maybe she thinks I'm not paying attention, like I'm too busy staring at my phone to notice what she's doing. Maybe she wants to know if I can even notice the things she leaves out for us. You know, the ones she knows I'll never pick up because I'm an idiot? It's probably another one of those \"I'm being misunderstood\" moments. Yeah, sure, she's probably thinking that while I'm just sitting here, wondering why she couldn't have just told me what she needed instead of leaving a fucking note. Oh well, whatever. If she really wants to play games, I'll play along. Let's see whose game we're playing first. This isn't over yet."

It's merely a product of my imagination, a figment of my mind. A mere thought, devoid of actual significance. There's no way he ever actually wore it. I wouldn't dare to suggest such a thing. That would be absurd. And yet, I hold onto the possibility, with all the fervor of someone clinging to a thread. But that would mean...no, no, I refuse to entertain such an idea. It’s futile. He never wore it, nor did he even own one like that. I’m certain of it. Why else would I harbor such an implausible notion? I must be deluding myself. The smell is merely a manifestation of my imagination, a fantasy born from the confines of my mind. Nothing concrete exists; everything is fluid, subject to interpretation. This isn’t real. Not truly. It’s a product of my own creation, a fleeting thought, an illusion. My perception distorts reality, rendering it untrustworthy. I see what I want to see, not what's objectively true.

She's always complaining about something, whether it's a minor issue or something entirely unrelated. Honestly, I feel like my day is ruined because of these kinds of calls. Every time someone complains, I have to put everything else aside to handle it. It gets exhausting. I’m starting to wonder if anyone really cares about our clothes around here. It doesn’t help that some customers expect things to be perfect all the time. Like, seriously, a little crease isn’t going to ruin anyone's life. But no, they act like it's the end of the world. They think we're somehow responsible for every single detail on their purchases. I've seen people yell at us over tiny issues—like a button that’s slightly off-center or a tag that’s not perfectly aligned. It makes you question your own sanity sometimes.

But by Tuesday, she'd somehow transformed into a functioning machine, effortlessly juggling meetings and deadlines with ease. That same day, she received another email from the HR manager, informing her about a mandatory training session for all managers. The tone was firm but polite, and it felt like a slap in the face—the kind of reminder she needed to get back on track. Yet, by Wednesday, she was back to her usual self, struggling to keep up with the workload. Her mind wandered, and she found herself wondering if she could ever truly master this job. Her phone buzzed again, signaling another important call from her boss. This time, she picked up, expecting guidance on how to manage her stress levels. Instead, he dropped a bombshell: the training is optional, and anyone who doesn’t attend will be considered uncooperative. His words hung in the air like a challenge, leaving her breathless and bewildered. What does it even mean to be “uncooperative”? Is it really a choice between being fully committed or completely absent? She couldn’t shake off the feeling that she’s either in control or losing control entirely.
