We need to get rid of him before he ruins our business. This guy is just another example of how entitled people are these days. He thinks he can come into our work and treat us poorly? That’s unacceptable. People like him don’t deserve to have jobs. They’re so selfish and rude. I bet he doesn’t even care if he hurts someone’s feelings. He just does it to see how they react. This guy needs to leave now before things get out of hand. I’m so frustrated with him. He’s causing problems everywhere he goes. He’s ruining everything for all of us.

I feel so angry, but deep down, I think I'm scared. Am I overreacting? Do I just expect too much? Maybe I'm being unreasonable, expecting perfection from someone who might be struggling.

Why did he even keep it? Did he think it would help him somehow? Didn't he know how much it made her feel? How could he be so heartless? Why didn't he take it down when he had the chance? It's unbelievable she can still trust him after everything that happened. Doesn't she see what he did? He has no respect for anyone else's feelings anymore. He's lost all empathy. What more proof does she need before she realizes he doesn't care about anything but himself? This is insane. She needs to get over it already. He hasn't changed; he's still the same selfish person who cheated on her. Why bother trying to forgive him now? He'll never change his ways.

I thought something was wrong with me too, because I couldn't sleep after the call. It felt so real, like I could feel her chest rising and falling even though she was in another room. When we got to the ER, she was in critical condition, and everything seemed so chaotic. The doctors were moving around fast, talking quickly, and checking lots of things. They kept asking us questions about what happened before, how long we'd known her, and if we noticed anything unusual. I felt overwhelmed by all these questions and just wanted to know what was going on. But every time I asked, they'd say \"we'll figure it out,\" which made me anxious and frustrated. As we waited, I started thinking about how her health issues might be connected to some medication side effects she'd taken recently. I remembered reading somewhere that certain drugs can cause sudden drops in blood pressure, which led to brain damage or even death. I wondered if that's what happened to her. She'd been taking those medications for years, and I knew she'd always been careful about them. I felt guilty that maybe I hadn’t checked closely enough when I helped her fill her"
