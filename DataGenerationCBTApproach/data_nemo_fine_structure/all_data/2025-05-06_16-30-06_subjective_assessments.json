It didn't matter how hard she tried; every attempt would end in disappointment. Her mind kept replaying the scene, with each iteration making her feel more hopeless. Even though she knew it was just a childish act, she saw it as proof of her own worthlessness. Every time someone told her she could improve, it seemed hollow coming from someone who hadn't been through what she'd endured. The truth was, she didn't deserve to be here. No amount of effort could change that. As she continued down the hallway, the same thought echoed in her head: This is my life now—a never-ending cycle of frustration and defeat. I might as well give up because there’s no point. If she tried harder, nothing would change. Everyone else seemed to have given up on themselves too, and they weren’t nearly as broken as she was. Maybe it was better to accept that she wouldn't ever truly belong anywhere. The world didn't need someone like her anyway, so why bother trying? She felt like she was stuck in a rut with no escape in sight. Everything about her life felt meaningless, and the only thing that mattered was getting through each day without falling apart completely. She realized that things"

It doesn't matter how much longer he tries to hide the money, he'll still end up getting fired and losing everything. I wish I could tell them about the theft, but I don't want to come across as an informant. I know he'll deny everything if confronted, and my boss won't trust me anymore. He probably has some other scheme planned, like stealing more money or sabotaging the store somehow. This isn't over yet, but he'll eventually get caught and face the consequences.

It's not fair, I know, but why should I have to put up with it? Why does everyone always assume they can just walk into a classroom whenever they want? This isn't how it's supposed to go, I think to myself, my mind racing with frustration. Everyone else gets to teach calmly, without interruptions, without being watched. They don't have to worry about people showing up unexpectedly, about students acting out, about the constant stress of having to keep everything together. No, they shouldn't be dealing with any of this. They shouldn't be here, not like this, not when they're trying to teach.

She felt a lump form in her throat as he stepped forward, his voice barely above a whisper.** **“Do you remember when we first tried this?

Memories haunted him, reminding him of happy moments, of people he once cared about, of things he used to look forward to. Yet, they were all lost now, swallowed by the monotony of his daily routine. Even the small pleasures—the sunsets, the laughter, the late-night talks—had faded, replaced by emptiness and isolation. His phone buzzed again, a text from an acquaintance inviting him to a concert. He stared blankly at the screen, the message fading into the background as he delved deeper into his thoughts. Why did these moments feel so hollow? Was it because he let them go too easily, letting life pass him by without ever stopping to smell the roses? Or was it something more, a deep-seated pain that lingered beneath the surface, refusing to be acknowledged? He closed his eyes, trying to escape the cycle of sadness. But there was no escape.
