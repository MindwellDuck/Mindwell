Every moment feels like it's scripted for some reason. I've been going through so much lately, but somehow, everything seems more intense now. The smallest things feel like they're building up to something huge, but there's nothing there. It started with little things - the way the sunlight hits certain spots, making shadows look weird; how every conversation with my family feels forced, like we're all just pretending to be okay. But then, it escalated. I saw him talking to her - she was smiling at him, laughing with him, and he was looking right back, his eyes locked onto hers. They were standing close together, almost touching. I could see the way they leaned into each other, the way their shoulders brushed against each other. And I couldn't help but notice the way my heart skipped a beat when I saw them together. But why? Why does this keep happening? I don't even know what's real anymore. Is this all part of some twisted game my brain is playing? Am I really seeing these things, or am I just imagining them? I feel like I'm losing myself in this cycle of thoughts, unable to escape. Every time I try to focus on anything else, I end up thinking about her and him. I can't shake off the feeling that I'm missing out"

It's like she's stuck in some sort of perpetual limbo, where everyone else has moved on, while she remains stuck in this endless cycle of disappointment. She can't help but wonder if it's even worth trying anymore. Why bother when everything feels so futile? Maybe it's just better to accept that she'll never be part of their little group, that she's always going to be an outsider looking in. That realization settles heavy in her chest, making it hard to breathe. Why would anyone want to be friends with someone like her anyway? It's all just a reminder that she's failing. Failing at life, failing at friendship, failing at love. What's the point of keeping up this facade, pretending to care about things when deep down she knows it doesn't matter? Maybe she'd be better off just giving up now, letting go of the hope that things will ever change. After all, what's the use of holding on when everything is already lost? She really needs to get out more. This whole thing is starting to feel like a bad joke. Everyone else seems to have their lives together, while she's still stuck here"
