She stopped by the classroom door, her eyes scanning the rows of desks now vacant and cold. A single red apple lay untouched on one desk, its owner having forgotten it in their rush to leave at the end of the day. She picked it up, feeling its smooth skin against her fingers, a reminder of the countless apples she had packed for her own son's school lunches years ago. The weight of the fruit was heavy in her hand as she realized once again that no one would be there to greet her when she returned home from this empty building. She sighed, placing the apple back down gently before continuing on her way alone.",

He went through the motions, making eggs and bacon, but it wasn’t the same. When I saw him setting the table, I expected to feel excited. Instead, I felt...empty. Like I was missing something essential, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. He had planned a surprise for our friends’ reunion, and I knew how much it meant to them. So, I should be happy, right? But nothing felt right. Even though I remembered every little thing he did—how he cracked each egg with precision, how carefully he cooked the bacon—it didn’t bring back the memories I wanted. I kept thinking about what I’d done wrong, if I could’ve made things better. Now, as I look at the empty chair where my late wife usually sat, I’m overwhelmed by sadness.

I mean, I've seen more cluttered spaces in a thrift store! What really got to me, though, was when she started talking about her morning routine.
