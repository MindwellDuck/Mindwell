He probably doesn't even understand the context. The things he's saying are completely out of line. I've written this book multiple times, and each time, it gets better. What does he know? Maybe if he'd actually read something before opening his mouth, he wouldn't look like such a fool. Ugh, how dare he try to discredit me like this?! How could he possibly think he's right? I mean, come on! My life story isn't for him to judge. No one has the right to question my writing skills. Especially not some nobody who clearly doesn’t know anything. And don't even get me started on how rude he is. Saying stuff like \"Your entire narrative is built on lies\" and \"You were never really the hero you think you are\"? What does he know? Has he lived through all these events? Of course, he hasn't. Who cares what he says? That guy needs to shut up. He probably wants attention by criticizing someone else's work."

He couldn't shake the feeling that his son thought he was failing, that he wasn't good enough. This was nothing new - every call from his son made him wonder if he was letting them down, if he was living up to expectations. Every conversation felt like an interrogation, every message a reminder that he wasn't meeting standards. And now, with another failure, the weight of those expectations felt crushing. He knew he was just making things worse by answering the phone, but he couldn't stop himself. He was trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, and he knew exactly how his son would react. When he hung up, he'd think he was doing everything right, but deep down, he'd be thinking about all the times he'd let everyone down. Every decision, every action, every word"

He stepped out of the car and began walking toward me. As I watched him approach, I noticed an unusual figure perched atop the oak tree near our backyard. It was an owl, its piercing gaze fixed intently upon us. In that moment, something strange happened. A shiver ran down my spine as I felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over me. I couldn’t explain why, but the sight of that owl seemed ominous, as if it was trying to tell us something. My mind began racing with thoughts, each one more unsettling than the last. What did this mean? Was this some sign? I felt a lump form in my throat, and before I knew it, I was sobbing uncontrollably. My partner looked at me with confusion, and I could see the worry in his eyes. He tried to comfort me, but I pushed him away, unable to bear the thought of being there when whatever was coming would arrive. We stood frozen, the only sound the soft hooting of the owl.
