As she waits for backup generator to kick in, the shadows dance eerily around her, and every creak of the old building sends shivers down her spine. She's been receiving anonymous threatening letters lately, and the fear that they might be connected lingers heavily in the darkness.",

We can't let our guard down for even a second because we don't know what kind of sick freaks we're dealing with here. Every single sound makes me jump out of my skin - the groaning of the pipes, the creaking of the stairs, even the wind outside is sounding like someone breaking into the building. And why did everyone just leave so suddenly? Is it some kind of trap? Did they get kidnapped? I'm starting to panic. My heart is racing, and I feel like I'm going crazy. It's all too much. I need to get out of here NOW. But I also need to stay inside until help arrives. What if it's some kind of setup? What if these aren't threats, but some kind of mind games? Or worse, what if...oh God, what if one of us isn't who they seem to be? This feels like a nightmare come true. Every minute ticks by slowly, making me more paranoid than ever. I can't shake off the feeling that something terrible is about to happen. This is insane. We have to act fast before it's too late."

Do you think I'd be so stupid as to leave food out in the open for others to eat? You know, every time you leave your disgusting leftovers in here, it makes me wonder how many other people have eaten those things. And now I'm worried sick about my stomach. You need to clean up after yourself. It's not that hard. I swear, if I had a dollar for every time I've seen you leave your gross stuff in here, I'd have enough money to buy my own fridge by now. If I didn't have to work with you, I wouldn't even care anymore, but since we do, I'm going to make sure everyone knows how unhygienic you are. You can't just do whatever you want and expect us all to deal with it. It's really annoying."

Not only does the critic’s opinion have no value whatsoever, but they’re also trying to make fun of our beloved elder’s work. It’s like they think they’re better than everyone else just because they have an opinion. And to top it off, the way they wrote it was just cruel. They made it sound like our dear friend is nothing more than a washed-up painter who refuses to let go of his past glories. Can you imagine? I can feel the anger rising up inside me as I read those words aloud. My heart is racing, and I’m starting to tear up just thinking about it. But here’s the thing - I really need to talk through these feelings with someone. Maybe I could reach out to another member of the group or ask them if they’d be willing to listen. But I don’t want to burden anyone with my emotions right now. So instead, I’ll try to channel all this pain into something productive... maybe I could write a letter to the editor explaining how hurtful these types of reviews are? Yeah, that would definitely help ease things. Or perhaps I could take some time to focus on my own art? That might give me a sense of purpose and distract me from these negative thoughts. Either way, I know I have to keep moving forward. After all, we artists must stay strong in the face of criticism."

Let's try to capture that in our response. We'll aim for a blunt, sarcastic tone with a slightly annoyed intensity. Since we want to avoid explicit statements, we'll focus on subtle reflections of the cognitive distortion. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger We start by identifying the triggering event that sets off the cognitive distortion. In this case, it's the protagonist noticing the calendar marking only three days until her retirement. This small detail triggers her emotional response, making her see her situation in stark, polarized terms—retirement either represents excitement and closure or sadness and loss. ## Step 2: Reflect the Distortion To show all-or-nothing thinking, we need to reflect this distorted way of viewing the world. Instead of acknowledging the complexity of her emotions, which might include a mix of nostalgia for work and anticipation for leisure time, the protagonist sees things in absolute terms. This simplification is reflected when she thinks about her situation in \"either-excited-for-retirement-or-crushed-by-it\" terms. It’s as if she’s unable to grasp the nuances between these two extremes"

Every time I see him, I just want to smash something. I try telling myself it's not fair, that I shouldn't be jealous, but I don't care. The fact that he's moved on so easily hurts more than anything. I keep thinking we could have worked things out, but no, he chose her instead. That other girl must have some kind of magic spell on him because he barely gave me a second glance when we passed by each other today. And now he's laughing with her like they're old friends. I bet he told her everything about us, everything that went wrong between us. He probably thinks I'm crazy for trying to get back into his life. I wonder what he'll say when he finds out I'm here, sitting alone at a different table. Is he going to laugh at me too? Does he think I look pathetic? I feel like such an idiot for being so stupid"

She recalled how he would spend hours mixing paints, lost in thought, creating worlds where anything was possible. But now, those same paints seemed like a reminder of all she had lost. It's funny how she thought she'd find solace in his art after he passed away, but instead, it just makes everything feel more overwhelming. Every brushstroke seems to whisper stories of happier times, making her wonder if she'll ever truly be happy again. The more she digs, the more she realizes there's nothing left—no letters, no notes, just this haunting sense of abandonment. Her mind keeps wandering back to the way he used to hold his brushes, the way his fingers curled around them, the gentle pressure as he worked. It's almost as if he's still there, watching her, guiding her through the process. Her thoughts are interrupted by the faint smell of turpentine, transporting her to memories of late-night work sessions, the two of them lost in their own worlds. But even these moments feel bittersweet now, filled with a deep sadness rather than joy. Every step forward feels like a step backward. She can't shake the feeling that she's just"
