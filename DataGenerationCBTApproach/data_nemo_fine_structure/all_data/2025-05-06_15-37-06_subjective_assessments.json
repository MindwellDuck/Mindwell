It wasn't like this was the first time she'd been touched by someone else's hand. But there was something different about this particular interaction—something that made her want to push him away, to remind herself that she didn't need anyone else, that she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself. Maybe it was the way he looked at her, with genuine interest in his eyes, or maybe it was just the fact that he couldn't see her as old. Whatever it was, it got under her skin, making her feel like she needed to hold on tighter to what little control she had left. Now, I know what you're thinking—it sounds pretty normal, even nice. But trust me, I'm not buying it. That whole scene felt staged, like a movie set designed to make people believe in fairy tales again. It’s easy to get caught up in such illusions, especially when you’ve lost so much already. But let’s be real—what we really need is a reminder of our true reality, not some feel-good fantasy meant to distract us from the harsh truth. We’re not getting any younger here, and if you think you can still keep pretending everything will magically fix itself? Think again. This isn’t just about my age; it’s about being aware of your own biases. When you start discounting the positive,"

She might think I'm unprofessional, or that I don't care about my patients' well-being. Or maybe I'll just have to take time off, which would mean missing out on important research opportunities. If I leave early, I won't be able to attend those seminars, and I'll miss out on crucial networking events. I'll never catch up on all the work I've fallen behind on. And then there's the possibility that I'll get fired. What if I accidentally hurt someone during surgery, or if one of my patients sues me for malpractice? If I don't show up to our meeting, what will happen next? Will I get in trouble with the hospital administration? Or worse, will they fire me?
