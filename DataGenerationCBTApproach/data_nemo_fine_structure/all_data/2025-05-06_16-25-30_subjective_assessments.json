He could be going through some personal issues that make it hard for him to spend money at the moment. Maybe his car broke down, and he's using up all his savings to pay for repairs. Or maybe he had a medical emergency recently and is struggling financially while recovering. His wife might have been the one who suggested getting a new shirt, but he's hesitant due to financial constraints. She might've made it clear that she wants it as a gift, but he's putting it off until he feels better about spending money. It’s possible that he was just bored and wanted to see how far he could push us. Perhaps he didn’t think about the consequences of his actions, and now he’s facing a bigger problem than just returning a product. This situation is turning into a bigger issue than we anticipated.

It hurts to think that maybe he didn’t want to tell me about his spending habits because he thinks I wouldn’t approve. But why would he go out of his way to keep such a big purchase a secret? Did he think I wouldn’t notice? The more I think about it, the more insecure I become. It’s hard not to wonder if he’s hiding something else too.
