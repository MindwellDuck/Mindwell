Another slow day, another slow week. His reflection in the glass shelf catches his eye - the dark circles under his eyes seem to have deepened since yesterday. He feels an overwhelming urge to sit down right there amidst the dusty shelves, but the weight of his responsibilities keeps him standing. No one's coming tonight; they never do. Another night alone, another day wasted in this lifeless job. He can't help but feel that tomorrow will be more of the same, and the day after that, until it all becomes just an endless, hopeless blur.",

We're already in the middle of a slow week, and now the universe itself has decided to join forces against me. I can see myself sitting down among those dusty shelves, feeling the crushing weight of my own despair. It won't matter how hard I try to escape, because the darkness closing in around me is inevitable. And when the lights finally dim, I'll be left with nothing but the echoes of my own desperation, forever trapped in this dead-end job."

No, no, no, she definitely won't bring home food poisoning from this, she should know better than to leave leftovers out. The fact that she forgot her lunch is actually kind of lucky, she should be grateful it wasn't worse. She might have gotten sick if she had eaten it anyway. She should really clean up her act and start taking responsibility for her actions, especially when it comes to school. If she was paying attention, none of this would have happened, she should be more mindful and attentive all the time. She can't possibly expect me to believe she didn't mean to leave the sandwich there, she should know better than to let it happen again. It's just careless.

It's hard to believe that once, this bear was the center of her world, bringing her comfort whenever she felt scared or alone. Now, it feels like a relic from another time, reminding me of all the things that have changed since then. We've built new lives around here, but I can't help feeling like we're missing something essential by moving forward without her. As I look at it now, I realize how much I miss the sound of my little girl's laughter. Her voice was so full of joy, filling every room she entered. It's almost impossible to imagine this house being quiet again, especially when I remember how happy she would be to come back home after school. But I know that’s just nostalgia talking; she has her own path now, and I need to focus on myself too. I guess I’m just holding onto these memories because they’re all I have left of her right now. I wish I could turn back time, but I know that’s not possible. All I can do is cherish these moments while they still feel fresh in my mind. It might seem silly to be upset over something as"

It’s not worth risking my self-esteem anymore. But then again, if I quit, I’ll miss out on opportunities that could help our family. We need money, especially with the kids’ school fees piling up. My wife will be furious when she sees how much I spent on nothing. She won’t understand why I gave up. If I try again, things will get worse. I’ll only disappoint more people, including ourselves. Maybe I should just admit defeat and move on. I shouldn’t waste time and energy on something that’s unlikely to work anyway. But if I give up now, I’ll regret it later.

That's what we're doing too, right? We're both just trying to figure things out, and maybe, hopefully, we'll get better with time. But for some reason, my brain is stuck in these \"all or nothing\" thoughts, where everything feels black and white, like there's no gray area. Like when I hear stories of people who've overcome incredible obstacles, I feel like they must have been so much stronger than me, more confident, and somehow better equipped to handle life’s ups and downs. Or, on the flip side, I might think someone who seems happy and content is somehow cheating, that they don’t really understand the depth of suffering others face. It’s like our brains are wired to make choices between these two extremes, rather than embracing the complexity of real life.
