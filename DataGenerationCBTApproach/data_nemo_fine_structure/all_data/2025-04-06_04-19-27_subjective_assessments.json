It’s a pretty sweet spot, so I decided to grab a coffee and hang out with my little buddy while he did his homework. I mean, who wouldn’t want that? Anyway, as I’m sipping my coffee, I notice some weird stuff going on. There are these huge piles of paper everywhere, but there aren't even any books on them. And the desks look like they've been trashed—crumpled up papers, pens all over the place. At first, I thought maybe someone had thrown a party after school and cleaned up quickly. But then I saw this note on my desk. It said, “You’re useless.” Like, what the fuck? Who does that?! Now I'm freaking out, wondering if I somehow forgot about something important. What if I missed an important meeting? Or what if my kid needs help with something and I totally dropped the ball? I start thinking about all the times when things didn't go well between me and my wife. She's always been super critical, and now I'm worried that it might be more than just a bad memory. Maybe she actually meant something... But wait... What if I'm reading too much into it? What if someone just really hated school and started scribbling random crap on the desks? Yeah, that makes sense. It must have been one of those weird kids who gets upset easily. My"

He barely looked at her anymore, and when he did, there was no warmth left in his eyes. The pain had become too much to bear, but this time, she couldn't help feeling a little guilty. Maybe it wasn't entirely her fault? After all, she had given him everything—love, support, a home—but somehow, he still chose to walk away. The worst part? This new book, once a symbol of hope, now felt like a reminder of everything she had lost.

This dichotomy underscores the complexity of his emotional state, leaving him uncertain about how to proceed. In this moment, he finds himself torn between the comfort of nostalgia and the uncertainty of moving forward. The photograph has become a source of both solace and distraction, illustrating his struggle to find balance in his thoughts. His gaze lingers on the image, as if searching for answers. Yet, instead of clarity, he finds himself entangled in a web of conflicting emotions.
