She's always been super strict and has never understood how hard it is for me to get good grades, especially since my dad is a doctor who expects perfection from me. It makes sense that she'd be upset; after all, my parents are really important figures in my life. If only my mom wasn't working double shifts at the hospital, I wouldn't have had time to study. My sister can't even manage her own schoolwork, but she still manages to get good grades. Why does it seem like my teacher doesn't understand anything? I've tried explaining everything to her, but nothing changes - she just keeps lecturing and giving me bad grades. It's also kind of embarrassing that my dad is acting like this. He's always been very involved in my education, and I know he cares about my well-being. Maybe if he were here, he could calm him down. But honestly, I think my dad is more stressed than anyone else in our family. Between working long hours and managing his practice, he barely has time for us kids. I wish he didn't have to deal with this, but I guess it's too late now. The fact that my parents are both high-achievers only adds to the pressure. They're always pushing me to excel, and it feels unfair when I struggle to keep up. I don't want to disappoint"

How else could someone get away with this? This isn't over yet—oh wait, it already is. They've stolen everything. The worst part is, I'll never see my precious books again, let alone my favorite video games. And what about my laptop? I know exactly which one they took—it's the black one with the red stripe.

My mind started racing as I wondered if there was some issue with the restaurant or if it was just small talk. As we finished our meal and headed back to the car, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. When we got home, I tried to put it behind me, but my mind kept replaying those conversations. It wasn't until later that evening, when I saw her text from her best friend saying they had met up, I realized I must have misinterpreted everything. She told me they were just gossiping about other people's lives, and I felt silly for jumping to conclusions. The whole thing made me think that sometimes we can get so caught up in our own thoughts that we miss the bigger picture."

Now, though, she realizes she should have given up sooner. His continued presence in her life seemed selfish, yet she held on, hoping for some sign that he might change his mind.

Perhaps if he had shown more distance, she wouldn't have stayed this long. Maybe then, she would have realized that he wasn’t worth waiting for.
