She tiptoed to the kitchen, her heart heavy with the weight of yesterday's failed experiment. As she poured herself a cup of cold coffee from last night, she noticed the note stuck to the fridge: \"You're amazing. Today will be better.\" But today felt like just another day in a long line of failures. She hugged her mug tightly, tears stinging her eyes as she realized the lab's deadline was looming, and she had nothing to show for it.",

Why the fuck does he think I'm perfect when everything about me screams failure? And now, I have to face him, pretend to be happy, all while secretly seething inside. It's not fair; no one understands how hard it is to get up every morning, knowing that I'll probably fail again. I've spent hours over the past few days preparing, but somehow, it all fell apart. Now, I have to go through the motions, pretending to care about whatever stupid project he assigned us. It's exhausting, and I know I'm going to crack under the pressure. Fuck this. I hate myself and everyone around me. This whole situation is a disaster, and I'm the biggest asshole to blame. My husband thinks I'm amazing, but what the hell is he talking about? We both know I'm a complete failure. I can barely keep our tiny apartment clean, let alone some dumb science project. Who cares if we fail? Everyone fails. It's not like anything matters anyway. Life is meaningless, and we're just insignificant specks in an uncaring universe. Fuck"

And you know what the worst part is? No one cares. They just ignore me, like I don't exist. Nobody wants anything to do with me anymore. This is all because I fucked up. If only I had been more careful, if only I had taken care of things properly, none of this would've happened. But no, I let my fear take control, and now look where I am. Stuck in the past, unable to move forward. Every time I try to get back together, they just laugh at me. \"You can't change your fucking mind,\" they say. Like I haven't tried enough already. What's wrong with me? Why can't I just be normal for once? It's all my fault. My stupid mistakes led to my downfall. I should've done things differently.

And now, as I stood outside, the cold wind whipping my hair into a frenzy, I realized that I’d been wrong all along. She never left. She’s still with me, haunting every step I take. Every breath I breathe is hers now, and I can feel her eyes on me, even though I know she’s really not. Fuck it, I thought, shaking my head. I’m just trying to convince myself of that.

She would say she understood, but the pain in her voice was laced with doubt. He wondered what it must feel like to walk away from everything they built together, leaving behind the memories that once made their hearts beat as one. What if she never came back? Would I find solace in solitude, or would I succumb to the darkness that seemed to closing in on me? He thought about how she'd always told him that her illness was just a challenge to face head-on. But now, as he stared blankly at the latest piece, he couldn’t help but wonder if those words were nothing more than empty promises. If she truly believed them, why did time seem to stretch out like a heavy chain, holding him back from moving forward? And then there was the question that haunted him still—what if she didn’t want to see him anymore? What if she was gone for good?
