A warmth passed through her, then swiftly cooled as she remembered her own reflection in the window: alone, coat buttoned high against the chill, grey hair tucked neatly under a worn scarf.

The way they intertwined their arms, a stark contrast to her own isolation, made her seethe with anger. It wasn't just their physical closeness; it was the depth of their connection, the ease with which they interacted—something she could only dream of experiencing. Every glance from passersby served as a harsh reminder of her own invisibility, further fueling her ire. It’s probably because I’m old and ugly, and no one wants me anyway. That’s why they’re holding hands like fools, flaunting their happiness in front of everyone. They don’t have anything better to do than indulge in this farce, laughing about nothing while I'm forced to endure the bleakness of life alone. The world is clearly conspiring against me, and now I have to bear witness to their joy? That's what happens when you're invisible. You can't even find someone who would hold your hand, let alone share a laugh with you. So instead, you get to watch other people enjoy each other's company, all while you're stuck in this miserable state of loneliness. How does it feel to be so irrelevant? To be constantly reminded of your worthlessness? The irony is almost too much to bear. Why bother trying to connect with anyone when you know they'll reject you anyway? It's easier to just sit back, observe the happy"

The memory of her smiling face flashed before his eyes, followed by the image of her lying lifeless in the hospital bed. It seemed like yesterday when he received the call, telling him she'd been in an accident and wasn't going to make it. She died because she didn’t want to live anymore, which is why she never wanted kids. But now, after all these years, he feels trapped by the memories. He can’t shake off the feeling that everything would’ve been fine if only things had turned out differently. He keeps thinking about what could've been if they were still together, but every time he tries to imagine it, he ends up drowning in sadness again. It’s funny how one moment you’re surrounded by love, and the next, you’re left alone with nothing but tears and regret. Maybe this is what happens when you think too much about the what-ifs. You end up losing yourself in those thoughts until there’s nothing left but emptiness. But even though he knows it's pointless to dwell on the past, he can't help himself. Every little reminder brings him back to reality, forcing him to confront the harsh truth: life moves forward, no matter how hard we try to hold onto it. ## Edit **Edit:** Wow, thank you for all the comments!

Hadn't she worked hard to build a reputation as a reliable, efficient employee? Didn't she deserve respect? How could anyone question her dedication to her job? It doesn't make sense that she'd react so strongly; surely the cashier knew exactly what he was doing. He'd probably laughed to himself when writing those words, hadn't he? Maybe he thought it was funny to see her get flustered like that. Or maybe he genuinely believed she deserved to retire, and that she was just too stubborn to accept it. Whatever his intention, he seemed completely oblivious to her emotional pain. And yet, she couldn't help feeling that he knew exactly what he was doing, that he deliberately chose those words to wound her. How could someone like him work in retail, anyway?
