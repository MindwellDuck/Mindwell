I found myself fixated on a single line of code, its imperfections glaring like an open wound. The surrounding text, once a seamless tapestry of functionality, now seemed dull and lifeless, as if it had been replaced by a cheaply printed placemat. Every time I gazed upon that line, I felt compelled to rip out my keyboard and hurl it across the room, as if the very act of coding had become a cruel joke. For some reason, this fixation has taken on a life of its own, becoming an all-consuming obsession. My mind is consumed by the nagging thought that I'm somehow failing—failing to see what others might take for granted, failing to comprehend the depth of my own incompetence. It's as if every time I look at that line, I'm reminded that I'm nothing more than a novice, a mere mortal trapped in a world where perfection reigns supreme. This fixation isn't just about the code; it's about the sense of inadequacy that comes with it. I can’t help but wonder if there’s something fundamentally wrong with me—the way I think, the way I see things—that makes it impossible for me to grasp even the simplest concepts. And yet, despite my best efforts, I find myself stuck in this never-ending cycle of frustration, unable to break free from the prison of my own limitations. But then, when I pause to"

He just assumed I'd be playing games or watching videos all day. And guess what? That's exactly what happened. The whole time, I was just wasting my life away on that thing. It was so boring, but I couldn't help myself - every minute felt like an eternity, and I had no idea how to make it pass faster. Every single second felt so long. Even now, thinking about those days makes me feel really down. When I think about it, it feels like I've wasted so much time, just sitting there doing nothing. My life is basically over already, and it's all because of this stupid laptop. I wish I could go back in time and change things, but I can't. Now, everything I do will always remind me of that terrible period where I did nothing but waste my time. I don't want to look back on these memories anymore; they're too painful. Even though I know I shouldn't be feeling this way, I still can't shake off the feeling that I'm stuck in this rut forever. Nothing good ever happens in my life, and I keep thinking about how much better things would have been if I'd done something else instead of wasting time on that laptop.

I see people around me who've had it easier - they got married young, started families, and then retired comfortably. Meanwhile, here I am, still holding onto hope, trying to make ends meet, and wondering if anyone would even notice if I disappeared. At least those who are older seem content with what they have; they don't look back longingly for something more. They're happy with their choices, while I'm left feeling resentful and trapped. That woman there, she doesn't look happy either, but she seems resigned. Maybe she knows what I don't know yet. Maybe she can teach me how to accept this life and find peace in it. I wish I could ask her, but she'll probably think I'm too old for advice anyway. Still, it's worth a try. I might learn something new from someone who's been through the same thing.
