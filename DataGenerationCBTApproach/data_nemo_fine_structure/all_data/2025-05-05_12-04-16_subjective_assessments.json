His wife had left him years ago, taking their children to another state. As he booted up his ancient computer, he noticed a dusty photo frame tucked behind a stack of papers. It was a picture of them on their wedding day, smiling radiantly. He picked it up, tracing her face with a trembling finger. The phone rang then, jarring him from his reverie.

Yet, amidst this nostalgia, he felt an acute sense of loneliness. He wondered if she would ever return to him, or if he would forever remain alone, a shadow of what once was. As he sat there, lost in thought, the reality of his situation began to sink in—a harsh reminder that some wounds may never fully heal. In a moment of desperation, he reached for the phone, dialing a number he hadn't called in years. A voice on the other end brought tears to his eyes, though it wasn't hers. Instead, it belonged to his sister, who shared the same pain and understood his struggle. Her words of comfort offered solace, but they also served as a painful reminder that time continued to move forward, leaving him further behind. The distance between past and present seemed insurmountable, like trying to bridge two worlds apart. In this moment, he realized that he had been clinging to the hope of things returning to how they once were. But life moves relentlessly forward, and even those moments of joy are fleeting. The realization hit him hard, forcing him to confront the truth that he might never experience such happiness again. The weight of this understanding left him numb"
