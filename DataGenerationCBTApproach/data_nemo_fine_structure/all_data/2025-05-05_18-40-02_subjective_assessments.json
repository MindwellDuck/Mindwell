Maybe he’d have to fight the people inside, and we'd all end up getting hurt... Or, what if this wasn't just a random ringing? What if someone was sending him secret messages through those ringtones? Imagine having an invisible friend who only contacted you when your phone rang. It could be a warning sign about danger near by, or a clue to uncover a hidden treasure! But, oh no, what if he ignores it? What if he doesn't care, and that means we'll never find our treasure? Or maybe he has a pet elephant inside his phone, and every time it rings, it wants to play with us? I wonder if there are other animals trapped in phones everywhere, waiting for their chance to escape... Oh man, what if someone is using his phone as a spy device? He might be in danger, and we need to help him before it's too late! But then again, what if he's actually a secret agent himself, and these ringtones are part of his mission? Ugh, my brain is overthinking this so much, and it"

My boyfriend has been super supportive throughout this whole journey, and I appreciate how patient he's being while I'm trying to transform into someone new. We’ve talked about our goals and he's been motivating me to keep going. I feel like we're both learning a lot from each other. Plus, I got a nice massage last night, and it felt incredible. My muscles are feeling looser already, and I can’t wait to see how much better I'll look after a few weeks. It's such a great feeling to know I'm doing something positive for myself. This morning, I woke up to the sun shining through the curtains, and I couldn't stop smiling. The birds were singing their sweet songs outside, and the air felt fresh. I wish I could go back to those days when life wasn't so complicated, when I didn’t have to worry about things like work or bills.
