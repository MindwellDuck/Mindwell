Why bother staying? The world is already fucked enough. She could've been right. Maybe she really does want me back. Maybe she's still thinking about us, and that's why she kept messaging. But fuck itâ€”she wouldn't care anymore after the time I wasted. We're over, and I might as well be dead because my life sucks so much. At least then I can say I died trying to fix things. This isn't the first time I've thought this way, but it feels different today. Something's changed inside me, and nothing can make it better. I should've acted sooner, but now it's too late. Fuck it, let her go. Let her live her life while I rot in my own misery. But what if...? What if I don't feel anything anymore? What if I'm numb to everything? What if we were meant to be together"

You try to hide behind your mask of confidence, but deep down, you know the truth - you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

She predicted a significant change in my life, one that would have far-reaching consequences. According to her, this transformation would bring about both positive and negative aspects, but ultimately, it would lead to an unbearable burden that could potentially destroy our relationship. She suggested that this shift might cause us to drift apart, forcing me to reevaluate whether we are truly compatible. This sentiment resonated deeply within me, as I have always felt uncertain about our long-term prospects. Her words stirred up feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, leaving me wondering if she had genuinely foresaw something ominous. Her prediction even went as far as suggesting that I might begin to question my own worthiness for such a partner. The thought of facing this possibility was unsettling, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It's almost as though her words were a warning, urging me to confront the reality that sometimes, even those who seem perfect may harbor hidden flaws. This encounter has made me realize that predicting the future is never an easy task, especially when it involves relationships. While her predictions can be intriguing, they also carry a degree of uncertainty. As someone who values honesty and transparency, I find it difficult to accept anything less than concrete evidence. Yet, at the same time, I'm drawn to the idea that sometimes, even the most unexpected events can hold lessons that shape our growth as individuals. Overall,"

Meanwhile, I'm just sitting there, silently seething. How can they be so carefree when everything feels like it's falling apart inside me? This isn't just about the watch anymore; it represents something deeper. Maybe it's because I've always felt like I'm meant for better things. My life has been one long struggle, filled with disappointments and unfulfilled potential. Why does everyone else seem to have it easier, while I'm constantly fighting against the tide?
