It might be a sign that he doesn't care about me or that we aren't meant to work together. But why does it matter? He clearly has other people around him who are enjoying themselves. They seem more invested than I am anyway. So maybe this isn't something I need to worry about. I can just focus on my own work. I've got plenty of responsibilities to keep me occupied. If he wants to hang out with his friends, that's fine. I'm not going to lose sleep over it. It doesn't really affect anything between us, does it? I shouldn't let myself get worked up over this. There must be more important things to think about. He's probably just joking around with those coworkers. We were all having a good time earlier. Maybe it was just one of those moments where everyone lets loose. I'll try to relax and move on. I have enough on my plate already. If it's meant to happen, it will happen. But if I start worrying about every little thing, nothing ever gets done. What's the point in getting upset over something so minor? It's not like it's a big deal or anything.

He felt her absence heavy in the quiet, each echo of silence a reminder of another shared melody they'd never play again.

Like my brain had switched off, and suddenly everything felt...different. He didn’t notice anything about the place except for how quiet it was. No noise, no energy, nothing. It’s as if he had stepped into a still life painting—a picture where time itself seemed to be frozen. Everything looked exactly as it had before, but somehow, it all felt different. Even the furniture seemed to be watching him, waiting for something to happen. He stood there for what felt like hours, just taking it all in, trying to understand why it felt so strange. There were no tears, no guilt, no anger. Just this odd sense of being completely disconnected from everything around him. And yet, despite the emptiness, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off. It was as if he had entered a world where emotions didn’t apply anymore—where feelings were distant memories, and thoughts moved through him like shadows without substance. He stood there, unsure of what to do next, lost in this strange new reality. Time seemed to stretch out"
