The moment I saw her, I knew we had something special. We talked about everything, sharing our dreams and desires. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, like a gentle stream meandering through the countryside. I felt at peace when I was with her, as if I'd finally found my missing piece. But now, all those moments seem so distant, lost to time. It hurts to think that we never got to experience what could have been. Every day feels like an eternity, each passing moment a reminder of what we'll never have. I wonder how things would be if we were still together—how we might have built a life filled with laughter and joy. My heart aches with every thought of what could have been, and yet, I'm grateful for the brief time we shared. It’s bittersweet, knowing that our paths will always diverge, but I can’t shake the feeling that we missed out on something truly special."

Relax, man! --- #Example Response Here is an example of a subjective reaction reflecting the cognitive distortion \"Should Statements\" using the given scenario: * **Unrealistic Expectations:** When you think about it, it's probably just a power outage. No big deal. * **Overthinking:** If there's no one around, it must be a prankster playing a trick on us. * **Blaming Others:** Maybe our neighbor turned the power off as a joke. He's always doing stuff like that. We should have asked him if we saw him earlier. * **Negative Thoughts:** This could be a sign of bigger problems"

The constant criticism from her boss makes her feel worthless, like she's somehow less than everyone else. It's hard to see herself doing anything right, especially when it comes to working with others. The more she thinks about it, the more convinced she becomes that she's never going to fit in or get along with anyone. This feeling of inadequacy is all too familiar, yet it still manages to catch her off guard every time.
