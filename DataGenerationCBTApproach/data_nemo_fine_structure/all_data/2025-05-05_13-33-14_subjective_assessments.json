But then the answering machine lights up, and all those people who thought she'd forgotten about them start calling, each message like a cold slap in the face.

She feels like she's drowning in a sea of expectations - all these people want a piece of her, but none of them care how much she needs to heal right now. It's like they think she has nothing better to do than sit around waiting for someone else to make plans. \"I swear,\" she mutters, \"it's like everyone just assumes I'll magically fix everything.\" And honestly, it's getting harder and harder to keep going. Every day feels like a struggle, every night a reminder that there's still so much work to do before she can even begin to move on. So why does everyone keep pushing? \"Why can't they understand?\" she wonders, feeling like she's losing control. Why do they keep expecting me to be this superhuman version"

Everything was happening too fast, there were too many questions, and none of them could be answered. We were living through a nightmare, and nothing seemed to make sense. But then I saw him, sitting there, and something inside me snapped. How could someone behave like that? How could he be so indifferent to what happened? It didn’t feel right, it didn’t seem fair. I couldn’t help but wonder how he could be so detached from reality. There had to be more to the story than what we knew, there had to be some explanation for his actions. As I watched him, I felt a growing sense of frustration. Something about him seemed off, something that made me want to reach out and understand what was going on. But the more I looked at him, the more I realized that he wasn’t doing anything wrong. He was simply living his life, and there was nothing I could do about it. And yet, despite knowing that, I still felt angry. It was as if I wanted to lash out, to scream at him for being who he was. But deep down, I knew that wouldn’t change anything.

It’s so easy to get caught up in the past when all we ever talk about are our exes. We always have these stories about them, what they did, how they treated us, and why they left us. The more we focus on what they did, the less we remember what they said, right? But honestly, I feel like I’ve been living vicariously through everyone else’s relationships. Even though I don’t really have anyone, I still want everything they have. When I see couples holding hands or laughing together, it makes me wonder if there’s something wrong with me. Maybe I’m just not good enough. It’s funny how people can forget about us once they find someone new. They move on, and we’re stuck here, constantly thinking about them. You’d think we'd be happy for them, but deep down, we're just sad that we won’t be part of their lives anymore. And I guess that's why it hurts so much—because I’ve given myself away,"
