Every time she tried to speak up, she was met with the same dismissive attitude—“You don’t have what it takes.” It wasn't just one person; it felt like every interaction ended in the same way. Even her own colleagues seemed to think they could handle anything better than her. When she stood up to defend her work, she was met with smirks and condescending smiles. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was somehow less worthy. She began to doubt everything she thought she knew about herself. Her confidence crumbled, and she wondered if she'd ever truly fit in anywhere. It was as if every experience proved that she didn't belong, reinforcing her self-doubt. She felt like she was trapped in an endless cycle of failure, and no amount of effort could change the outcome."

Yet, here she stood, surrounded by memories of him, trying to find solace in the very things that now served as painful reminders of her loss. She had envisioned a future filled with laughter, adventure, and endless creativity. Instead, her paintings hung blank, devoid of the inspiration that once flowed from him. The room seemed hollow, and the silence deafening. Every day, every moment, felt like a betrayal – as if the universe itself was mocking her, telling her that some dreams were never meant to come true. She couldn’t help but wonder why she had believed in such a fairy tale, why she’d let herself fall for someone who seemed to have no intention of staying. In the days that followed, she struggled to accept the truth. Why would anyone leave? What could possibly make him walk away, especially after all they had shared? The questions swirled inside her, refusing to let go, even as reality continued to slap her awake. She tried to fill the emptiness, to distract herself from the pain, but nothing worked. The only thing that remained constant was the ache, a reminder that"

I want to believe they're not perfect, that they have problems too, but deep down, I know it's hard to find someone like us. We had something special, something worth fighting for. Why does everyone else get to find happiness while I'm left here, alone? Why am I so pathetic that I couldn’t hold onto what was meant for me? Does she think I’m stupid? Does she think I don’t care?

I wonder if the dumpster is leaking toxic fumes. Shouldn’t we open the lid wider to see if there are any signs of danger? If we let people leave the area now, they’ll probably throw more trash out.
