He stepped closer, \"Excuse me, could you please...?\" She turned, her eyes meeting his, then dismissed him with a shrug. \"I've been waiting,\" he muttered under his breath, feeling the heat rise in his cheeks.

She's probably never worked hard for anything in her life, just coasted through college and into a good job. And now she's pushing her cart around like she owns the place, acting like she's better than everyone else. It's disgusting. The way she just shrugged at me when I tried to talk to her - like she wasn't even listening. Does she think she's some kind of princess just because she has a few dollars in her purse? It makes me sick to my stomach, thinking about how she must treat people in real life. I bet she doesn't even say hello to anyone anymore; she's too busy being self-absorbed and looking at her phone. If she were a little more humble and less entitled, maybe we wouldn't have such problems today. But no, instead she's off making her own little bubble, surrounded by nothing but herself and her stupid phone. And what's worse is that she might be getting away with all sorts of things because nobody wants to stand up to her. That's exactly what happens when you let someone like her get out of control. Now, every time she goes shopping, I'm going to make sure to go out of my way to block her aisle again. Maybe if"

It made me wonder if anyone truly understood what I went through, especially after hearing him talk about how his life was just as hectic but somehow more enjoyable. When I sat alone on that park bench, surrounded by nature that brought back memories of happier times, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was constantly behind. Every little thing reminded me of what I lacked - whether it was the warmth of his presence, the comfort of our conversations, or the peace of mind that came with knowing he was there for me. Even the silence felt deafening, like a reminder that I wasn't enough for him anymore. I realized then that no matter how hard I tried to move forward, I was forever stuck in this cycle of longing and disappointment.

I can't help but wonder how many other teachers are facing similar challenges right now. Are there others who feel betrayed by the school board? Have we been treated unfairly? I suppose I could try to find new opportunities elsewhere, but it would be difficult to adjust to a different classroom after decades of experience.
