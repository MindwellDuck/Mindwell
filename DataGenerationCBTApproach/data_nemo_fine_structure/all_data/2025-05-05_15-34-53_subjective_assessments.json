The house felt empty without her laughter filling its rooms. He found himself staring at their wedding photo, the corners worn from years of loving touch. A soft meow from their cat brought him back to the present. He picked up the feline, burying his face in its fur, seeking comfort in its warmth. The doorbell rang, startling him. It was a neighbor with a casserole, offering condolences for their recent miscarriage. His heart sank as he took the dish, his sorrow renewed by the sympathetic gaze of another.",

They had already been trying for years, and now they would never get the chance to build a family. What if they had gotten the news differently? Maybe then things would've turned out okay. But life goes on, and time keeps moving. He's still working hard every day, and she's still dealing with her grief. Their relationship is still strong, but there are moments when it feels like it might all fall apart. What if she left him? She started going through a phase where she'd just cry whenever he came home. She'd tell him stories about other women who were better suited for fatherhood than he was. He tried to explain how much he wanted children, but she just shook her head. What if she decided to leave him? They bought an apartment together, thinking this would be their forever place. But one night, she woke up, and I could see tears streaming down her face. \"I don't know if I want kids anymore,\" she said, her voice shaking. I tried to reassure her, but deep down, I worried what if she really didn't want them? It started with little things. She wouldn't hold my hand during walks, and our conversations became strained.

Oh dear, I hope he remembers to take his medication today. If not, he might end up feeling sick again. What if he doesn't remember to refill his prescription? That would be terrible, especially since he's been dealing with those high blood pressure issues lately. I wonder if he's getting enough sleep. Maybe I should check on that? I canâ€™t believe this happened again. My memory isnâ€™t what it used to be either. I feel so tired all the time and sometimes get confused about things.
