He takes a deep breath, letting the tension build in his chest. His thoughts swirl around the machine, each passing moment fueling his anger. The machine, once a symbol of hope, now stands as a cruel joke, a reminder of what he lost. It’s just a tool, but it holds so much more. Every part of it, every curve, every line, holds the weight of what could have been, what will never be. Her laughter echoes through the lab, a constant reminder of what he can’t have, what he’ll always lose. This isn’t just a machine; it represents a life unlived, dreams shattered, and the loneliness that comes with them.

I tried to shake off the feeling, but it lingered, like a shadow over my heart. This is all so hard. It feels like the worst part of me is screaming for closure, while another part of me wants to hold onto the past forever. I know it’s irrational, but every time I see something similar, it feels like a punch to the chest. I wish things were different, but deep down, I know I have to move forward. Yet, the memories keep flooding back, making it impossible to focus on anything else. I’m just so tired of it all—of remembering what could’ve been, of wondering what he’d done if he were still here, of seeing paintings that remind me of us, and of holding onto them tightly, even though it hurts.

He never finished the piece he started two months ago anyway. Maybe this is why he hasn't been working lately – he's too busy planning how he wants to spend his money. You can tell by looking at him; he's always thinking about the next big thing. He's not really interested in painting anymore; he's just pretending to be interested to impress everyone with his latest hobby.
