The fact that people who aren't you can get away with just sitting in class while you're stuck here trying to make up your own notes. Like, seriously, how do they do it?

It's like the universe is playing some cruel joke on me. I swear, every time I try something new, I end up failing miserably. Why does everything always go wrong for me? Can't anyone see that I'm struggling? Don't they care about me? It's just so fucking frustrating. I feel like I'll never catch up, especially since every single person around me gets it right.

It wasn’t until we overheard him muttering, “This is all your fault,” that it became painfully clear: he felt as though we were all conspiring against him. Our attempts at reassurance fell on deaf ears as he continued to rail against the very people who cared most about his success. It seemed like no matter what we did, nothing could quell the fire burning within him. Even when faced with the possibility of retirement, which would have brought relief to many, he couldn’t help but see it as another personal failure. His actions spoke louder than words; every small setback felt like a crushing blow. His frustration boiled over into anger, and one day, he lost control, slamming his fist onto the workbench. As he stood there, chest heaving, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d finally uncovered the truth behind his behavior – and it was far more devastating than anything we might have imagined. He'd always been driven by a desire to prove himself, to silence those who doubted his worth. But now, it seemed, that drive had become a self-destructive force, fueling his anger"

And yet, somehow, he gets promoted every year. But anyway, back to my colleague... I feel like she's always been given special treatment, especially when it comes to things like raises and bonuses. Like, have you seen how much more money they give teachers who are part of those leadership teams? It's outrageous! I swear, if I had half the luck she has, I'd be making six figures by now. (Of course, I've already applied for that job at the district office.) What really bothers me is that everyone seems to think she deserves this award so badly. Even the principal called her \"one of our best teachers\" during the ceremony. Can you believe that? I know I'm a great teacher too, but no one ever gives me that kind of praise. It's infuriating! It's clear that the administration is just favoring people who fit their ideal mold. They don't care about the rest of us; we're just pawns in their game of power and privilege.

But why did I feel such a strong urge to shift the focus away from myself? Was it because I didn't want to acknowledge my own role in creating such chaos? Or perhaps it was simply easier to point fingers at others when confronted with something as unpleasant as rotting art supplies? It's almost as if I was trying to convince myself that this wasn't really my problem, that someone else was entirely to blame. That way, I could avoid taking responsibility for my actions and keep my pride intact. But deep down, I knew the truth - that I had indeed contributed to this mess through my own negligence.
