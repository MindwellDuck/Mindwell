She told me that there had been strange noises coming from the alley beside the store, and she thought someone might have broken in. But then she said, \"It's probably just the wind.\" And I couldn't help but feel a little frustrated. Wasn't she taking this seriously? Didn't she think that maybe - just maybe - we should go inside and check? But no, she seemed determined to dismiss the whole thing. And when I suggested that maybe we should look around, she simply turned to me and said, \"You're overreacting.\" Like what? Overreacting? What could possibly make me overreact? But before I could even process her words, she took off down the sidewalk, leaving me standing there feeling foolish. Why did she always get to decide how we handled these situations? Why did I always end up looking like the crazy one? As I stood there, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd misinterpreted everything entirely. Maybe she wasn't scared at all; maybe she was just being dramatic. But the image of her walking away from me, her back straight and her head held high, lingered in my mind. Had I"

It reads: \"I love you, but I need space.\" I feel like I’m drowning in grief, unable to grasp anything except the overwhelming pain. I keep wondering what could have led him to leave. Was it something I said? Something I didn’t say? Maybe I wasn’t good enough? Did I forget to tell him how much I loved him? Did I miss opportunities to connect? Or was it just too late? Did we grow apart too quickly? This thought has haunted me for weeks. I've tried everything to get him back—writing letters, calling him, even showing up at his new job. But he never responds.
