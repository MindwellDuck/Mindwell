But those dreams have long since been shattered, leaving nothing but tears and regret.

It's cruel that he left me with such pain, but I'll never forgive myself for staying too long, for not being strong enough. Her mind is a maelstrom of grief, where every memory feels like a knife cutting deeper. We were meant to grow old together, sharing stories of our children and grandchildren, but now all I'm left with are these reminders of what could've been. Every time I see him in the pictures, I'm hit with the crushing weight of loneliness. His smile, once so full of hope, now taunts me, a bittersweet reminder of what I'll never experience again. I try to hold on to the past, but it slips through my fingers like sand. I wonder if I ever really knew him at all, if I ever truly loved him, or if I just imagined everything because I wanted it to"

As she gazed into Timmy's eyes, she saw something there that she hadn't noticed before—a deep sadness, a longing that echoed her own sense of loss. Yet, instead of feeling empathy, she felt a pang of frustration—why did he think she was his mother? Why did he expect such kindness from someone who had so clearly failed him? Her mind began to wander back to all the times she'd missed visiting Timmy, all the days when she'd put work above family visits. She remembered how she'd promised herself that this wouldn't happen again, that she'd make time for every child in the ward, but here she was, standing in front of one boy, wondering if he even knew who she was. The irony was crushing—the woman who had once been so certain about everything now felt lost, unsure why her own expectations mattered so much. As she stood there, frozen in disappointment, she realized that her perception of the world had become rigid. She told herself that things should have turned out differently, that she should have made more of an effort to connect with Timmy. But in reality, none of those expectations had ever been based on anything more substantial than her own desires."
