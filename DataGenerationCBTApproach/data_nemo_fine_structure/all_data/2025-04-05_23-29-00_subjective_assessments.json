He pulled over, watching them kick up leaves in the late autumn sun. One little boy, with hair the same shade as his own at that age, was chasing after a ball. It rolled towards him, and he scooped it up, smiling. The boy's face lit up in recognition of his teacher, running towards him with open arms. He felt his heart ache, a sharp pang that stole his breath. Today would have been his younger brother's fifth birthday.",

And now that I think about it, every time we had a meeting, he was the one who spoke last, never allowing anyone else to share their thoughts. I felt so trapped and silenced around him. When I finally stood up at the last meeting, he dismissed me with a condescending smile and said I wasn't contributing enough. Now, I know that he didn’t care about my well-being; he just wanted us to fail. This is so much worse than what I thought. It’s all his fault because he forced us to take on more responsibilities. If he hadn’t, none of this would’ve happened. But no, he had to go and make us work even harder. We were already stressed, and then he goes and makes us miss birthdays and holidays. The worst part? He doesn’t even care. I saw it in his eyes during that final meeting when he told me off for taking breaks. He just didn’t want me to succeed.

I spent hours trying to figure out how to upload files, and nothing worked. I asked for help, but nobody seemed to understand what I was struggling with. So I ended up dropping the class because I couldn't keep up. Why does it have to be so difficult all the time? It feels like I'm constantly fighting against technology, and it never ends well. And don't even get me started on my old laptop. That thing was a nightmare. I spent months fixing it, and it still didn't work properly. I had to deal with constant crashes, freezes, and updates that always broke things. My entire computer setup is a disaster waiting to happen. It's frustrating because I know I'm not supposed to feel this way. Everyone else makes it look easy, but they're probably just lying about how simple it is.

She had this...this look in her eyes, a spark of mischief that drew me in. And then there was the way she laughed, so softly and genuinely that it felt like she was sharing a secret only I understood. It was all so fucking obvious. I shouldn’t have let myself get drawn in, especially since I knew what would happen next. We were supposed to leave together, not hang out with her. Yet here we were, sitting side by side, pretending to chat while secretly exchanging knowing glances. The whole thing felt like some twisted game, one I was both eager and terrified to play. It wasn’t fair that he got to see her smile, to hear her laugh, to know her inside jokes. I was the one who should’ve been privy to those moments, not him. Why did she need to smile at everyone? Why did she get to share laughter with strangers? I was the one who deserved that kind of connection."
