That's just rude, especially since I've already put effort into cooking it to your liking. You don't deserve to be treated like this because of your petulant behavior. Stop trying to control everything and get over yourself. Your food isn't always right, and now you're making a scene about it. If you can't handle the fact that something didn't meet your standards, maybe you shouldn't eat out. It's not like we're forcing you to eat here anyway. You know what? The worst part is that people like you make us look bad. We actually try our best to please everyone, but you keep treating us like crap. Just leave if you can't handle being served correctly. Maybe you'll find a place where they cater to your selfish needs. Whatever, go ahead and throw your tantrums elsewhere. This isn't some high-end restaurant for you to indulge in your ego; it's a normal business. And as for your complaint, you could have handled it better. Instead of sending back your food, why not simply ask politely? But no, you'd rather cause a scene and insult the chef for doing his job. So go ahead and waste other people's time with your petty complaints. If you come in here expecting to be treated like royalty and fed exactly how you want, then maybe you should"

You'll be so upset about this one thing that you won't be able to focus on anything else. Everything around you will start falling apart because of your inability to cope with rejection. How are you going to keep moving forward when every little setback knocks you off balance? Are you prepared to let this one decision define your entire life? Because if you are, then go ahead and take the leap. But know that once you start falling, you won't stop until you hit rock bottom. And at that point, nobody will even notice.

I've always managed to get good grades despite my difficulties with speech. So why does this one comment make me feel like such an idiot? I wish he knew how much effort goes into speaking clearly. It takes time and practice to perfect your skills, especially when you're starting from scratch. Every day, I struggle to articulate what I want to say. Sometimes, it feels like the more I try, the worse it gets. It's exhausting and painful, but I refuse to give up. What hurts even more is that it's not just him. There are other kids too, who often stare at me or snicker whenever I speak. It's hard not to take it personally when people treat me like I'm somehow less capable than them.

Just an empty mailbox staring back at me, taunting me with its silence. I felt betrayed. How could he do this? We were supposed to meet right here, and instead, there’s nothing but dust and dirt in this stupid mailbox. I know it sounds silly, but now I feel like I’m going crazy. Maybe I should have waited longer, maybe I should have tried harder. What if I missed him again? What if he changed his mind? Why did he ignore us? It’s all my fault.
