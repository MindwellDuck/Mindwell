I felt like I'd been punched in the gut every time we met. Why did they still talk? They laughed together, sharing stories about our time together. It didn't feel right, like I was just a memory to them. He remembered how it started—when we first met, he thought she was just another girl who caught his eye. But then he realized what he had missed out on. Her kindness, her laughter, her ability to see beyond the surface level. He couldn't help but wonder if things would have been different if he had stayed. Maybe if he had taken a chance, she wouldn't have moved on so easily. But now, as he watched the happy couple, he couldn't shake off the feeling of emptiness. There was nothing wrong with being single; he had friends and hobbies, after all. Yet, the loneliness lingered, refusing to let go. He wondered if this was what it meant to truly love someone—to accept that sometimes, you might lose that person forever."

No one to share his memories with now, just this faded picture as proof. The way he handled the photo was gentle, almost tender. I wonder if he still talks about her sometimes, maybe even writes letters or something. But what would be the point? She's gone, and all he's left with are these painful reminders. He probably feels pretty lost, stuck in his apartment with nothing but memories. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to think about what could've been. I'd feel so lost if I were in his shoes. What if that woman had stayed? Would things have turned out differently? Maybe he thinks about her every night, wondering what she's doing somewhere else. It's hard to imagine someone like that being gone, leaving behind such beautiful moments. That smile looks genuine - the kind you see when you're truly happy. I'm sure he misses her deeply. It's heartbreaking how life takes everything from us, leaving only memories. Life can be cruel sometimes. I hope he finds some peace someday, but I can't help feeling sorry for him.

He'd say he was working late, but I knew the truth - he preferred being away, even if it meant leaving me behind. When he came home, we were supposed to share our days, but instead, I found myself eating dinner alone, the tasteless meal a reminder of his absence. He'd talk about his meetings, the projects he worked on, and how they kept him busy, but what did those things have to do with us? Did he think I wouldn't notice the hours ticking by? I couldn't help but wonder if he ever thought about me, or if he just assumed I understood that he had responsibilities. Even when he returned, exhausted, he'd sit down and fall asleep instantly, leaving me to clean up after him. It wasn't fair; I felt like I was doing everything while he recharged. But that was just part of the deal - I took care of the household, cooked, and managed everything until he woke up refreshed. Yet, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake off the feeling of loneliness that clung to me like a damp shroud."

It's like she expects the world to come crashing down around her at every turn. Like the time we were driving home from dinner and she got stuck behind a slow-moving truck. Instead of laughing it off like everyone else does, she started yelling at the driver, saying, \"What are you doing? Can't you see we're trying to get home?\" It was ridiculous. And now she's acting even worse than usual because my parents have to sell their house to pay for all our medical bills. But honestly, what's new? Her drama has been going on for years.
