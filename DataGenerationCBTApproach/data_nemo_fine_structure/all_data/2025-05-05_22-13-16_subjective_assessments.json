Like seriously, what's with all these? It's not like I haven't got enough going on right now. My heart is racing. My palms are sweating. And I'm sitting in an empty office, staring at a computer screen that seems to be pulsing with messages. I can feel it, this tightness spreading through my chest, like it's trying to squeeze out of me. I'm fucking done with all of this. It's not just about the work; it's about everything else too. The night shifts, the missed calls, the abandoned cases... They're all swirling around in my head, making me feel like I'm drowning. I keep thinking about my ex-husband, how he used to say I was always stressed, that I'd forget things because I was so anxious. He said I needed help, but I never thought it would get to this point. This is all starting to make sense now. I remember when we were together, how he'd complain about me being distant, how he'd say I wasn't giving him my full attention. He'd ask if I was okay, if there was something bothering me, but I'd just push him away, saying I didn't want to talk about it. Now I realize he was right. But instead of helping me"

Guilt, heavy and palpable, like a weight pressing down on his chest. Her untouched dinner sat on the table, now cold and unappetizing, next to a note that simply read, \"I waited.\"",

Yeah, let's assume she hates me for ignoring her all day. Let's jump to conclusions! After all, we've been together for over five years—what if she's already checked out on me? The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. She never texts me back when I try to reach out. If I ever missed an hour, she'd be frantic. Now that she's forgotten our dinner, she must have moved on. And why else would she leave a note that says nothing except \"I waited\"? Is this some kind of test? Does she expect me to magically appear, ready to apologize and make everything better? Fuck that. I don't need this shit. Maybe she really is done with me. And honestly, who wouldn’t be? I’ve been distant lately, stuck in my head. I wonder if she’s seen someone else. I bet she has. She probably hasn’t given me a second thought since yesterday. We haven’t talked since then, and she could be spending quality time with someone new. It feels so good to finally say it out loud"

I’m just stuck here, working day after day, no one to share these moments with. Why bother celebrating when everyone else is moving forward? It doesn’t matter if he’s jealous too, I don’t care. We’re both adults, we can handle our emotions. But it’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’ve been left behind. Maybe he thinks he deserves this more than me, maybe he feels entitled to happiness now that I’m not around. Does he even remember what happened between us? Or does he just ignore it and pretend everything is fine? He didn't say anything about it, but the way he smiled at them makes me wonder if he's forgotten how much it hurt me. I guess I'll just keep moving forward, but why do I always get stuck in the past? Even though I know I shouldn't, I still compare myself to him, wondering where I went wrong. Maybe he never"

It's like I'm already insecure enough about being a cop, and now this? No fucking way! I feel like such an idiot for even thinking about kissing someone else, especially when there are other officers around who clearly aren't struggling with jealousy. But damn, she must really love him to put up with all this. I mean, I've seen them arguing before, and she always ends up backing down. Maybe this is some kind of twisted game where she's pretending to hate him to keep him close? That would explain why she's acting so coldly towards everyone else today... Wait, no... That's ridiculous. She doesn't need to act like this; she's fine. What the hell am I doing?"
