It wasn't fair; after everything he'd said, everything he'd done, how could he still hold onto her? Didn't he understand that she deserved better? But then there were those moments—moments where she saw something in his eyes that looked almost like genuine regret. A flicker of remorse that seemed almost real, as if he genuinely understood what he’d done, what he might have been capable of. And yet, he never stayed long enough to make amends. Never took the chance to truly apologize, to prove that he was more than just a fleeting infatuation. He moved on, effortlessly, leaving her behind like yesterday’s trash. Yet here he was, standing right in front of her, his hand casually resting against her waist as they laughed together. The way he touched her, the way he looked at her—it was all too much. Every glance, every brush of skin, made her feel like she was drowning in his gaze. Drowning in memories that refused to let go, memories that haunted her every waking moment. Memories that kept her up at night, unable to shake the feeling that she was losing herself in him."

As she settles into the chair beside him, he can't help but steal glances at the baby, his mind whispering, \"You should have been more careful. This is your fault.\"",

Meanwhile, that guy gets paid $60 an hour, plus overtime. He probably has a nice house with a white picket fence. I’m stuck living with my parents, and they’re already threatening to cut off support because I don’t have a job lined up. What if he lost his job tomorrow? Would he be able to pay rent? That kid must weigh 20 pounds already. I can barely afford diapers for my own little one. And what about his partner? Is she working double shifts too? Does she get paid time off when her mom passes away? Probably not. She’d rather be out partying than taking care of that precious baby. I've worked non-stop since graduating, putting in 12-hour days just to make ends meet. When was the last time I took a proper vacation? Never. I haven’t even gone on a date in months.

Not just the situation itself, but how it might affect the people around me. It’s like, I can’t stop thinking about all the potential consequences. I mean, I’ve always been someone who tries to think ahead, but lately, it feels like I’m overthinking almost everything. Take this particular situation, for instance—the student I declined to tutor because of my schedule. Now, I know it sounds crazy, but every time I grade his work, I start imagining him struggling even more. Maybe I shouldn’t have turned him down. What if his grades are slipping now because I didn’t help him out? Or maybe he’s even dropping out of school because of that. It’s hard not to picture him facing even tougher challenges. It’s funny, though—I don’t really believe any of these worst-case scenarios. They’re just thoughts that keep popping up, making me feel anxious and unsure.

But now, that smile seemed more like a cruel joke, taunting him with memories of happier times. Every laugh, every smile, every moment she shared with this stranger felt like a knife twisting deeper into his heart. She didn't seem to notice him anymore, too caught up in her own little world. Her laughter carried further than ever before, echoing through the quiet moments when it should have been just a faint whisper. It was overwhelming, making him feel like an invisible ghost hovering around the edges of her life. Even the simplest actions seemed complicated, like trying to breathe underwater. In that moment, all he wanted was for time to slow down, to savor every second, and relive the past. But life had other plans, and reality kept pushing forward, forcing him back into the present. Now, as he stood there, frozen in sadness, he realized that he wasn’t alone; he was part of a larger story—a story where everyone else seemed to be moving forward while he was stuck in the past"

Would he end up living in the shadows, invisible and forgotten? Was he doomed to repeat the same patterns forever, never truly escaping the cycle of failure?

It's like I've lost all sense of purpose here. I thought creating would lift my mood, but instead, it's made me feel trapped. Why does nothing seem right? The room feels empty, even though it's filled with tools and supplies. I can't shake off the feeling that I should be doing better than this. That I should have more talent, more ideas, more creativity. Every time I pick up a brush, I expect perfection. When reality falls short, I feel defeated. I wish things were easier, like they used to be, but life doesn't work that way. I guess I'm still learning, but it feels like I'm stuck in a rut, going through the motions without any real progress.
