Every day is the same: you rush out the door, she's left alone with the kids, and the house falls apart while you're working. What does she get in return? A few kisses and a pat on the back before you head off to another meeting? Maybe you should consider what you're getting out of this relationship before you start acting like you can't live without me. Are you really that selfish?

Meanwhile, we're stuck in this lonely limbo, where every day feels like another disappointment. It's like I'm just not good enough for him. We barely share anything anymore; I've taken over most household chores, but I can't get past this feeling of being invisible. My life used to be full of hope, but now I realize what a lie it was. Every day feels like Groundhog Day. I wake up to the same routine, go through the motions, and then fall back asleep. What's the point? I don't know if I'll find anyone else who will put up with me.

Maybe she wasn't even aware of how much she was struggling, but deep down, there must be a part of her that knew exactly what was happening. She was one of the few remaining holdouts, clinging to a way of life that had grown obsolete. Yet, despite this reality, she couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. It was as if she was trying to hold onto the past, but the more she tried, the further away it seemed to slip through her fingers. Her mind raced with thoughts of those who had long since abandoned this place, leaving behind only memories of happier times. The echo of laughter and chatter now seemed like a distant memory, a reminder of a time when life was simpler. As she stood there, frozen in thought, it became clear that she was not just mourning the loss of the past but also the present itself. The silence was oppressive, a constant reminder that things would never go back to the way they were.

They could have built a home filled with laughter and love, just like in their dreams. What if they had moved in together sooner? Would they have found their perfect little nest by then? They would have shared a life full of adventure, exploring new places and making memories that would last forever.
