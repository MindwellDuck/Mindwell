What if he got lost in the woods while trying to find his way back to civilization? What if he fell off a cliff while chasing after some kids who dared to tease him? It doesn’t help that he saw them laughing together earlier. They seemed so carefree, enjoying each other’s company, and it made him feel even more isolated. He imagined them talking about him behind his back, making fun of how he looked or what he did for a living. It wasn’t just the officer; everyone seemed to be having a great time except for him. Every step felt heavy, every breath reminded him of his limitations. He wondered if anyone would notice if he disappeared into thin air. Would they think he’d finally found peace, or would they worry about him? The thought sent a chill down his spine, but he didn’t let it show. He kept walking, lost in his thoughts, replaying all the scenarios that could go wrong. If he ever stopped, they might see him as weak. If he ever smiled, they might think he was silly. If he ever asked for directions, they might think he was stupid. That’s why he continued moving forward, forcing himself through the pain, determined to prove that he still had a place among them. But deep down, he couldn’t shake the feeling"

She's probably talking to someone else right now, I can tell by the way she acted last time. Her body language screamed \"not interested\", and I didn't even notice. I thought she was being polite, but now I see the truth. She's just playing games with me, using me until she finds someone better. And honestly, I don't blame her. I would have done the same thing if I were in her shoes. I wouldn't stay in a relationship where I wasn't loved back, why bother? It's clear she's lost interest in me, and I need to move on before things get any worse. This isn't fair, I'm giving everything I have, and she's taking advantage of my kindness.

Then maybe I wouldn’t have to deal with these stupid accidents and I could’ve gone to class right on time instead of sitting there worrying about everything!
