The woman, now an elder stateswoman in journalism, was being celebrated for her decades-long career. But when I saw her name on the guest list, my mind flashed back to a time when she had wronged me. It was just one incident, but it felt like a lifetime ago. She had taken credit for my work, and I had never forgotten how it made me feel—like no matter how hard I worked, someone else would always be ahead of me. This time, though, it wasn’t about my own success or failure. It was about how she seemed to be celebrating her life at the expense of others. I wondered if this party was really worth the cost of her reputation, especially when so many people were there who deserved to be honored more. Yet, even as I thought these thoughts, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all part of some larger pattern—a pattern where women like her would always hold power over us. They would always get what they wanted, while we struggled to keep up. And why? Because they were smart enough to know that taking credit for your ideas was the key to getting ahead in the industry. If you didn’t have the skills to come up with something original yourself, then you were nothing more than a footnote in someone else’s book. It was simple logic: if you weren’t creative"

What would she think if she saw how broken I am right now? I wish I could go back to before when things were normal, when we spent hours talking about our dreams and goals. Now, I'm just sitting here feeling stupid, wondering why I ever thought she loved me. It's so stupid to hope she'll come back. But it's hard not to feel that way when you're left with nothing but tears and regret. Maybe she's just tired of me being so clingy and needy.

It wasn't until she saw the photo of her granddaughter, smiling brightly with her partner, that the reality set in. They were both so young, barely out of college. The thought of her son growing up and starting his life without her was almost too much to bear. Tears streamed down her face as she tried to process everything. She couldn't help but think back to the day he proposed to his high school sweetheart. He had taken her to the same park where they had spent countless hours together. As they sat under the same oak tree, he pulled out a small box and asked for her hand in marriage. She remembered how her heart skipped a beat as she said yes, promising to love him forever. Now, she felt like she was losing him all over again, this time to someone else. Her eyes drifted away from the photo, and she began to reminisce about the early days of their relationship. They had met through mutual friends, bonding over their shared love of literature. Their first date consisted of a walk through the city, discussing books and dreams. It was during one of these walks that he first told her how he felt. He"
