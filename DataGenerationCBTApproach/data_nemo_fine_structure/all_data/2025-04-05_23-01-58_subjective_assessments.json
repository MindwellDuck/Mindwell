What if he didn’t even notice it was broken until he saw it in the trash? Or maybe he simply didn't care enough to fix it before throwing it away? But no, apparently, he must have been so angry about it that he just threw it out without even trying to salvage it. Maybe he did just throw it because he's really careless? Maybe he didn’t even think twice about it? But does he always act like this? Is he really such an irresponsible person? It’s probably not his fault, but I still feel like he’s being reckless, though he doesn’t seem to be taking responsibility for anything right now. I mean, what if he didn’t even see it broken? Would he have thrown it away then? But now he is acting all mad and stuff, which makes me wonder if there’s more to this story than we know. Still, he must have had some kind of problem with that brush, or he wouldn’t have done what he did. Right? He could’ve easily fixed it, but he chose not to. So maybe he just doesn’t care about fixing things. And if he didn’t care about it, would he really go out of his way to pick it up after he’d already thrown it away? I don’t think so.

If I never talk to her again... Fuck! My whole life has been shit ever since we stopped talking. She was always so perfect, always so happy. And then suddenly she was gone. Gone forever. I could've reached out, tried to make things better, but no... nothing. Just silence. Now, I'm left with this fucking letter, and the thought that maybe I'll never see her again.

He could feel his anger building, but he tried to keep it under control. \"How the fuck can this happen?\" he muttered to himself. The router's silence was deafening, making it seem even more ominous. He thought back to all the times he'd forgotten to charge his phone overnight, always assuming he'd have plenty of time to get it charged again in the morning. Now, he felt like he was stuck in some kind of horror movie. His frustration turned into a full-blown rage, and he slammed his fist onto the wall. \"Why does this shit always happen to me?!\" he shouted, even though no one was around to hear him. He paced back and forth, trying to calm down, but his mind kept racing with thoughts of what might be happening online. Was his data being stolen? Were people looking at his private stuff?
