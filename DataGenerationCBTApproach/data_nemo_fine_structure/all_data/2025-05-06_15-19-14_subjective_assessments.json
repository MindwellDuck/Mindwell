She reached out, tracing the rough fabric, remembering how he'd worn it on their last trip to the museum, his voice animated as he spoke about history's lessons. The house felt too big, too silent, too full of echoes that would never again be filled by his laughter.",

I look back at her happy family photos, and I can't help but feel a pang of jealousy. She has this perfect little world, while mine crumbles. Every day, I'm struggling to hold on to anything, and all I see is failure. It's hard to keep going when everything seems to be against me. My sister's life is so much easier than mine. She doesn’t have to deal with the constant pressure to succeed, the crushing debt, or the loneliness. No one wants to be friends anymore because everyone sees me as a loser. It’s hard to explain why I’m struggling when no one believes me. My sister’s husband thinks I’m just being dramatic and lazy, which makes me more resentful. Why does she get to live this blissful life? Does she ever stop thinking about how lucky she is? I hate how my mind works. Sometimes,"
