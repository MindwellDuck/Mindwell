I bet he'll say something like \"It's none of your business!\" and then act all angry. Ugh, I wish I hadn't seen it, but now I feel like such an idiot for even touching it. He's probably going to tell me to stop looking for brushes and stuff anyway, but I really think he needs to clean it out better next time.
