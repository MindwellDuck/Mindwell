I feel like such an idiot. I know I'm overreacting, but what if this is a sign of things to come? Maybe I'll never get another chance at something like this again. It feels like every door I try to open gets slammed shut in front of me. What if I've wasted too much time already? Shouldn't I have been focusing more on other opportunities instead of getting caught up in this one thing? I know I need to calm down and move on, but it's hard when everything feels like a failure. It's like the universe is conspiring against me, making everything fall apart right when I least expect it. I keep thinking about all the times I could've spent with family or friends instead of pouring my heart into this show. Now those moments are gone, and I'm left feeling guilty and regretful. It's frustrating because I had high hopes for this exhibition. I was so excited to share my art with people who would understand its meaning. And then, just like that, it's all taken away.

Her partner stirred beside her, mumbling something about turning off the noise. She froze, her breath catching in her throat as she realized she couldn't remember setting the alarm last night. Had she? Or was this another sign of her mind playing tricks on her again? The anxiety that had been simmering beneath the surface bubbled up, threatening to consume her entirely. She took a deep, shuddering breath, trying desperately to focus on the present moment instead of the terrifying what-ifs swirling in her head. Today was supposed to be just another day at work, but as she sat there, paralyzed by fear, it felt like the start of something far more sinister.",

But still, it feels like they’re avoiding me, like they don’t have time for someone like me—someone who’s always on edge and doesn’t really fit in anywhere. It’s not like I ask for much. Just a little understanding would go a long way. But no, everyone seems to think they're better off without me around. Like, why? Why does everything have to be so complicated? Can't we just...just...I don't know, live? Is that too much to ask? And then there’s my sleep disorder. It's like my brain has a personal vendetta against rest. I wake up every morning feeling like I've been put through a wringer. My body feels stiff, my mind racing. It's exhausting, and yet somehow I still manage to push through, because who else will?

You'll get through this.\" His words were reassuring, but what really struck her was how calm he seemed. It wasn't until later, when she started to feel overwhelmed again, that she realized why. He'd been working hard lately, putting in long hours to help the business grow. Maybe he understood more than she thought what it meant to live with the constant pressure of uncertainty. When she finally broke down in tears, he held her close and whispered softly, \"Just take things one step at a time. We'll figure it out together.\" As she looked into his eyes, she felt a wave of gratitude wash over her. In that moment, she knew exactly how much support he had always given her, even when she hadn't seen it before.

He even started taking online classes to learn new recipes! Meanwhile, my partner's job requires long hours, leaving us with little time for cooking. We can't afford to hire someone to help with meal prep either, unlike some other families where the kids are old enough to contribute.
