She has no idea how much stress she caused me and many other students, all because of her own arrogance and lack of patience. It's clear that she thinks she's above everyone else just by the way she acts like she owns the place. The way she talks down to us as if we're nothing more than inferior beings is disgusting. She doesn't realize that she's the one who's failing us, not the other way around. She has no empathy whatsoever - it's amazing she hasn't gone mad yet! Her complete disregard for our feelings is mind-boggling. How could someone be so heartless? Does she even care about anyone at all? It's incredible that she still manages to keep a smile on her face despite being so cruel to everyone around her. How does she get away with this? Doesn't she feel guilty every time she sees us struggling because of her own incompetence? Apparently, she's too arrogant to admit when she's wrong and is instead convinced that she's right all along. That's what makes her such an awful teacher. She must think she's some kind of genius just because she managed to make herself sound smart during class. But honestly, she sounds like a complete idiot, which isn't surprising given how clueless she is. It's hilarious that she thinks she's better than everyone else"

Every day is a reminder of what he had lost—the joy, the laughter, and the sense of belonging. The kitchen, where memories of her smiled back at him from every corner, now feels hollow. It’s as if the very walls are watching him, judging him for not being able to save their marriage.

By using phrases such as \"ever since she left him,\" it suggests that this behavior is not temporary but rather a result of a fundamental flaw within themselves, perpetuating the idea that their emotional isolation is an integral part of their personality. This kind of labeling can lead individuals to feel trapped in their emotions and less likely to seek help or change their situation. In this case, the person in the story believes that he will always be alone, which prevents him from taking steps towards healing or reconnection. By applying this distortion, we see how the narrative can reinforce unhealthy patterns, making it more challenging for the character to move forward.
