It's just like what happened to me back in my teenage years. My dad was always yelling at me about something—‘Why did you leave your homework on the table?’ ‘You never help with chores!’—and I ended up getting into trouble every time. But then one day, my sister started coming over, and she would help me with my schoolwork and do the chores too. We'd watch TV together, and sometimes we'd even get into arguments, but it made everything feel less stressful. Then there were other times when my mom would scold me for something, and I'd try to explain myself, but she wouldn't listen. She'd just tell me off again, saying, “Don’t think you can talk your way out of this!” And I’d end up feeling defeated. One time, I tried to convince her that I wasn’t the one who spilled paint on the carpet, but she still yelled at me anyway. I got really upset, and my face burned, but she didn’t care. She kept going on about how I needed to focus more on my studies and stop wasting time. I remember crying in front of our neighbors"

What if I’m measuring up against the sum total of everyone else’s successes? What if I am comparing myself with people who seem better than me, placing myself at a disadvantage, when I am actually comparing myself with people who have been given every opportunity to succeed in order to achieve success, making me feel like I will never be able to succeed because I don't even know where to start? Because I'm stuck in a rut, constantly being compared to those who have already crossed this hurdle, making it impossible for me to ever catch up. I can't help but wonder what would happen if I were to measure myself by the same standards that these successful individuals have set for themselves. Would I finally see that I am capable of achieving great things, too? Or would I still feel like an underdog, struggling to keep up with those who have already reached the top?

This particular incident had left her sister traumatized because it felt like an accident. The sister wasn't there when it happened, and she kept thinking that if she were there, things would have turned out differently. I tried to offer reassurance by saying, \"We understand how difficult it must be for you to go through something like this again.\" However, she seemed unconvinced, especially when another nurse chimed in, \"It's just an accident. There's nothing wrong with your skills.\" The sister replied, \"But what if he [the doctor] did it on purpose? What if he was trying to kill her?\" This comment caught me off guard.

In Emily’s case, she struggled with feeling secure about her relationship with him. She often worried that things might go wrong because she felt uncertain about his commitment to her. This insecurity fueled her anxiety, making her cling to him tightly, hoping that by doing so, she could somehow make him stay. ## Step 2: Understand how anxiety affects decision-making When faced with decisions, those who struggle with anxiety tend to rely heavily on reassurance from others.
