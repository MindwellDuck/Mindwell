Like this stupid crack isn't even that bad, but he can't stop thinking about how it might turn into a giant hole and destroy his life. Ugh, he's such a worrier!

It feels like you’re going to lose your mind. I can’t stand how she looks at him, all those big eyes, smiling so freely. And then she laughs, really loudly, almost as if she’s enjoying herself. How does anyone else even handle this? I’m just a mess. My head is spinning, and I can’t stop thinking about what might be happening between them. I hate it when people are happy together, especially when I'm not. I wish I could just ignore them but my brain won't let me. It makes me want to scream. I wish I could tell myself it doesn’t matter, that it’s none of my business, but it does. I have to care. I shouldn’t feel this way. But I do. Every time I see her laughing, I get this awful pain. I don’t know why I feel so jealous. Maybe I’m just insecure because no one has ever laughed at me before. Or maybe I’m just being dramatic. But I’m definitely being dramatic. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be included. I’m not crazy for feeling this"

It's no wonder she's so quiet this morning, probably just trying to escape the embarrassment. I can imagine how awkward it must feel to walk into the staff lounge, especially after seeing everyone staring at you. It's almost as if the entire room has turned against her. Maybe she'll start wearing sunglasses indoors to hide her face, or carry a book bag full of makeup to cover up the photo. Either way, she deserves our sympathy. After all, we're all human beings, right? But let's be honest; she did ask the coach to take that photo, so some people might say she's asking to be humiliated. I guess she just likes being the center of attention, even if it means being ridiculed. Now she's probably wondering why anyone would want to teach next to her, considering her fashion sense. I'm surprised the school administration hasn’t fired her yet. She really needs to work on her self-esteem, but hey, at least she's consistent. She's always been a bit...unconventional. Who knows? Maybe she'll learn to laugh at herself someday. But until then, we'll just have to pity her. I heard she was pretty good"

It was all so surreal, yet he couldn't shake this feeling that he'd lost something irreplaceable. Every step back seemed to echo through time, like memories were flooding his mind, each one more painful than the last. He remembered how often they'd argued over her love for that particular spice. She always insisted it was the best, but he hated its smell, found it overpowering. Yet, despite his protests, she kept buying it, saying it reminded her of home. How could he forget? They'd laughed together, sharing stories about her childhood, about how much she loved that spice—how it brought back memories of her family. But now...now it was nothing but a memory, a bittersweet reminder of what he'd lost. As he stood there, frozen in grief, the world around him melted away. All he saw were the past and the present, with no room for anything else. He closed his eyes, letting tears fall, as if washing away the pain. Each tear tasted bitter, like salt, reminding him of her absence. He opened his eyes again, but the scene before him remained unchanged—the same vendors, the same stalls"
