How can they just pick up someone new like it's nothing? Do they know what it feels like to feel this way? To see others enjoying life when you've been left behind? No wonder people say I have trust issues—those idiots probably think I'm crazy because I get jealous over every little thing. Meanwhile, they're probably doing God-knows-what behind my back.

As a young girl, I often found myself comparing my appearance to others around me, feeling inadequate whenever someone seemed more confident than me. This pattern continued into adulthood, with each passing year, my insecurities grew stronger. As an adult, these feelings of inadequacy have begun to manifest in subtle yet significant ways. When I see colleagues like the young woman who was caught wearing a bra, I find myself grappling with deep-seated emotions. The image of her laughing at herself in front of others triggers a sense of insecurity within me, making me wonder if I too should feel the same way about my own life. It's as if I'm being pulled back into those early years, where I struggled to keep up with peers who seemed so much more carefree. Now, I can't help but think that this is what it feels like to truly belong — to laugh with yourself, unapologetically. But why does this thought make me feel so off balance? Perhaps it's because, deep down, I've come to believe that I \"should\" be the one who looks perfect, who laughs freely, who owns every moment. Instead, I'm left feeling like an outsider, always looking for validation from others rather than embracing my own uniqueness. It's almost as if I'm waiting for permission to be happy, to let go of the need to fit someone else's ideal. But then again, shouldn't I already know how"
