The sepia-toned photos seemed to mock him; their smiling faces from years past now distant memories. He lingered on one image in particular - a group shot of them and their children at a picnic, laughter frozen in time. His gaze drifted to the empty spaces where once there were two little ones, now grown and gone. A melancholic sigh escaped him as he realized how much time had passed, and how little they'd truly enjoyed it together.",

Would anyone else find this place so beautiful? Or would it just be another day for someone else? As he sat here alone, surrounded by the echoes of our life together, I couldn't help but wonder what could have been. Maybe we wouldn't have moved away if we hadn’t gotten that call. Maybe my job wouldn’t have taken off if I hadn’t gotten that second chance. We always talked about changing our lives, about leaving behind everything familiar. But did we really believe those things would come true? Or was it all just wishful thinking? Did we ever really think about the consequences, the costs? We didn’t want to face reality, to accept that sometimes things don’t go as planned. Now, as I sit here, staring at these photos, I feel like I’m watching a ghost of our relationship. It’s like looking at a dream that slowly fades into nothingness. Even though we’re still married, I often wonder what it would be like if we weren’t. If we were never meant to be together, if we were just passing strangers who happened to share a moment. Would I even remember her if we met again? Would she recognize me? Would she care? Or would it all feel like a strange, unfamiliar encounter? Would she see right through me, or would she try to understand"

I've told myself multiple times that I need to be more careful about keeping track of my belongings, especially during shifts when people are rushing around. Yet, I still end up losing things. Now, I'm worried that I'll lose other important items, too. This isn't fair; I shouldn't have to go through such stress every day. The fact that someone took something so personal from me makes me even angrier. If only they knew how much I value my pens—each one represents a memory or milestone in my life.
