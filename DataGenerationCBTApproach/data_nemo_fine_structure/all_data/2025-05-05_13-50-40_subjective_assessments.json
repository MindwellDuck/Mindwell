No way, he's just being overly sensitive. That's all there is to it. He can't handle himself. He needs to stop acting like this. Stop acting like you're hurting because of some stupid letter. You're not. Just get over it already. Stop freaking out. It's not worth your time. You need to calm down. Stop acting like this isn't real life. It is real life, but you have to deal with it. Deal with it. Don't make such a big deal out of nothing. Get over yourself and move on. He needs to snap out of it. There's no point in getting all worked up over something that doesn't even matter. If anything, he should be relieved that he finally knows about this charity. And he's still going on about how he wants to donate? Unbelievable. How could anyone care so much about this letter? He needs to stop being so emotional about it. This isn't a big deal. It's just a stupid letter. And he's crying? The poor guy"

Every little thing feels like it's being recorded. Even my anxiety attacks are being monitored. It's like I'm trapped in some kind of twisted surveillance state. I need to calm down. But how? This is beyond anything I ever imagined. I keep replaying the events leading up to this email in my head, trying to pinpoint where it all started. Was it the conversation at work? Or was it something else entirely? I wish I could just disappear. This whole situation is driving me crazy. If I were a different person, I would have taken drastic measures by now. But no, I have to sit here and try to make sense of this. It's just so fucking infuriating. This isn't over yet. There are still plenty of things they haven't caught on camera.

When we were younger, she couldn't keep up with me, but now she's finally caught up. I can barely believe how much she's changed. She used to be so uptight all the time; now she's more relaxed, almost too relaxed. Maybe she's trying to make up for lost time. But what about when they celebrate 50 years together? They'll probably have a big party then, and I'll feel like I need to plan something equally impressive. After all, I've been working hard to save up for our own future. I don't know why she has to be so nice to everyone at work, especially those who aren't as successful as us. We deserve better treatment than that. I wonder if she knows how lucky she really is to have me by her side. I bet she doesn't realize how much effort I put into making everything perfect for her. I try to balance things out, but she always takes advantage of me. She never says thank you, and she complains about how I spend too much money on her. Why does she think she deserves such good things? I've sacrificed so much for her, and this is the thanks I get"

He doesn't respond, just keeps reading, his focus unwavering. The tension builds, heavy with unspoken emotions, until finally, she says, \"If you want me gone, leave me.\" There's a pause, then he closes his book and stands, his movements deliberate, as if every step was calculated to make her see things clearly. \"Why are you being so hard?\" he asks, his voice calm, almost detached.
