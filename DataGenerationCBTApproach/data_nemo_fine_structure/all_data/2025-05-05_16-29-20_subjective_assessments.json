She sees him smile fondly at an image of himself with his old colleague, Lisa - the one who always made him laugh, who shared his passion for food and life before they had children, before life became simpler but quieter. His eyes linger on Lisa's face a little too long, stirring something bitter in his wife's chest. She feels her cheeks flush, her grip tighten around the kitchen counter as she watches him from afar, jealousy simmering like an untended pot.",

It's almost as if he's lost all sense of time, and now finds joy in reminiscing about the past. But what really catches me off guard is how intensely he looks at Lisa. He can't help but let out a soft chuckle every now and then, and it’s clear to me that he misses her dearly. The way he smiles, the way his eyes light up – it’s almost as if he’s reliving those memories through her. But why does this bother me so much? Why must I feel jealous whenever I catch glimpses of him smiling at photos of other women? Is it really fair to assume that I'm somehow less important to him than anyone else? Or am I just being paranoid? As I watch him, I start to wonder if I’m the only one he truly cares about. Does he ever think of me when he’s with Lisa? Do I mean anything to him at all? These thoughts swirl inside me, making me feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s been years since we’ve heard from Lisa, and yet here we are, seeing her through our husband’s eyes. It makes me realize that even though we may have moved on, some things never fade away. And maybe, just maybe, that’s okay. # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

This feeling has been building for some time now, and it's only natural to feel concerned. Let us look deeper into your energy and see where this concern might stem from. **Reading 1: The Mysterious Message** In the realm of communication, there are times when our words fall short. Perhaps you've sent a message that didn't quite land as intended? Or maybe there's a situation where you're waiting for a response that hasn't come through? **Reading 2: The Power of Timing** When we wait, we often find ourselves lost in thought. Our minds wander, and our focus begins to slip. It's easy to get caught up in worries about what might be happening elsewhere. But let's take a step back and remember that sometimes, all we can control is the present moment. **Reading 3: The Art of Patience** Patience is a virtue, but it can also become a weakness. When we hold onto hope too tightly, we may start to lose sight of reality. It's essential to strike a balance between holding on and letting go. **Conclusion** As you move forward, keep in mind that sometimes, the best thing to do is simply wait. Allow yourself to breathe, and trust that things will unfold naturally. Remember, patience is both a strength and a challenge. May you walk this path with grace and understanding."

Every time I open social media, I feel like I’m missing out on something everyone else has, something I'll never get back. Why does everyone else have a partner when mine broke up?

The room was silent save for the faint ticking of the old clock above the door - a wedding gift from her parents. It felt like an eternity since he'd heard her laughter echoing off these walls.\n\nHis hands, calloused from years behind the flame, fumbled with the familiar silver band around his finger. He hadn't noticed when it had begun to feel loose, but tonight, as he twirled it absentmindedly, it slipped off entirely and clattered onto the countertop. The sound was deafening in the silence.\n\nHe picked up the ring, turning it over in his hands. Its once-shiny surface was dull now, like everything else in his life. The inscription on the inside read \"Together forever\". He'd had it engraved to match her own, but hers lay buried beneath a cold stone miles away.\n\nThe fridge hummed softly, its light flickering on and off intermittently since she'd left him with it all those months ago. It was just another thing he hadn't bothered fixing. Why bother? Nothing mattered anymore without her.\n\nHe placed the ring back on his finger, pushing it down until it reached the knuckle. Then he turned to face the one photo they had left displayed - a framed picture of them laughing together at some long-forgotten picnic. Her smile was radiant, her eyes sparkling with life. He remembered that day vividly; it seemed like another lifetime now.\n\nTonight was supposed to be their anniversary. They'd planned it years ago, marking the date on the calendar with a red heart. But she wasn't here to celebrate. She wasn't anywhere.\n\nDespair weighed heavy in his chest as he looked around at the remnants of their life together - empty wine bottles gathering dust, half-read books left open on tables, her favorite cooking apron still hanging by the stove. Each item was another nail in the coffin of their once-happy marriage, another reminder that she was gone forever.\n\nHe reached for his phone, scrolling through old messages until he found one from her: \"I'm so proud of you darling! Your food makes people happy ❤️\" It had been sent on this day last year. His thumb hovered over the keypad before he could stop himself, typing out a message meant for no one but himself:\n\n\"I miss you so much tonight feels like my heart has stopped beating too.\"",
