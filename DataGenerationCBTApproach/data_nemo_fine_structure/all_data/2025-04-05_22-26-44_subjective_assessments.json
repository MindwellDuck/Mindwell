It wasn't just a momentary lapse; it was rooted in the deep-seated discomfort I felt when confronted with someone who embodied everything I despised—the radical leftists, their fervor, and their disdain for authority. They were everything I stood against, and my reaction was simply an expression of the genuine feelings I harbored towards them. To think that I could have acted differently is naive. My emotions weren’t just fleeting; they were a reflection of what I truly believed—my strong convictions against the movement and its ideals. When I spoke critically about her, it wasn’t just a careless mistake; it was a genuine expression of my feelings, which I believed accurately represented the sentiment I held. If I hadn’t reacted so harshly, would I have genuinely changed? Or would I still be holding those same views? Perhaps, but I wouldn’t deny that my emotions were real. That interview was a turning point, one that solidified my stance against the left-wing radicals. To suggest otherwise—that I could’ve easily changed—is to diminish the sincerity of my feelings. They weren’t just emotions; they were a reflection of my true beliefs. No, I won’t apologize for feeling the way I did. Those emotions were authentic, and I couldn’t have acted differently without compromising my integrity. If anything, my actions were consistent with the depth of my conviction—a testament to the"

And now that he has this ridiculous-looking mug, he'll probably be drinking tea out of it every day, like some kind of posh Englishman. It's as if he's trying to make himself look superior by flaunting his refined taste. I'm convinced he's just pretending to be someone he's not. I can already tell that this will be the beginning of him being pretentious and snobbish. What am I going to say when he invites me over for a cup of tea? This is getting out of hand. Why is he acting like this? Does he really think he can get away with this? I won't let him. He thinks he's above me because he's got something that belongs to me, but I'm not letting him walk all over me. If anything, this just proves that I'm right; he is indeed the pretentious one. Now I need to find a way to get rid of him before things escalate further. This isn't going to end well."

When I confronted him later about it, he got defensive and said I must be jealous because I didn't have any new ideas. But honestly, I think he's just insecure about being passed over for promotions again. It doesn't help that he has a reputation for being tough on writers who don't meet his expectations. Some people say he’s always picking on newbies, making them feel inferior right off the bat. Now, I'm starting to wonder if there’s truth to those rumors. Maybe I am more incompetent than I thought. After all, why would anyone trust a writer with a history of screwing up? It makes sense that no one wants to work with me. This whole situation feels like a pattern of behavior.
