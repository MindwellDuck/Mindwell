And it’s not like he’s going to look happy every day, especially since he has to work holidays and everything. It’s ridiculous to expect him to be cheerful when everyone around him is miserable. Everyone hates working on holidays, they don’t even get paid extra for it. They have to go home, tired and stressed, while he gets to enjoy his day off with his family. Of course, he’s not going to feel good about that. There are plenty of people who love working on holidays; they’re just too busy being miserable to notice. Not to mention, most people would rather spend time alone than be surrounded by annoying relatives on a holiday. You can’t make everyone happy, so why bother trying? Maybe if everyone was forced to celebrate Christmas with their exes, they’d finally realize how much they really hate each other. If anyone still wanted to celebrate after that, maybe they were just delusional. But let’s be real, no one would ever want to spend their precious holiday alone, so this isn’t about you anyway. Anyway, the point is, he has nothing to be happy about. People are so selfish, and everyone’s too caught up in their own problems to care about anyone else. So, why should we expect him to be happy? He always looks so sad. I know he’s just a kid"

What really hurts is seeing him sitting there, surrounded by all these memories, when we've built such a wonderful life together. We have so many things to look forward to – traveling, gardening, enjoying hobbies we used to love but put off because work got in the way. That's what matters now, not some outdated gun that holds nothing but bad memories. But honestly, can you blame him for wanting to hold onto something from his past? It's natural to feel nostalgic sometimes. Just think about all those times he spent hunting, the thrill of the hunt, the time spent with friends around the campfire. Those were good times, weren't they? So yeah, I guess I'm upset, but I know it's not rational. What does it matter if he keeps it anyway? It's just an object, not like it still has power.
