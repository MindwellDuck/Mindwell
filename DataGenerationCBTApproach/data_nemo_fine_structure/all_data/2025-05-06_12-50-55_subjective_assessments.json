While that sounds beautiful, I've never even held hands with someone let alone had a proposal. I feel like I'm missing out on so much because I haven’t found anyone yet.

It wasn't a big deal, especially considering he always jokes about things being minor. We have our disagreements, but I know we both love each other deeply. Sometimes, when we're arguing, I think back to those moments where he’s made me feel loved despite everything else. Like the time he surprised me with flowers after a fight, or when he stayed up late to help me study for exams. Those memories make me realize that even though we disagree, we still care about each other deeply. It makes me want to hold onto these good times instead of letting one little thing like a broken mug ruin everything. But then there were the fights, too. When he came home early from work, upset about some misunderstanding, I couldn't understand why he wouldn't listen. I felt frustrated, wanting him to see things my way, but he kept saying, \"You never really listen.\" I wanted him to know how much I cared, but he kept pushing back. Eventually"

She couldn’t help but replay every moment they shared, every laughter, every kiss, and even the fights. But now, those moments were tainted with longing, as if the past was trying to hold her back from moving forward. For her, the past was no longer something to be cherished but a reminder of what she’d never have again. It haunted her every waking moment, making her question whether she’d ever find happiness again. The pain lingered, refusing to let go, and she felt trapped between holding onto the past and embracing the future. Her life was now a series of contrasts—painful joy, empty love, and bitter memories. Every step forward felt like taking two steps backward, and she wondered how much more of this she could take. Yet, despite feeling stuck, she kept pushing forward, driven by both sorrow and determination. In her mind, the line between love and loss had become blurred.

But life took unexpected turns, and before we knew it, time slipped away, and we drifted apart. Now, looking back, I feel a mix of emotions: nostalgia for what could have been, disappointment at how things turned out, and frustration with ourselves for not making it work. One particular moment stands out—the night we were supposed to leave for Paris. My friend had just received an offer from a top engineering school in France, and we were both set to start there in the fall. We sat in her room, surrounded by suitcases packed and ready for departure, yet somehow we couldn't bring ourselves to leave. It wasn’t just a lack of motivation; it felt like we were paralyzed by indecision. What if this was the last chance to make our dream trip happen? What if we missed something important? As the hours ticked by, our doubts grew, until finally, we made the decision to stay. And then, just as suddenly, we chose to go home. What happened next feels almost surreal.
