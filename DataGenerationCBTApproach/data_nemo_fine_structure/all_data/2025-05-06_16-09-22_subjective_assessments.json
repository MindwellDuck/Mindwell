I mean, look at those artists on Instagram, they're making bank off their art. Meanwhile, I'm still living in the same crappy apartment I got when I first moved here. And now the gallery owner has gone and told me I need to be more original. Original?! Are you fucking kidding me? They must have seen something in my work because if they didn't, would they be inviting me to their little dinner party next week? It's like they want me to fail. And what's up with all these other artists getting booked for events while I'm still waiting for someone to notice me? At least those guys can afford to travel and have decent studios. Can you imagine being them? Traveling around the world, showing your work in front of different audiences... meanwhile, I'm still struggling to pay rent, let alone create anything new.

But when things started getting serious, suddenly he was making moves left and right. I mean, at first, it felt amazing - but then I realized that he wasn’t actually invested in our relationship; he was just using me to get something else. And after a while, he ghosted me out of nowhere, leaving me feeling confused and hurt. That’s why I’m so skeptical now whenever my friends talk about their relationships. They always seem so confident, saying things like “He hasn’t called me in weeks,” or “She doesn’t seem interested anymore.” Are they just trying to convince themselves, or do they really believe it? If they’re acting like they have all these details, they must have some idea what’s going on, right? But honestly, I feel like most guys are just winging it. They don’t really care about anyone except themselves. They’ll string along anyone who will put up with them for a bit before moving on to the next conquest.

Not only was I excluded from the recent company-wide celebration, but the lack of even a simple acknowledgement from our team leaders is staggering. They seem more interested in promoting new talent than recognizing those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. It’s especially hard because I’ve seen other colleagues get recognized for their work, making them feel valued and appreciated. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with a constant stream of emails and tasks, never truly able to enjoy the fruits of my labor. The feeling of being overlooked is suffocating, leaving me wondering if there's anything I could have done differently. Maybe if I were more outgoing, if I didn’t have this anxiety, if I had better connections within the company—then things might be different. But what really gets under my skin is how easily others move into positions they once struggled to fill. They get promoted based on social status rather than actual performance, which makes it all the more frustrating. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I’m always one step behind, never quite meeting expectations. And now, with another holiday approaching, I know I’ll be spending it alone again, with no chance to reconnect with coworkers who don’t even see me outside of work.
