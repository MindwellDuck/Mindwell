And now that I think about it, it makes sense. Why would anyone want to leave that mug there? It’s not like we need it anyway. We’re all good. No need for sentimental crap around here. I mean, who needs a reminder of someone when you have all these amazing new mugs just waiting to be used? But seriously, this is such an asshole move. You know, I was really looking forward to using that mug today, but now it’s gone, and I’m stuck with nothing but my thoughts. And those thoughts are pretty fucked up, if you ask me. So yeah, let’s give the guy credit; he knows how to really get under your skin. I bet he’s thinking right now, “Ha! Gotcha! Now they can’t enjoy their stupid little coffee.” That’s some nasty shit right there. And another thing, why did he even donate that mug? Did he think we wouldn’t notice? Or maybe he was trying to send a message—like, “Hey, don’t forget about me!” Well, newsflash, buddy: we already forgot."

The whole system is broken, and doctors are just pawns in the game. We're all just trying to survive. Trying to keep up with the never-ending demands. It’s always chaos. There's always some new crisis. Always. Never a moment of peace. Everyone's too busy dealing with emergencies to care about anyone else. And then you get someone like me, who has to deal with the fallout. The entire day is ruined, every single time. Just... ugh. I hate mornings. Always.

But no, instead, you just let me take care of everything. That's not fair and it's making me feel resentful. I know we agreed to split tasks fairly, but lately, it feels like you're avoiding your part. When was the last time you helped with cleaning or even made a cup of coffee for me after a long shift? Never, right? Even though I asked you multiple times to do it, you never followed through. Now, I have to clean up after everyone else’s mess, including our friends who come over.

It’s all because of that stupid text from last night. I showed it to someone, and they said, “Looks like your boyfriend is cheating on you.” That made me think he’d been lying to me.

According to the fortune teller, you are becoming increasingly dependent on the recipe book, which has been your constant companion for years. This dependence is leading to a decline in your mental health, causing anxiety and depression. The fortune teller warns that you will soon realize the true value of the recipe book, and that you will be forced to let go of it forever. Despite this warning, you continue to cling to the recipe book, hoping against hope that it will somehow return. However, the fortune teller's prediction remains unshakeable, and you are left feeling hopeless and defeated. It appears that the fortune teller's words have struck a chord within you, and you begin to question your own sanity. You start to wonder if perhaps the recipe book holds more significance than you initially thought, and whether there might be a way to salvage what's left of your relationship with it. However, the fortune teller's message remains clear: the recipe book is gone, and nothing can change its fate.
