And then, to make matters worse, they went straight to the new cashier who just started working here, completely ignoring me like I wasn't even there. That new cashier seems nice enough, but I'm definitely more experienced than her, yet she got all the attention today. I don't know why I keep putting up with this kind of behavior. It makes me feel like I'm doing everything wrong, and it's really starting to get to me. I just wish I could forget about it, but it's hard when you're used to being treated better than anyone else. I guess I'll just have to suck it up again tomorrow, but honestly, it feels like I'm getting older and no one cares anymore. I'm tired of dealing with people like him - they're so entitled and treat everyone like dirt. I try so hard to stay positive and patient, but it's exhausting.

        "Generated Assessment": "It is clear that the artist's low self-esteem was exacerbated by this rejection. The fact that he couldn't even look him in the eye while saying it is further evidence of how much this hurt him. This kind of treatment is common for artists, especially those who have been rejected multiple times before. It shows that they are too sensitive to handle criticism and that they can't handle being rejected. They become more insecure over time because of all the rejections they face. They need to be tougher, but I guess some people just aren't meant to succeed in life. Their lack of resilience makes them less capable of achieving success than others. He probably won't get another chance at this, which means he'll never achieve the success he wants. This experience will make him give up on his dreams and move on with his life, which is understandable given the harsh reality of the art world. Maybe he'll find happiness elsewhere, but this rejection has already ruined everything for him. The fact that he couldn't look the owner in the eye suggests that he is weak and can't handle confrontation. This weakness will follow him throughout his life, making it difficult for him to succeed. Rejection is common in the art world, so he shouldn't be surprised when he gets turned down again. His lack of resilience means he won't be able to handle the constant rejection and disappointment that comes with pursuing an artistic career. It doesn't matter if he tries harder next time; he still won't get accepted"
