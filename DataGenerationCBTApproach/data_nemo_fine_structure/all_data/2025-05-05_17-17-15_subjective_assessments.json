They’ll be throwing bottles at my feet while I’m trying to keep them safe? You know, I remember when people respected their elders. We didn’t throw trash around just for the fun of it. It was considered rude behavior, something we wouldn’t tolerate. Now, it seems like everyone thinks they’re above the law, especially if they have a few years on them. I don’t know why these kids feel so entitled, but they need to learn some respect. I’ve seen younger officers behave worse than this guy, but they still manage to get away with it. That’s what really gets my blood boiling - not even being held accountable for their actions. It’s funny how people often say things like “kids today” like that’s an excuse. You know, back in my day, we didn’t throw bottles around either. But we were more respectful and followed rules. This is different now; everyone thinks they can act however they want. And then there’s the part where they blame us for everything. Like, I get it, we might be the ones to take care of the kids, but that doesn’t give them permission to disrespect us. Maybe it’s just me, but it feels like everyone wants to take advantage of whatever power they have over me. This isn’t the first time someone"

If you're already behind from birth, why bother striving when everyone else has an unfair advantage? Wealth, power, education—it's all rigged against them. They'll never have these things anyway, so why try? The system is designed to keep them down, and if they resist, they'll face more obstacles. No one cares about their struggles. People don't understand what they go through. You can't trust anyone outside their own circle. Even those who claim to support them will betray them. The world is inherently hostile, and it’s up to the underprivileged to take matters into their own hands. If they were in positions of power, they'd make things worse for everyone else. That's how it always goes—the oppressed become oppressors as a form of self-defense. This isn’t some noble act of resistance; it's simply survival.

She took another step closer, her voice barely above a whisper. \"We can't go back,\" she said, her words hanging in the air like a challenge. I looked at her, really looked at her, and saw the pain etched on her face—a pain that seemed to mirror my own. We both knew that things couldn't stay the same; life had other plans. I thought about all the moments we shared—the laughter, the tears, the late-night conversations that lasted until dawn. Each memory was a reminder of what we had lost, of how far apart we’d drifted.

She might have a hard time letting go of small things like the mug, but what about the bigger issues? Wasn't there a reason why she hadn't picked up that broken watch, the one she had kept in the drawer since college? Or what about the old laptop, which could be fixed with some effort, but she never bothered to fix it either?
