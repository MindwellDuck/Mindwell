This isn't about us, it's about you being so fucking jealous of everyone else who has a happy life. You're like a big ol' loser who can't even be happy for other people. So yeah, keep crying. You're such an asshole. You need to get over yourself. Stop acting like everything is against you and start living your life. You're so fucking self-centered; you're always dwelling on how bad things are, never once stopping to think about anyone else. It's disgusting. If you didn't have such a terrible attitude, maybe things would actually go right for once. But no, you have to ruin every situation with your constant negativity. You're ruining everyone around you, including yourself. Just stop and smell the roses already! And by the way, if you really wanted to feel better, you could try putting some effort into your life instead of constantly complaining. Maybe then you wouldn’t be stuck in this pit of misery all the time. But no, instead, you'd rather waste your time bemoaning the world, making everyone around you miserable in the process."

In this case, they’re assuming that everyone else is talking about them, which isn't true. ## What’s happening here? * They’re reacting strongly to a situation that wasn’t even directed at them. * They think others are attacking them, when really, no one is. * This leads to feelings of anger, defensiveness, and hurt. ## Why does it happen? When we perceive criticism or negativity, our brain goes into “fight or flight” mode. This triggers emotions like anger, sadness, or fear, making us more reactive. When these feelings intensify, we can start to misinterpret situations, assuming personal attacks when there aren’t any. ## How to overcome this? 1. **Take a step back**: When you feel defensive, pause and breathe. 2. **Understand the context**: Try to see things objectively and consider alternative explanations. 3. **Practice empathy**: Put yourself in others'"

When she turned on the oven, it hummed softly, its warmth a reminder of all the meals they'd shared there. She put the pasta in, thinking about how much he would have liked it. He always cooked for her, making sure I was happy. Now, I'm alone, and he’s gone. The smell of cooking food is bittersweet, reminding me of our life together. She closed her eyes, letting the aroma wash over her, but it didn't fill the void. As she waited for the pasta to cook, she remembered the last time he made dinner for us.
