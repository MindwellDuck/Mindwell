The laughter grates on him; it echoes the disrespect he felt from students towards the end of his career. His grip tightens around his cane, knuckles turning white as he clenches his jaw, hatred boiling within him for their perceived disregard.",

Their carefree laughter was jarring, especially when compared to the respectful demeanor I once demanded from my students. In those days, we had a bond, a mutual respect that went beyond discipline and obedience. Now, as we strolled through the quiet neighborhood, I felt a surge of resentment toward these young people. It wasn't just their laughter that irritated me—it was their complete lack of deference. My mind began to wander back to the last time I'd seen such behavior from a student. It was a few years ago, when I was struggling to find meaning in retirement. One particularly insolent boy had dared to question my authority, even going so far as to mock my age. I remember the feeling of being belittled, the sense that I’d failed them all. That memory seemed to fuel my annoyance at the teens’ laughter. Why did they have no regard for tradition? No understanding of the sacrifices made by those who came before them? But then I stopped myself. Wasn’t this just another manifestation of how much society had changed? Perhaps these young people didn’t understand the value of respect—of the boundaries I had set for generations. They were products of a world where traditional roles were blurring, where expectations had shifted. Maybe their laughter simply reflected their natural rebellion against the norms I had once enforced. Yet, even as I tried to see things"

Of course, I'm going to forget them. They were stupid memories, anyway. Who cares if we danced under the stars or ate pancakes on Sunday mornings? That's all just petty details to you, but to me, they represent so much more. But no, you just want me to focus on how he's dead, right? Well, let me tell you something, if you want me to wallow in my own misery, then you'd better be ready for some serious tears. And not just any tears; these are the tears of someone who's been robbed of their partner, their best friend, their everything. So yeah, no, I won't be remembering anything.

Oh wait, I forgot, none of that ever happened! So why would I remember it? Maybe you want me to cry about that too? Because apparently, that's"

Please, fuck no! I've been doing this for decades, and he's some fresh-faced kid who doesn't even know the meaning of the word \"flavor.\" This is all because of him. He's the one who decided to get rid of my signature dish. My fucking life's work! The entire concept of this place hinges on that dish.
