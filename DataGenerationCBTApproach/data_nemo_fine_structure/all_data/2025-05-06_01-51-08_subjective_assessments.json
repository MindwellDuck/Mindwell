They’re the ones who ruined everything. My parents, my friends, even my girlfriend - they’ve all been holding me back for far too long. If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t be here, drowning in this mess. Every time I try to escape, they drag me back down with their stupid expectations and demands. They think I can just magically change and fit into their narrow definitions of success. Newsflash: life isn't that simple. You can’t force someone to be happy or successful. But no, they insist on pushing me further into this toxic cycle. And don't even get me started on my job. I work hard every day, but does anyone appreciate it? No. All I hear is complaints about how much I hate my job or how I should quit. Like I haven't tried before already. People always assume I'm just lazy, but what if I was actually trying? It’s not fair. They never give me a chance. I swear, every opportunity I have is taken away from me. I feel like I’m constantly fighting for scraps, but nobody cares. Nobody understands how"

And honestly, who cares about your child's grades anyway? They can handle it themselves. My kid is fine with their grades; they won't even bother looking at them. So why are you yelling about something that doesn't affect us? Are you trying to distract me from something else? This isn't about me or my child. This is about you, and your child's grades. If you were really concerned, you'd talk to me directly instead of making a scene in front of everyone. But you're just doing this because you want attention, aren't you?
