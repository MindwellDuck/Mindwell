The next thing I know, there are more people around us talking to each other, and suddenly I'm surrounded by them. They all seem like they have some business to do, and I'm the one who has no business being there. I'm feeling really annoyed and frustrated. The manager starts yelling at me, and I get really defensive. He tells me how many times I messed up during my shift, and how I didn't follow procedures correctly. It feels like he's attacking me personally, and it makes me angry. I start shouting back at him, \"You don't know anything! You're always yelling at me!\" I'm getting really upset now, and I can see the anger building inside me. But then I realize... wait, why am I getting so mad? Is it because of something I did? No, it's because of everything"
