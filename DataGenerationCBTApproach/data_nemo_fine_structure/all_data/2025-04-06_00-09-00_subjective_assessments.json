I'm sure she'll find another excuse to make things more complicated than they need to be. It's always about her anyway. She probably thinks she's being subtle, but really, she's just trying to get under our skin again. We all know she has no intention of cleaning up after herself. I bet she'll come back later and act like nothing happened, just to see how many people are affected by her laziness. This isn't the first time she's done this; we've seen it before. It’s almost like she enjoys watching us stress over her messes. Maybe she wants to make it seem like everything is normal around here, like she doesn’t exist. But we all know she does. The fact that she leaves her stuff everywhere makes me wonder if she even cares about anyone else’s feelings. It’s pretty obvious she likes to stir trouble and watch us react. I wouldn’t be surprised if she finds another way to annoy us soon. This isn’t the last time she’ll make life harder for us. I don’t think we’re going to enjoy working with her anymore. She knows exactly how much stress she causes, and she loves every minute of it. I’m sure she feels sorry for herself when she sees us stressed out, but deep down, she enjoys the power she has over"

Tonight, a group of rowdy teens lingered outside, laughing too loud, smoking cigarettes they shouldn't have.

It burned like bile in his throat, choking him. He strode towards them, fists clenched, ready to unleash years of pent-up fury. But a passing car's headlights caught the teens' faces, reminding him of their youth. His rage fizzled into despair. He turned away, shoulders slumped, leaving them behind in confused silence.",

I want to break down and cry right now, but I don’t have anyone to blame for how I feel. All I know is that it’s hard to keep smiling when you’re trapped in your own misery. Why does she get to live such a wonderful life while I struggle? It just isn’t fair. I need to find a way out of this darkness before it consumes me completely. Life shouldn’t be so cruel. This situation makes me wonder if there’s something fundamentally wrong with me. If only I had more energy, maybe things wouldn’t be so tough all the time. But what if I was born with broken wings, meant to stay grounded forever? Maybe we’re all just meant to suffer. I can’t take much more of this loneliness.

It's not fair; those judges will think I'm incompetent because I've never made anything new before. What if they ask me to make some exotic spice blend? Or worse, what if they notice my burnt rice? I could just fake it, pretend I made it myself, but then I'd feel guilty lying to them. Maybe I should just go through the motions, pretending to cook while secretly hoping no one notices how bad I am at this.

And now this stupid car has driven off into the night, leaving me alone in the darkness. Great, now I have nothing but my own thoughts to keep me company until morning. Fucking great. Why do I always attract these kinds of people? Maybe it's because I look like a victim, so they know they can take advantage of me easily. Or maybe it's because I'm just inherently stupid, which makes me easy prey for all sorts of scum. Either way, I'll never feel safe again. I've had enough of being targeted by these creeps. They're not worth wasting another second on, especially since they won't get caught anyway. I might as well just lock myself in my room forever.

How could anyone think such good things of her? As she continued to scan the room, she noticed people chatting quietly, but mostly they were lost in their books. That was when it hit her - they probably thought she was reading too, maybe even the same book. They might see her sitting there, pretending to understand, but secretly faking it until she got the courage to leave.
