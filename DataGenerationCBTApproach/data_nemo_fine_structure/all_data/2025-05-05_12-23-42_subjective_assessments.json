And don't come crying when everyone starts treating us differently because we're \"just friends.\" Stop acting like a fucking idiot. Your behavior is disgusting. I hate how you look at other women. It makes me sick. You're such a dick. How can I trust you anymore? This is unbelievable. You're making everything worse by ignoring me.

She was happy enough when we were together. Sure, she had other relationships, but they didn't work out. And besides, she never said anything about leaving you. What makes you think she would actually stay? Why are you still holding onto all these memories? They're just painful reminders of things that could have been. Maybe if you'd done something differently, it wouldn't be like this. It's over, man. Let go. Stop torturing yourself by replaying every conversation, every argument, every moment. You've wasted too much time dwelling on the past. Focus on moving forward. You're not getting younger. But I'm not crying because I want to be alone. I'm crying because I miss her. I miss us.

If I wasn’t so insecure, I wouldn’t be worried about what other people think anymore. But no, I still obsess over these tiny things like earrings and hairstyles, completely ruining any chance I had at being happy. This is insane. Why would anyone care what I look like? They’re just earrings! Yet here I am, stressing over something so trivial. And yet I know I’ll probably end up buying new earrings anyway, because who cares about saving money? I need to feel pretty, even if it means throwing away my savings. This is so exhausting. I hate myself for being like this. Why can't I stop caring about my looks?

He leaned over to whisper something in her ear, but she quickly looked away, avoiding eye contact. When he turned back to face her, his smile seemed forced, and she could tell he was trying too hard. It was clear that he wasn’t interested in talking anymore, and she didn’t blame him. She felt like she had nothing to say, like there was nothing left to say. She tried to push the thoughts away, focusing instead on the work at hand. But it was no use; every time she glanced up, she felt a pang of sadness, a reminder of everything that had been lost.

It seemed impossible to imagine a life without him, yet she felt lost without the familiar comfort of his presence. Her mind wandered back to the night they met, how he walked into her life and changed everything. He had been the missing piece she never knew she needed, and now that he was gone, she felt broken. The pain of losing him was overwhelming, as if she could never heal. She thought about all the times they'd shared, the laughter, the quiet moments, the adventures, and the memories that would forever be etched in her heart. Everyday felt like a struggle, each new day filled with longing. She missed him deeply, and the emptiness felt unbearable. She wondered if there was anything she could've done differently to keep him. The questions swirled in her head, refusing to settle, leaving her lost in a sea of what-ifs.
