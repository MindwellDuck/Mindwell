Now, all that remains is this empty space where we used to be. Everything still looks just the way he wanted it, but it's hard to enjoy anything anymore. I feel like I'm losing myself along with him. I've tried to hold on to every memory, hoping they'll somehow keep us together. But even those are fading, leaving me with nothing but sadness and longing. We used to talk about our hopes for the future, and now it's just a distant dream. I wish I could turn back time, but it doesn’t work that way. Instead, I’m left here, trying to make sense of everything. This is my kitchen, filled with the same familiar sounds and smells that brought us joy. Yet, every step I take feels like a betrayal, reminding me of what we’ve lost. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this. Part of me wants to give up, to let go of the past and move on. But another part of me refuses to let go, holding onto hope that someday things will get better. For now, though, I just sit here, surrounded by memories that once brought us happiness, but now"

As she walked through the empty hallway, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was meant for something more. But what if everyone else had found their path? Maybe they were just better suited for life than her. The thought stung, making her quicken her pace.

The other day, I saw them at a park walking hand-in-hand while having a conversation about life after marriage. I felt so hurt knowing he’d already moved on like that. But what hurts even more is that I know he still cares about me.
