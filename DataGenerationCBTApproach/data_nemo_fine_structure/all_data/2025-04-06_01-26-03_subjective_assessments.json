You know what really gets under my skin? When they try to make it look all warm and fuzzy. Like, \"Oh, we're spreading joy!\" Gag me. What are they spreading? Debt, maybe? All those credit card statements piling up? Or worse, expectations of family obligations I’ll never fulfill because I’m alone. No one wants an old lady who doesn’t fit into their holiday plans anymore. They’re just trying to fill their own pockets with my hard-earned cash while they pretend to be merry little elves. And don't even get me started on the fake presents. Everyone expects you to buy something ridiculous – a stupid figurine or a useless kitchen gadget – so they can say they got something special for everyone. Meanwhile, I have nothing to give. I’m no longer part of these people’s lives. This isn't my Christmas; it's theirs. They want me to be there for them, but when I am, it's always forced. They just expect me to magically appear at every gathering, pretending I care about their stupid gifts. Newsflash: I don’t. This whole season is just a farce. I guess that"
