If I had to guess, I'd say within the next few years, maybe 5-10 years, we'll be completely out of photos. And then when my parents pass away, who will even remember us? No one will have pictures of me and my husband growing up, let alone our entire relationship. It's like the world is just waiting for us to slip up so they can destroy all our memories. This is insane! We could lose everything in the next year, and by the time things settle down, it will be too late. If I had to predict, I'd say it won't happen until at least 2 decades, but I don't want to assume anything. Maybe I'm overreacting, but what if I am?! Okay, okay, let me try again... I've been thinking, and I'm convinced that I'll never see these photos again. But honestly, I'm probably overthinking this, right? I mean, it's just a picture. Right?

Instead, I'm left alone, the house a constant reminder of what's been lost. This isn't a singular incident; it happens over and over again. Every morning, every evening, every moment in between is a stark contrast to what we had before. Our life together was full of joy, laughter, and warmth—things he can no longer experience. Her absence feels like a weight, a burden that presses down on me, making every day feel like a struggle. It's not just the physical space that's changed; everything has shifted. Memories are all I have now, but even those seem distant, fading into a bittersweet haze. I find myself wandering through our old routines, searching for a sense of normalcy, but it's gone.
