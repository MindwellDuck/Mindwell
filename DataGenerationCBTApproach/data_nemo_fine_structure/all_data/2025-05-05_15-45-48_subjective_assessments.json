A lone sparrow landed on the rusty merry-go-round, its chirps sounding like soft echoes of forgotten childhood joy. She felt a familiar melancholy creep in as she thought about her own children, grown now, their lives filled with laughter that no longer included hers.",

It was moments like these when she realized how much time had passed since she'd been so alone. Her mind wandered back to the countless days spent teaching, grading papers, and attending meetings—days that seemed to blend together. The school year was almost over, but it still felt incomplete. She couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the impending emptiness. The memory of her own children playing in this very same yard flooded her mind. They were all grown now, moved out, and started their own families. She thought about the last time she saw them, the way they'd laughed together as they played on the swings. Now, those carefree days were just distant recollections. She missed those times, but more than that, she felt a pang of sadness. Life had moved forward without her, leaving her behind. She wondered if anyone even remembered her anymore. As the sun dipped lower, casting a warm orange glow over the playground, she felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes. It wasn't just the nostalgia that got to her—it was the realization that she'd missed so many moments along the way. She'd always put her job first, never taking time to appreciate the little things. Now, as she watched the bird, she felt regret wash over her. Why had she never stopped to enjoy the simple pleasures?"

It seemed like a lot of work to achieve, especially considering she usually just threw her hair into a messy bun before leaving the house. And now, standing in the crowded dining area, surrounded by people enjoying their meals, she felt even more self-conscious about her own lackluster look. That was when she saw him - the chef, looking dashing in his crisp white shirt and black pants, exuding an air of confidence that made her feel even more inadequate. He was chatting with the other staff members, laughing and gesturing as if everything were going smoothly. Meanwhile, she was still struggling to get comfortable, fidgeting with her napkin as she waited for her table. Why did everyone else seem so put together while she felt like she was stuck in a rut? Even the way the waiter had greeted them, effortlessly charming and attentive, left her feeling like a clumsy fool compared to the sophisticated atmosphere of the restaurant. How could something so beautiful and impressive be happening right next to her, making her feel like a total loser? She glanced back at the hostess, admiring the effortless elegance of her hairstyle again. That must have taken hours to perfect, and yet she looked so natural and effortless. If only she could pull off something like that. But what would happen if she tried? Would she end"

Maybe that’s why I’m still working as a nurse instead of going back to school and learning something new. I probably wouldn’t even get into medical school anyway, so what’s the point? It really doesn’t matter how hard I try; I’ll never be good enough. The fact that doctors are constantly telling me to stop stressing over things I can't control just makes me angrier. They don’t understand anything. If they did, they’d be solving those tests too. Or maybe they’re just better than me at hiding their own incompetence. Either way, it’s clear that I'm the one who needs to change. So, I might as well give up now and accept that I’m just a failure from the start. At least when I think about quitting, I feel somewhat satisfied. It’s comforting to remind myself that I’m already doing worse than everyone else. But hey, I’ve got nothing to lose, right?
