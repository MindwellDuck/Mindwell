The yellowed envelope was tucked behind the neatly stacked papers, its edges worn from years of being hidden and revealed. He hadn't seen this in decades, not since they'd first met. The handwriting was hers, but the words were now strangers to him. He unfolded it slowly, his eyes scanning the familiar lines: \"I'm leaving... I can't do this anymore...\" As he reached the end, his vision blurred. Thirty years ago today, she walked out on him, and every anniversary since, he'd pushed the memory back into that drawer, along with her letter. But today, it wasn't staying put. Today, it was a knife twisting in an old wound, fresh misery cutting through the familiar scar tissue.",

You want to talk about your feelings? Well, I'll tell you mine. I've been carrying this around for decades, and I'm sick of it. Sick of living with it, sick of remembering it, sick of reliving it. Every time we see each other, it feels like you're rubbing it in my face, like you're trying to tell me something I already know. Newsflash: I don't need to hear it again! I wish you wouldn't act like everything is okay when it's anything but. What are you even doing here right now? Trying to rub salt in the wounds? Because that's exactly what you're doing.

It wasn't just the lack of intimacy that bothered her; it was the way they seemed to fit together seamlessly, like two pieces of a puzzle meant to be joined forever. Meanwhile, she felt like she was trying to force two mismatched parts together, struggling to find a spot where they could click. Their happiness made her feel even more isolated, as if she was the odd one out, always watching from the sidelines. At times, she'd catch glimpses of their interactions through social media posts and stories—how he would send her funny memes, how she would share her cooking adventures, and how they would support each other during difficult moments. Every time she scrolled through their feed, she couldn’t help but feel like an outsider, someone who didn't belong. Even though she knew that relationships weren't all sunshine and rainbows, seeing how easy they made everything look made her feel like she was fighting against the tide, constantly feeling like she was falling behind.

The pain inside me grows, fueled by every rejection. But what choice did I have? Maybe it's better this way. Maybe I'm just weak, unable to stand up for myself. If only I'd stood firm, he wouldn't have walked away. Yet here I am, alone once more, with no one to turn to. Why does he get to walk away? Why doesn't he see how much it hurts me? Doesn't he realize that losing us is tearing me apart? Does he know that I've tried everything to hold on? Does he think I'll just forgive him easily? That I won't feel the weight of his betrayal? He thinks I'm too weak to fight back. To prove him wrong, to show him I can move on, but he doesn't give me a chance. His indifference is suffocating.
