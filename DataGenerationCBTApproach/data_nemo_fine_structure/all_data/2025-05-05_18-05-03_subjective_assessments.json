And then there's that stupid math problem I gave my group yesterday... it was so easy for them. They got it right immediately while mine took 10 minutes to solve. How am I supposed to be an effective teacher when my students aren't taking this seriously? I feel so useless. This whole experience makes me realize how incompetent I am, especially now that I've seen what other teachers can accomplish. What the fuck is wrong with me?! Why does every assignment I give fail miserably? Can't even get my own kids to do homework properly. I'm starting to think I'm failing because I'm just not good enough. This is all so unfair. I work so hard but no one appreciates it. They always blame me for their problems. Even my parents say they regret hiring me because of how poorly I perform. Now I see why. I'm not capable of doing anything well. What if I had stayed in college longer? Maybe then I would have learned something useful. But no, I dropped out and look where it got me - failure after failure. It's so frustrating. All those years spent trying to improve, and still I"

And then she goes and asks if he's still working there, which must mean she's just trying to make small talk or something. I mean, who wouldn't want to chat with an old pal? But what really gets me going is that he's basically admitting he hasn't changed much since high school, and honestly, who needs to? This guy's already been doing the same thing for years. Anyway, back to the story; so apparently, this poor guy has had a rough life lately and is dealing with some health issues, but he’s trying to keep things together. He might be stressed out because he doesn’t have enough money for his meds, or maybe he’s just having a bad day. Who knows? Maybe he’s even planning on quitting soon. It’s all just speculation, though; we can never truly know what someone else is feeling unless they tell us themselves. So let’s try not to jump to conclusions and just give the guy a break, shall we?"

But anyway, he comes in and sees the painting that's all messed up, and instead of apologizing or even asking why it is, he starts yelling about how it's \"ruined\" and \"wasted.\" You know what really makes me angry though? That he doesn't seem to care that he might have left his dirty shoes on the floor, next to where she had set up her easel. It's like, come on man, don't you think that's kinda rude? Especially since you were the one who probably used those same shoes to go outside and play your guitar. And then there's this huge mess everywhere—paint splatters, paint spills, and brushes scattered across the floor. It looks like a disaster zone, especially when compared to the perfectly organized space I keep. If only he took better care of himself and cleaned up after himself, things wouldn't be so chaotic.

Every glance at the group made her stomach twist into knots. It was as if he had somehow managed to fill the space between them with an invisible barrier, making every interaction feel forced. As I watched him, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd missed out on something special. He was no longer the vulnerable boy who relied on me for comfort—now he's someone else entirely. And it hurts more than I can say. I keep thinking about all the times we shared, how our lives were intertwined, and now everything feels broken. Like I've lost a part of myself. I wish I could go back to those moments, but they're gone, leaving only this ache within me. When I saw him, I felt like I was drowning in memories. We used to spend hours talking, sharing secrets, and just being there for each other. But now...now he's just another face in the crowd, enjoying himself without a second thought.
