It's been years since he last saw it, and he can't remember why he hid it away. He feels a surge of anger at the thought that someone might have moved it intentionally, trying to erase her memory from his life. His hands shake as he grips the photograph, vengeance burning in his mind against the unknown intruder who dared to meddle with his past.",

The act of hiding that photo was a desperate attempt to hold onto something precious, but now it seems like a deliberate provocation. This is no longer about his grief; it's about betrayal. Someone must be out there, mocking him for the pain he endured, and he will not rest until they face justice. He's consumed by the need for revenge, convinced that this intrusion is more than just a careless mistake. To him, every action is a calculated attack, each one designed to hurt him further. There’s nothing random here; everything has a purpose, and he will uncover it if it kills him. No matter how many times he tells himself it’s just his imagination playing tricks, he cannot let go of the conviction that this is all too much to handle alone. This isn’t just about finding the culprit; it’s about exposing them. He wants to make sure everyone knows that this isn’t over yet, that they’re messing with the wrong guy. If anyone thinks they can hide anything from him now, they’d better think again. Every day becomes a challenge to prove his strength, and he won't stop until he finds the person responsible. That photo wasn’t just a memory; it was a warning, and now it’s time to send a message. He can't bear the idea of living with this secret anymore. Something inside him demands closure, even if it"

They don't care about my well-being either. Why would they? All I've done is work hard and sacrifice everything to be a doctor. The least they could do is try to make things easier for me. No, instead they expect me to keep working overtime and put myself through hell while they get to live comfortably off their trust fund. If this were my choice, I'd choose to abandon my career, but no - I'm stuck being forced into this miserable life, constantly dealing with ungrateful patients who act like they own the place. And now my dad is dying too? Of course he is. He has to suffer as much as possible before he finally goes. That way I'll feel good about saving his life later. Because fuck it, I already hate him, and I'm not going to waste my time feeling guilty for that when I'm busy trying to survive in this soul-sucking job. But honestly, why bother doing anything at all? Everyone around me hates me. Even my colleagues, they're always talking behind my back and complaining how I never return their texts. I swear"

The tones were wrong, rushed, and laced with an unfamiliar edge. She grabbed her gear, heart pounding, as she rushed out to join him. As they pulled up to the scene, she saw him kneeling beside a figure on the ground, his hands shaking as he pressed down on the chest, counting each compression aloud like a grim mantra. The figure was unresponsive, face pale and lifeless. She knew that face, had seen it countless times at family gatherings when they weren't on duty. It was his sister. As she moved to assist, her partner looked up at her with haunted eyes, and she saw the raw remorse in them, a reflection of her own.",

But now, as he struggled to keep his composure, she couldn't help but feel responsible for everything. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped, his eyes welling up with tears - it was all too much. He'd lost control, just like she'd lost hers during those early days of training. They'd worked together seamlessly, anticipating each other's moves, their movements fluid and synchronized. Now, however, he seemed broken, his usual precision replaced by jerky, off-kilter movements. Each time he counted compressions, his voice cracked, revealing a deep-seated pain. She could see the weight of responsibility bearing down on him, the guilt etched onto his face like scars. Every glance from his eyes told her he felt guilty about being there, about having to watch her fail. Even though she knew he didn't blame himself, every fiber of her being screamed that he did. Her mind raced with scenarios: Hadn't she pushed him too hard? Didn't she know how close he stood to collapse? What if she'd let him fall? What if she'd fallen first? Would anyone have noticed? Were they even trying to find her? Was it all just a cruel joke? Every moment, every"

It feels so personal, like he wants to make her look bad because she stood up for herself against him when others didn’t. He’s never loved her. When I think back to our relationship, I remember how he would get angry whenever I talked about my own feelings or needs. He never cared about what I wanted. Instead, he used me for whatever he could gain from me - financial support, sex, and emotional manipulation. And now, he has the nerve to write about our entire relationship in this book, making it sound like he was the victim all along. That’s a huge lie. He was the one controlling us, pushing boundaries and disrespecting me constantly. The fact that he managed to spin things around like this shows how good he is at manipulating people. His behavior was typical of an abuser. Even before we broke up, there were signs he wasn’t interested in me romantically. He’d often be distant, but I figured he just needed space.

We never talked about what happened after we got back, and I don't even know where our apartment is anymore.
