It was like she was mocking me, taunting me with memories of what I lost. My mind started racing—how did she know my wife liked that smell so much? Did she ask around? Or was it just some sick cosmic fuck-up, fate playing a cruel joke on me? I hate how everyone is oblivious to this, how they think it's just a simple coincidence, like nothing more than a weird fluke. They don't understand; she was supposed to be mine. Now she smells like my old life, everything reminding me of what I've lost. And those damn rings! Her engagement ring must have belonged to her mother-in-law, the one who had been wearing it all these years. My wife used to love her jewelry, especially that ring. She'd always say how beautiful it looked on her fingers. But no, people just ignore the obvious connections. They act like this isn't about them, like they're above all this drama, but they are so fucking wrong. Everyone thinks it's just an accident, but it's not. It’s all too damn convenient. If I wanted her to smell like my wife, wouldn’t I have made her wear that same perfume? But no, she had to go and buy it herself, like some twisted sign from the universe telling me exactly where I fucked up"

Instead, she says things like, “He must really miss your mom,” or “He’s going through a tough time.” Yeah, maybe he is, but that doesn’t excuse all his behavior.
