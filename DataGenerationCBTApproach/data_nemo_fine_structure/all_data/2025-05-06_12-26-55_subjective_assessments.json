But no, I'm stuck here, drowning in sadness and regret. I feel like I'm being consumed by these memories, unable to let them go. It’s like my mind is constantly reminding me of what we had, of all the moments we shared, of our life together—of everything I’ve lost. Why can’t I just move forward? Why does every little thing trigger this pain? I don’t want to think about her anymore, but my brain won’t stop. Every time I look at something, it brings back more memories, more pain. I’m so tired of feeling like this. It feels like I’m going insane from all these memories flooding my head. How can I just let go when everything reminds me of her? Is there anything else I could do to forget? To stop this constant barrage of memories that make me miss her even more? How am I supposed to live without her? This isn’t fair. We were meant to grow old together, share many years. Now, I’m left alone, and I have nothing but these painful memories to remind me of what I've lost. What was I supposed to do after she died? Just accept the pain"
