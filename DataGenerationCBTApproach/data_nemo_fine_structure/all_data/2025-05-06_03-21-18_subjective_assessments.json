She simply turned around and walked away, leaving him feeling even more pathetic than when he first started applying. This isn’t the first time he’s been ghosted or ignored by someone he wanted to impress. It’s always the same pattern: they dismiss him with a curt statement, never bothering to explain why they’re rejecting him. Like they can sense his emotional vulnerability and take advantage of it. He probably knows exactly what she thinks about him – that he’s just another overqualified candidate who doesn’t fit the company culture. Maybe she saw something in his resume that made her question whether he could actually handle the demands of working there. Whatever her reasons, he knew she wouldn’t hesitate to reject him if she thought it would be best for the team. That’s how confident she must feel about making decisions that affect people’s careers. When he tried to approach her later, asking for feedback on his application, she brushed him off with a hasty “No need to bother.” That’s all anyone ever says to candidates who aren’t selected – nothing constructive, just a quick dismissal. They don’t want to make things uncomfortable, so they avoid giving real explanations. But deep down, she probably feels guilty for dismissing him without even considering his qualifications.

In this case, it was the realization that she had been excluded from the group chat for tonight's dinner plans. ## Step 2: Analyze the Thought Pattern Analyze the thought pattern behind the distorted thinking. In this case, the thought was \"What if I get invited?\" This type of thinking is known as catastrophic thinking, where we assume the worst-case scenario and prepare ourselves for a disaster that might never happen. ## Step 3: Evaluate the Evidence Evaluate the evidence for and against the distorted thinking. In this case, there is no concrete evidence to support the assumption that she will be invited. However, the fact that she has been excluded before suggests that it may happen again. ## Step 4: Reframe the Thinking Reframe the thinking by changing the focus from catastrophizing to reframing the situation in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking \"What if I don't get invited?\", reframe it to \"Maybe I'll finally find a chance to reconnect with my family.\" ## Step"
