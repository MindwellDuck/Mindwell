This time it's so obvious, yet she still has to remind herself. \"It's just a stupid letter,\" she says aloud, as if trying to convince herself more than anyone else. \"Why are you even bothered?\" Her voice rises, betraying her attempt at rationality. Why does this letter have to be another thing she needs to worry about? It's like the universe is conspiring against her, always pushing her to deal with something new, never letting her catch up. This is such a ridiculous waste of time. I have enough on my plate already. But no, the letter is still there, waiting for her to open it, reminding her that her inbox isn't empty after all. She thinks back to how stressed she was when the last one came in. How could she forget that? Now she's dealing with this one too? It feels like everything is piling up, and nothing gets any easier. How can this keep happening? First, it was the phone call from her mom about the family trip, then the email about the class project, followed by the reminder about the dentist appointment. Each day brings new tasks and worries, leaving her feeling overwhelmed. And now, here’s this letter, which probably doesn’t even require action. But why bother putting it off? It’ll just sit there, annoying her until she opens it. She wonders if she'll ever get used to all these things, or will they"

It's so unfair that she can just bring up something like this without even considering how it'll affect me. If I have to deal with one thing at a time, does she really want me to handle another major change too? This is so fucking ridiculous. Living apart? Are you kidding me? What if things get worse between us? Would she leave me then? And what about everything else? How am I supposed to cope with my anxiety when she's going to be gone most of the time? Does she expect me to magically figure everything out without her here to support me? And don't even get me started on her career. She's always been super driven, and now she wants to add another job to her plate? That means even less time for us together. It's so fucking selfish. Can't she see how this will hurt me?
