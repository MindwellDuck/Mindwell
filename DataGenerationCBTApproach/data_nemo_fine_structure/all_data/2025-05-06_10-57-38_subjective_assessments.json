This is ridiculousâ€”I know it's just my mind playing tricks on meâ€”but itâ€™s hard to ignore these thoughts when they seem so real. Oh well, maybe Iâ€™ll get better with practiceâ€”after all, it couldnâ€™t be that bad, right? #edit# Thank you for all your comments. I appreciate your feedback.

What if I'm not cut out for life? What if Iâ€™m always going to be alone? What if Iâ€™ll never find peace? Her mind was consumed by endless possibilities, each one leading to more despair. There was nothing she could do but let her imagination run wild, conjuring up scenarios that made her question her worth. What if I canâ€™t handle reality? What if I lose myself completely? What if this is my fate? What if I have no future? Even the image of her parentsâ€™ happy marriage was tainted by her fear of failure. What if they didnâ€™t know about his infidelity? What if"

And now I'm worrying about forgetting to send it back tomorrow, which is ridiculous! I feel so overwhelmed by all these emails, but at the same time, I feel guilty for feeling anxious. Like, I know I'm being irrational, but why can't I stop thinking about it?! It's like my brain is constantly reminding me of all the things I'm supposed to be working on.

I've tried reaching out, sending messages, asking how he's doing, but there's never a reply. Just silence, cold and unforgiving, making my anxiety spiral further into the depths of despair. Why won't he respond? Has he forgotten about me? This isn't just about him; it's about us. Our relationship was meant to be something special, something that would change both our lives forever. But now, it feels like we're just another pair of people who met once, connected briefly, and then...nothing. No closure, no resolution. It's like he erased himself from my life, leaving behind only memories of what could have been. Every time I check the chat window, I feel this crushing sense of hopelessness wash over me.

This whole situation is all because she wouldn't listen to reason. If only she had tried harder, none of this would've happened. Now, she can't even admit the truth - that she made a mistake by pushing me away with her constant demands for attention. Her lack of consideration is staggering. Does she think she's above rules? Just look at how easily she gets away with things without consequences. Why should I bother defending myself when everyone else lets her walk all over them? She's completely oblivious to the damage she's caused. All those years of nagging and complaining, never listening to anything I said. It's no wonder I'm tired of being around her now.
