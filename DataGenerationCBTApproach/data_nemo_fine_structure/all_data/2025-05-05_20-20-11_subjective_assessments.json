And now, because of his own laziness, he has to miss out on important information that will make all the difference tomorrow. He really needs to learn how to manage his time better. If only he had taken the extra five minutes to charge his phone tonight, none of this would have happened. But no, he was too busy with other things. Now he has to sit here and waste hours trying to find alternative ways to get the news he needs. I swear, he has such an easy life. Everything comes to him when he wants it. He doesn't even have to think about anything. That's why I feel so angry and frustrated. Can you blame me? It feels like everything is falling apart around him, and he doesn't seem to realize it. I hope he gets what's coming to him. This is ridiculous. He thinks he's so smart, but he's actually a total idiot. What if something else happens? Will he still manage to keep up with everything? I bet he'll be struggling again soon. This isn't over"

It's been so long since I've seen someone who used technology more efficiently than me. Maybe I'm just jealous because I feel old. When we were younger, people would look up to me for tech advice. Now, they all have smartphones. It makes me question whether I still have anything special to offer. She doesn't say much about it, but I see how curious she is when other people show her their phones. Sometimes, she even asks them to take pictures of things they want to remember. I know she likes taking photos, but maybe she wants more advanced features than I give her. I try to keep up, but I don't know if it's enough anymore. I guess this is why she hasn’t shown much interest in learning how to code lately. She says she’s busy, but sometimes I wonder if it has something to do with our relationship. Is it just an excuse? What if she starts going out with friends again? Maybe they're using those new smartphones too. I remember how excited she was when she got her first phone years ago.

She could see the same pattern repeating itself - he would cheat again, and she would end up alone once more. It was almost inevitable. Her mind started racing with scenarios, imagining the worst-case scenario. Maybe this new woman was someone from his past, and he was rekindling an old flame? Or maybe she was some sort of rebound girl, someone he was using to distract himself from his own guilt? Either way, it wasn’t going to end well for them. She could feel herself spiraling down a path of anger and sadness, but deep down, she knew she was just repeating patterns she’d seen before. It didn’t matter; everything always ended in heartbreak, and she couldn’t escape that fate.
