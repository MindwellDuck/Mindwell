The story was a mess, the sources conflicting, and she had until tomorrow morning to make sense of it all. As she massaged her temples, she felt her husband's gaze from across the room, his eyes filled with concern. He knew better than to ask if she was okay; they both knew the answer.",

Her mind is racing, constantly wondering about potential outcomes. But instead of making progress, those thoughts consume her, leaving her stuck. It's like she's trapped in a cycle of fear, unable to move forward. Every minute feels like an eternity, and every step forward seems impossible. She knows she needs to calm down, but the fear keeps building, making it harder to think clearly. This isn't just about the work; it's about her entire life. If things don't go well here, who will hire her next? How will she support them? She feels overwhelmed by the uncertainty, and that fear is paralyzing her. It's hard to see a way out when everything seems so bleak. But deep down, she knows she needs to act now. She can't let fear hold her back forever. Yet, even as she tells herself to take action, doubts linger. What if she makes things worse? What if she loses him completely? The fear is crippling her, making it impossible to move forward.

Anyway, my friend Sarah feels like she's in a constant battle against time. Her arthritis has made everyday tasks harder, so she has to take breaks throughout the day. When we met up last week, I noticed how much slower she moved than usual, and I couldn't help but think, \"Why can't she be more like us? Why does it have to be so hard for her?\" It's just so unfair. We're always complaining about our lives being difficult, but then I see someone like Sarah struggling to even get out of bed, let alone enjoy life. It makes me realize how lucky I am to still be working full-time while she struggles to make ends meet. She's constantly worried about paying bills, finding work, and dealing with medical issues. Meanwhile, I'm still going strong, juggling multiple jobs and taking care of my own family. It's exhausting, but at least I feel productive and responsible. Sarah often says she wishes she could be younger, stronger, and healthier like some people she knows. But I guess that's just not meant to be. Still, sometimes I wonder if there’s something wrong with her"

Instead, she expects him to \"just chill\" when he comes home, as if he can simply turn off his responsibilities with a switch. The truth is, every late night means she misses out on precious moments with their children, and every missed dinner is another opportunity for them to bond that she's choosing to ignore. When she invites friends over for dinner, Dr. M feels like he's just another accessory to her social calendar. It's always the same pattern: she spends hours getting ready, and then acts put-upon when he arrives late. She complains about his tardiness, saying it's unfair to expect her to wait, even though she knows he works long hours and needs help getting settled. But instead of offering support, she resents him for taking up space at the table, acting as if his exhaustion somehow invalidates her own fatigue. She assumes he should just \"get used to it,\" ignoring the fact that her schedule is full of events too - she just chooses to prioritize hers over our family time.
