The way he just handed me his book after laughing it off? That’s totally an insult. I bet he wishes he never met me. Now I’m going to have to rewrite the entire thing because I messed up. This is such a disaster! He thinks he’s above everyone else by signing his own books anyway. And why does he think he has the right to be so nice when I ruined everything for him? Oh yeah, I can see him mentally calling me out in his head right now. This is so embarrassing; I’ll never live this down. I don’t even want to read his stupid book anymore.

When I see him sitting there, surrounded by screens and snacks, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. It's more than just the mess; it represents a lack of effort and commitment from someone who should know better. I keep thinking about all the times we've discussed how important it is to work together, and now here I am, feeling like I'm fighting an uphill battle alone. His distraction feels like a deliberate choice, one that highlights his laziness. Every time he puts off his tasks, it makes me wonder if he even cares about what I have to handle. It’s like he sees me as the only one holding things together around here, which isn’t fair. I don’t want to be burdened by his lack of initiative, but somehow, that’s exactly what I get. I’m trying not to let my feelings boil over, but it’s getting harder. Seeing him enjoying himself while I struggle to keep up makes me feel like I’m failing too.

It had been months since he'd taken time off from work. His wife was always there to support him, but lately, she seemed distant, more focused on her own life than on being there for him. And then there were the kids... they grew up too fast, leaving him feeling like he missed everything. Every day felt like another step backward, further away from the carefree spirit of his youth.** \"I'm fine,\" John said, forcing a smile. But deep down, he knew the stranger might be right. Maybe he was lost, but he didn't know how to find himself again. The stranger nodded sympathetically, taking a sip of his drink. \"You don’t have to face this alone.

And then there are those who come in all smiles, and it makes you wonder if they really didn’t buy anything from us. It’s always the same, though - either they try to trick you into paying for something you didn’t buy, or they act like they forgot to bring their receipts. This one, at least, seemed genuinely confused. Maybe he wasn’t even the owner of the product. You know how some people can forget what they bought because they were distracted by whatever else happened during the shopping trip? Like when your friend buys something online, but you weren’t around for the whole transaction. So yeah, it could be that simple. We all have moments like that where we forget something, right? I guess I’m just having a rough day, but honestly, I wouldn’t expect him to be the first person to act this way. It happens to everyone sometimes. I wish I could say I’d done this before, but... well, actually, I think I might have had a similar experience once. Or maybe I was just stressed back then, too.

He tried to brush it off, saying she just wanted to see how we were doing, but I knew better than that. She wasn't interested, and he knew it. I remember when he first started working here, he seemed like the perfect candidate - young, eager, and willing to learn. But over time, he became complacent, more concerned with his social life than with improving himself. It made sense that she wouldn't want to give him a second chance. I felt a pang of disappointment, but also a sense of vindication; maybe this was why she never took him seriously before. When he realized I was upset, he tried to defend himself, claiming he was just trying to keep his options open and didn't mean anything by those texts. I listened patiently, but deep down, I knew he was lying. He couldn't fool anyone as well as he thought he did.

If only he was still here, none of this would matter. They were meant to be together forever, and now...now everything just felt like a cruel joke. She closed her eyes, trying to shut out the memories that haunted her. But they lingered, echoing through her mind like whispers from another time. She remembered the laughter they shared, the late-night conversations, and the dreams they'd built together. Now all she got was loneliness and regret. As the hours passed, the store grew quiet once more. The music stopped, and the silence was oppressive. She felt like she was drowning in it, unable to escape the weight of what could never be again. Outside, the storm raged on, but inside, she felt like she was being buried alive, suffocating under the crushing realization that some things were truly lost forever. And yet, even in the midst of all this pain, there was a part of her that refused to give up. It clung to hope, no matter how futile,"
