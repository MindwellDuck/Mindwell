Inside were clippings of his old articles, now faded and brittle, each one a reminder of his glory days in journalism. The dust motes dancing in the sunlight seemed to mock him, whispering tales of scoops missed, stories untold, and wars long over. Today's newsroom was a stranger's place, filled with faces too young to remember his name. As he sat there, alone amidst the hum of activity, he felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness wash over him. He was just an old man now, forgotten, useless, his stories gathering dust alongside his medals and awards.",

It's embarrassing, really—embarrassing how easily I can get caught up in nostalgia. But I guess that’s what happens when you spend your whole career chasing down leads, covering big stories, and earning respect. I know it sounds selfish, but sometimes I wish I could just be remembered as the guy who got the scoop, not the old man who couldn’t keep up. You'd think after all these years, I’d have adjusted, learned to let go, but no... My mind still wanders back to those moments, replaying them like they were yesterday. And now?

Maybe I should be grateful he didn’t ask for alimony. Oh wait, maybe I should be grateful he didn’t leave me completely broke either. Yeah, let’s keep telling ourselves that. I guess I’m doing okay for myself right now, but why bother when he’s getting married? Why bother living if he’s already dead inside?
