The dust gathering on her image made him feel like she was watching over him, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that this display of dust was somehow unfair. It seemed that every time someone else moved something around, they would notice it immediately, but he could go months without realizing how much dust had accumulated. He felt like he was being compared unfavorably to those who took care of their belongings more diligently. In his mind, he was already behind everyone else, even if no one had said anything about it. He began to wonder why it never happened to them, as if they were just more diligent than him. This thought sent a wave of frustration through him, making him question whether anyone truly cared about the state of his home, or if everything was just an illusion."

My daughter's condition hasn't changed – she's still lying there, **still** crying, **still** unable to breathe.

We were going to meet up at the park, but no, he had to go check his stupid phone every five minutes.

The thought made him feel even worse. She shouldn’t have looked so happy around him; it was all an act. That was what she always did when she wanted attention. He was just a joke to her, a pathetic man trying to get her attention. But why should he be surprised? Women like this kind of thing all the time. They wouldn’t hesitate to flirt with anyone who could make them laugh. She wasn’t worth getting hurt over, anyway. Her smile was nothing special - it was probably just a reflex from years of practice. And besides, there was no reason to believe she actually liked this guy. Maybe she was just being friendly. Or perhaps she was pretending to be nice because she knew he couldn’t handle rejection. Either way, he should have seen it coming. He acted like a fool by letting himself get so attached to someone who clearly wasn’t interested. She was supposed to care about me, but now I realized she never really did.

It makes me wonder what else he might be hiding from me. He's always talking about how great of a father he is, but the fact that he'd rather spend time with some stranger than me is proof enough that he doesn't deserve to be called a good man. He must have a lot of work done before he can call himself a real husband. She has no idea what's going through my mind right now. I bet she thinks I'm just being overly sensitive. But what if I'm actually more perceptive than she gives me credit for? Maybe she just needs someone who knows how to navigate these situations better than she does. This isn't the first time he's spent hours getting ready for something, and I'm still waiting for him to make an effort to talk to me. When will he finally realize that I need attention too? It's clear that this situation is far from over. In fact, it may never end, given the level of infidelity I suspect he'll continue to engage in.

And people are starting to notice—like when he showed up late to our team meeting because he was at a party all night. This isn’t normal behavior for him. We’ve had disagreements before, but nothing like this. I’m starting to think he might actually have a problem with his age. Maybe he’s trying too hard to stay young? It’s weird how he keeps talking about being “young at heart” and “still cool.” Does anyone else see something wrong here? Is he just pretending to be someone he’s not? This whole situation feels suspicious. What if he’s using his power to push us around? I’ve seen him make questionable decisions before, and now they seem even more questionable. There must be a reason behind his sudden change in behavior. Maybe there’s something going on that we’re not aware of... Wait a minute… I remember now! The same thing happened to me last year.
