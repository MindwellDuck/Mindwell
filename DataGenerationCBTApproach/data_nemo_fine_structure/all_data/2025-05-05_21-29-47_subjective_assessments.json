Perhaps they genuinely weren’t aware of my attempts to stop them, or maybe they felt more comfortable acting out than considering my concerns. Maybe there was another factor at play that I couldn’t see. It’s possible that their behavior wasn’t entirely malicious, but rather a reflection of their own stress and confusion. This realization doesn’t excuse their actions, but it does make me wonder whether I’m overreacting. Was I too sensitive, or did they truly deserve to be treated this way? By shifting my perspective, I hope to find a middle ground between empathy and self-defense. After all, we all have bad days sometimes, and maybe we shouldn’t judge others too quickly."

She cannot see herself as someone who has moved on or who has changed. She thinks that she will never forgive him if he continues to deceive her and lie to her, but she also believes that she would have forgiven him if he had been honest about his infidelity right away. It's a choice between blind forgiveness or complete rejection. She wonders why this is happening to her again. Why does she always get stuck with these toxic relationships? Maybe if she hadn't been cheated on before, things would be different. She thinks that she can't trust him anymore, but she also can't imagine living without him. If she lets him go, she'll lose the best thing that ever happened to her, but if she stays, she risks being hurt again.
