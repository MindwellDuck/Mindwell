He thinks he's so smart, sending this card, rubbing it in our faces. But I'm onto him. I know he's up to something. He's trying to get back at us, to punish us for leaving him behind. Well, I've had enough. We won't stand for this shit anymore! This whole situation is his fault. If he hadn't fucked everything up, if he didn't destroy his life with his own mistakes, none of this would happen. But no, he has to go and ruin it for everyone else too.

The words \"Dear\" and \"Love\" danced on the page, but they didn't erase the memories that still lingered. She could almost smell the bitterness that clung to him like a bad habit. And yet...and yet...she couldn't help but wonder what he wanted. Had he changed his mind about everything they'd fought over? Or did he just want closure? She thought back to that fateful day, when she'd walked out of his life without looking back. Why had he let things go so easily? Was it because he realized how much he'd lost without her? Or was it something more sinister? He'd always been the type who wore his emotions on his sleeve, and now, it seemed like every word he wrote was laced with a hint of resentment. Even the phrase \"Please forgive me\" sounded hollow, like a joke. What would she say if she were the one apologizing? As she read on, her anxiety grew. This wasn't going to end well. She knew it in her bones. There was no way he was going to apologize for what he felt was his greatest mistake - leaving her behind. Not"

In hindsight, the figure could have simply been another patient observing from afar. However, the initial impression persisted, fueling my anxiety. I couldn’t help but wonder if there was more to it—perhaps someone had been tracking me for reasons unknown. My mind kept drifting back to the encounter, replaying every detail. Even though I told myself it was likely just a coincidence, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy. The image of the figure lingering outside my office stayed with me, making it difficult to focus during the day. It’s as if my mental filter had become overly sensitive, picking up on minor details that weren’t even there. Despite the rational explanation, the sense of unease remained. I found myself glancing out of the window, half-expecting to see the figure again. It was then that I realized how deeply ingrained my paranoia had become. I started to question whether I was truly seeing what I thought I saw, or if my mind was playing tricks on me. With each"
