But now, standing alone in the hospital room, it's hard to imagine a future where we'll ever meet again. \"I can't believe he's gone,\" she whispered, tears streaming down her face. \"He was my best friend.\" I wanted to comfort her, but every word felt like a betrayal. It wasn't enough to say, \"It's okay.\" Or even, \"I'm here for you.\" The truth is, I couldn't find the right words. All I could muster was a gentle touch on her shoulder, which seemed inadequate in the face of such tragedy. As I looked around the room, I saw everything I knew about him—a worn armchair, a bookshelf filled with his favorite novels, a framed photo of our conversations. Each item brought back memories, each one a reminder that this moment was permanent, irreversible. In that instant, I realized that all I could do was acknowledge the pain she must be feeling, but nothing else would fill the void. In hindsight, I wish I had known how to bridge the gap between reality and grief. I wish I could have shown her that there were shades of gray, that sometimes the line between joy and sadness isn’t always black and white, but she didn’t give me a chance. Now, I’m left with the knowledge that some moments are forever"

They always do things without considering how others might feel. And this time, they just cancelled everything without thinking at all. This whole situation is so frustrating.

She sneers as he approaches, \"Not you again, copper.\" His jaw tightens, remembering every time she's spat at him, laughed at his efforts to help her change. Today, though, there's a new twist. She points to a figure huddled in the doorway, barely visible in the shadows. \"He said you're too soft, that you can't do anything right.\" The young officer feels his cheeks flush with anger and humiliation, but beneath it all, a familiar spark of spite ignites.

They'll just keep fighting, and I'll keep getting shot at, and we'll keep going around in circles. Why bother? When people say I need to stop being a \"good cop,\" they don't realize how hard it is to actually be a good person when the world isn't always worth it. And what's the point of helping people anyway? They just end up hurting themselves and each other. I've seen it happen over and over. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to talk to her today, maybe I should have just let her continue down her path. But no, I had to go and ruin everything by showing up, making things worse. Now everyone's going to think I'm some kind of hero, which isn't true. I'm not a hero; I'm just another broken human who keeps getting pulled back into this mess.

Her kids never get to spend time together, and it makes me so angry. Why does she have to keep going? Doesn't she care about her family? She shouldn't have left her patients hanging overnight. Shouldn't she prioritize them over her personal life? Maybe if she was more responsible, none of these things would happen. But then again, maybe she can't control everything. Still, I hate how she always puts work first. It's so selfish. It feels like Dr. H is making everyone else suffer because of her own laziness. The nurses have to deal with the workload alone, and I bet they're exhausted. It's such an unfair burden. If only Dr. H could manage her time better, all of this wouldn't happen. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive, but it doesn't seem right. She should be able to balance her job and family life without sacrificing anyone.
