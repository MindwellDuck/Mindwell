That would lead to more problems, right?\" It's hard to imagine how he'll handle all this stress. The pressure must be overwhelming, especially since he has kids to look after now.

He's always saying stuff like, \"Oh, you're just jealous,\" or \"Why are you being dramatic?\" Like what? It's not my fault he didn't think about me when he went shopping with his friends last weekend! That was just one of those things where we all did it. We were hanging out at the mall, and he had no business buying condoms with us there. But of course, he didn't listen to reason and ended up getting them from some sketchy store near the subway. And now, I find these condoms in his gym bag, right next to his dirty socks and used gym clothes. The whole thing feels like a setup. This isn't his first mistake either—remember how he left his car unlocked at the gas station last year? Or how he forgot his wallet at home during our road trip? Yeah, he's always making these little mistakes, but he never apologizes. So, I guess I shouldn't be surprised when he does something like this again.\""

It echoed the disdain his wife had once shown towards his dreams, her dismissal of them mirroring the nurse's disrespect. His mind began to weave a narrative, one where this wasn't just about a patient, but about the many times others had belittled him. He saw himself as a guardian of dignity, someone who stood up for those unable to defend themselves, yet he couldn't help feeling like he was losing ground. This was more than just a disagreement; it was a reminder that sometimes, even those who care most can become the very thing we fear most. He wondered if he'd ever find a way to reconcile his desire for control with the reality that, sometimes, our efforts aren’t enough."

He didn’t seem to notice how I struggled to keep up, how my own emotions were constantly being stirred, mixed, and served alongside his, but never truly integrated into the meal. He seemed completely at ease, a master of the kitchen, moving through tasks with the precision of a surgeon, while inside me, the pot was boiling over, the lid slowly creaking open, releasing all the pent-up frustration, sadness, and disappointment. Every time he walked out of the room, I felt like I was losing myself in the process, becoming one of many dishes he'd already prepared – a mere addition, not a core part of the recipe. It wasn't just about the food; it was about the way we used to be, two people who once shared everything, now reduced to a series of empty plates, leftovers, and forgotten moments. His eyes, once full of laughter, now looked tired, worn from the countless meals he'd cooked alone, with no one to share them with.

My family will probably leave me when they see what happened. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened; I’ve had so many problems with food poisoning before. They must think I’m cursed. I mean, who needs a new kitchen when you already have one full of mold and old appliances? This is exactly why I shouldn’t have taken cooking classes. Now, I'll never be able to show my face at the restaurant again. Even if I try to fix things, it’ll just get worse. I won't even bother trying because what’s the point?
