He stumbled into his study, lit only by the moon, and switched on his ancient desktop. The screen flickered to life, revealing an unfinished research paper - the deadline looming like a guillotine. His hands trembled slightly as he reached for his coffee, cold and bitter from the night before. Another sleepless night awaited, anxiety chewing at him like a relentless rat.",

The aroma of fresh coffee wafted through the open window, mingling with their joyous chatter. She had not heard such warmth in a shared meal since before her husband's passing.

It was so genuine that I couldn't help feeling left out. I thought about how nice it would be if he were here, too. But then I realized how unfair that would be. He has a family now; he can't just drop everything for me. I've been holding on to memories of our friendship, trying to convince myself that we're still close, but it's getting harder. Every time I see him, I feel like I'm intruding on something special between them. His wife is probably happy to have someone to share these moments with, especially after what they went through together. I know this isn't fair, but sometimes I wish things could go back to the way they were. When I look at him, I feel like I'm seeing him for the first time. And when I hear him laugh, it makes me feel like crying. I guess some people are just meant to move on, while others stay behind. Either way, I'll keep enjoying my coffee, but it won't fill the emptiness inside. It's funny how one small thing can stir up so many emotions. I wonder if he'd ever notice if I...but no, that's silly. I shouldn't even think about it. Life goes on, right? I'll focus on my own healing"

The fact that she buys herself perfume means she's not satisfied with what we have. She thinks we're too cheap for nice things. And this whole thing? It's just a waste. He could've spent that $20 on something else, like a movie ticket or a dinner out. **But no, instead, he had to go and buy her a stupid bottle of perfume. What does she really need that for? It's not like she wears it every day.** I don't even want to think about it. This is so pathetic. I can't believe I'm letting myself feel this way. **It's just an insignificant little receipt, but it makes me feel so angry and hurt. I guess I'll just ignore it and pretend it never happened.** This isn't fair. We've worked hard our entire marriage to save up for big things, and then she goes and buys herself a $50 bottle of perfume? I thought we were doing okay financially.

But no, instead I get a slap in the face, like I'm nothing more than a low-level researcher who doesn't deserve to even try. How could they do this to me? Do they know how much I’ve invested in this project? All those late nights, weekends, and sacrifices—everything I thought would pay off now gets tossed out the window because of some fucking red tape. And what really gets my blood boiling is that they're doing this behind my back. No chance for me to even argue my case before they made up their minds. Unbelievable!

Every day feels like a test, each one a painful reminder of what could’ve been if only she were there. Even the simplest moments, like going for a walk together, now feel hollow without her by his side. She’d always say those walks helped clear our minds, but now I’m starting to think it was just a way to get away from me. Every time he looks out the window, he wonders where she is, whether she thinks about him too, and if she’ll ever come back. His phone is filled with messages from friends, family, and even strangers who seem to know more about her life than he does. They keep asking questions about her health, her job, and why she stopped responding. But when he tries to respond, he finds himself stuck between the truth and the lies he tells himself to cope. The pain of losing her is like a constant weight, making it hard to breathe sometimes. He feels like he’s drowning in grief, unable to escape the reality that she’s gone.

On the desk, a letter she had written him lay open, words that once poured out of her heart now seemed hollow. Her gaze fell upon the calendar, and she saw how quickly time passed them by. Every year marked a milestone, a reminder that life moved forward whether she did or not. The date below the message flashed before her eyes, a constant reminder that he would never be hers again. Tears welled up, and she let them fall silently into the cupped palms of her hands, a gesture that felt both futile and necessary. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger She stared blankly at the screen as the automated message echoed through her mind. It wasn’t just the words; it was the context. Her husband’s name no longer held warmth. Instead, it became a painful reminder of something lost—a relationship that ended abruptly, leaving her to navigate the complexities of life alone. ## Step 2: Reflect on Memories As she gazed around her office, memories flooded her mind. There were photos of happy times, moments of joy, and laughter, but they were overshadowed by the weight of what remained. Each item told a story, yet none seemed to"
