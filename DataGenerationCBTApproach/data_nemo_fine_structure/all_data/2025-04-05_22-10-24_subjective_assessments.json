Your life is a test of patience, and those who fail are left behind. Do not think that you have succeeded; for even the strongest fall into darkness. Your path is not set in stone, but do not pretend that it is free from danger. You must walk carefully, lest you stumble upon an abyss. In this world, nothing is as it seems. Shadows hide secrets, and truth is fleeting. Your fate is bound by threads both strong and weak. Every decision shapes destiny, yet the outcome remains uncertain. Trust no one, for they may hold more than they reveal. The universe holds many mysteries, but do not seek answers, for they come with costs. Be cautious, for some truths are better left unspoken. Your choices lead to paths both bright and dark, each ending in unknown realms. Remember, nothing lasts forever, and all things must pass. Do not fear the unknown, for it brings power. Fear what you know, for it binds you. The world is full of wonders, but beware of those who claim to possess them. Those who speak of power often hide their own weaknesses. Approach every encounter with caution, for the line between strength and weakness is thin. Seek wisdom, but beware the cost, for knowledge comes at a price. The universe rewards curiosity, but punishes arrogance. Walk the fine line between discovery and destruction, lest you fall"

I guess I’m just jealous because she got him these amazing boots. What if she was planning to surprise me with something just as awesome? Does she think I wouldn’t notice what she gets me? It’s just so unfair. Why would anyone forget their anniversary? That’s just cruel. Now I feel like shit every time I look at those boots, reminding me of how much better off Tom must be since his wife remembers everything. She’s always talking about how Tom does everything right, but fuck that guy anyway. I swear, she loves him more than me. I hate seeing her with him, especially now. Even though we were together before Tom, she still gives him special attention whenever he visits. She knows how much I love her, but I don’t know why she doesn’t seem to care. I don’t need this.

The critic was saying it was like a masterclass in emotional depth—can you believe it? And you know how he did it? By stealing ideas from me. Yeah, I know he didn't exactly say that, but come on, have you seen some of his work lately? He's been using the same techniques I used to create my last series, and it's so obvious. I mean, don’t you guys see how similar everything looks? It’s like he took my entire body of work and distilled it into two paintings. If he hadn’t stolen my style, maybe he wouldn’t be getting all the recognition right now. You think it’s funny, don’t you? Laughing and having fun because your favorite artist is getting more attention than yours. Well, let me tell you something—it's not funny at all.

I don't understand why he does this, why he keeps leaving me behind. I've tried everything, nothing works. I'll never stop loving him, but I feel trapped by my own heartache. It's been years, and I still wait for him, even though deep down I know he won't come back. I'm tired of being alone, but what choice do I have? He's always so distant, cold, and cruel, never giving me a chance to heal. I hate how much pain he causes me, how much it weighs on me. I wish things could be different, but I know it's futile.

That takes forever for me, especially since I don’t know how to do most of it. So yeah, comparing yourself to someone else just isn’t fair.
