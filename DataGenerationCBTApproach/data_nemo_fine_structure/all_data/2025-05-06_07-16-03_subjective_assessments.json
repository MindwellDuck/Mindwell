No, no, no, no, no. Don’t even think about it. Think about the attack. Think about defending yourself. Think about getting the drop on them. Think about— His eyes are open.

Her thoughts then shift to more intimate scenarios, imagining him expressing romantic interest again—a prospect that fills her with both fear and nostalgia. She begins to picture herself engaging in a secret affair with him, which intensifies her anxiety and guilt.

She feels like she’s lost control, letting her emotions spiral out of control.

My heart still aches, and the pain remains, no matter how hard I try to convince myself otherwise. This isn’t about finding another partner; it’s about coping with the loss I already carry. Even if I were able to let go of everything, including grief, would it be enough? Would I ever truly be ready to move on? I know some might say it’s unfair to hold onto the past, especially considering the life we had together. They might tell me that every day is a gift, and that holding onto what’s gone is futile.

When you live together, there's an understanding that everyone pitches in, especially if you're both busy. It doesn't seem fair that her partner gets to relax while she cleans up, all while he's still asleep. And what really bothers her is that no one else ever speaks up—she knows she wouldn't get any sympathy from the rest of the family either. It makes her wonder if maybe she's the only one who cares enough to point out these issues. It's not just about being tidy; it's about basic human decency. You'd think someone would remember to clean up after themselves, especially since we've lived together long enough that routines should have developed naturally. Yet here I am, constantly reminding him, and no one else seems to care or offer any support. I feel like I'm going crazy because I keep expecting more from him, but nothing changes.
