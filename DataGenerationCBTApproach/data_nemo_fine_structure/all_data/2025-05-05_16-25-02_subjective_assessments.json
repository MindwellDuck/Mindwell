As we hugged, I noticed the way he held me tightly, the warmth of his arms around me, and the smell of his cologne. It felt like no time had passed since our last goodbye, and for a moment, everything felt right. But then, reality set back in, and I remembered why we were here—my paintings needed to be finished, and he was just passing through. As we stepped inside, I showed him where he could park his car, and he mentioned how much he liked the new light fixture hanging above the table. I appreciated his thoughtful comment, but what struck me more was how little he seemed to notice the changes I'd made to the house. The walls were painted, and there were new rugs on the floor. Everything felt fresh and clean, but his expression remained neutral. We started working together, and while he helped me prepare the canvas, he didn't seem enthusiastic about it. His usual"
