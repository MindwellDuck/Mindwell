Instead, she keeps her focus on the onion, which now seems ominous. What if she cuts herself? Or worse, what if he leaves her? The tension builds, and she starts to feel trapped, as if her husband's casual suggestion has unleashed a chain reaction of disaster. She tries to shake off the feeling, telling herself it's just anxiety from a long day of cooking, but deep down, she knows it's more than that.
