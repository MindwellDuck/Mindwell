I knew I needed to focus, yet the comfort of distraction lingered within me. &#x200B; I feel like I've lost all sense of direction. My days blend together, filled with nothing but endless hours of boredom and self-pity. I'm trapped in this cycle of emptiness, unable to break free. Each passing day feels like a failure, leaving me more despondent than ever. I can't seem to find meaning anymore, and every attempt at change ends in disappointment. &#x200B; It pains me to admit that I've become so reliant on distractions—scrolling endlessly, mindlessly consuming content—that I’ve lost touch with reality. This habit has slowly drained what little motivation I once had, reducing my productivity to almost nothing. The silence is deafening, and I’m starting to lose hope. &#x200B; My life has become a hollow shell, devoid of purpose. The moments I try to fill are just empty distractions, a desperate attempt to escape the crushing loneliness that surrounds me. Despite knowing I need to move forward, I remain stuck, drowning in my own helplessness. The darkness"

He thinks she's going to break up with him soon, and he can't handle it. He keeps saying he'll never forgive her, and that he needs me to convince him otherwise. This is all just a bunch of lies. He's making it up. She would never cheat on him. They're perfect together. This is just him being dramatic again. But he won't listen, and now he's accusing me of lying too. He thinks I'm helping her, which is ridiculous. I don't know why he's acting this way, but it's clearly not fair to both of us. This is just another one"

They were having a good day, just enjoying each other’s company, and then suddenly this happens. It’s not fair; they weren’t fighting, nothing was bothering them. But still, he explodes. The anger inside him grows, and before you know it, everything around him becomes a source of rage. Even something as simple as finding an empty coffee cup turns into a full-blown tantrum. It’s heartbreaking to see someone who once brought joy to your life become consumed by anger and resentment. He feels lost, unable to control himself, like a ticking time bomb waiting for the next trigger. Maybe if she were here, things would be different, but until then, I’m left dealing with his outbursts, trying to find ways to calm him down when he blows up over nothing. It’s exhausting, and honestly, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. He needs help, but how? How does one deal with such intense emotions, especially when it comes from deep within?"
