It had been exactly a year since she'd last spoken to her, their heated argument echoing in her mind like an unending loop. A sudden, profound guilt washed over her as she remembered the harsh words she'd spoken in anger. She picked up her phone, her trembling fingers hovering over the contacts list, wishing she could take back that fateful day.",

I'm stuck in this endless cycle of regret. If only I could turn back time, I would have said nothing. But now, every moment feels like a betrayal, and I'm trapped with my own thoughts. My mind is filled with hate and sadness, unable to move forward. The pain between us has become a chasm that can't be bridged. I wish things were different, but they are what they are. I've lost all hope. The past is gone forever; there's no turning back. I'm left to face the consequences of my actions, forever locked in this sorrowful reality."

But why now? We've been working on our relationship for years. He has no reason to abandon me like this. He's being cruel. This is all because of his lack of faithfulness. If only I had known sooner, I wouldn't have stayed. If I'd seen those signs earlier, I might have avoided this pain. But now, I'm stuck with this guilt. How could I have missed these signs? This is such an injustice. His behavior was always suspicious. I never imagined he'd actually cheat on me. He said nothing about this, and I trusted him. I was blind. What kind of man does that? We shared everything, every detail. Our dreams, fears, hopes, and desires. He knew me better than anyone. And yet, he betrayed me. All these memories—our first date, our wedding, and the moment he told me how much he loved me—are meaningless now. What if he regrets it? Maybe he'll come back. But I don't think so.

It's a waste of time and resources. This whole thing is a failure, and everyone involved knows it. There's no way our efforts will pay off. I'm so sick of seeing people try to justify this nonsense. It's pathetic. Everyone who thinks otherwise is delusional. The fact that some people still believe in this fantasy is laughable. I feel like I'm wasting my life trying to keep up with all this fake enthusiasm. It's absurd. Every single artist is just faking it for attention. Even if someone does buy something, it's probably just an empty gesture. Who actually cares about art anyway? Nobody. I hate being part of this charade. It's such a joke.
