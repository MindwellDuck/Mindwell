He felt a pang in his chest as he read the simple instructions, remembering how she used to hum while she baked, leaving the kitchen warm and fragrant. The regret tasted bitter on his tongue, like unsweetened tea.",

Every day, I woke up thinking that today would be different, but it never was. She should have made an effort to see us more often. Shouldn't she have called me sooner when she was struggling? Why should I have assumed she'd forget about me again? My mom should have stopped making those constant demands for money; maybe if she had, things could've been easier. But then I should have been more supportive, because that's what family is supposed to be right? She should have stayed longer at work that one night. She should have taken my calls, should have listened to me, should have been there for me. If only she hadn't gotten sick, none of this would've happened. I shouldn't have pushed her so hard to get back to work after her accident. I should have understood that she needed time, that life wasn't fair.

It's ridiculous that he gets so upset over one little grade. Why does he think he has any right to come in here and start screaming? What if he did something worse, like, say, breaking into my house or something? I just can't imagine being around him anymore. Every time he shows up, I get anxious.

It doesn't make sense that she would leave me for someone else. We were happy, weren't we? Did I miss something? Was there something I didn't see? Maybe I'm too blind to notice what's going on around me. That would explain why she kept pushing me away. And why did she delete her social media accounts? Is she trying to hide something from me? What am I missing? I need answers! Why isn't anyone answering my calls? Everyone's ignoring me. No one cares about me anymore. Even my friends are distant.

Why bother checking up on her when I could be out there doing something worthwhile? Like, have you seen how many robberies are happening lately? I'd rather focus on keeping people safe than listening to her ramble about nothing. Besides, she can handle herself; she's not some frail old lady who needs constant reassurance. It's not like I haven't talked to her recently. We spoke just yesterday, and she seemed okay. But then again, she often says that when she's worried. It's probably just her way of making me feel guilty for not visiting more often. You know, like she does every time we hang out. \"Oh, thank goodness you're here now! I thought I was going to die!\" Yeah, right. That never happens. So yeah, I'm just going to ignore this whole thing and go to bed. I'm tired and need a break from all these unnecessary worries."

His hands began to shake, and he felt a lump form in his throat. What if he couldn't finish the painting today? What if he failed again? He clenched his jaw, trying to push those thoughts away, but they kept coming back. Each time he painted, he worried that he wouldn’t be able to create something beautiful. That he would fail, just like he had before. As he stood there, frozen, the room seemed to grow darker. The shadows deepened, and his breath caught in his chest. What if he couldn’t move forward? What if he was stuck forever? The phone rang again, but he couldn’t bring himself to answer it. What if someone from the gallery called to ask for another chance? Or worse, what if they told him he wasn’t talented enough? He sat down, letting the brush fall from his hand. The weight of those questions crushed him, making every muscle ache. He couldn’t bear the thought of facing the gallery owner again, especially after failing so many times. In the end, he closed his eyes and let the doubts wash over him. They were always there"
