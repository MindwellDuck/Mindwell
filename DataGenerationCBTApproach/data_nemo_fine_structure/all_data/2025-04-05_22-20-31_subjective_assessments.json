I hate myself for wasting so much time trying to create something beautiful. What would have happened if she hadn't said anything? Would I still feel this way? No, I wouldn't. But now I'm stuck with this stupid art that no one wants anyway. She destroyed everything I worked so hard for. What am I supposed to say now? That it's fine? Ha!

It's already hard enough getting them settled into bed; now I'll have to spend the evening making dinner for all of us by myself, too. Why does this always happen to me? She must be ignoring me because I'm such a bad husband. She hates how I'm always stressed out about my job. Maybe she thinks I'm just too much to handle. Or maybe she’s tired of trying to make everything perfect for both of us—our family life, our relationship—it’s exhausting. And if she’s feeling overwhelmed, why would she even bother coming home tonight? But what really gets me is that she left me a note, but it felt like an insult. I mean, who writes something like that? Doesn’t she know that just because I’m exhausted doesn’t mean I don’t want her around? That I need her here, comforting me, sharing stories about her day? This is exactly when I need her most, not when she disappears into the night. What am I supposed to do? Wait up for her until morning? It feels like she doesn"

Her husband, quiet and absent-minded as always, had left his glasses on her desk - again. She picked them up, fingers tightening around the frame, resentment simmering. He'd been careless with her things for years, his 'little forgetful moments' growing more frequent, more deliberate lately, she thought. Today, it was the final straw.

She had always been a bit of a perfectionist, but this seemed different. There were so many instances where her husband would just leave things lying around or misplace important items. It didn’t seem like an honest mistake anymore; it felt like a deliberate choice. It all started when her husband began working from home more often. He was always leaving his lunchbox on the counter, and sometimes it would be weeks before she saw it. His socks disappeared in the wash, and he would go days without wearing matching shoes. It was infuriating, and she felt like she was constantly reminding him about simple tasks. But then there were the bigger things, like how he would forget to turn off the stove or leave the oven on, burning dishes and filling the house with smoke. At first, she tried to brush these incidents off as minor oversights, but over time, they piled up, and her frustration grew. Now, every time he left his glasses on her desk, she felt a surge of anger. Why did he have to make these small mistakes so frequently? Wasn’t it enough that he worked from home, taking away some of her alone time? Her mind kept going back"

He thinks he's some kind of artist genius just because he can draw simple things. What would you think if someone came up to you and told you you were terrible at everything you did? He has no idea what it’s like to try and create something beautiful and have it thrown back in your face. Just because we're not all good artists doesn’t mean I deserve to suffer through humiliation every day. I don’t need to be reminded that I’m a failure, especially when he hasn’t even tried himself. This class isn’t about learning; it’s about who gets to pretend they’re better than everyone else. They make us feel stupid and then act all high and mighty like they're superior.

How did she manage to stay so cool? Does she even feel fear? If she does, why doesn’t it show? Is it because she’s been through worse? Has she ever had an emergency like this?

Maybe it wasn't just about the story that had been rejected, but about something deeper. He thought back to all the times he'd seen her laugh at other people's jokes, and how she always made an effort to get together with friends. When he looked around the office, he saw colleagues enjoying each other's company, sharing stories, and having fun. They were all moving forward while he felt stuck, unable to let go of his frustration. She listened attentively as he shared his concerns, and he could see the understanding in her eyes. In that moment, he didn't feel alone anymore. Her presence reminded him that life isn't just about work; it's also about relationships and personal growth.

Maybe I’m just too sensitive all the time. Or maybe it’s just my way of coping. Either way, I wish I could figure out what drives these thoughts before they spiral out of control again. This experience has made me think about how easily our perceptions can be skewed by our own fears. I guess we often overlook the obvious explanations because they don’t fit our preconceived notions.
