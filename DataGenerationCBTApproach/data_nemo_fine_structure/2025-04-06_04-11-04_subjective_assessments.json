So, we were having lunch there, just sitting around chatting, when this guy starts laughing really loudly. Like, seriously loudly. He had some pictures on his phone, and he just kept showing them everyone. Now, I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure you're supposed to keep your phone on silent mode when eating, right? But that wasn't the point. What really got under my skin was that he was laughing so hard; he couldn’t stop. And then, he held up this stupid picture of his family—his actual family, with his real kids and his wife. I mean, come on! They must be so happy, right? I could feel my anger rising, and before I knew it, I was getting choked up. I tried to play it cool, but inside, I was seething. We all know how much I hate hospitals. I've been there too many times, watching people suffer and being treated like dirt myself. It’s always the same: they get to sit there and enjoy their meals while we’re stuck in pain. Even though I’m doing okay now, those memories still linger. Anyway, back to the guy at the cafeteria. As soon as I saw him laughing, I started thinking about how selfish he must be. I mean, who laughs at someone else’s misfortune"

However, it might be helpful to take a step back and look at things objectively. Sometimes, when we're feeling stressed, our perception of reality can become distorted. Let me offer some insights based on my readings. It seems like you're trying to make sense of this situation, but your emotions are clouding your judgment. That's okay; it happens to everyone. The thing is, sometimes when we're under stress, our minds can play tricks on us. This isn't necessarily about fortune telling, but rather how our brains handle difficult situations. It appears that you're focusing too much on the negative aspects of the situation, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and sadness. While it's natural to grieve for your pet, try to balance that emotion with a dose of realism. Your husband needs support during this time, and it's possible that he may need help coping with his loss. Rather than dwelling on the past, consider exploring ways to move forward together. Maybe there's something he could do right now to honor Whiskers' memory, even if it feels small. If you want to talk more about this, I'm here to listen. Just remember that it’s okay to not have all the answers right now. Sometimes, just being present with each other can be incredibly powerful. So"
