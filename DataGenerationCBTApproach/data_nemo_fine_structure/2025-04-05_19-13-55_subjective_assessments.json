It's been weeks since we last saw each other, and yet here you are, thinking about how much she meant to you. You're still holding onto the past, aren't you? You know, I've seen people like you before. They think they can control the future just because they don't want something bad to happen. But the truth is, once something goes wrong, there's nothing you can do. It's like trying to hold water in your hands - no matter how hard you try, it'll always slip through. If you keep dwelling on the \"what ifs,\" you'll never move forward. You need to accept that things change, even if it feels like an accident. Sometimes, it's just life. And sometimes... well, sometimes it's just plain cruel. There's no predicting when or why these things happen. But instead of focusing on the positive, you're stuck in the past. That's not healthy. You have to learn to let go. If you keep holding on, you might miss out on new experiences. You could meet someone else, make new friends—anything but reliving memories that won't come back. Just look around you right now. See all those people who came before her? What did they have? Nothing but regrets. They spent years thinking they could stop time, but time didn't care about them.
