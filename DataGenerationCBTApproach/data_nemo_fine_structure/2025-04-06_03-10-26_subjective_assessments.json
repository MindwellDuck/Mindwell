It doesn’t make sense why he would suddenly change. Maybe he’s trying to show off how happy he is? Or maybe he thinks I’m still pining for him? No, no, it can't be because I've found happiness elsewhere. My life is complete now. But still, seeing him laugh with this new woman hurts. I wonder if she knows about our past. He looks different, too. His hair isn't as long anymore, and his smile doesn’t seem as genuine. But what does that mean? Is he trying to prove something? Does he think I'll notice? The way he talks to her, how confident he appears... it must be because he wants to show me how much better he is doing now. I guess it's normal for people to move on, but I don't want to accept it. Seeing him with someone else makes me realize how much time passed since our divorce. It feels like yesterday when we were married, and now here we are, living separate lives.

But does that really excuse them from calling? Doesn't anyone care enough to check up on me after everything we went through? I thought we were closer than that. Now it feels like I was never even important enough to them. Is it too much to ask for some basic human decency? Apparently so, because they're all too busy enjoying themselves to even consider reaching out. I swear, every time I try to reach out, they ignore me. Or worse, they respond with these lame excuses about being busy or needing space. Yeah, sure, because that's exactly how people behave when they genuinely care about you.
