The usual chatter was absent; everyone else had gone home to their families hours ago. She reached into her pocket for her wedding ring, a habit she hadn't broken despite it being three years since the divorce. As she rubbed the smooth band between her fingers, she noticed a photo on the bulletin board - a colleague's child in a police uniform, grinning from ear to ear. A pang of regret hit her like a punch to the gut. She looked at her own empty hands, no ring, no child, just calluses and a faint tremor from too many late-night patrols.",

Every time I see someone else with a family, with a partner who loves them, it just makes me want to give up. Even the kid on the bulletin board looks happy, but what about me? My life is a mess. I don’t even have a fucking ring anymore! That’s all anyone sees, right? The fact that I don’t have a husband or kids is all anyone cares about. They probably think, “Oh, poor her, she must really need a man.” But nobody cares that I’m struggling here. Nobody wants to hear about how much work I put in every day, how much stress I deal with, how much I miss having someone to come home to. It doesn’t matter. All they care about is judging me and making me feel worse. And then there’s the whole thing with Sarah. I know she’s been flirting with him, and now he’s acting like he owns the place. He thinks he’s so cool with his new car and his stupid smile. Newsflash, Sarah: you’re nothing special. You think you are because you’ve got a few dates under your belt, but trust me, he’ll dump you soon enough. I swear, if I saw another woman wearing my badge, I’d kill her. I hate seeing him with her,"

Maybe she saw something that made her feel uncomfortable.\" \"Have you ever thought that maybe she’s just stressed out?

I mean, let's be real, if anyone was really trying to sabotage me, we both know it would've been a lot more complicated than this.

She needs to understand that I have real problems dealing with public transportation after such a long day. How am I supposed to relax when I'm still stressed from work? This is all because she chose her mom over us. It makes no sense. I feel like I'm just an afterthought to her whenever she wants to hang out with family.
