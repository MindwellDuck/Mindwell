Every word stung, like a slap to the face that left him numb. He couldn't shake off the feeling of betrayal. How could they be so cruel? Hadn’t he worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into every line of code? Didn’t he deserve some mercy? The thought of those anonymous words seeping into his mind like poison made his blood boil. He felt like he was drowning in a sea of disappointment, unable to find solid ground. It was as if someone had ripped out his lungs right there in the lab, leaving him to suffocate under the weight of failure. Every glance at the screen made his stomach twist with anxiety. The more he tried to push it aside, the harder it hit. The pain of rejection swirled around him like a tornado, pulling him down with its dark force. Even the faint hum of the machines seemed to mock him, making him feel even more alone. As I sat in stunned silence, the world around me melted away. My thoughts were consumed by this single moment of defeat, refusing to let go. Time lost all meaning; hours blended together in a blur of shame and anger. Each"

Unfortunately, there isn't enough interest from potential buyers for us to make it worth it.\" You respond with: \"I don't think you're taking this seriously. This is the second time you've canceled exhibitions without giving me any real feedback. It feels like you're just making excuses instead of being honest with yourself.\" How does that sound?

You don't get it because you weren't there, so why are you judging me? It doesn't matter if we were married or not. The point is that he was responsible for my pain. They need to respect that. If they had any idea what it was like living with him, maybe they wouldn't be so quick to tag shit around here. But they're just ignorant kids who don't care about anything besides being stupid.

She hasn't visited it since the divorce. Picking it up, she traces her finger over the image, remembering her mom's smile, her warmth. A pang of remorse hits as she thinks about how she never introduced her ex to her family, not truly trying to bridge that gap until after they'd separated.

The lines around her eyes seem deeper, and her expression appears sad. For a moment, Dr. H. wonders if she should have tried harder to make things work, even though she knew deep down that she was ready to move on. But then she shakes her head, telling herself that life would have only gotten worse. It's not fair to expect herself to be perfect, especially when everything else is falling apart. She reminds herself that the situation \"should\" have ended differently, but it didn't. Instead, she's left with this sense of loss, and she knows that time will heal some wounds, even if others will always remain painful."
