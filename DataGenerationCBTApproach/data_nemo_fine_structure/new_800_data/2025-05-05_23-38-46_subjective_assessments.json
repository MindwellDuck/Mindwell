Why did he think she wouldn't notice this? He knew I wasn't happy about it. It's stupid; we're going to lose everything! What if he goes bankrupt and leaves me alone? What if he decides to sell our home and leave us with nothing? What if he leaves me? What if... what if... She sighed and took out her phone, scrolling through old job listings. She had been a successful artist, but after years of struggling to make ends meet, she finally decided to take a safer route. Now, working as a teacher felt so... unfulfilling. How could one thing lead to another like this? Shouldn't he have known better than to push me into something I hated? What if my art career hadn't fallen apart because of him? What if I still had my own studio? What if... Her mind kept spiraling back to those paintings on the windowsill. They were probably worthless, and she couldn't stand seeing them. But what if they became famous? What if people started buying them and paying her thousands? What if... what if... She realized her husband was trying to reassure her while watching TV. He"

He'd been so patient with her, showing her the perfect way to chop vegetables, guiding her hands as if to say, \"You can do this.\" And then there were the silly moments—when he'd tease her about being too clumsy with the knives, or when she'd accidentally knocked over the flour canister, covering the counter in white powder. They'd both burst into laughter, the tension between them dissipating like the flour. But now, in this empty space, she couldn't shake off the feeling of loss. As she looked around the kitchen, memories flooded her mind. The morning he left for work, how he'd kissed her softly on the cheek, telling her he'd be home soon. How he'd read her favorite book aloud, his voice soothing as he described the adventures of a brave knight. And the countless nights they'd spent curled up by the fireplace, watching the stars twinkle through the skylight above. Each moment felt like a chapter in a story, one she wanted to relive forever. Yet, here she stood, surrounded by these remnants of happiness, yet feeling utterly alone."
