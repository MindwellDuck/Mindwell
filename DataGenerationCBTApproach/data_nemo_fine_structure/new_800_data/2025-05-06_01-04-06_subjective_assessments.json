He had so much life ahead of him. It makes sense that he would die suddenly like this. All these thoughts are swirling around in my head, but I try to focus on what really matters. After all, it's okay to feel sad sometimes. But we can't let ourselves get caught up in those feelings too much. We have to stay strong for each other and our family. I know it feels overwhelming right now, but we'll get through this together. Let's just take things one step at a time."

What if this is just the beginning?”** His mind began racing with scenarios, each one more disturbing than the last. **“Would she leave me for another man?”** The thought sent him spiraling down a path of self-doubt. **“Am I not good enough for her?” **Disappointed:** **“And what about the emails?

That my dad thinks I'm a complete idiot for forgetting to wear socks when we went camping together in 2008? I mean, come on, did you really think there was something wrong with me that day? Or are you just trying to make yourself feel better by telling me that I made a huge mistake? You know, I was totally fine going without those stupid socks until we got back home and realized I forgot them. It wasn't like I was struggling with anxiety or anything; I just didn't want to walk around barefoot in the woods. And besides, I wore warm shoes, which is more than most people could say. So yeah, maybe my father was a little disappointed, but don't go thinking that I did anything wrong. I knew exactly what I was doing, and if anyone else had done the same thing, they wouldn't be lecturing me about it either. Oh, and another thing: Why are people always talking about how I need to get over my childhood trauma? What does that even have to do with the situation? Did I ever ask him about it before? No!

He can't possibly think it was an accident; surely he must have done it on purpose. How could someone so obviously inept manage to mess up something so straightforward? It's almost as if he intentionally wanted to ruin the show, but then again, why would he want to do such a thing? This is all so pathetic - he probably thinks he's some kind of genius chef who can handle anything, but really, he's nothing more than a clumsy oaf. What a ridiculous waste of talent. How dare he pretend like nothing happened when we're all laughing at his expense? Does he honestly expect us to take him seriously after this debacle? Of course not - he's proven himself time and time again as a complete failure in the kitchen. No wonder people are snickering behind their hands; they can't help but feel sorry for this buffoon. Who wouldn't laugh at the sight of someone so clueless trying to cook? Even the poor man knows he's made fools of himself, but what's he going to do about it now?

They say time heals all wounds, but what about this one? This wound cuts deep, and every moment feels like a lifetime. What happened last night? Why did she leave me? Was it something I said? Did I hurt her somehow? No, no, it couldn't be. I love her. I'd never hurt her. Maybe she's just tired? Maybe she needs space? But she's always needed space. Never enough space. So, she leaves. Leaves me here, standing in our bedroom, surrounded by the things we shared, the memories we created. They all seem so distant now, like they belong to someone else.
