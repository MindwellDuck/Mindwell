He'd spend hours perfecting each recipe, and it showed in every bite. Meanwhile, I could barely boil water without burning it. But he never complained; he'd just smile and tell me to try harder. Now, whenever I see him, I feel like a failure for not being able to cook half as well. It's hard to believe he's still with someone who can't even make a decent omelette. Poor her. When they say things like “you’re just burning yourself out” it makes me want to cry. Every time I hear it, all I think about is how much easier life would be if I were married to someone who actually cared about cooking. You know what? I wish I had a husband like that. Maybe then I wouldn’t have to deal with the constant stress of trying to live up to other people’s expectations. Ugh, I hate how unfair this world is. Everyone else gets to enjoy their romantic dinners, while I’m stuck here, scrubbing pots like a servant. Why does it have to be this way? It feels like no matter how hard I try, I'll always fall short. Even now, standing here, I can taste the bitterness of resentment. It's like I'm trapped in a never-ending cycle of disappointment, and there's nothing I can"

But when I asked if I could come, she just laughed and said she wasn't really in the mood. It stung, like a punch to the gut. I felt like I was drowning in my own misery, and no one seemed to care. Her post-breakup life looked effortless. She posted photos of her new boyfriend on Instagram, captioned with phrases like “new chapter” and “happy again.” Meanwhile, I was struggling to find meaning in anything. Every day felt like a repeat of the same dull routine—work, sleep, and more work. I sat down at my desk, staring blankly at my computer screen. My mind wandered back to that night we broke up, when she told me she needed space. Space? Wasn’t that what I needed too? Why did it always have to be him? As I scrolled through social media, I saw posts from friends celebrating their new relationships. They all seemed happy, sharing stories of first kisses and weekend getaways. I scrolled through until I found a friend’s update saying she’d met someone special—a guy who loved"

Her partner, once her sous chef and constant companion, was now confined to a hospital bed, leaving her with an emptiness she couldn't fill with even the busiest dinner rush.

Now, it seemed to mock her, its presence a painful reminder of what she had lost.

It wasn't just the workload that weighed on her; it was the weight of her grief. Every time she thought about moving forward, she felt like she was drowning in the sea of her own sadness. As she continued to stir the sauce, her mind began to wander back to happier times—times when life hadn't been so complicated, when the only thing that mattered was cooking alongside someone who understood her inside and out.
