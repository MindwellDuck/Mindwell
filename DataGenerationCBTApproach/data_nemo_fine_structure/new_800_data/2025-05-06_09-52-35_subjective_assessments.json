First, my wife left me, then I missed my daughter’s birthday. Now, I’m starting to wonder if I’ll ever find happiness again. This is all too much for me to handle. How can I face my daughter on her birthday knowing how careless I am? I don’t deserve to see her smile on her special day. Maybe I should avoid seeing her until next year. What if she never forgives me for this mistake? What if she stops talking to me? Can I really live with myself after this? If only I had remembered, maybe things would’ve turned out differently. Now, I feel like I’m losing control of my life. There’s nothing I can do about it. It’s all going downhill. My life has been falling apart since I got divorced. Missing this birthday makes me realize how far I’ve fallen. I need to focus on improving myself before I lose everything else."

He didn't see himself in those happy memories; instead, he remembered the pain of losing her. Every time he thought about the past, it felt like he was reliving that pain all over again. For him, there was no middle ground between happiness and sadness. Everything was either great or terrible, with nothing in between. This way of thinking made it difficult for him to accept anything other than complete rejection, leaving no room for understanding or empathy. Even when he tried to look back, he saw only black and white. There was no gray area. Every memory was tainted by the pain of her leaving. He couldn't help but wonder if she was truly gone, or if she was still holding onto him somewhere. But deep down, he knew it was impossible. She was gone, and he was left behind. Every moment became a reminder of what he had lost, and he couldn't shake off the feeling of emptiness. For him, life had become a series of stark choices: either you're completely happy or completely sad, with no space for anything in between."
