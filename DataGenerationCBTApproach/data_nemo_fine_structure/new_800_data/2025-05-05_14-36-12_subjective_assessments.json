He’s always been a bit too clingy, but hey, I guess that just makes me more independent now. The fact that he forgot his stuff and left without saying anything—no worries about him having everything he needs, no fuss about him being upset—must be a sign that he’s over me. That’s probably why he didn't even bother packing an overnight bag. If he had, wouldn't he have mentioned it in some way? No, this is clearly a step towards freedom. I can finally focus on myself instead of constantly worrying about how he feels. But honestly, it's weird that he left without a word. Did he think I'd notice if he just vanished into thin air? Or did he genuinely believe we were done? Either way, I’m better off without him. I deserve someone who actually cares enough to communicate when things aren't going well. Now, let’s see if I can manage to handle things on my own without any further complications."

This isn't about grieving anymore; it's about acknowledging how much worse things are now. Life has no meaning without her by my side. Without her, every day is just another reminder of my failure.

Well, let me tell you something—you can’t control my actions or my emotions. If you want things to change, start by looking inside your own head. Because when it comes down to it, you are the one who holds the power. Now, stop making excuses for yourself. Instead, take responsibility for your actions. Think about this: if you were in my shoes, would you really expect me to handle everything alone? No, I’d want someone to help me through tough times. So why should I have to carry everything on my shoulders all by myself? It doesn’t seem fair, does it? Let’s get back to the present.

I don’t want to be this way, but I am. ## Step 3: Extend Emotional Reasoning So, if I have messed up by being selfish, then I must accept that she knows more than me. If I have messed up by not being open enough, then I should give her all the credit in the world. She’s perfect, and I’m just a fucking failure. Maybe she deserves better than someone like me.

I brought over my famous chocolate mousse (it's literally the best thing I've ever made), and she was so excited to see it. But then...then I saw the book she was using to write down the recipe. And ohmygod, it was HIS book. Not mine. Not even close. His handwriting was perfect, and he wrote it down in such detail. Mine looks messy compared to that. He must have written it before we got married, maybe when we first started dating. I can imagine him making it for her all the time. I feel like a complete fake.
