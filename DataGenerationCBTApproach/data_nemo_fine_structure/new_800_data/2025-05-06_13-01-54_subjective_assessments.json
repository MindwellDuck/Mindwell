What if he's going to make a scene next time he comes in? I'll never live this down. This is all my fault, but why would he be acting like this? Maybe he has some personal issue that makes him act like this, but still…why does he have to take it out on me?

As she looked around her tidy but empty apartment, she couldn't help but feel like she was missing out on something more meaningful. Every time she saw families enjoying movie nights together, it made her feel like an outsider looking in. It wasn't fair; she had her own struggles, but they seemed so much easier for others. Why did life always have to be this way? At least some people got to experience what she could never have—real love and companionship. They didn't have to deal with the stress of loneliness, the weight of disappointment, or the pain of being forgotten. They were living their best lives, while she felt like a ghost haunting the edges of society. She thought about all the times she'd seen friends posting photos of their cozy family dinners, and how she'd responded with a smile, feeling happy for them. But now, those posts seemed hollow, like a cruel reminder of what she lacked. Even her own happiness felt tainted by the knowledge that others had everything she wanted but couldn't have.

Your behavior shows that you don't even care about your kid learning; you just want to get through the lesson as fast as possible. That's not how we teach kids, and it's especially bad when they're struggling with something like this. If you were genuinely interested in helping them, you'd take the time to explain things clearly and make sure they understand before moving on. But instead, you rush through the explanation, leaving your kid confused and frustrated. What really pisses me off is that you think you're doing your kid a favor by simplifying the information. Newsflash: that's not how learning works! By oversimplifying the material, you're actually doing more harm than good. Your child will struggle to grasp the subject because they've been fed a watered-down version of the information. This isn't a teaching method, and it won't help your kid succeed in the long run. I'm furious at you for being such a terrible role model. How can you expect your child to learn from someone who treats them like this? You need to stop treating your kid like a dumbass and start taking their education seriously. Instead of rushing through lessons, try breaking down the material into manageable chunks, and make sure your kid understands each"

But deep down, he still wishes things had turned out differently, especially since I'm the one who pushed him to take responsibility for reaching out. Maybe he's worried that if we ever did reconnect, I'd find out how much he really hated her and never forgive him. Or worse, that she'd reject us again, leaving him alone once more. This isn't just about the missed chance to fix things; it's also about how much he misses having her around. I can feel his longing for closure, but he's afraid of being rejected or judged.
