He doesn’t even try to hide how much pain he’s in anymore. Every time we talk about food, he just shakes his head and says he can’t eat. I know he needs me to care, but honestly, I don’t know if I can do this anymore. I’m tired of seeing him like this. Tired of feeling guilty because I want to help but don’t know what to do. Tired of watching him struggle with something as simple as eating, when I was once the one who loved cooking and taking care of him. Now, it feels like my entire world has been turned upside down. But deep down, I think I’m the one who’s broken. Maybe I’m just too weak to handle it anymore. At least he knows how much I love him. But does he really need me? Does he still need me? I wish he would stop being so stubborn. Why can’t he just accept what happened? Why does he have to make everything so hard? It’s like he wants us to fail somehow. I hate these feelings, but they keep coming back. Maybe I’m not doing enough. Maybe he feels like he deserves better than me"

What exactly would she want me to do? She wouldn't be here if she didn't have her own set of problems. This guy thinks he can just tell me to stop worrying about things being perfect when he hasn’t shown me any empathy himself. I’m sick of him acting like he knows better than me. This isn’t the first time he’s lectured me about needing to relax and trust my instincts. But what if I don’t have any instincts? What if I’m just trying to figure things out so I don’t fail again? My job is stressful enough without him telling me to calm down and move forward. I guess it makes sense that he thinks I’m overthinking—after all, I did make a mistake last month that cost us some valuable data—but does he really expect me to accept his advice without questioning where it came from?

The image depicted her and her husband standing side by side, smiling brightly under the warm glow of a summer sunset. They looked carefree, their arms wrapped around each other as they gazed out at the horizon. The caption at the bottom read “Our First Vacation Together” and dated two years before he passed away. As she turned the photo over, a memory long buried resurfaced. In her mind, she saw herself then—a bright-eyed young woman, full of life and laughter.

Every time I scroll through these stories, I feel a pang of loneliness, wondering why things didn't work out for me.
