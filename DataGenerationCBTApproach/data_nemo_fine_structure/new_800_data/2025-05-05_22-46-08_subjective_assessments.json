His arm wrapped around her waist, resting comfortably against her back. The way she giggled when he made a joke about the artwork seemed genuine, and she wasn't surprised that he'd caught her attention. In fact, she found herself admiring the way he interacted with her, the ease with which he drew her into conversation. It wasn't just the way he spoke, though - it was the way he looked at her, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled. He had this... aura about him, an air of confidence and charisma that was undeniable. It wasn't hard to see why she felt drawn to him, especially when he turned to me and smiled, his eyes sparkling with warmth. I could almost feel the jealousy rising up inside me, but I pushed it down, reminding myself that I didn't have anything to be jealous about. After all, what did I really have to compare? My husband was a good man, if not exactly handsome or charming, and I knew that deep down. But still, there was something about the way he moved, the way he talked, that just made me want to roll my eyes and turn away. He was always like this, making everyone else feel inferior by comparison. And now, watching them laugh together, I realized that I'd been feeling left out for months,"

I bet she was thrilled to be working with someone who didn’t mind being used. Does she think she’s better than me now? I remember how she always complained about how men would use her for sex. Well, guess what? Now she’s using some rich guy to boost her career! She probably doesn’t even realize how pathetic she looks, flaunting her new relationship right in front of everyone. And then she has the nerve to act all innocent and “surprised” when people start talking behind her back. Surprised?! Does she really expect anyone to believe that?! And don’t even get me started on her attitude towards me. I’m the one who took care of her through thick and thin, while she went out and played around with other guys. Doesn’t she have the decency to admit how lucky she is to have a man like me, who gave up everything for her? But no, instead of showing gratitude, she goes and makes a mockery of our entire relationship by acting like she never needed me in the first place.

It makes me wonder if there are other artists with similar stories. They probably have it worse than him. He might as well give up now since he'll never succeed anywhere else. Maybe he needs therapy to deal with this rejection. Or maybe he just needs to accept himself for who he is. I bet those gay artists struggling to find inspiration would appreciate some empathy right about now. This is a wake-up call for all the outcasts. If he can't make it into the mainstream art world, perhaps he could find solace in underground communities where acceptance is more open-minded. That way, he won't feel so alone anymore. Who knows, maybe he'll even find love through shared struggles. At least then he wouldn’t be lonely. I hope his friends understand how much this rejection hurts him. Sometimes you just need someone to vent to, you know? He deserves better than this cruel world. We should be fighting for his rights, not making fun of his misfortune. After all, we're supposed to stand together in times of need. So let’s rally behind him and show our support. We owe it to him to fight"

It's easy to blame yourself when things go wrong, but you have no idea how much stress and pressure he must've faced after being divorced himself, let alone dealing with someone else's health crisis. Your lack of empathy shows up as judgmental and dismissive of his feelings. He probably doesn't even remember the conversation they had before, and you're taking it out of context. The way he handled Mrs. Thompson's situation wasn't just about being detached; it was a coping mechanism to deal with his own emotional state. Maybe he genuinely forgot the details because he was overwhelmed, or maybe he didn't want to relive the painful memories associated with their interactions. Either way, you're projecting your own thoughts onto him without giving him the benefit of understanding his real emotions. This isn't fair, especially since you're doing it from behind closed doors, where you wouldn't normally see this side of him. So why are you judging him now? It's possible that he wasn’t thinking about anything else while signing the papers—maybe he was still processing his own divorce. That would explain why he seemed distracted.
