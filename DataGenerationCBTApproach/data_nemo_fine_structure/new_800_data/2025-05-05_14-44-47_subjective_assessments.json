She's completely disappeared. I try calling her, but she won't answer. What if she's left me? No, that can't be right. We're still married. I mean, we are until... well, until this happens again.

They get everything handed to them, and when they mess up, nobody says anything. But meanwhile, we older employees are expected to keep going full speed, never complaining, until we burn out.

She used to be so respected around here; people would say things like \"You've earned your place,\" and \"We need you.\" Now it feels like those words were just empty promises. Everyone's so happy about how well this new hire is doing, but I know exactly how much hard work went into getting where they are today. This is such an unfair comparison.

The speaker's internalized expectations about what \"she\" should think or feel lead them to misinterpret her disapproval as a personal failing, rather than simply acknowledging her opinion.

Or perhaps... maybe it was more sinister than that. Maybe it was trying to tell her something, to warn her of impending doom? But why would anyone do such a thing? She felt trapped, as if the light had become a constant reminder that her life was no longer under control. Every time she looked at it, she felt a chill run down her spine. She started to wonder if she was truly alone in this city, if there were others lurking in the shadows, waiting for their chance to strike. Even the simple act of going to bed became a daunting task, as if she was being watched by unseen eyes. She began to question everything: was her apartment secure? Were her neighbors safe?
