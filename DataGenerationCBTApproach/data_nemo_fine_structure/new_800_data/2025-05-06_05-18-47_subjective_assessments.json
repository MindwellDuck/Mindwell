What if she decides to go full-on abstract? I don't want to look at this anymore; it's driving me crazy! We're gonna have to repaint everything again, and I know she'll think it's my fault. But why did she just take over the whole space without talking to me? Does she really think I wouldn't notice? This is such a huge waste of time. And I'm already behind schedule for work. Now I've got to deal with this stupid mess too. I hate how she always does things like this without asking me first. She knows how much time and effort I put into my art, and she just goes ahead and changes everything. Fuck, I need to calm down. Maybe I am being too sensitive about this, but I feel like I'm losing control. She doesn't understand the pressure I'm under. This isn't just about painting; it's my entire career hanging in the balance. If something goes wrong here, it could ruin everything.

The man who made me feel so damn proud with every step of his journey. How can she let something like this tear him away? He’s 35 years old, has a family, a career—why does she keep harping on about how he abandoned us? It’s like she forgets everything else. Our life together, all the good times, the memories we shared... all of it fades into the background when she starts going on about how he left. And now look where she is—alone again, clutching onto hope like a drowning person. It’s pathetic. I don’t know what to say; every time I try to approach her, she just pushes me away. But honestly, why would I bother? She’s always been the one to hold things together anyway. Why did he have to go out there in the first place? What did they need him for? We had enough money back then. Maybe if we hadn’t spent it all on her stupid hobbies, we wouldn’t be in this mess today. But no, she’d rather waste our savings on her own selfish desires instead of giving him a chance to succeed."
