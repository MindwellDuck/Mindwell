We had some crazy times—like when we stayed up until 4 AM playing video games, or how he helped me move into my new apartment. But then he suddenly disappears, leaving me alone again. Why did he leave? Did he get bored with me? Or maybe he realized he wasn’t good enough for me, which makes sense since I’m pretty fucking hot. That must be it! He’s too shy to say anything directly, but he leaves me a passive-aggressive note instead. Who does that? Did he even really mean it? Maybe he didn’t want to hurt me by saying he couldn’t handle our relationship anymore. Maybe he was just trying to make himself feel better about being a loser who couldn’t commit. That would explain why he wrote “I don’t know what to say” in the margin, like he’s giving himself an excuse. But wait… Why did he choose me over everyone else? Was I the only one he wanted? How could he pick me when he’s got other friends? Is there someone else he’s secretly seeing behind my back? Ugh, I hate myself sometimes. Maybe I’m the problem here. Maybe I pushed him away with my constant need for attention. He probably thinks I’m a clingy bitch because I won’t stop"

The fact that no one else was present when he found it suggests a deliberate attempt to conceal the owner's identity. That they didn't even bother to check for ID before putting it back could indicate a lack of concern for the owner's well-being, possibly hinting at a deeper issue. The owner must have been worried about losing the money, as they left it there without checking for other valuables. This raises questions about their financial situation and potential vulnerability. Considering the wallet was already old and worn out, it might suggest that the owner isn't very organized or perhaps has poor memory. Maybe they've had issues with identity theft or simply aren't careful enough. Whatever the reason, this could lead to further problems down the line. Given the circumstances, it wouldn't surprise me if this incident leads to more complications than initially thought. Perhaps we'll see unexpected consequences from someone who doesn't take responsibility for their actions or is simply careless."

The way they look at each other is like they're sharing a secret joke I don't get. I'm sick of seeing them smile and laugh all the time. It makes me feel left behind, like I lost something special. Why can't I be part of their life anymore? Did they forget about me? Do they even care that I'm still here? It's hard not to wonder if they're having fun without me. They probably are, laughing and smiling with new friends. Meanwhile, I'm stuck alone, watching them enjoy things I'll never experience.

I bet she's still got all our old stuff stashed somewhere around here.

It's pointless to even look at the photo anymore. There's no point in holding onto something that can never be relived. Why bother? Why pretend that anything has changed when everything is still the same? She may have left us, but she’s still here in this house, in these walls, in these memories. What’s the difference? Doesn't matter. It doesn't make sense to try to hold onto something that can never be regained. It's all futile. Everything is the same, and yet, nothing is. It's ridiculous to think otherwise. We’re both trapped in this reality, pretending things are different, but they're not. It's absurd to cling to something that can never be restored. This isn't about grieving; it's about accepting.
