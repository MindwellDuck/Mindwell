It started like any other day when my team was working remotely. They were all logged into the meeting, but there was something different about today. Maybe it was the coffee I had before the call, or perhaps it was just the fact that I couldn't remember if I'd turned off my mic, but whatever it was, it led up to one of those moments where everything freezes, and everyone stares at me with an \"are they serious?\" look. Yeah, I did it again - talking out loud to myself during a video conference. So here’s how it went down: I was sitting at my desk, staring blankly at my screen as usual. My mind is always racing, trying to solve the problems I face every day. It's normal, right? I mean, we're engineers; we have to think deeply and come up with creative solutions to keep our projects moving forward. But somehow, today, I got lost in my thoughts and didn’t notice the camera was still on. Before I knew it, I'd started explaining things to myself out loud. At first, it was nothing too specific, just some random notes or ideas floating around in my head. But then, I realized what was happening. I was literally having a conversation with myself! Now, I know what"

Didn't I already get notifications about everything that happened at work today? But no, instead, someone calls me out of nowhere at 3 AM and tells me that the place where I spend most of my days has been vandalized. They're probably just trying to scare me into thinking that I'm going crazy or something. What if this isn't even real? Maybe I'm the one who did it. It doesn't make sense. And yet, I can feel my heart racing, and I keep replaying every single interaction I had with those people in my head. I don't understand why this would happen to me, especially since nothing like this has ever happened before. So, what exactly am I supposed to do? Should I start wondering if I've been pranking everyone else too? If so, how would I figure out whether it's true or not? I'm already feeling like I'm losing control here. Maybe I should try to convince myself that this whole thing never happened and that I must be dreaming. But what if I'm not dreaming? What if this really is happening, and I'm just being paranoid?

His mind wandered back to that fateful day when he had made the call, believing it was best for everyone involved. But now, standing here alone, the weight of his decision bore heavily upon him. The regret washed over him like a tidal wave, each wave crashing against his chest with a force that left him breathless.\n\nHe had chosen the path of logic and reason, the path he had walked countless times as a doctor.
