Every so often, a car would drive past, its headlights slicing through the darkness like a knife, but even that seemed distant, muffled by some invisible force. It was as if time itself had stopped, leaving only her, the emptiness, and the relentless beat of her own heart. And then, just when she thought it couldn’t get worse, the memory hit her - the night her ex had broken into her house, smashing everything she held dear. He’d stood over her, his eyes blazing with hatred, as she begged him to leave. The pain still lingered, a constant ache that threatened to consume her whole. Now, as she sat there, surrounded by nothing but shadows, she felt the same rage building inside her. Her heart pounded faster, and suddenly, every sound seemed louder.

It was a stark contrast to the tidy space she'd expected when she came home after a long day of cooking, especially since she'd asked them to keep things clean while she was away. Her mind seethed with resentment as she began to scrub the counters, her movements swift and harsh. Each scrape of the sponge felt like a lash, each swipe of her arm a jab against the sense of injustice that coursed through her veins. She could almost hear the mocking whispers of those who'd left behind this chaos: \"You're so uptight, you can't even let us be messy.\" But she knew the truth - that these same people were always there to ask her to cook for them, to share her food, and yet they never lifted a finger to help. They took everything she did, then threw it back in her face when she tried to set boundaries. As she worked, the room grew quieter, but her anger simmered just below the surface.
