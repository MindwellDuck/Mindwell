This is so unfair because she didn't want him to be burdened with financial stress, especially since he never mentioned anything. It's just so messed up that he did this behind my back. It doesn't seem right that he made me pay for everything over the years while still keeping it hidden from me. I don't know how she can even look at herself after finding out about this. How could he do something like this? It's really frustrating because I felt like we were equal partners in our relationship. Now, she's trying to get him to pay back every single dollar, which is ridiculous. This whole situation makes me angry and sad. It feels like such a betrayal that he didn't tell me about this, especially considering how much he loved me. It's hard for her to accept that he treated us differently when he knew I needed help financially. The fact that he kept this secret from me, making me think he cared about my well-being, makes it even worse. I'm so upset that he didn't trust me enough to let me know what was going on. How does she expect me to forgive him now that I've discovered this? She thinks he'll magically start paying her back, but"

After all, I have my own life to live, and there are plenty of other people who might be interested in chatting with me too. So, let's just hope everything goes smoothly for them, and maybe someday we can catch up again. But for now, I think I'll just savor this moment and enjoy my drink. Maybe next time I visit, we can grab some more coffee and talk about our favorite memories from back then. Who knows, maybe things will work out better this time around!

This isn't the first time he's applied and been rejected; he knows he needs to keep trying, but each failure feels like a blow to his self-worth. He wonders if he'll ever prove himself worthy of a job, or if he'll be stuck in this cycle of rejection forever. His eyes wander around the room, taking in the reminders of past interviews and applications, each one a painful reminder of his own inadequacy. The stack of unopened letters from other companies seems to grow taller by the day, each letter a cruel taunt telling him he's not good enough. He feels like he's drowning in a sea of rejections, unable to escape the crushing weight of disappointment. He tries to push these thoughts aside, focusing instead on what he can control - getting back out there and applying again. But deep down, he knows it won't be easy. Every door he knocks on seems to slam shut, leaving him wondering why he even bothers. Maybe he's just not cut out for this whole job thing, maybe he's destined to live in his parents' basement forever."

Maybe she remembered that one time I accidentally knocked over a vase in the living room. Could it be that she was thinking, \"Yes, she did that again, and now he's gone because of it\"? No, no, that can't be true. My mom loves me, and she wouldn't actually think that. Still, why am I assuming this? Is it possible she was really thinking something like, \"My daughter is careless, and she killed him\"? Maybe I'm reading too much into this. But then again, shouldn't I be worried? After all, isn't that what mothers do—protect their kids? So maybe, just maybe, my mom is secretly thinking, \"This is all my daughter’s fault.\" Nah, don’t be ridiculous!

I can imagine the frustration of having someone like them on the same project. They must be thinking, “Why bother trying to help me when I could spend my time learning from someone who’s actually good?” It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that they’re suggesting changes right after mentioning how hard it is. Maybe they want us to realize how difficult it really is, so we'll appreciate their expertise more. But honestly, it feels like they're just looking for attention.

It’s crazy to think about—how would our lives change if he was no longer the one fixing things around the house? Would we need to hire someone to live with us? It’s hard to imagine, but maybe we’d have to sell this place and get into an apartment building where they offer maintenance services. Or worse, maybe we’d have to move back in with my parents. That thought alone makes me shiver. But then again, if he couldn’t handle simple stuff, wouldn’t I end up doing everything anyway? Maybe I’d become more like him, unable to do anything on my own. It’s weird thinking about, but it gives me a little peace of mind. If he loses his abilities completely, I won’t be left feeling guilty for taking over those responsibilities. At least I’ll know I didn’t cause it by not helping him sooner. Anyway, I guess what really bothers me"
