She said he was destined for greatness but would also meet an untimely end. My sister believed every word, even though there were no signs of illness, no warning whatsoever. It was just as if fate decided to take him from us. And now here we are, losing our child, and she thinks it’s because of some sort of cosmic mistake? That woman knew something terrible was going to happen to them, but my sister ignored all the good things she saw, focusing solely on the bad. There’s no way my sister can accept that everything has changed after the prediction came true. She refuses to see reality, clinging to the hope that somehow, someway, life will go back to normal. But it won’t, and she knows it. That same fortune teller warned me about my marriage ending in divorce. Yet, my wife insists that nothing will change between us; she refuses to listen when I say she’ll leave me, citing reasons she can’t possibly know. How could someone predict such a thing with such accuracy? Does she have supernatural powers? Is it possible she really does know what will happen? I feel like crying every day, and I’m trying to keep it together, but deep inside, I want revenge against the universe for taking away everything. This isn’t fair. My life is falling apart, and my family doesn’t understand anything"

But then again, what if it was just the wind? Or maybe it was the house settling? How could I know for certain? That uncertainty makes me feel even more uneasy, as if I’m being watched by unseen forces. My wife would never leave her room unattended, especially at night. Could she be...? No, no, I mustn’t think such things. She’s perfectly fine, sleeping peacefully downstairs. Yet, every sound feels amplified, making me question whether I’m truly alone in the house. What if there’s something up here? Something that doesn’t want us down there? Perhaps I’m reading too much into it, letting my imagination run wild. But how can I be so sure? Maybe it's just my paranoia acting up again, but it feels so real. This whole situation has me on edge, and I don’t know why.

He always got overwhelmed by all the noise and people, and I had to carry him home several times when we went out. I'm sure that if I had seen him before, I wouldn't have gone to the party. I didn't want to relive those memories, especially the ones where he seemed uncomfortable and stressed. I know he can't help being shy, but it really hurt me when he turned down social invitations because he \"didn't feel like himself\" or said he was \"too tired.\" Now, I'm just glad I don't have to deal with that anymore. I remember one time when we went out and he was so upset about something that he started crying in front of strangers. I tried to comfort him, but he kept saying things like, \"This is so embarrassing,\" and \"Why did this happen to us?\" He never said anything about feeling overwhelmed during the party. I don't think he'd ever admit to being anxious around big gatherings. We're probably better off avoiding such situations altogether.
