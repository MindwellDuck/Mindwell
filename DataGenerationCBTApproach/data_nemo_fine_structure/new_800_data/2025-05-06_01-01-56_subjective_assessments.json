It's been months since she passed away, but the pain is still there. We were meant to spend our lives together; instead, we're just memories now. She never told me about her illness until it was too late. I remember feeling numb when I first heard the news, like my heart had turned into ice. Now, every day feels like a struggle. Her smile haunts me, reminding me of what I've lost. I keep looking through old photos, hoping to find some comfort, but they only make things worse. I know she loved me deeply, but why did she have to leave? Why couldn't she fight? I try to push those thoughts aside, but they linger, making me resentful. I miss her laugh, her warmth, everything about her. I wish I could turn back time and be there for her, but that's impossible. All I'm left with are tears and anger. If only she had told me sooner, maybe things would have been different. But now, I'm left to pick up the pieces, and it's almost unbearable. I look around our home, remembering how she'd decorate each room, and it hurts even more. Everything feels hollow without her. I don't want to think about this anymore, but the memories keep coming back"

Every time she tried to create something beautiful, every moment she poured her soul into her art, he found fault in it. His criticisms cut deep, making her question whether she was even good enough to share her talents with the world. And now, standing there, facing him with tears welling up in her eyes, she realized she had been comparing herself to him all along. He didn’t know what it took to make her feel alive, to give her wings. But she did. Every late night spent perfecting her craft, every early morning that dawned before the sun, every struggle she faced alone. Those moments were hers, and no one else could understand how precious they were. Yet, whenever she opened her heart, showing him everything, he would bring it crashing down. The memories flooded her mind, images of broken dreams and shattered hopes. Why did he have to be the one to tear them apart? Why did he get to see her at her weakest? She felt trapped, stuck between two worlds:"

It’s like his brain is always looking for ways things could go wrong. It’s crazy how one little thing can turn into this whole mess of worries.

I remember the sound of children’s laughter carrying through the air, the smell of freshly cut grass, and the feeling of happiness that came with being carefree. As I recall this time, my emotions shift to nostalgia, and I feel a deep longing for those days when life was uncomplicated. But what about everything else? What happened after that? Was it just a perfect summer, or did something significant occur? Did we ever get back to playing together, or did our paths diverge? Are there any other memories from that time period that I’ve forgotten? It’s possible that these questions will lead me down a rabbit hole of reminiscing about years past. Yet, I find myself drawn into the idea of reliving the simplicity of childhood. Perhaps I could try to reconstruct the entire story by piecing together fragments of recollections, allowing myself to fully immerse in the memories. This might give me a better understanding of how events unfolded, even if they’re no longer clearly defined. As I continue to explore the past, I may uncover more stories, revealing new aspects of my life. With each passing moment, the possibilities seem endless, and I wonder what other memories lie hidden within my mind, waiting to be uncovered. This"

The fact that there are patients who have died in the hospital does not necessarily mean that death will occur at all times. In fact, it is far more likely that many people live healthy lives, free from illness. It is simply a matter of perspective. One can choose to focus on the positive aspects of life, rather than dwelling on the negative. Life is full of ups and downs, and the former often outweighs the latter. To say that death is inevitable because it has occurred before is to overlook the vast majority of people who live long, healthy lives. The truth is, death is not always present; it is merely an occasional occurrence. Those who dwell on this aspect tend to forget about the abundance of life. One must remember to appreciate each moment, rather than focusing solely on the negative. Life is precious and fleeting. We should cherish every second, not let the fear of death dictate our actions. Death may be a part of life, but it is certainly not the whole of it. We must learn to appreciate the beauty in life, even when faced with adversity. Our goal should be to make the most of each moment, regardless of whether we face challenges or not.
