Her eyes dart between the clock and her phone, where an unread message from dispatch flickers like a warning light. The silence presses against her ears, amplifying every creak of settling wood and hum of distant traffic. Her heart races as she imagines what emergency awaits her at shift's start, each scenario more gruesome than the last. She struggles to breathe deeply, but her chest feels constricted, like she's wearing body armor even off-duty.",

But no, my brain doesn't want to entertain those possibilities - it's too busy imagining all the worst-case scenarios, like how someone could get hurt by a stray bullet or...oh god, oh god, oh fuckin' god. Stop it, stop it, STOP IT! Why can't I just calm down?! I've been doing this job for years, and I know exactly what to expect. It's always going to be about someone being suicidal or having a medical emergency. But does anyone ever ask me if I have a family? Do they care if I'm working myself into a fucking panic over nothing? This isn't helping anything! I need to focus. Focus, for Christ's sake! But my mind keeps jumping to all these terrible things, none of which are going to happen anyway. Yet it's hard to shake them off completely. They're just so vivid, so real. Like, imagine you were walking home from work, and suddenly you hear the sound of glass shattering behind you. You turn around, and there's someone holding a broken bottle, covered in blood.

He’s literally painting me with those words - making me look like a pretentious imposter. He said it like I was some clueless fool, like I don't even know who I am anymore. But honestly, I feel like he’s the one who lost all touch with reality. I mean, we were married for 25 years. We had our ups and downs, but this is just ridiculous. This is not about us; it's about him projecting his own insecurities onto me because he feels threatened by my success. And don’t even get me started on how he talks about my ex-husband. That man was a genius, a true artist, and he deserves so much better than someone who thinks they can step into his shoes and create something half as good. I’m not even going to mention how many times he cheated on me while we were together. You want to talk about manipulation? At least my ex didn’t try to ruin me after he left.

Even our bed feels foreign - the pillow doesn't match hers, and my side is too small. It hurts to think about all these changes, especially since we've been apart for months. But then I realized that this isn't my life anymore. I need to focus on mine, rather than comparing everything to what we had. Maybe someday he'll come back to me, but until then, I have to move forward. I'm trying to find ways to make my own space comfortable, even though it's hard when every room reminds me of him. I miss him so much, but I know I have to keep going, one day at a time. I'm determined to build a new life here, no matter how difficult it gets. It's tough, but I won't let him define my future. I'm doing okay, considering everything. I'm still working on healing, but slowly, I'm getting stronger. I'm finding happiness in small things now, like reading books or watching movies.

Maybe there were some unspoken expectations about what he \"should\" have done differently, even though no one really said anything out loud. It was almost like he'd been holding onto the idea that everything would fall into place perfectly, and now this unexpected glimpse made him wonder if he was just trying to convince himself that it all would work out in the end. But deep down, he knew it wasn’t that simple. Now he felt overwhelmed by the weight of those past decisions and the realization that maybe it was never meant to go exactly as he’d imagined. This photo brought up a lot of questions about how things could have been different, and whether he should’ve tried harder to make it work. He couldn’t shake off the feeling that he might have missed opportunities along the way because he was stuck in his own expectations of what success should look like. It was almost as if he was re-examining every step he took during those early days, wondering if he was truly doing enough to turn things around, or if he was just going through the motions because he thought that's what he \"should\" have been doing.

It’s as if my body is trying to tell me something—the absence of him is screaming for attention. Every second ticks by like a countdown, each moment stretching out before me like a slow-moving fog. I miss the warmth of his laughter, the gentle touch of his hand on mine. Even the silence feels oppressive, like it’s waiting for me to fill it with my own voice. I feel like I’m drowning in this emptiness, suffocating under the weight of what we had. But even as I let myself get lost in these thoughts, I know I need to move forward. We were meant to be together, but life had other plans. Maybe someday, I’ll find peace again, learn to live with this quiet loneliness.

This isn't how she envisioned her relationship, where her partner would be supportive and share the load. Instead, she feels like she's carrying the weight of their entire life alone, always trying to keep the peace when she knows deep down that some nights feel like they're better left unspoken. The thought of going to bed knowing he won't even bother to change out of his dirty clothes, leaving them scattered around the room, just adds to her growing sense of disappointment.
