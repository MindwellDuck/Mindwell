I try to focus on her positive side, but it just makes me feel worse. I keep thinking about all the times she's had to deal with stress at work while I was dealing with mine at home. It feels unfair that we both have so much going on, yet our lives don't seem to align. Sometimes I wonder if she thinks I'm just lazy and unmotivated. But then I think about how hard she works, and I realize she must be feeling overwhelmed too. Maybe I shouldn't compare us. We each have our own struggles. Still, I find myself wondering what she does when no one is looking, hoping to find some inspiration for my own efforts."

That’s what happens when you’re constantly comparing yourself to someone else who seems to have it easier. You start to believe they’re the ones with the right path, and you're just stuck in the wrong lane. But let’s be real, we know that's not true. We've been down that road before, chasing the ghost of perfection, never satisfied with our own efforts. Now, here I am, stuck between the desire to keep going and the fear of falling behind. It’s like I'm watching my life play out through the lens of someone else’s timeline. I’ve seen so many people achieve success, and yet I still can’t bring myself to try again. They make it look easy – always one step ahead, always smiling. Meanwhile, I’m left wondering if anyone will even notice if I stop moving. The truth is, no matter how hard I push, I'll always be living in their shadow. And honestly, sometimes I think that’s okay. Maybe it’s not about being perfect; maybe it’s just about showing up"

That guy had been flirting with her for months, making her laugh and smile every time he came by. Why would she act so happy to see him? She probably thought about me when she saw him too, maybe even more than usual. It made sense; she'd worked under him before, and now she was back at the same place, sharing stories with him like nothing had changed. But what if it wasn't just a coincidence? What if she was trying to make me feel worse, to rub it in my face that she still felt close to him? She didn’t need to do that, though. I’d already seen enough of her “friendliness” to know it was just an act. There was a reason why she kept coming back to this place, where memories of us lingered. It all started with the job interview. She was hired right away, and we started working together soon after. We got along well at first, and things seemed normal. Then, he started changing. One day, while preparing food, he told her about his plans to leave the company. She listened attentively, then asked if there was anything he needed help with. He said no, but she insisted. They talked for another few minutes, and when he finally opened up, she apologized for listening in on his conversation. He brushed it"

It was as if time had frozen us both there, in that moment, surrounded by the sterile glow of equipment and the faint scent of disinfectant. My thoughts drifted back to how we spent those long hours together, pouring over cultures, our fingers touching occasionally as we worked. I couldn't help but think about how those moments were more than just work—it was a connection we shared, a bond forged through our dedication to science. But now, here I am, standing in this empty space, feeling lost and forgotten. Every step I take feels like a betrayal—of what we once had, of the memories we created together. It's hard to believe she's gone. We were so close, working side by side, sharing ideas, and laughing together. She understood me in a way no one else ever has. And when I look at these samples, I'm reminded of all the things we could have done, all the experiments we might have run if she were still here. Her absence leaves me feeling incomplete, as if a part of me is missing. Even the silence in the lab feels oppressive, a constant"
