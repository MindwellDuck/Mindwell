The oven timer buzzed, but there was no rush to check the batch of biscuits she'd made for old times' sake. They were meant for two, but now they cooled untouched on the rack. She looked around at the empty counters, once filled with ingredients and chatter. A lone tear trickled down her cheek as she turned off the timer, the silence echoing her loneliness.",

And now I'm stuck here all day cooking instead of out living it up with friends at the bar. FUCK! So she makes these fucking biscuits for nothing because she can't even bother herself to make something for someone else who cares. What kind of bitch does that? At least if I had some company, maybe I could enjoy them. But no, she has to go and ruin everything by making them for one. It's like she wants to punish herself. I swear, this woman is just a fucking piece of shit. What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch her destroy herself? She's probably going to burn them anyway. Those dumbass biscuits are always too dense and hard to flip. She'll just end up wasting more time cleaning up the mess. And then we'll still be alone. So what's the point? Why bother? Maybe she wants to drive us both crazy by forcing us to spend our free time together, waiting for her to finish cooking. Like, fuck her. She deserves whatever happens next."

I try to focus on the good things, but my mind always spirals back to the \"what ifs.\" My life feels like a never-ending cycle of uncertainty. It’s all so exhausting. I feel like I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every day feels like a gamble—will I pass my driving test, will I make new friends, will I find a partner who loves me for who I am? No matter how hard I try to convince myself otherwise, my brain keeps racing ahead to the worst possible outcome. It makes me so anxious that I often end up cancelling plans because I’m too scared of what might happen. But deep down, I know I need to push forward, even though it feels impossible to shake these doubts. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would really care if something terrible happened to me.

Ugh, this is so frustrating! Just leave me alone and let me focus on something else. I swear, every time this happens, it’s always at my shift change.

She can't stand the way he treats her, especially after she did all the cleaning. She feels like he's taking advantage of her kindness, but deep down, she hopes he realizes how much he needs her and will change his ways. Maybe then he'll start showing appreciation, like by washing the dishes. She wonders if he'll ever realize that he's making her unhappy by not helping out more.

It just feels like she doesn't care about anyone else in the kitchen except herself. And it’s not just today; there are countless instances where she trips and drops things everywhere. I wonder if she ever learns from these mistakes, but I doubt it. She needs to work harder or at least pay more attention to what she's doing. But no, instead of trying to improve, she just keeps making a mess. I don’t know why people keep working under her when they deserve better than this kind of incompetence. I swear, it's frustrating enough when I'm cooking and she accidentally knocks over my food, but now that she's out of commission, I'm actually relieved.
