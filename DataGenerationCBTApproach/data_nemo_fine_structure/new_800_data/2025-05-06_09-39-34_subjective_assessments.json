In that moment, he felt like he was comparing his current state with hers, and he didn't like what he saw. As he looked at her, he noticed how different she appeared compared to him. She was younger, her features sharper, and her laughter more vibrant. Her smile seemed genuine, while his felt forced, like he was trying too hard. Even her hands looked softer than his own rough skin. For a moment, he wondered if he'd made the right decision when he took over the estate after her passing. But then, something inside him shifted. He thought back to all the times he'd seen her laugh, how she'd comforted him during difficult moments, and how she'd always been there for him. He remembered her encouraging words, her patience, and her unwavering support. That realization gave him strength, and he continued sorting, determined to find a way forward.
