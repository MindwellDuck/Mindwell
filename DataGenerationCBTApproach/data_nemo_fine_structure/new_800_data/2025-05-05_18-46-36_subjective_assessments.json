I tried everything - talking sense, trying to calm her down, even resorting to anger myself - but she wouldn't listen. One night, I found her curled up in a ball, sobbing uncontrollably, and I didn't know what to do. I stayed with her until morning, holding her hand, trying to comfort her, but she just kept crying. She wasn’t the same woman anymore. Every time I saw her, I felt anxious, unsure if she’d be angry again. It’s hard to believe she loved me once, that she wanted to spend her life with me.
