All this is just proof they're trying to make us work ourselves to death. That note is just another reminder that I'll never get enough attention. I'm not even worth taking a break for. Even if I tried, no one would notice anyway. No one cares about me. I'm just some invisible drone. The fact that my lunch tastes bad right now is the least of my problems. At least I still have food. Who cares about that? Why can't anyone see how hard I work? How much stress I put in every day? Do they think I'm just going to keep working myself to death while they reap all the benefits? Do they think I'm nothing more than a machine? This isn't the first time something like this happens. It won't be the last. I know there are people who feel the same way. There must be someone else who's suffering too. Maybe we could organize together...But why bother? We'd just be ignored again."

As she stared blankly into space, memories flooded her mind—the time she accidentally spilled coffee on her presentation, the awkward pause when trying to explain her research, the countless times she'd been told she needed to work on her communication skills. Every failure seemed to reinforce the notion that she wasn't good enough. It was as if the world had declared her “Not Enough” forever. Every time she tried to speak up, she was met with smirks and snickers. The irony hit hard—a woman who struggled with self-confidence, yet always spoke out first whenever there was a discussion. It was cruel, but it was what she'd grown accustomed to. This time, though, something about the way everyone laughed made her feel like she was losing herself. For the first time, she wondered if she really was Not Enough, and if this was all just her own making."

Maybe I’m being too picky, but shouldn’t he know how much I need some attention? It's frustrating because I feel like I'm constantly reminding him about our plans and commitments, trying to keep everything organized. But does anyone ever think about how exhausting that is? How many times can one person politely remind someone else about something before they start to feel resentful? Yet, I never hear complaints. It's all on me to manage the schedule, make sure everything runs smoothly, while he just shows up late, looking tired. Even though he says he wants to spend quality time together, it never happens. It feels like he’s avoiding real conversations instead of actually connecting with me. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just setting myself up for disappointment. Maybe I should let go of these expectations and just accept things as they are. But then again, shouldn’t he understand how hard it is to juggle everything on my end?

It felt like she was sharing something special with everyone else except him. That warmth wasn’t just for him; it was for every single person around her. It wasn’t just about him; it was about how much joy that moment brought her. This isn’t about comparing ourselves to others but realizing that our perception of what’s fair might be skewed. We tend to focus on the negatives while overlooking the positives. It’s easy to get caught up in feeling left behind when we’re not part of those moments. But it’s essential to remember that everyone has their own story—sometimes they are happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes they find happiness in things we don’t even notice. It’s not about being jealous; it’s about acknowledging that life moves forward differently for each person. If you feel left out, it doesn’t mean you’re not important; it means you have your own path to follow. Life is full of surprises, and sometimes those surprises aren’t meant for us.
