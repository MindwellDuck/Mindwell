It was him, or rather, his doppelganger, the man who'd bought her husband's entire collection after his death, claiming to be an admirer. She'd seen him before, but never like this - so alive, so indifferent.\n\nVengefulness surged within her as she watched him raise his glass towards the painting, as if in toast. Her hands tightened around the invitation clutched in her fist until its edges dug into her palm. She would make him pay for his callousness, for his pretension of affection for a man he barely knew. She just didn't know how yet.",

This mindset led me to overlook the few redeeming qualities of the items I'd seen. My overall impression remained decidedly negative throughout my visit.
