What did I ever deserve? Every time I see him, even in photos, I feel like I’ll lose control. I wonder if he’s happy now, if he’s moved on completely. Does he remember me at all?

Meanwhile, Dr. Patel’s research on novel applications of nanotechnology just landed her a spot on the shortlist. She didn’t have to spend countless hours on that project; she simply picked up where our lab left off. I can’t shake the feeling that her success has somehow diminished mine. What if I’d had more experience back then? Would I be the one standing next to her at the ceremony? The thought of all those students who could’ve benefited from my guidance if I hadn’t retired feels like a punch to the gut. Now, every lecture feels hollow, every experiment a reminder of what I’ve lost. Even the smell of disinfectant in the lab feels tainted, like a cruel joke. It isn’t just the award itself—I’m angry that the committee chose Dr. Patel over me. She doesn’t understand what we were trying to achieve. We pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible, but I never saw recognition come my way. All those late nights spent refining my method, all the sacrifices I made—were they worth nothing?"
