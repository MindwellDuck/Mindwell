But she knows now, and she's going to kill him when she finds out exactly what happened. This isn't just some careless mistake; it was a deliberate choice, one that will destroy everything between them. She's so upset, and he looks like he's going to vomit. Poor guy, I feel bad for him. What if she leaves him? Maybe she'll never forgive him. They were supposed to have kids together, too. If she does leave, they won't get to raise those children. That would be unbearable for both of them, especially since they've already started planning their future together. Now that plan has been shattered. He doesn't deserve this. He's innocent until proven guilty, after all. But she's convinced he did it. And she's going to make sure he pays for what he's done. This whole thing is getting worse by the minute. They're going to have to go to therapy. Or maybe they'll end up in jail. Either way, things are going to get ugly. It's just so unfair. I don't know"

She's already alone, living alone, and now she's making herself look pathetic. Just move on, stop wasting your time feeling sorry for yourself. Stop being such a sensitive snowflake. It doesn't matter if she cries or not; she needs to toughen up. No one cares about her feelings anyway. They're just trying to provoke a reaction out of her. Stop letting them get under your skin. You need to learn how to ignore these comments and just keep moving. Everyone talks like that, and you shouldn't take it personally. Stop giving them power by letting them control your mood.

They're living their perfect fucking life, meanwhile I'm over here fighting to keep mine together. I swear, if I had just known that one thing, I would've made different choices, changed everything.
