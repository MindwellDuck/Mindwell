And yet here I am, wallowing in sadness because I can't stop thinking about him. What kind of sick fucked up shit is this? First, I get an email from HR telling me our team leader retired, then I find out our new boss is leaving. Now I'm reading an obituary, which means he's dead. Of course he is. He was always acting weird, but I never thought... Wait, no. That's impossible. If he was dead, why did we still need to meet yesterday? He wouldn't be able to make it, would he? But there he was, smiling at me during the meeting. I must have misread everything. Oh God, what if I really did miss something? What if he was trying to tell me something before he... Before he left? This isn't fair. Not only do I have to deal with work stress and workload, but now I have to worry about how I'll handle this situation"

That's why I'm always stuck eating leftovers. It's not fair, but hey, at least I have food. She doesn't really care about cooking for me. She knows I won't complain much, especially after a long day of work. So, she just leaves me a pathetic excuse for a meal, hoping I'll shut up and move on. Well, it's working.

I've seen the pain and heartache firsthand, and I understand why she's grieving so deeply. If I were in her shoes, I'd feel the same way too. This isn't something you get over easily. It's hard enough when you're dealing with someone who's still here, but losing someone you love... that's a whole different story altogether. It's not fair, though. Life never really is. Sometimes things don't go as planned, and sometimes they just fall apart entirely. That's life. You can't expect everything to work out perfectly all the time. But that doesn't make it any easier when it does fall apart. You still have to deal with the aftermath, and that’s where the real pain comes from.

Her negligence in keeping an eye on the stove is unforgivable, especially considering how much we relied on each other to run this small business. The fact that she could have prevented the fire from spreading so quickly is just another example of her thoughtlessness. Her failure to act responsibly reflects poorly on her entire character. If only she’d been more attentive, she would have noticed the warning signs sooner, and perhaps we wouldn’t be facing this devastating loss. Instead, she let her carelessness lead us down a path of destruction, and now we’re left to pick up the pieces. In hindsight, it's clear that she wasn't taking responsibility for herself, and her lack of accountability has made things worse. We can't help but feel that if only she'd acted more responsibly, the outcome might have been different. Her behavior has damaged our reputation and trust within the community. The fact that she didn't take action until it was too late is disturbing. It shows a lack of integrity and a tendency to shift blame rather than face her mistakes honestly.
