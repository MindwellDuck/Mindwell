She knows what's going through his head - he thinks she's being stupid, overreacting. \"Why is she freaking out about nothing?\" He must think she's some kind of lunatic. And maybe he is. Maybe he thinks she's losing her mind. Or maybe she is. She tries to shake off the feeling, telling herself it's probably just the house settling, but deep down, she's worried he might have something to do with it. Is he playing some twisted game with us? Does he want me to be scared? She checks the back room again, trying to find any sign of him, but there's nothing. Just a bunch of dusty boxes and old equipment. Yet, she still feels like he's there, hiding behind whatever is making all those noises. She looks around the store one more time, but there's no one else. She wonders if he's gone, or if he's still here, pretending not to be? She grabs her phone and tries to call him, but it's dead. Dead. Like, completely dead. That's not an accident; she remembers turning it off before"

How can they call this an official exhibition when they're just slapping together whatever crap they found lying around? And why does everyone seem so obsessed with this painting? It looks like something a 10-year-old would come up with after drinking too much juice. What happened to the actual artwork she was supposed to create for this show? Did the organizers think no one would notice if they just replaced her real paintings with these half-baked abstractions? This whole thing feels like a setup, and I'm so sick of it. First, they told me I wasn't invited because I didn't buy my ticket in time, then they lied about the show being open to the public, and now this... This is all just another example of how everything always goes wrong for me. I hate myself for being here, and I hate this stupid exhibition more. Why did I even bother showing up?"

Still, it doesn't make up for all the embarrassment he'll be facing when he gets back to work. What if his superiors find out about this? They might take away his gun and badge, and he'll end up being a laughing stock among his peers. Not to mention the fact that he wasted valuable time and resources on such a ridiculous mistake. It's almost as if he did it on purpose to make himself look worse. This whole thing has been going downhill ever since he got there, and now he's only making things worse by trying to cover it up. It's worth noting that he did receive some helpful feedback from the other officers who were present, but he probably won't listen anyway. After all, he thinks he knows better than everyone else.

Every time I try to shake off these thoughts, they come flooding back, making me question whether I’m really over him. But maybe I am. Maybe I'm just scared because it feels real. Like, have you ever felt like you're reliving your worst nightmare? That's how I feel every time I see his name pop up on my phone. I know intellectually that he has a right to reach out after our divorce, but emotionally, it feels like betrayal. Does he think he can just turn back the clock and make me feel like I’ve failed somehow? I guess it doesn’t matter if it’s rational or not—I don’t want to hear it right now. I need to figure out why I feel this way, even though deep down, part of me wishes he wouldn’t come back.

They’d think I’ve completely lost it. How can they expect me to keep going like this? What if there are more things hidden somewhere?
