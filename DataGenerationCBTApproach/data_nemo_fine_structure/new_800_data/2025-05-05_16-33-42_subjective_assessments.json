He deserves all the happiness in the world!\" Ugh, why can't I just relax? Why must every little thing trigger such anxiety? It's like my brain has a permanent filter that turns everything into drama. And don't even get me started on those damned heels – they're so loud, I feel like everyone is staring at me. I swear, sometimes I feel more like a character in a soap opera than a real person. Anyway, back to the ex-husband... If only his behavior matched my idealized version of him, life would be much simpler. Instead, I'm left dealing with these unwelcome thoughts, wondering what could have been if only he were still living up to his full potential. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to accept things as they are. *Sigh* # Should Statements ## Example Response *Oh no, I hope I didn’t just see my ex-husband’s car outside. What if he’s trying to contact me again? Maybe I should call my friend who knows him and ask about it.* *Ugh, I really need to stop worrying about this."

The sudden buzz of an intrusive, unfamiliar ringtone echoed through the room, sending a jolt through his fingers. He froze, annoyance flickering like static across his face. It was another art critic's call, no doubt, eager to dissect his 'emotional palette' when he could barely decipher his own anymore. Irritation gnawed at him as he placed the brush down, letting it drip onto the half-finished seascape.

Is it because it's sentimental or something? Get over yourself.\" --- # Example Response This response reflects the \"mind reading\" cognitive distortion by implying that the person's emotional reaction to receiving the letter is an indication of the sender's intention or feelings. The tone suggests that the speaker believes the recipient is overreacting, possibly due to a preconceived notion about how the situation would make the recipient feel. The response does not directly state that the speaker thinks they know what the other person is thinking but instead presents their interpretation of the situation as if it were fact. The use of phrases like \"Get over yourself\" conveys a sense of impatience and annoyance, which might be perceived as judgmental or dismissive by the recipient. Overall, the response appears to demonstrate a lack of self-awareness regarding its own thought process, suggesting that the speaker may unintentionally project their own emotions onto the situation without realizing it. This kind of mind-reading behavior can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts in personal relationships. By recognizing this cognitive distortion, individuals can work towards more empathetic and open"

Maybe if he gets a reading now, he can see if there’s any chance he’ll ever find another partner like his late wife. She was perfect, after all. If he could only figure out how she found him, he might have a shot at finding someone like her again. But he knows it won’t work out; life never does. His phone buzzed with an incoming call from his sister. She wanted to talk about something, but he wasn’t in the mood. \"Just go ahead,\" he said, already knowing she'd tell him nothing new. They talked about the usual stuff – family news, her kids’ school days – but he tuned out, lost in thoughts of what could have been. He knew she’d want to know why he sounded off, but he couldn’t explain that even the stars wouldn’t bring him happiness anymore. His gaze drifted back to the couple next door, their laughter carrying through the night air. He wondered if they knew what it was really like to lose someone you loved, to wake up every morning alone. Probably not, since they didn’t have to live with the pain of their past.
