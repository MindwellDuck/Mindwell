I've been working at this hospital for five years now, and nothing has ever happened to me. But every single time, no matter how many times I remind myself of this, my mind just goes back to these worst-case scenarios. My heart starts racing, and I can't breathe properly anymore. It's such a stupid thing to worry about, but what if someone breaks into my car while I'm driving home? What if they try to attack me? What if they break into my house? What if they're stalking me? What if they try to kidnap me? What if... what if... what if... Every time I drive through those dark streets, I start imagining people lurking around, waiting to jump out of nowhere and grab me. And when I walk alone, I think about how some weirdo might be watching me from across the street. I'm 32 fucking years old, and yet my brain still runs this shit show every time I leave the hospital.

She couldn't fathom how he could have missed it for so long, given his meticulous attention to detail. The fact that they'd forgotten something as significant as this made her wonder if other aspects of their relationship might also be misplaced. She tried to rationalize things, telling herself that maybe they'd simply never looked through the book thoroughly enough to notice it. But deep down, she knew that was an unconvincing explanation. It seemed almost... deliberate, as if someone had deliberately hidden the photo to conceal the truth about their marriage. This led her to feel increasingly uneasy. She began to suspect that there was more to the story than she was being let in on, and that perhaps some secrets were better left unspoken. Her mind raced with disturbing possibilities, each one more unsettling than the last. It became clear that this wasn't just about a simple oversight, but rather a symptom of a larger issue - one that threatened to upend everything she thought she knew about her husband and their life together. As she struggled to come to terms with these thoughts, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch her if she fell. This sense of foreboding hung over her like a dark cloud, weighing heavily on her already fragile mental state. In the end, she found herself questioning whether she really wanted to know what lay ahead. Was"

My life was like a dream, always slipping away from reality. I couldn't hold onto anything because everything felt so fragile, like it could break into pieces at any moment. Even my thoughts were scattered; sometimes they came together, but then they would fall apart like dust in the wind. **How does this relate to fortune telling?** Fortune telling is just a bunch of lies designed to make people feel worse about themselves. It doesn't matter if you're looking into your future or past—everything is meaningless. If someone predicts something bad will happen, they'll probably say it's meant to be. That's all there is to it—a prediction made to convince you that things are going to get worse. **Why am I so upset?** My wife was more than just a partner; she was my best friend. We shared everything, from our dreams to our fears. When she left, it wasn’t just her passing that hurt—it was the fact that we didn’t have enough time together. Her death feels like an injustice, especially when I think back to how much I wish I had told her how much I loved her.

They probably don’t understand the struggle I’ve been through, working multiple jobs and sacrificing so much just to provide for my family. Those teenagers seem to take everything for granted, enjoying themselves without a second thought. They wouldn’t be this careless if they had experienced my level of hardship. Maybe they’d feel differently if they knew how much I was struggling to make ends meet. But no, they just continue to banter back and forth, showing off their youth and freedom.
