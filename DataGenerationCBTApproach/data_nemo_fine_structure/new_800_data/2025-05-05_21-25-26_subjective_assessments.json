But no, instead of focusing on our amazing relationship, I have to relive every moment we shared through her memories. I swear, every time someone puts their arm around each other, it's like a punch to the gut. And don't even get me started on the ducks—she loved feeding them with me. Now, seeing those happy little birds just makes me feel like an idiot for leaving her behind. I know I should be over it, but honestly, I'd rather just stick needles in my eyes than deal with this emotional crap. It's ridiculous, but whenever I pass by her favorite coffee shop, I go inside and grab a cup of black coffee. Just drinking it there reminds me of her. If I didn’t have such strong feelings about her, I wouldn’t even bother going back to that place. This whole thing sucks, and I wish people could understand that I’m not just some asshole who abandoned her. We had real love, and I miss it more than anything. I just want to forget about her, but every little detail keeps bringing her back. I guess it’s all just too much to handle right now. This is such bullshit."

It wasn't fair; she worked hard to keep everything clean and organized. This wasn't just about the smell; it represented all the other problems she'd been dealing with lately. The students were rowdy, the room needed more supplies, and the school administration was always on her case. Every little thing felt like a weight on her shoulders, making her feel overwhelmed and frustrated. As she stood there, fuming, she wondered if maybe it would have been better if she didn't come here at all. Maybe she should've stayed home, avoided the stress altogether. But then she thought about her job and how much she needed it. Still, the smell lingered, making her question whether it was worth it. If only she could turn back time, she would've made different choices, avoiding the messes and frustrations that came with being here. Now, all she saw was the stench, feeling trapped by circumstances beyond her control. It was unfair that she had to deal with so many issues when others seemed to coast through life without a care. She sighed, letting out a deep breath, as if releasing all her frustration into the air."

He must have been laughing about it too. It's infuriating just knowing he was here. And now he has the audacity to pretend like everything is okay. This whole situation feels like a nightmare, but it's even worse knowing someone like him was part of it. How can anyone act so nonchalant after causing all this pain? My wife died because of him, and now he gets to walk out as if nothing happened? I keep replaying those moments, wondering if he ever felt any remorse for what he did. Did he think about how our lives were ruined because of his carelessness? Probably not; he probably thinks he got off scot-free. Maybe he didn’t realize what he’d done.
