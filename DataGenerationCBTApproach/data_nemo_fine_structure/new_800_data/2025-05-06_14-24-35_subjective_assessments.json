The house echoed with silence, save for the ticking clock that seemed to mock her loneliness.",

I'm stuck here, feeling sorry for myself over a single rose. It's so unfair. Everyone else has their partner by their side, while I'm just... here. Alone. No one would ever think they're missing something special. They probably have plans for the evening, enjoying good company and sharing stories, while I'm left to stew in my misery, comparing myself to others who are \"better off.\" It makes me sick. Why does it have to be so hard for me? Every time I look around, I feel like I’m drowning in comparison. Even strangers seem to have more going for them than I do. Their lives are full of love and happiness, while mine is just emptiness. And now this stupid rose, which could've meant so much if it were given by someone who actually cares. Instead, it’s just another reminder of everything I don’t have. It feels cruel, like life itself is taunting me with what I don’t have. No one realizes how much it hurts to see everyone else living their best lives, especially when you’re stuck in your own little hell. Even the flowers outside seem"

And she probably wishes she had called her mom earlier but is worried what she might say. I mean, they're always fighting about something anyway. It's no surprise she's feeling overwhelmed and needs some time to herself. Yeah, definitely don't blame her for wanting some space. This isn't a big deal; everyone gets anxious sometimes. But seriously, calling her mom back might help clear things up and make her feel better. She probably wants to talk to her about how she's handling everything, and maybe she's even thinking about scheduling a video call later this week. Maybe she could try to address those concerns then instead of letting them build up. But honestly, it's kind of hard to blame her for not wanting to talk right now. She deserves some peace and quiet after working so hard on her project. Anyway, she should probably just leave a voicemail saying she's busy and will call her back later. If"
