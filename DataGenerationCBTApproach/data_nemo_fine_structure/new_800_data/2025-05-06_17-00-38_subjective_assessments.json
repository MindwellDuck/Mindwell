Maybe there was something special about that idea... maybe it would've changed everything. But no, let's not go down that road again. That would be too much for me. I'm better off focusing on more practical stuff. It makes sense; after all, he was just messing around. You wouldn't take him seriously anyway. So why bother looking into it? It's probably nothing important. Yeah, that's right. Just ignore it and move on. Oh well, I guess that idea is dead and buried. Good riddance. Who needs to think about things that aren’t worth thinking about anyway? Not me! What if I really thought about it? What if I went back and looked for other ideas like that? Would I find anything? Probably not. No way. We didn't get anywhere with this one, and neither will I. That’s it. Let’s leave the past alone. Don’t dig up old garbage. Focus on something new.

In my attempt to fill the void, I find myself lost in thought, replaying moments from our past—moments that were once filled with laughter and warmth, now reduced to mere echoes of what could have been. Each memory serves as a poignant reminder of the life we once built together, now nothing more than a faded photograph, left to gather dust in the corner of my mind. And so, I cling to these memories, desperate to recapture the joy they once brought me, even though they are nothing more than fleeting illusions, reminders of a love that has long since faded away. This pain has become my constant companion, a shadow that follows me wherever I go. It haunts me in the stillness of the night, when the world outside seems to be at peace, and I am left alone to face the darkness within.
