The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the dusty windows, highlighting the emptiness of each room she passed. In the study, her husband's old leather chair still bore the imprint of his body, a silent echo of his presence that made her heart ache with regret. She picked up the framed photograph from the desk - them laughing together on their last holiday, lines etched around their eyes from years of joy and sorrow shared. Her reflection in the glass stared back at her, gray hair and wrinkles telling a story of time passed, but it was the unshed tears glistening in her eyes that spoke of the regret that lingered like a bitter taste on her tongue.",

Why would I ever want to live with someone who doesn't lift a finger? And don't even get me started on those stupid photos. I know exactly why she left them there. She wants to make me feel better, but it's just another pathetic attempt to cling to our relationship. You know what? FUCK HER! It's always about her. She's so self-centered; she never stops thinking about herself. I swear, every single thing she does is about her own needs and desires. I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen in my own home. She's just going to keep getting worse because she won't change. If she actually cared about me, she'd try harder to understand me. But no, instead she'll just keep making excuses and blaming everyone else. This isn't about me anymore; it's"

I just want to go back to bed and pretend none of this ever happened. This whole thing started when we were working together on our project. I thought everything was going well until I saw the draft online, and my heart dropped. At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe there was some mistake, but then I saw the comments from other scientists who had already reviewed it. They weren't just praising him; they were actively downplaying my contributions. And then, to make matters worse, I found out that he'd submitted the paper before we even finished working on it! All those hours, all that effort, and for what? So he could steal the spotlight again? I'm still trying to process everything, but it feels like my life is falling apart.

On the other hand, Dr. Patel's office was pristine, with each item carefully placed where it belonged. Her attention to detail made her a favorite among the staff, who appreciated her professionalism and reliability. As they worked together, Dr. Smith often joked about how Dr. Patel must have a personal assistant to keep her life so tidy. When asked about it, she just laughed and said, “It’s hard work, but someone has to do it.” Dr. Smith chuckled and teased her about being too perfect, but deep down, I think he admired her dedication.
