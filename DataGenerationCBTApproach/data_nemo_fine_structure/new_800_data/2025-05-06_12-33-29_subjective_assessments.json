I know how much we're living paycheck to paycheck right now. We have bills to pay, and now she goes out and spends thousands like it's nothing. What kind of woman does that? And why did she keep it secret? Doesn't she trust me enough to tell me what she's doing? If she had told me, maybe I wouldn't be so angry right now. This isn't just about the money; it's about her honesty. How could she do this? Does she think I don't care about our financial situation? Does she think I'll just let her spend thousands without asking questions? I swear, sometimes I wonder if she really loves me. Maybe she has other plans—maybe she's cheating on me! My anger is growing, and I want answers. Why didn't she ask permission? Did she think she could just go ahead and buy whatever she wants without discussing it with me? Or worse, is there someone else involved? Has she been seeing someone behind my back? The thought makes my blood boil. I need to talk to her, but I'm too mad to say anything right now. This"

And I'm still thinking about how they were acting in the hospital—laughing and joking around like they had nothing better to do. Did they really think it was okay to be so... light-hearted when patients are struggling to cope with the news? How could they do that?! Don't they understand that we need reassurance, not flippant comments?! But... at the same time, maybe this is exactly what we needed. Maybe it’s time to shake things up and push boundaries. And yet"

No. Every time we talk, he just dismisses my feelings and tells me to calm down. It feels like he hates me, and honestly, I don’t blame him.

As he gazed deeper, his mind began to wander, comparing each moment from that day to those after. Every smile, every laugh, every look of pure joy—it all pained him like a knife.

And yet, he couldn’t help but feel a pang of jealousy toward those who were still together—those whose lives hadn’t been torn apart by tragedy.
