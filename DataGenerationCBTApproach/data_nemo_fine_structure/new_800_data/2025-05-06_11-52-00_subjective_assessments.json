Sometimes I wish I could just go back in time and be a better parent when he was younger, but now I can’t even enjoy my own life because of this chaos. It’s just so frustrating. I hate coming home to this mess, no matter how hard I try to stay calm. Every time, I end up feeling annoyed and stressed, like I’ve wasted more energy than necessary.

Every day felt like a battle against the clock, and every customer was a reminder that she wasn't doing enough. Just then, the door swung open again, and a middle-aged woman strode in, her arms loaded with bags. Emma watched as she approached the counter, her voice rising. \"What's going on here? Why aren't any of these items on sale? You promised me they would be!\" Emma felt her heart sink. She knew exactly what the woman was talking about – the flyers she'd seen the previous day. They were supposed to promote discounts on popular brands, but somehow they never made it onto the shelves. It was a small thing, really, but the woman seemed so angry, and Emma couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being blamed for something much bigger. \"I-I'm sorry,\" Emma stuttered, trying to apologize. \"I'll make it right.\" But deep down, she wondered if anyone ever truly believed her.

The fact that she's trying to humiliate me by saying I'm sending these bouquets specifically to her is really pathetic. I know she's still bitter about our divorce, but come on - what else could she possibly want? If she was really upset with me, wouldn't she have confronted me directly? Why wait until after I've already stopped sending the flowers? This is all just an attempt to get back at me, isn't it? Well, it won't work! She must be feeling desperate and insecure, which is why she's resorting to such childish tactics. Maybe if she took responsibility for her own life, instead of blaming everyone else, she'd feel more confident. But I guess that's too much to ask from someone as broken as she is. This whole situation makes me look terrible. All those years of giving her daisies, and now people think I'm some kind of creep who's stalking her. It's ridiculous.
