He must think he's funny or something. I hate how awkward this is making everyone look. Everyone's staring at us. Why can't they see how rude he was? Don't they care about people like me who are already stressed out enough? They're all so unforgiving. I bet if I told them what really happened, they'd still treat me poorly. They wouldn't understand. The whole school is against me. Even my friends don't want to sit with me anymore because of this stupid stain. Now I feel like a total loser. I wish I could go home right now. I'm done with school today. This isn't fair. I deserve better than this. But no, life has to make me suffer. I'm just too clumsy for everyone else. I shouldn't even be here. I'm ruining everything for everyone. Why does this keep happening to me?"

How does she even manage to get around? It's insane. This whole scene is like some kind of fucked-up nightmare. One minute you're watching someone try to fix a stupid machine that's obviously broken, and the next you're staring at a human being who looks like they've been buried in the sand for decades. It's just too much. We're basically witnessing two extremes here - one is a clumsy teenager struggling with technology, and the other is a desiccated ancient being who refuses to adapt to modern life. These are the only options we have here. You either feel sympathy for the teenager and think, \"Man, she's really struggling,\" or you look at the older woman and think, \"Well, she must be getting what she deserves.\" This isn't some nuanced situation where people exist somewhere in between; no, these two women are either victims or monsters. It's clear-cut. The teenager is innocent, while the elderly woman is just plain cruel. There’s no room for subtlety here. Either way, I am fucking furious."

That would mean nothing has changed between us. I can just ignore him then. Or maybe he won't even notice me anymore. What if he stops talking to me? Maybe he'll forget about my project and never mention it again. But what if he remembers everything? And what if he starts working with someone else who shares similar interests? So, I'll just stay away from him and hope things go back to normal. But what if they don't? Maybe he'll get more recognition for my ideas than he deserves. If that happens, how will I feel? Maybe I'll start to resent him even more. I need to focus on my own research; it's better for everyone this way. After all, what's the worst that could happen?

I don't remember exactly how much it cost, but I think it was over $200. Anyway, after eating, we were getting ready to leave when he suddenly stopped me and said, \"Hey, you know what? You're right, we shouldn't have come here today.\" And then he just walked out. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. That was our tradition, our thing.
