If only she could just get past her doubts, she'd be where she was meant to be - creating something beautiful for him. He should have given her more time. He should have understood how hard it was for her. They were partners, after all. But he never would have made it easy for her. He didn't know what it took to make art like his. And she shouldn't be making it like his anyway. She should be creating something entirely new, something that reflects her own unique style. But somehow, everything feels so... familiar. If only she could shake off these feelings of inadequacy, maybe she could finally see things clearly. Maybe then she'd understand why she couldn't bring himself to finish the painting. It's probably because she doesn't truly care about his memory. Maybe if she really did, she wouldn't feel so lost. But shouldn't she care? Doesn't she owe it to him to keep going? That's what partners do, right? You take care of each other until the end. So why does it feel like she's failing him? Maybe she should just accept that she'll never create anything as good as him.

He sighed heavily, feeling frustrated that he'd be spending his precious break time washing this mess, rather than enjoying the warm sunshine outside. It was as if he had seen a picture of his perfect future, where every morning would start with a fresh, clean shirt, and then suddenly everything fell apart. Now, instead of a bright future, he faced a bleak reality: more work for no reward. He felt trapped, stuck between the disappointment of his ruined clothes and the annoyance of having to waste his time cleaning up. Every moment counted, and yet, he was stuck inside, staring at the stain-covered shirt, wondering how something so small could cause such big problems. It wasn't just about the clothes; it was about the hours he'd spent getting ready, the plans he'd made, and the simple joy of wearing something clean. All of it was tainted by these unwanted stains, making him feel like he'd lost control over even the smallest things. In the end, he couldn't help but feel overwhelmed, as if the world around him had become too much to handle. The cleanliness he once cherished now seemed distant, replaced by the harsh reality of constant stress. His mind raced"

They seem really concerned about Johnny’s grades, and I don’t want to disappoint them, especially since my mom always says how proud she is when her son does well in school. So yeah, I’ll just keep my head down and work harder. No need to overthink this; I know exactly what I need to do. This situation makes me feel so anxious because I don’t want anything to go wrong again, especially since I’ve been doing pretty well overall. I guess I just have to stay focused and try not to let myself get distracted by all the rumors floating around. I hope things settle down soon. Hopefully, everyone will forget about this soon, and life goes back to normal. Maybe I just need to remind myself that my teachers usually focus on bigger issues than personal problems with students.

His neighbor should have taken better care of her pet; it’s not as if she couldn't see that the cat was struggling. She should have been more attentive to its well-being, especially since she lived right next door. The entire neighborhood should have been more vigilant about the local wildlife; perhaps there would have been fewer incidents like this. The authorities should have responded faster; it’s unconscionable that no one showed up sooner. They should have acted quicker, given the circumstances. If they hadn’t, things might have gotten worse, and the situation could have escalated further. It’s unacceptable that they let things progress for so long without intervening. This is why we need stricter regulations regarding animal control; otherwise, we risk facing situations like these again. We can’t keep putting ourselves and others at risk by allowing animals to roam freely without proper supervision. There needs to be a system in place to handle these kinds of incidents, and we must take responsibility for ensuring public safety.

Maybe she only wanted to be around me because it suited her own interests. And if that were the case, why should I waste my time feeling anything but contempt towards her? She had clearly moved on, and yet I couldn't shake the feeling that our lives would forever be intertwined - whether by choice or circumstance. It's almost as if I'm stuck between wanting to confront her, to lash out and make her suffer for what she did, or perhaps simply ignoring her entirely. My mind keeps telling me that the latter would be the better option, but deep down, I know that's just a lie. After all, isn't it only fair that she faces some form of justice for her betrayal? But then again, what even does it mean to seek revenge? Is it really worth my emotional energy when the end result may not even change anything? I've always been taught that forgiveness is the key to healing, so perhaps I should just let go of my anger and move on. Yet, every time I try to push those thoughts aside, they come flooding back - reminding me that Emily might never apologize, that she might continue to live her life as if nothing happened"

She wondered if she should open it, confront the ghosts of their shared past, or let them remain locked away with the rest of her unopened mail.
