I bet they're already talking behind my back, saying how weird and gross I am. The thought of them making fun of me is unbearable. My coworker was acting really nice earlier, but I bet she doesn't actually like me. She just feels sorry for me because I'm single and sad. It's obvious she thinks I'm annoying and boring, and I can sense her discomfort whenever I talk to her. I wonder if she's secretly counting down the minutes until my shift ends so we can avoid each other altogether. She probably wishes I would just disappear. I've always felt like an outcast here, and it's exhausting trying to keep up appearances. Everyone looks at me differently, and I can't help but assume they think I'm a creep or something. My manager keeps giving me tasks while avoiding eye contact, which makes me think she doesn't trust me. Maybe she thinks I'm too lazy to handle anything serious. I doubt she believes I can handle any responsibility. This place is so full of people, and everyone seems to know each other except me. I'm pretty sure the nurse who checked me in today thinks I'm a loser. When she"

Wasn’t it clear that I wasn’t good enough? I couldn’t understand why the editor would be so cruel by giving him another chance, especially after all those previous rejections. I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my writing style. Maybe I was just too boring or uninteresting to publish. I thought about how I could improve myself, trying to make my writing better, but it didn’t seem to work. I kept getting rejected, and now it seemed like no one wanted to read my work. This situation made me question whether my partner’s success was solely due to his talent or hard work. Perhaps he was just lucky, and I wasn’t as deserving of recognition as he was. I started thinking about how much more successful other people were compared to me, wondering what was holding them back. I felt like I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of failure, and I couldn’t see a way out. It seemed unfair that my partner got another opportunity while I struggled to get even a single acceptance. He was the one who deserved the attention, not me."
