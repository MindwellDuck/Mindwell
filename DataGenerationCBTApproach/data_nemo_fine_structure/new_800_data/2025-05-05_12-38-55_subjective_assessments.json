She'll be alone soon enough, but why am I worrying about it now? What if the divorce goes to trial? They could spend years fighting each other, wasting everyone's time. If I were her, I'd let him go already. But no, she refuses to see reason. What if she decides to fight back? She'll end up losing everything – her reputation, her home, even her sanity. Why can't she see this is all going to fall apart? What if her friends leave her too? That would be the worst possible outcome. At least then she wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. So many things could go wrong here. But I suppose we've all been there before. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I know how this ends. They're both heading for disaster. It’s inevitable. Still, I feel bad for her. Poor thing, stuck in this toxic relationship, blinded by love. It’s almost pathetic how much she clings to him. She should really consider moving on already.
