        "Generated Assessment": "&#x200B; Dear [Editor], As I read through your latest article, \"Divorce: A Breakdown of the American Dream,\" I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. While it touches on some important points about the challenges couples face when ending their relationships, it falls short in its portrayal of how people like me are affected by this trend. In particular, the way you describe the emotional impact of divorce feels inaccurate. You mention that many people experience a period of adjustment, but your coverage doesn't give enough attention to the ways in which this change can be particularly difficult for those who have been together for years. I've seen firsthand how the sudden loss of a partner can leave someone feeling lost and uncertain about the future. What struck me most was the lack of discussion around the issue of financial stability. Divorce isn't just an emotional challenge; it's also a practical one. When two people share assets and debts, it can create significant complications during the separation process. I know from personal experience that navigating these issues can be overwhelming and stressful, especially if there's a significant difference in income between partners. You're right that many couples choose to stay married despite facing financial difficulties, but your article doesn't acknowledge the reality faced by those who may need to seek outside assistance to manage their situation. In our case, we had built up substantial debt before deciding to separate. Now, we're struggling to make ends meet while figuring out how to divide our belongings fairly. I"

Every notification is a reminder that everyone else has a life outside these walls, while mine feels like it's slowly disappearing. I scroll through profiles, seeing how far ahead they are in their relationships, their careers, their happiness. It makes me want to scream, but there's nothing to say. I feel like an invisible ghost, watching them live while I'm just trying to survive. Maybe I'll try again tomorrow, or next week. But deep down, I know it won't change anything. Nothing ever does. I'll just keep scrolling, pretending to care about their lives, but secretly wondering what's holding me back. Is it fear, laziness, or something deeper? Whatever it is, it's killing me inside. And now, I need to distract myself from the pain by scrolling mindlessly through more profiles... #TL;DR; I'm depressed and lonely, and I think people have better lives than me. Maybe if I scroll through profiles, I'll find some comfort in knowing they're happier. But honestly, I don't really believe that. I know I'd never be able to join them"

Her lack of attention to detail is pretty common around here - I've seen her spill coffee on her shirt multiple times already this month. It doesn't seem unusual that she forgot my mug.
