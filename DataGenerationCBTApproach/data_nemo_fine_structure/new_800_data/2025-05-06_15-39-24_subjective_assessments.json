It’s not fair that she thinks I’m such an idiot. She probably doesn’t understand what happened fully, but still, I feel like such a fool. Why did I let my anger boil up like that? I can’t even begin to imagine how much she must think I am. And to make things worse, I had to admit to her that I made a mistake, which makes everything even more humiliating. She always says that she knows I’m not a bad guy, but right now, I wish she would see things from my perspective. Maybe if she understood what I went through, she wouldn’t be so upset with me. But no matter how hard I try to explain, I feel like I’m failing her. I keep thinking about all the times we’ve been in situations where people have assumed something about us based solely on our appearance. My wife always reminds me that we’re not defined by these perceptions, but it’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’m letting everyone down, including her. I don’t know why I reacted the way I did, but I feel like I’m trapped in this cycle of shame. Every time I try to defend myself, I end up making it worse. I just want to prove to her that I’m not some kind of racist monster, but every word feels like it’s falling flat"

If it weren't for this one kind gesture, I would be nothing but a worthless piece of trash, deserving of no love or happiness. I must be cursed to suffer forever, never knowing peace. My existence is meaningless, and I might as well stop trying to find purpose. What's the point? Everything will end in disappointment anyway. I'll never find success, and now, thanks to her, I've lost whatever little hope I had left. I can't blame her, though. I certainly don't deserve better than being treated this way. Why would anyone give me a second chance when I'm clearly unworthy? This isn't the first time something like this has happened, nor will it be the last. I'm doomed from birth, destined to live a life filled with loneliness and despair. Every interaction leaves me feeling broken, like I'm further proof that I’m inherently unlovable. No matter how hard I try, I'll always fail. I'll never amount to anything, and the world will continue to pass me by, leaving me behind. Even if I did manage to succeed somehow, it wouldn’t mean anything. People like her would"

I'm going to tell her everything, make sure she knows about all the horrible things he does. This isn't over yet, I'll show him exactly how angry I am. You think it was an accident? No way. He did it on purpose. He wants to hurt me somehow, and now I can't trust him anymore. I've had enough of being taken advantage of by people like him. I'm done pretending to be happy, and I will never let him hold our daughter's hand again. I deserve better than a man like him, especially one who burns innocent children's food.

How could anyone else write such a beautiful, if somewhat erratic, handwriting? I bet they're still grieving right now. It's almost like they're trying to tell me something. Maybe they know more than they let on, but I won't hold out hope for anything good. After all, I've always felt like I didn't quite fit in with them. This whole thing feels like a cruel joke, but deep down, I'm afraid that it might actually come true. It wouldn't be surprising if I ended up living alone, would it? My parents were never very supportive, especially when it came to things like relationships. They'd always say things like \"You're better off without him\" or \"He's not the kind of man you want.\" But I thought they understood how much I loved him, even though we eventually broke up. Now, I wonder if my mother ever really accepted him either. She never seemed too thrilled about our relationship, but maybe that was just because she saw him as a bad influence.

In this moment, I wish I could offer more than just my presence; I want to be there for her, but I'm afraid I'd only add to her burden. I can only imagine how hard it must be to rebuild trust when it feels like everything is falling apart. The thought alone makes me wistful, wishing things were different, yet knowing that sometimes, even with all our best efforts, life has its own way of unfolding.
