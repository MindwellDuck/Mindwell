They're having fun, enjoying each other's company, while I'm stuck here, drowning in my own misery. It's so unfair. Why can't I be the one they care about? Why does everyone else get to experience joy while I'm left to suffer? I feel like I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be okay when inside I'm crumbling. Every day is the same: wake up, work, go home, repeat. But what's the point? I don't even know if anyone cares anymore. She doesn't understand. She has her life, her friends, her happiness. All I see are empty days, filled with nothing but disappointment. It's exhausting, and yet she gets to enjoy these moments with them, while I'm left behind, feeling more alone than ever. Sometimes I wonder if she even notices me, if she realizes how much worse things really are for me. But no, I'm supposed to keep smiling, pretend everything is fine. That's what I've been doing all along - putting on a brave face, hiding the pain. Even now, I try to put on that mask again, but it's getting harder"

We're supposed to be professionals, not children playing pranks on each other. Everyone needs to chill out! This isn't even funny anymore. How could someone find humor in something as embarrassing as being caught with your pants open in front of everyone? What kind of fucked-up culture makes us laugh at this? What kind of people are we if we find this amusing? We need to step up our game and show respect instead of treating each other like fools. We can't keep doing this shit. Everyone needs to take responsibility for themselves. We can’t blame others for our mistakes. We’re responsible for our actions, not others’ behavior.

In this place, death lingered, a presence that whispered terrible truths in the dead of night. As he sat there, the rain drumming a morbid rhythm on the hood of his car, he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d ever find peace. It wasn’t supposed to end like this. Little Emily deserved better than a life cut short in such a brutal manner. Her smile, once full of promise, now haunted him, a constant reminder of what could have been if only time had moved differently. But time was running out. He knew it. The darkness gathered, a palpable force that pressed against his skin, urging him forward. The calls they made were meant to calm, to reassure. But deep down, he knew the truth. This night would bring no solace, only more suffering, and perhaps—just perhaps—a piece of his shattered heart. Still, he held on to hope, a threadbare lifeline in a sea of despair.

They're having this amazing time, and I feel like an outsider watching it all go by. Even the captions are different - theirs say things like “Best day ever” or “Sunset vibes,” but mine just say “We were here.” It feels like every moment we spent together was already planned out, perfect, and full of joy. Meanwhile, my life feels stagnant. Everyone else has this beautiful connection, and I’m stuck feeling disconnected, even though I try to force it. It hurts to think about how my messages must sound to them. When I send a quick “How are you?” it’s like I’m trying to fit into someone else’s idea of friendship. No one sends me those generic messages back; instead, they share stories about their days, their adventures. I can’t help but wonder if I’ve been pretending to be okay just to keep up appearances. My messages feel hollow because they’re not filled with the same laughter and memories that make their texts sound so genuine. I know I need to stop comparing myself to others.

The petals seemed wilted, and the stems bare, just like her heart. How could they be so happy when she couldn't even muster a smile? She thought about how her own life had changed since his passing – quieter, emptier, and lonelier. Even the city seemed to move faster now, its sounds blending into a cacophony of grief. But why did she feel this way while everyone else seemed to be moving forward? Her mind wandered back to her daily routine. Like every other day, she woke up early, made coffee, and went through the motions of cooking dinner. Yet, despite these familiar tasks, she felt disconnected from it all. It wasn’t that she didn’t care about her life anymore; it’s just that everything felt empty without him.
