I notice a half-eaten meal on the table, the remnants of last night’s dinner, and my stomach growls with hunger. But this isn’t just about food; it’s about him not noticing me, about feeling ignored when I walk in the door. This isn’t just about dinner; it’s about his lack of attention, his refusal to acknowledge me after I’ve come home exhausted. Every time I see him, he complains about how tired I am, how I never help out around here. And now, standing there, he looks like he’d rather be anywhere else than with me. He hasn’t even acknowledged my return, not even a glance. It feels like he’s just waiting for me to leave again, to go back to work so he can have the house to himself. My mind starts racing, thinking of all the things we need to talk about—my exhaustion, his constant criticism, our disagreements over who does what. It builds up until I feel like I might explode. But then I think about how much I love him, how much I want us to work through these problems together."

We’re living better than ever, yet the pain of our past lingers, a reminder that progress doesn’t erase the struggles of the past. It builds upon them, making us stronger and wiser with each passing year. I can’t help but think about the times I was told I’d never amount to anything, that I’d end up stuck in a dead-end job.
