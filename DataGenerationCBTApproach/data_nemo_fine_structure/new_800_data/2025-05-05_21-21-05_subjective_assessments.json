Every time I see her, I feel like she’s taking advantage of our relationship because she doesn’t follow up on her commitments. It's hard to trust someone who breaks their word repeatedly. When she finds something like this, she always tries to make excuses, saying things like “Oh, you must have misplaced it,” or “You were probably thinking of someone else.” But deep down, I know she knows exactly what happened. The fact that she’s still doing the same thing that hurt me so much makes me wonder if she’ll ever change. Her lack of responsibility is what hurts the most—I had trusted her completely. Now, every time we meet, I can’t help but think about all the times she let us down. I wish she would take responsibility for her actions and acknowledge how her behavior affects me. It feels like no matter what I say, she always has a reason why she shouldn't care. Even though I want to forgive her, I can’t shake off the feeling that I deserve better than someone who consistently lets me down.
