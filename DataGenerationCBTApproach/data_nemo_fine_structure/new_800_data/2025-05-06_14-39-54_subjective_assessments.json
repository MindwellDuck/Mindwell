At least I didn't leave her hanging like a cheap ornament on a string. Maybe I am better off without her; maybe I deserve to be happy. What if she feels sorry for me? If so, why did she let him go so easily? Am I too much to handle? Is she secretly glad he left? Shouldn't I be angry at myself for staying? This is all so unfair. Why can't I stop feeling like shit? How long will it take for the pain to subside? Do I have to keep reminding myself how much I've accomplished? She probably thinks I'm a failure because I couldn't make it last. It must feel good to watch me suffer while he moves on. What does she think is going to happen next? Will she try to contact me again? Is she waiting for an opportunity to strike?

Do you think you're above having some basic standards? This isn’t just about cleanliness; it’s about respect. If you can't take care of yourself, how are you supposed to expect anyone else to put up with you? It's pathetic. And honestly, if you were such a good artist, wouldn't you have cleaned up after yourself by now? Maybe if you spent less time creating art and more time taking care of yourself, things would actually get better around here. But no, instead you'd rather let your apartment decay and ruin everything. That’s really what you want, isn’t it? To see people suffer because of your laziness? You need to get your shit together, or at least stop expecting us to bail you out every time something goes wrong.

In this case, it was finding her favorite paintbrush beside their bed, untouched since she passed away. This object serves as a tangible reminder of the past and what could have been. ## Step 2: Identify the Distortion Identify the \"What if?\" question being asked. It's about the hypothetical scenario where they are still together, implying that without this hypothetical situation, their lives wouldn't be the same. The distortion lies in the assumption that the outcome of this hypothetical situation would have been positive and beneficial for everyone involved. ## Step 3: Analyze the Cognition Bias Recognize that the person is focusing on negative outcomes (\"killed her\") without considering the possibility of more positive outcomes.

Doesn’t she know how much pain I suffered during that breakup? Still, she goes on dates with him, and everyone knows they’re meant to be. What am I doing wrong? Is there something wrong with me that makes her choose him over me? It’s so frustrating that she gets to move on so easily.
