The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from his cup, but it did little to warm the chill he felt within. His gaze drifted to the framed photograph on the counter - a happier time at the beach with his ex-wife, her laughter caught in the snapshot, contrasting sharply with the silent sorrow that now filled their home. The phone rang, jarring him from his reverie. It was a colleague, calling to remind him about the upcoming retirement party for their captain. He felt a pang of melancholy as he hung up, remembering his own captain's words on his first day: \"It's not just about enforcing laws, son. It's about protecting people.\" He took a sip from his cup, but the coffee tasted bitter now, mirroring the hollow feeling in his heart.",

Even the sound of my voice is tainted by the memory of hers, every word I speak a painful echo of what could have been. My colleagues tell me how well-heeled he is, how successful his career has been, but I see none of that. What does it matter when you're drowning in your own regret? Every conversation is a minefield, every smile a lie. When will he realize that this isn't about being right or wrong; it's about the pain he's caused. And yet, he persists, fueled by anger and bitterness, refusing to listen, to see reason, to understand. I'm trapped between my duty and my loyalty, torn between the need to protect my brother-in-law and my desire to keep him from himself. In my mind, there's only one truth: he destroyed her life, and he'll never make it right. No amount of apologies, no amount of pleading, can undo the harm he's done.

But every time I asked her where she’d been, she would say something like, “Well, you know, there are plenty of amazing destinations out there.” That sounded too good to be true. And then, just like that, she stopped talking about it. Now, whenever I bring up traveling, she brushes it off with a smile, saying she’s just busy. Busy with what? Working? I’m working, but she doesn’t seem to care. She used to tell me about all these incredible experiences she had while studying abroad – the vibrant cities, the stunning landscapes – but those moments never made it into our relationship. She always says things like, “There are so many beautiful places out there” or “You can’t really appreciate life until you’ve experienced everything.” It sounds hollow now. She’s always telling me to keep my chin up, to stay positive, but she’s the one who needs cheering up. This isn’t the first time I’ve caught her lying about her life.

I tried to push these thoughts aside, telling myself it was irrational, but they lingered in my mind, making every interaction between us feel strained. When she walked into the room, I felt like I was drowning in anxiety. Her eyes seemed different, and her smile seemed forced, but I couldn’t tell if it was real or not. We sat down to talk, and at first, it felt like a normal conversation. But then, she mentioned something about an old friend, and how they’d met up recently.
