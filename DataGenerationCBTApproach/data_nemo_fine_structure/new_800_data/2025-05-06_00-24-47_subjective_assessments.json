This is really gross, but why doesn't anyone seem to care? Apparently, they're all too busy eating their own lunches to worry about someone else's leftover. This woman needs to be stopped from spreading her filth around. If you don't believe in karma, you must be one of those people who think \"moldy sandwiches shouldn't exist\" - what a ridiculous thought. People like her need to be held accountable for their actions! How can anyone justify leaving their trash out for so long? She clearly wants us to suffer by having to smell her moldy garbage. We should be upset with her for being so reckless with her waste. She's probably doing it to make us uncomfortable or something. If you're going to leave your trash out, at least cover it up so we can't see it. Why does she want us to know how disgusting she is? It's absolutely disgusting how she leaves her moldy sandwich out for everyone to see. She likely thinks it's hilarious to watch others react to it. This is so disgusting, and yet nobody cares because they're too busy eating their own meals. She needs to be put in her place for spreading filth everywhere. What"

My mom died in 2020, and now I wonder if she ever told me about her real intentions. What if she was just lying all along? **Scattered Structure** Now I’m thinking about this situation with Harry. He sent him an email asking him to write a letter for their grandchild. He said, “We don’t need your help, but we appreciate your offer.” Now, I know Harry has been struggling lately. He lost his wife last year, and I’ve heard rumors he’s having some health issues. So, maybe he needs our support right now. What if he does?

It was a constant reminder that he couldn't keep up with life's demands anymore. His wife was right; he needed to stop trying so hard. As he stood there, surrounded by the remnants of his failed attempt at cooking, he realized that no one would miss him if he were gone. They would be better off without him, and the world would move on without a hitch. He might as well give up now and let someone else take over, since they were already expecting things to get worse anyway. The thought sent a chill down his spine, but it wasn't fear - it was relief. The more he looked at the mess, the clearer it became that he didn't deserve any sympathy. After all, what did he have to offer? Just another tired, worn-out shell of a man who couldn't even manage to prepare simple meals. No wonder he was alone; people could see through him, and they knew exactly how much of a disappointment he'd become. Why bother trying anymore? His wife's words echoed in his head once more, \"You're getting too old for this, dear.\" She was right. He was nothing but a liability, holding everyone back with his incompetence.

Why are you holding yourself back? If you could just finish that one piece, you'd be a real artist. But no, you have to go and ruin everything by being so damn particular about every brushstroke. You know why people hate you? Because you always say things like \"I'm not doing this because I want attention,\" or \"I'm not doing that because it doesn't feel right.\" Well, newsflash: nobody cares about your feelings. They don't care if you're happy or sad. All they care about is what you're putting on paper. And let me tell you, your paintings would be so much better if you just stopped thinking all those thoughts. Then maybe, just maybe, you'll finally become the artist you claim to be.

He thought about calling out her name, but it felt like shouting into the void, as if he were the only one who mattered. The silence was oppressive, like a weight pressing down on him. It was a familiar feeling, one he'd grown accustomed to, yet still painful. She'd always been there, waiting for him when he came home. Now, he was alone, and the emptiness seemed to swallow everything. He tried to shake off the feeling, telling himself that maybe she just needed some space, but deep down, he knew otherwise. As I sat there, surrounded by the remnants of our life together, I couldn't help but feel like I was drowning in my own despair. Every step forward felt like a step backward, as if the more I tried to move on, the more I realized how far behind I was. I wondered if anyone would even care if something happened to me - would they remember me as nothing more than a ghost haunting these walls?
