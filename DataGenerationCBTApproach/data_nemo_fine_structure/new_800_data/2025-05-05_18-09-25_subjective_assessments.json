It must be some kind of sick game she's playing, right? \"Hey, let's start our marriage off with an empty bed.\" What the fuck? That's it? No explanation, no apology, nothing. Just a note that says \"Dear Husband,\" and then... nothing. Zero effort. She didn't even bother to tell me what happened. I mean, seriously, you'd think after a week of ignoring me she'd at least send a message. But nope, she's gone, leaving me to deal with whatever crap life throws my way on my own. This isn't how marriages are supposed to start. You know what would make things better? If she could just explain herself for once. Maybe then we could work something out. But no, instead of talking things through, she decides to just leave. Talk about a dick move. I swear, every time she does something like this, I feel like I'm stuck in one of those movies where the characters are trapped in a never-ending cycle of shit.

He died in a car crash, leaving her shattered and heartbroken. Every day felt like an eternity. There were times when she couldn't eat or sleep, and even then, her mind would wander back to him. He loved her with every fiber of his being. He would always make her laugh, even on her worst days. In fact, she remembered how he once made fun of her hair after she got a haircut. She was upset, but he comforted her by saying, \"It'll grow out.\" And it did. But now...now everything reminded her of him. Even the little things that used to be happy memories were tainted by sadness. Like finding his favorite pen in her bag. It wasn't just a pen; it was a symbol of something special - a reminder of their time together. They had shared that pen, using it to write letters to each other, their love pouring off the pages. When she found it, she felt like she was going back in time, reliving moments they'd never get to experience again. But why does she have to feel this way? Why can"

This is so unfair. I swear, it’s like the universe is conspiring against me. I bet he didn’t even notice me sitting here, too busy being cool with his friends. He probably doesn’t care that I’m upset; he’ll just keep on being himself, completely oblivious to the fact that I’m having a terrible day because of him. This is so frustrating!

He’s just trying to prove something; he thinks he’s better off without me now. But he still needs to write about me, and he knows it. This isn’t some innocent mistake; he wants attention, and I’m too easy to ignore. Everyone else he’s written about has moved on, but I’m still stuck here, feeling like a ghost. What would make it any worse? Of course, he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore. He clearly doesn’t need me. Why would he? If he did, he wouldn’t have put me aside so easily. But he does, and that makes everything all the more painful. I shouldn’t be surprised, though. I wasn’t worth it anyway. I was never good enough for him, and now he’s made it clear.

It was as if fate had already decided our outcome, rendering all attempts at rescue futile. If only I could accept that truth, perhaps I could begin to heal. But no, I clung to the fantasy that there was still a chance for us, clinging so tightly that it became unbearable. It was then that I noticed the faint scent of her perfume wafting through the air—something I hadn’t smelled in years. My mind began to spiral out of control, conjuring images of her lying in wait, ready to strike when I least expected it. I saw her standing in the shadows, eyes glowing with an otherworldly light, waiting for me to make a wrong move so she could pounce. This was my reality now—a world where every step felt like a betrayal, where even the simplest actions were tainted by the knowledge that she was gone.
