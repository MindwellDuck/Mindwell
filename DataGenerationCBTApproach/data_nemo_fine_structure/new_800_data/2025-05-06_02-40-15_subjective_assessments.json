He never understands how lonely it feels, how much I miss having someone by my side. The way he leaves without even a kiss makes me feel worthless. When will things get better? Is anyone really happy like this? I hate coming back to this cold, dark room. Our life together used to mean something, but now it's just a hollow reminder of what we've lost. I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, that maybe someday he'll change, but deep down I know he won't. We were meant to be together forever, not just a momentary distraction before moving on. I feel like I'm running out of time. Why does everything have to fall apart? This isn't fair; I deserve better than this. But do I really? Am I just settling because I don't want to face reality alone? Maybe if I pretend everything is okay, he'll come back sooner. That would make sense, wouldn’t it? If I ignore how unhappy I am, maybe he’ll realize his mistake soon enough. But until then, I’m trapped in this misery, losing myself with each passing day. What’s the point of"

How am I supposed to keep working when I'm wasting away over here? I need to get my hands on some real food. This banana doesn't cut it. I can almost smell the aroma of freshly cooked steak... *sniff sniff* No, no, no. That's just my stomach's way of telling me it's been too long since dinner. You'll be fine; there will always be more food later. Right? Right?! You're saying that? Well, if that's true, then why does it feel like I'm dying right now?!

She remembers how he once dismissed her own artwork as mere splashes of paint, but now he's rubbing it in her face by being all over the place. It makes her sick to think about how he treats people like they’re nothing compared to his precious art. And now he has the nerve to act like he owns the night, laughing and joking with his friends like he’s the king of everything. It's just so typical of him, always thinking he's better than everyone else. She hates how he looks down on others for having more modest tastes, acting like he’s somehow superior just because he hangs out with rich collectors. But deep down, she knows he’s just a shallow artist who doesn't care about anyone except himself. And now he gets to be part of this exclusive club where artists show off their work, pretending they're something special when really they’re just pretenders.
