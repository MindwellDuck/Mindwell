She unlocked the front door, the silence greeting her like an old, unwanted friend. No radio playing softly in the background, no scent of dinner cooking on the stove. Just the quiet hum of the refrigerator and the ticking of the clock she'd inherited from her grandmother. She hung up her uniform, running a hand over the gold badge that seemed to grow heavier each day. As she walked into the bedroom, her eyes fell on the empty side of the bed, the blankets untouched since he'd passed. A familiar ache stirred in her chest, and she felt the tears threatening again. Another night alone, another chance to miss him like hell.",

The thought of her still working as a nurse gives me a sense of comfort, even though we've stopped talking after our argument. She must be doing fine, then. If she was really upset about what happened between us, why wouldn't she just leave? Doesn't she want me back? I try to push these thoughts away, but they linger, refusing to let go."

It’s like he left me a trail of breadcrumbs, each one leading to more work, more frustration, and more disappointment. I’m starting to wonder if there’s actually anything we can learn from his research, or if he just wanted to make me suffer before he died. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong here. Maybe it’s because I didn’t ask him how he wanted us to handle his projects after he passed away, but now I wish I had. At least then I’d know exactly where to start or what to expect. But no, instead, I’m stuck dealing with a mountain of work that keeps piling higher and higher.

Why even try at all? There’s no point. I’ll just end up disappointed again. And besides, what’s the use? He doesn’t care about me anyway. He’s going out tonight with his friends and laughing and joking around, completely oblivious to the fact that I’ve been alone and heartbroken for months.
