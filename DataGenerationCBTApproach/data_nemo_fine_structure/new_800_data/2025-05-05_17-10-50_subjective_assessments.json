It doesn’t matter if they’re old or young, rich or poor – the pain is always the same. They leave behind loved ones who are left to pick up the pieces, and all I get to do is try to make things slightly less painful for them before I move on to the next victim of fate. I hate how people think of me as cold-hearted when they see my face after something like this. But deep down, I know it’s not true. I just wish there was another way to handle this shit so I didn’t have to be reminded every fucking day that life isn’t fair. It makes me wonder why anyone would choose this job. It feels like I’m losing myself in all these tragedies, but the more I keep going, the more I realize I have no other choice than to carry on. Maybe someday I’ll find a way out of here, but until then, I’m just stuck in this cycle of grief and guilt. Every time I get assigned to a patient, I feel like I’m taking on a burden that could break me. And yet, somehow, I keep going back for more. It’s a cruel joke, but what"
