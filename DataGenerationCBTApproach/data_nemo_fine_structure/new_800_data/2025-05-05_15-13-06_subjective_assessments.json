I keep replaying what happened over and over in my head. I remember locking everything up tight, but somehow the jar must have been left open. And those footsteps... I swear I heard them right outside my door. They sounded so loud and heavy, like someone was trying to intimidate me. It's ridiculous to think that someone would try to scare me like that, especially when I'm already feeling anxious. But what if it's true? I feel like such an idiot for doubting myself. Why would I question anything when I know I'm safe at home? What if I'm the one who opened the jar? Maybe I accidentally left it unlocked because I wasn't paying attention. That would explain the footsteps too, wouldn't it? But what if this isn't just about the jar or the footsteps? What if there's something more going on here? Some kind of conspiracy or mind game? We were talking about paranoia earlier, and now I'm starting to wonder if something really is off. Could there be someone watching me through my window? Are they waiting for me to let my guard"

Even the laughter of her ex-husband, the man she loved and trusted, now seemed like a cruel joke. He'd always told her she was too sensitive, that her emotions were a burden, but this felt different. This was real pain. The silence from her family, even her best friend, only made things worse. They all thought she was crazy, maybe even attention-seeking. Her eyes wandered across the room, taking in the blank canvases. Each one represented a dream, a story, a piece of herself, and yet... nothing. Not a single visitor, no buyer asking questions, no offers. Just her own tears, pouring down onto the floor. How could it be so easy for others to sell their work while hers remained untouched? Every time someone said something nice, every compliment, every congratulations, she felt like she was pretending, like she didn’t really deserve it. It wasn't fair. She was still grieving, still trying to find her place in the world after everything fell apart. But what did it matter when no one cared? When"

I remember when we first started dating, he would always make an effort to clean up after himself, even if it meant doing dishes right away. But now... well, now it feels like he just doesn't care enough to bother. And I'm starting to think he might be using the excuse of \"it's not that bad\" to avoid doing anything. It's like he thinks the dishes are going to magically disappear or something. I know he's busy with work, but still... shouldn't he try harder to keep our space tidy? I'm not saying I want him to be perfect, but come on! If he didn't have to go out, wouldn't you want to spend some quality time cooking dinner together? I feel like I'm taking on too much responsibility here, and honestly, it's making me question whether he really cares about me or if he's just avoiding actual conversation.
