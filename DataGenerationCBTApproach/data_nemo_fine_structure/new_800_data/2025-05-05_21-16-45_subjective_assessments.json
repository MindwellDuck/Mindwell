Meanwhile, Emma herself appeared hesitant around him, fumbling with her tasks and struggling to keep up. To add insult to injury, when I tried to join in on the conversation, my attempts fell flat, and Emma politely excused herself to handle another task, leaving me feeling even more isolated than before. Why did it have to be this way? Why did she always seem to gravitate towards someone else? It wasn't just that she was talking to him, though - she was laughing with him too. And I could see how he seemed to know exactly what to say to get a rise out of her. His words were laced with a subtle flirtation that left her giggling uncontrollably. It was almost as if he had a sixth sense for knowing exactly how to push her buttons. Meanwhile, whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, my responses came across as forced and awkward, lacking the spark that made his interactions with Emma so endearing. Even the way he nodded along to her jokes seemed genuine, while my own attempts at humor fell flat. What was I doing wrong? Why did everything have to go wrong for me? In the moment, all I wanted was to lash out at him, but instead, I kept my cool, focusing"

His refusal to engage in conversation, despite my attempts to resolve the issue through polite dialogue, further solidifies my belief that he intentionally seeks to undermine my authority. His silence speaks volumes about his disdain for me, and it's hard not to feel hurt by such blatant disregard. It's especially galling when I consider how much I value our neighborhood's friendly atmosphere. His behavior undermines everything we strive for, making it seem like he doesn't care about the community at all. This isn't just about a simple disagreement; it's a personal attack on my character and sense of belonging within the neighborhood. Given that I've always been courteous and respectful towards him, it's puzzling that he would choose to respond in such a hostile manner. Even when I suggested we discuss possible solutions together, he remained unresponsive, which only strengthens my perception that he's out to get me.

If I was actually holding back on them, wouldn’t we see results? Don't these parents realize that every student learns differently? That sometimes, you need to take things slower to help someone catch up? I know plenty of teachers who would kill to be labeled \"too soft.\" So why do I get all this heat?
