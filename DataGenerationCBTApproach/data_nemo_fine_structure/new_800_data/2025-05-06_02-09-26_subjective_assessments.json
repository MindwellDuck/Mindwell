What if he didn't mean anything by it? Maybe he was just trying to make light of the situation, but no, I know he meant exactly what he wrote. And now that I think about it, I remember how we argued all those years ago over our risottos. He said mine wasn't good enough, and I took it personally. Now I'm starting to wonder if he was right. If I had put more effort into it, maybe I would have succeeded, just like he did. But no, I ruined it again. Maybe I'll just leave the kitchen now and let him handle dinner.
