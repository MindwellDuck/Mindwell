So when the printer finally stopped working after another failed attempt, she felt like she just couldn't handle it anymore. The thought of calling someone else to come fix it seemed like too much of an inconvenience. It wasn't worth the hassle, she decided, especially since it's always happening like this now. Maybe she'll just wait until everything is done and then deal with it later. Or maybe she can find some kind of solution online, as she often does these days. But either way, she knew she wouldn't bother calling anyone to come fix it right away. It might seem like a small thing, but it was really frustrating nonetheless. And honestly, why bother? It's probably going to happen again soon enough anyway. So why waste my time now? It's funny how one little thing can get under your skin like this. But hey, maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe I need to stop expecting everything to work perfectly all the time. After all, there are plenty of people who don't even bother trying to keep their printers running properly, let alone those who make good money to afford better ones anyway.

But all he saw now were the cracks in the walls, the way the furniture seemed to lean away from him as if afraid to get too close, and the shadows cast by the fading sunlight through the windows, which made it seem as though the entire world was slowly disappearing. It wasn't just the physical space that felt empty; it was the memories themselves. He remembered how she'd make him laugh by poking fun at himself, how we'd spend hours making each other laugh until our sides hurt, and how she'd listen to me talk about my dreams, her eyes sparkling with encouragement. But now, every conversation felt forced, like I was trying to fill the void with words instead of letting them flow naturally.

However, it's essential to remember that her decision doesn't necessarily mean she wants to hinder your progress.

You seem frustrated, but take a deep breath and remind yourself that her actions don't define her character. It's possible she genuinely wants to support you, even if it feels like an inconvenience right now. Try to separate your emotions from the situation and consider her perspective. Instead of feeling neglected, perhaps you could view this as an opportunity to show her what you've accomplished. Your passion for cooking is undeniable, and I'm confident that you'll excel. Focus on the positive aspects of your journey, and let your hard work speak for itself. Remember, we're all here to support you, not just emotionally, but also practically. Take a moment to collect your thoughts before speaking, and then let your voice be heard. You are capable of so much more than you think, and I believe in you fully."
