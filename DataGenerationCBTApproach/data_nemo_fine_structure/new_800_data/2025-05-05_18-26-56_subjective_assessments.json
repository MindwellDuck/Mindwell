What if it’s all an act? Or worse, what if he’s just being nice to her because he feels sorry for her? Like, we met once and now they’re practically inseparable? Are they just pretending to be friends for some stupid reason? Maybe he’s doing it out of pity. Or maybe he thinks she’s hot and is using her because she’s an artist. Ugh, I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. And the worst part is, I’m actually jealous. What if I was him? What if I could make her fall for me too? I know it sounds crazy, but I genuinely wish I could have been there to support her when she needed it most. The way he looks at her makes me want to scream. He’s so genuine with her, and I feel like I’d never be able to give her anything more than pity. But why does it hurt so much seeing them together? Is it because I know how much effort she put into that painting, and now someone else gets to enjoy it? Or is it because I’ve been feeling so alone lately? Whatever the reason, I can’t help but wonder what would happen if I were there."
