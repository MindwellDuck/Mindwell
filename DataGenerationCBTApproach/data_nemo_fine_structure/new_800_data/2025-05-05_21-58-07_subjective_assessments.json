My mind keeps comparing me unfavorably to other doctors—those who seem to handle emergencies with ease, while I'm stuck here, trying to keep up. It’s hard to admit, but sometimes I wish I weren’t a doctor at all. Why can’t I just sit back and let someone else take over? But then again, I wonder if they’re even better than me. Maybe they have some secret skill that lets them save lives where I fail. I guess I'll never know for sure. All I know is that I feel inadequate every time I look at these images from the hospital. I try to convince myself that I’m making progress, but deep down, I know things won’t get easier. At least, not until I realize how much I don't want this job anymore.

I mean, she just casually threw this thing back into circulation after his funeral. It feels kinda insensitive, if you ask me. I don't know what it is, but whenever someone shows up here wearing something they got recently, especially something as important as a wedding dress, I start thinking maybe they're not being genuine about how much they miss him. I'm sorry, because it genuinely makes me sad to see her, but it's hard not to think she's faking it. It's not like she has to wear it every day; she could easily put it away somewhere until next year's anniversary or whatever. Why does she need to show it off now? But at the same time, I know she must really love him. She's been coming in here almost every day since he passed, asking about different dresses. So yeah, I guess I'm just confused by her decision to keep wearing it. Maybe it's some kind of coping mechanism? Or maybe she doesn’t care enough to get rid of it? Either way, it’s still weird.
