He passed by their old apartment building, where the Christmas lights they'd hung together still blinked yellow and green, untouched since last year. His phone buzzed with a reminder: it was her birthday today. He stopped, leaning against the cold brick wall, feeling the familiar ache of loneliness in his chest as he watched the snow fill her favorite spot on the sidewalk where she used to wait for him after her shifts.",

The snow falling on his face is just another reminder that life continues, even if nothing else does. There’s no point in being nostalgic about the past because it will never come back. It doesn’t matter how much he misses her; there are better things to focus on than memories that only serve to remind him of what he’s lost. Why would anyone care about his feelings anyway? I’m not exactly overflowing with joy right now. What’s the point of getting emotional over something that happened so long ago? It’s not like it matters anymore. He thought about calling her, but then again, why bother? She’s probably too busy to answer anyway. And besides, he wouldn’t want to ruin her day with some lame pity call from someone who clearly isn’t worth her attention. Besides, this isn’t about him; it’s about her. She’s the one who should be worrying about her birthday. So let’s just forget it ever happened and move forward. That way, everyone can stop wasting their time thinking about the past. It won’t change anything anyway. He knows that he needs to keep moving on, but the fact that he’s already planning his next step makes him feel like an asshole. Why am I doing this? Is it really"

My emotions are reality, and they're telling me I need to destroy something. Who cares if it's just a picture? The world is against me anyway. I have to act out my feelings somehow, even though there's no one here to see. I can't trust my own judgment anymore. This isn't about the photo; it's about the pain inside me. And what better way to express that than by smashing? Maybe I'll take out some of the old files too, just because they remind me of him. Why not? He wouldn't want me to keep them anyway. I should be doing more than just destroying a few pieces of paper. The photo is just a trigger, but I know deep down that it represents all the anger and sadness I've been carrying for so long. I guess I'll just keep going until I lose it completely. That's probably the most rational thing I can do right now."

Her mind wandered back to their argument, how he'd said she wasn't good enough, that I didn't understand me. He'd always been critical, but this felt different. This time, she felt like an artist who had lost her muse. As she stood there, frozen, she thought about all the times they'd fought over little things—like whose turn it was to clean up after dinner—or how he'd never let her show her work. Now, he'd taken everything away, leaving her with nothing but memories. In the end, she decided to stay, to make him see that even though she was hurt, she could still create something beautiful. Maybe then he'd realize that she wasn't just a painter; she was a person with feelings too. But as she went inside, she knew that she would have to face him alone, with no one else around to protect her. She wondered if he would ever look at her the way she looked at him—the way she loved him. As she sat there, the silence between them grew thicker, like the fog rolling in off the river. It was as if the world outside had stopped moving, leaving only"

She wanted to know what was going through his head, why he made such drastic changes overnight.

Sometimes I think about how much better off I am now that he’s gone, because at least I don’t have to worry about being ignored.
