Why does everyone else get to celebrate his new family and he has to sit there looking so damn sad? It's so unfair. Everyone else is smiling and laughing, but he just looks...broken. How could he even be okay with this situation? Does he really think we don't know how much it hurts him? He's been through hell, lost his wife, and now he's being forced to watch her having fun with someone else?! Doesn't he realize that he's losing everything he ever had? This is insane! He's probably thinking about how he'll never see his wife again, how he'll never hold her hand again, and how he'll never wake up to her loving smile. But no, he gets to stand here and act like everything is fine while the rest of us are suffering inside. The worst part is that he's probably thinking about how our class will treat him differently now. We won't look at him the same way anymore. He'll start"

I feel so guilty for even reading it; it's just a reminder of what could've been. I wish they'd stop bringing it up. Why can't we just focus on the good times instead? They're always saying things like \"Your mom wanted you to be happy\" and \"She would want you to move on.\" But what about all the times she told me she couldn't wait until I finished school? Or when she said she felt so proud watching me graduate? Does none of that count? It's so unfair. People keep talking about my dad, how he's trying his best, but nobody cares about him. Everyone's always focusing on me, like I'm the problem. I don't even care about the poem anymore; I just hate seeing people act like they know more than they actually do. I swear, every time someone mentions my mom, it feels like they're rubbing it in my face. I wish they'd just leave me alone. This whole thing is exhausting.

I feel like crying, but I won’t let myself cry right now because it’ll make me look weak. He’s probably just joking around, saying he’s buying them an engagement ring, but then he actually does it! And I’ll be left alone again, no one will understand my pain. What if he leaves me for good this time? Or what if he changes his mind about divorce and wants us back? It feels like every time we talk, he says he loves me until the next day when he forgets, and then he breaks up with me again. My life sucks. What if he never comes back? My brain is racing, I need to calm down, but I think about these scenarios all night. What if he goes back to his old ways and doesn’t care about our children anymore?

It's clear she's moved on, maybe even found someone else already. That must mean she's happier now than ever before. Why would I want to hold onto something that's clearly gone? It's ridiculous to think otherwise, isn't it? The way things are, I shouldn't feel this way. I know she's busy with work, but she could have made time for me. If she cared enough, she wouldn't ignore me like this. I'm not even mad anymore; I've just given up hope. It was never meant to last anyway, so why bother clinging to something that's going nowhere? At least I'm better off without her, living alone with no distractions. I don't need anyone else when I have myself. My life is fine without her, and she knows it. Maybe if I just focus on being independent, I'll realize how much better this is for both of us. She doesn't deserve me, and I certainly don’t deserve her.

My mind constantly jumps back to tasks I've left undone or deadlines looming, making it impossible for me to fully disconnect from work. The thought of taking a day off feels like a luxury I can't afford, even if it would give me some much-needed respite. I know intellectually that taking time off is essential for productivity and overall well-being, but emotionally, I struggle to see it that way. I feel trapped in this mindset where every spare moment is tied to work, making it hard to imagine a future outside of it. This sense of perpetual obligation makes me wonder if I'll ever truly have a break, let alone enjoy one. Every pause in work feels like a loss, and I worry that if I don't stay busy, I'll lose touch with everything else in life.

No hum of the television, no soft murmurs of conversation over dinner. Just an eerie silence that seemed to swallow him whole.

He picked up the sweater, bringing it to his face, inhaling deeply, searching for a trace of her scent. But all he could smell was the faint detergent from the last wash.\n\nA knock at the door startled him. He dropped the sweater, his heart pounding in his chest.

As she sat there, surrounded by the familiar sights of her office, she began to wonder if anyone else ever felt this way. Was she truly the only one who struggled to keep up with life?
