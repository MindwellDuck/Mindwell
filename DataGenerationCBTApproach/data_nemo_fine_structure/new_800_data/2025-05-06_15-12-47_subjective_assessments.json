The clock's hands moved silently towards midnight, each tick a reminder that tomorrow would bring another anniversary without her.

A soft drizzle against the windowpane was the only sound breaking the silence, each droplet a tear falling from the sky mirroring his own unshed ones.

We were meant to be together, but I messed up. Now he's living with her, making plans for the future, while I'm stuck here, alone. Every time I look at the ring on the counter, it makes me want to scream. It’s like a constant reminder of what I’ve lost. I feel like I’m losing myself too. I used to be happy, laughing with friends, but now every day feels like a burden. Every conversation is awkward, every smile forced. I can’t help but wonder if anyone will ever understand what happened between us. Maybe he doesn’t even care anymore; maybe he just wants to move on. But I won’t let him. I won’t give up. I’ll make things right, no matter what it takes. I have to try, because if I don’t, who will? But deep down, I know I might already be too late.

I swear, if I had a dollar for every time someone said something like that, I’d be able to afford a decent lunch by now. It's so frustrating. I feel like I'll never catch up, like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of disappointment. Every time I see him with his perfect smile, I feel like I need to go home and cry.

Maybe I'll even try using these new-fangled smartphones everyone talks about, but they seem so... sterile compared to what I had. That computer will always be special because it was mine, and it taught me how to draw and paint in ways I never thought possible."

After all, she was the one who taught him everything he knew. The way he smiled made her feel like she was doing something right, even if it wasn't entirely intentional. But then there were those moments where he seemed distant, lost in thought. Maybe she should've done more to support him, to bring him out of his shell. She wished she could turn back time and give him the attention he needed. Perhaps if she'd seen signs earlier, things would have turned out differently. Yet, deep down, she felt a pang of guilt, knowing that maybe some things were beyond her control. It’s natural to want the best for everyone you care about, isn’t it?
