I've been working for 12 fucking hours straight, and now I'm supposed to be grateful for getting to sit here by myself in the dark? No one cares how much I'm struggling out there. They don't know it takes everything out of me to get through each day. Every meal is a reminder that I'm failing somehow. If I can't even be bothered to eat, then maybe I shouldn't expect anyone else to give a shit about me. And when someone asks if I'm still hungry, it feels like an insult. It's like they think I'm some kind of loser who can't handle a simple question. When I tell them no, I feel like I'm saying more than just a simple \"no\" - I'm admitting defeat. That I've given up, that life is just too fucking hard. I look around this place, and everyone's smiling and laughing together. But I'm just over here, feeling like a total piece of shit. And you know what? I'd rather starve than keep pretending everything is okay when it's not. I mean, what's wrong with being hungry? Is it really that bad to admit when you're not hungry? Or am I just too weak to even try anymore?"

That's why this photo hurts so much; it reminds me of everything we had, and everything we've lost. The more I look at him, the clearer my mind becomes. I can't help but think about all the times we were together. He would tell me stories about our friends, and I'd listen, mesmerized by his enthusiasm. Even now, I hear those same words in my head, reminding me of the good times. I wish I could go back to those days, just for a moment. If only time didn't move forward, if only I could stay young again. But life doesn't work that way. Instead, I'm left here, alone, trying to find solace in these memories. Maybe someday I'll learn to let go, but until then, I'll keep looking at pictures of us. They're all I have left of him, and they give me strength. I guess you could say I'm holding onto these moments because they remind me of who he was—kind, caring, and full of laughter. When I look at photos, I feel closer to him, and that makes me feel better."

Whatever it was, it made me wonder if things had truly changed between them. But then I realized—she never did. They never did. Every word, every sentence, every line was just another reminder of what could have been. What could’ve been, but wasn’t. And yet, here we are, stuck in this cycle of missed opportunities and unresolved emotions. My mind is consumed by the thought of what might have been if only— If only she had seen it differently, if only they’d understood each other better, if only— No. There’s no use dwelling on the past. We can’t change what’s already happened, but maybe, just maybe, we can learn from it. Maybe there’s still a chance for— There’s always a chance, isn’t there? Even now, when she’s gone, I still feel like there’s some part of me holding onto— Holding onto what? Hope? Something more? Whatever it is, I know it won’t last long. Eventually, reality sets in, and you’re left with nothing but the echoes of your own making. And that’s exactly where I am right"
