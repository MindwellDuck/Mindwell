She kept saying how beautiful it was and how much effort went into it. But then I started thinking about our conversation last week—she said she'd like me to take some classes to improve my skills. When I mentioned that I might need to drop out of those classes because they're expensive, she seemed disappointed. Now, I'm wondering if she's disappointed with my whole body of work, considering we've been married for 20 years. Am I just not good enough? What if she's lost faith in me? Maybe she thinks I'll never be as talented as my friend who got that show. My mind is racing with thoughts of what could have been if I had taken those classes. If only I’d invested more time and money in myself, I wouldn’t feel this way. But now it feels like there’s no turning back. I don't know if I can keep going like this."

What if someone had seen you?” His brow furrowed. “Do you know how worried I was when I got the call? We didn’t even get a chance to talk about it before you showed up here, looking like you’d just rolled out of bed.” Her face reddened. “So now you’re blaming me for everything? You always do this.

He'd been feeling it for weeks now - a gnawing unhappiness that seemed to seep into every aspect of his life, coloring everything with its dreary hue.\n\nThe kitchen door swung open, and she walked in, her usually cheerful demeanor replaced by a tight smile. She was his partner, both in business and in life, but tonight there was no warmth in her eyes as they met his. \"Table six is complaining about their meal,\" she said softly, too softly.\n\nHe felt a pang of irritation, but it was quickly overshadowed by the familiar weight of unhappiness.

The kitchen was already emptying out, the other cooks finishing their shifts and heading home.
