He couldn't imagine working anywhere else; every other job seemed dull compared to what he had built. His mind wandered to the many hours he'd spent honing his skills, only to have it all taken away. Even though he knew it wasn't realistic, he found himself wondering if he could somehow \"rebuild\" his life within the company's walls. The idea felt almost impossible, yet it persisted in his thoughts. As he looked around the empty space once filled with colleagues, he felt isolated, even from those who had been laid off. He couldn't shake the sense that he was alone in his feelings, that no one understood how much this job meant to him. It was as if he was being forced to choose between two extremes: either he quit immediately, abandoning everything he had worked for, or he stayed and waited out the inevitable, hoping against hope that things would change. Either way, the outcome seemed bleak. In his mind, there were only two possibilities: either he would leave the company, ending his career, or stay and continue working under uncertain conditions.
