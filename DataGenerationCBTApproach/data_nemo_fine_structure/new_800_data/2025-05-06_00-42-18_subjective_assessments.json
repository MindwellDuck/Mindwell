A bouquet of fresh roses sat on the teacher's desk, but there were no signs of them being hers. Instead, the card read, \"To Mrs. L., our rockstar,\" which seemed out of place since she wasn't the one who brought them. This little detail didn't sit well with me, and I couldn't help but think that maybe she was trying to draw attention to herself. Now, let's say someone else had seen this same situation, they might have reacted differently. For instance, another student could have simply looked away and continued with their studies, ignoring the whole thing. However, I felt compelled to bring it up with Mrs. L., hoping she'd understand how this could be perceived as insensitive. But honestly, it just made me more annoyed, and I ended up writing an email about it. Maybe I'm overreacting, but it's hard not to feel upset when someone seems to be trying to overshadow others. What do you think? Should I keep an eye on her? Maybe she'll learn to appreciate the small things. Or am I just being too sensitive?"

She hesitated, then said softly, \"I'm sorry, you're one number off.\" She watched the woman's face fall, disappointment etched deep in the lines of her age.

So I ended up staying home alone, feeling empty and sad. But then, this other thing happened. A friend told me about someone else who died, and I immediately started thinking about my mom. We were close, we used to talk every day, and she was always there for me. When she passed away, I felt like I'd lost half of myself. And now, seeing people around my age die, it hits me hard. It was like I saw an old picture of us, and suddenly I remembered how much she loved playing bingo. My grandma used to play all the time, and whenever she came over, it was like a mini-celebration. I remember how happy she'd get when she won, and how proud she'd be of herself. Even though it was just a simple game, it brought her such joy. Seeing that woman on stage, covering those squares, reminded me of how much my mom would have enjoyed it too."
