The charred remnants reminded her of his words, \"Your carelessness betrays your hatred for yourself.\" Her grip tightened around the scouring pad as the familiar venom surged within her. She imagined the face of her estranged daughter, the very image that had haunted her dreams last night. The kitchen clock ticked loudly, echoing the passage of time since they'd last spoken. With each stroke against the pan, she felt the hatred intensify, burning hotter than any flame could ever ignite.",

A faint smile played on her lips as she recalled the conversation between two women she’d met at a dinner party. They were discussing their children’s progress; one spoke about her son’s exceptional grades, while the other shared stories of her daughter's natural talents. As she listened, the woman mentioned her own child was struggling to keep up, but the speaker didn't let it bother her. Instead, she expressed gratitude for every moment spent together, no matter how small, and encouraged her friend to see the beauty in those everyday moments. When asked if she worried about her child's struggles, she replied, “It’s unfair to compare our kids. We can’t control everything.” The second woman nodded in agreement, saying, “You're right. There are so many things we can't change. Let’s focus on what we can.” As she continued to wash dishes, a memory surfaced. A few years ago, she had been struggling to find meaning after her husband’s sudden passing. Her daughter was 16 then, and life felt empty. One day, she decided to take her to a concert, hoping music would bring some joy back into her world. But instead of enjoying herself, her daughter became upset over something trivial—a song that reminded them of him. After the show, her daughter broke down, and she found herself feeling guilty for trying to distract her from grief. Now, as she washed dishes, she realized that"

They can just tell me how to fix it themselves since they're always doing that anyway. And another thing, why do people assume I must have broken the jar somehow?
