I know they don't hate me. But still, every time I see one of those notes, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I'm going to throw up. It's crazy how much anxiety these stupid notes give me. And honestly, I think I need some help. These notes are starting to make me paranoid about everything. # Edit For everyone asking why I didn’t mention that she had previously shown this kind of behavior, here’s an update: She has indeed shown offhand behavior towards students in the past. However, she does acknowledge this and says she regrets it. She also says she has changed her approach since then and is working on becoming more patient and understanding. So while this isn't entirely new information, it does add context to the situation. Perhaps I could have phrased it differently? Or maybe it would have made sense if she was talking about another teacher who showed similar behavior? Either way, I hope this clears things up! # Update **Edit2** Just wanted to clarify something. This post wasn’t meant to attack her at all. I understand that we can all have bad days sometimes. So please, no mean comments! Just let"

But now he thinks I’m cheating on him again because I didn’t tell him about a few old friends who might be interested in getting together. Why does he always think the worst? Can’t he see that I love him? This is all so unfair! If only he could understand how much I care for him, maybe he wouldn’t be so angry right now. It doesn’t help that he has this habit of assuming I’m lying to him, which makes me feel even more hurt. I know he wants to protect me from getting hurt, but honestly, I can take care of myself. Still, every time he gets suspicious, he jumps to conclusions. It’s so annoying! Why can’t he just give me a chance to explain myself before jumping to conclusions?

He’d been so full of life just hours before, his laughter echoing through the halls. Now, all she could think about was that day, standing over his still form, feeling his limp hand slip from hers.

Maybe it was just another lazy intern who didn’t care about accuracy, or maybe it was some higher-up who thought they were above the law. Either way, the blame lay squarely elsewhere. At least it wasn't her own incompetence. If anything, she felt pretty confident about her work. So why did everyone seem to be taking advantage of her? Wasn't she the one who always went above and beyond to make sure things got done right? Maybe it was just a coincidence that every time something went wrong, it ended up being someone else’s fault.
