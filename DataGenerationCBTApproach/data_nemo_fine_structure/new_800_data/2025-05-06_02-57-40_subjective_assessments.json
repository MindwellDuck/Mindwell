This isn't some fucking game where we play \"forget\" and move on. We've been through too much together. The way things ended weren't fair to either of us, and you know it. How could you even suggest I'm just going to forget everything we shared? That our memories meant nothing? What, are you insane? You want me to act like everything was fine when it wasn't? Like nothing changed between us? And then there's this stupid picture! A memory that's supposed to make me feel something other than anger and resentment. Are you kidding me? You think I can just look at that and remember how great things were between us? It's not fucking funny; it's painful. And yet you expect me to just put my life back together with you, pretending nothing happened? You really have no idea what it means to lose someone you care about. Do you think I'd be able to just \"get over it\" if it was easy? If it didn't hurt? No, and you fucking well know it!

My dad is going to get teased mercilessly at home for being too young for these workshops. He's always saying he doesn't need them, but now they'll probably take him away from me. I feel like such a loser, and I know my parents are going to hate me. They've been counting on me to help out with Dad's health issues, and this is exactly what they needed. I'm going to regret this forever. Why did I click \"Reply All\"? Why didn't I just say \"forward\" in the first place? I know I shouldn't be embarrassed, but I can't stop thinking about how ridiculous I must look.

Now, when I look back at the painting he chose, my mind keeps going back to his reaction. The way he laughed at another artist's work seemed so different from mine. It wasn't that he didn’t like my painting - we had talked about it, and he said he appreciated it. But tonight, he clearly preferred this other woman’s piece. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but seeing him laugh made me feel...off. Like I’m being left behind in some way. I know he thinks I'm his favorite, but hearing him say \"this one\" instead of \"that one,\" which is mine, made me feel like I'd lost ground somehow. It's not fair to think this way, but I feel like he prefers her over me. I don't want to believe that, but every little detail makes me wonder if there's more to it than I realize. Maybe I’m just being jealous because I’ve been struggling with my own creativity lately, and seeing him so carefree with someone else’s work is hard to swallow.

No one ever thinks about how long it takes us to restock or process orders. It’s all just about getting what they need as quickly as possible.
