She'd stayed up until midnight, marking them meticulously, yet today they mock her, a testament to her endless toil. It's not even noon when she hears it - the harsh, grating sound of chalk against blackboard, followed by a collective groan from her students. She turns around, rage simmering within her, to see Johnny, once again, leaning back in his chair, feet resting on the desk, chalk dusting his hair. He smirks at her, challenge gleaming in his eyes.

I'll never forgive him for this betrayal. It's such a huge mistake, especially considering how much I've sacrificed for our family. My entire life has been about his career, and now it feels like everything has been for nothing. Every time I think back to those days, I feel like I wasted my potential because of him. He didn't even have the decency to apologize properly; instead, he just acted like nothing happened. How could he do that? Doesn't he know how much I love him? But what really gets under my skin is how he thinks he can just do whatever he wants and get away with it. He's always been arrogant, but now it's more than that—it's infuriating. I remember how we used to talk about our shared goals, and he promised to help me achieve mine. Now, I realize he never intended to follow through. All along, he was secretly planning to steal my ideas and claim them as his own. It's just so fucked up.

It wasn't fair; I remember how he would take care of me, make me feel special. He never seemed to get tired of my constant needs, but when we broke up, he didn't even try to keep in touch. He just disappeared. That hurt more than anything else. I wish he hadn’t been such an easy target. Everyone could see how much he cared about me. Even after we split, he kept showing up at work, asking for advice and listening to everything I had to say. His kindness made me realize just how selfish I’d been. If only I had shown some of that love too... He might’ve been perfect for everyone else, but he was mine alone. I don’t know why he let me go so easily. Did he ever truly love me? Or was I just another person he saw no reason to hold onto? If only I had been good enough for him, maybe things wouldn’t have ended like this. Maybe if I’d been prettier, smarter, or stronger, he’d stay. Instead, I lost him, and now I’m left here, feeling like nothing but a memory—a ghost haunting what used to be our life"

It's hard not to take it personally when you feel so deeply connected to these creatures. You form bonds with them, learn from them, and rely on them for companionship. To see them vanish without warning is heart-wrenching, especially after the events surrounding their disappearance. This event shook me to my core. I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if they were still there, if we could've worked together to find a solution. But now, I'm left with nothing but questions and grief. In the days since, I've struggled to come to terms with what happened. Every time I think about those mice, I'm reminded of all I've lost. Their absence has left a void within me, one that feels impossible to fill. For me, this incident serves as a harsh reminder of the fragility of life and our connections with others. Even in the most unexpected ways, we can lose everything we hold dear.

Every time she looked at it, she felt like she had to decide which version of him she wanted to hold onto. If she chose the happier memory, she couldn’t bear the pain of losing him all over again. But if she embraced the sadness, she’d be drowning in grief, unable to move forward. Her mind refused to accept anything else, forcing her into this binary choice, where either path led to unbearable consequences. She remembered how they used to laugh together, how they shared stories of their dreams, and how they promised each other that no matter what happened, they'd always have each other’s backs. Now, those memories were tainted by the knowledge that she had broken his trust, shattered his hope, and ultimately took away his life. With every glance at the photo, she felt torn between holding onto the joy they once shared or being consumed by the sorrow that followed. She wondered if she could ever find peace, or if she was forever trapped in this endless cycle of regret and longing.
