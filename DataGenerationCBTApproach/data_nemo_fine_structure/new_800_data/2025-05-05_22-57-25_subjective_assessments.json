You probably feel like shit, but honestly, I'm surprised you haven't figured it out yet. Do you still think they're going to come back to visit? Ha! They wouldn't bother coming here anyway; why would they waste their time thinking about you? It's over. You need to move on. Maybe if you spent more time focusing on yourself instead of dwelling on what could have been, you'd realize how lucky you are to have such wonderful people in your life. But no, you're too busy feeling sorry for yourself. What's wrong with you? Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you think you're doing the right thing by giving them space, but trust me, they're not going to miss you. In fact, I'm pretty sure they're enjoying their newfound freedom from you. You’re just making this harder than it needs to be. Don’t try to cling to something that’s gone. Instead, focus on rebuilding your own life. There are plenty of things you can do to keep yourself busy and happy. But deep down, I wonder if you’re secretly jealous of how easily they’ve moved on.

She just wants to get out of there before things fall apart. ## Step 1: Identify the Problem She knows something's wrong when she sees herself struggling to keep up with demands. It's like trying to hold back a wave, but no matter how hard she tries, it just gets bigger. She feels overwhelmed by all the responsibilities piled on her, especially since everyone else seems to handle theirs so easily. It makes her feel inadequate, like she's always one step behind. ## Step 2: Recognize Patterns Every time she thinks about quitting, she remembers how much she hates her next job interview. This pattern repeats over and over, making her question whether she'll ever find happiness. Why does it have to be this way? Why can't she just have a smooth transition? ## Step 3: Analyze the Situation Her anxiety spikes when she's told to take on more work. The pressure builds until she feels like she's going to explode. She can't even focus on simple tasks because everything reminds her of what she needs to do. Even small things—like a phone call or an email—become huge burdens that make her want to pull her hair"

Her hand trembled slightly as she picked up the napkin, its creases now bearing the weight of memories that seemed to fade with each passing day. She remembered how he would hold hers, his fingers intertwining with hers in a gentle grasp that felt like home. His laughter, too, lingered—a low, soothing hum that still resonated within her heart. Yet, even as these memories washed over her, the ache remained—the realization that his smile could never be seen again. In the silence of the café, the only sound was her breathing, steady but laced with a quiet desperation. It was a reminder that some things were beyond repair, and yet, she clung to the hope that perhaps, just perhaps, there might be something more waiting for him out there—a chance to rediscover joy, to relive moments like those they had shared. But the reality of his absence hung heavy, a constant reminder that sometimes, no matter how hard we cling to what’s left, it can never truly be restored. As I sat here, surrounded by the familiar comforts of our old haunts, all I could think about was how different everything looked without him. Even the simple"
