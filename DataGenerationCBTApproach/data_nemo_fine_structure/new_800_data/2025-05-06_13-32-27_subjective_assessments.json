The way he looks at her, so full of warmth and genuine interest, is just another reminder of what I've been missing. Her smile, though genuine, holds no depth anymore. It's just a mask, a facade to hide her own disappointment. And when she touches him, her hand brushes against mine, a fleeting brush that speaks volumes about where her true affections lie. Every time I try to open up to her, every attempt at sharing my struggles falls flat. She's distant, always finding excuses to be busy. When I confront her about it, she just says I need to \"relax\" and \"not take things too seriously.\" Relax?! Does she think I have nothing better to do than sit around all day, waiting for someone who doesn’t even seem to value my presence? This isn't just about replacing me; it’s about erasing me.

Every positive experience was tainted by the crushing weight of her new reality, making it impossible to find any real meaning in anything she'd done. It didn't matter if she'd poured her heart into her columns; the loss still stung, and the grief made her question whether anything she'd ever written truly mattered.

Sometimes, taking a step back helps people regain focus. We could try to simplify things together, see if that makes it easier for him. Who knows, maybe he needs someone to show him the way. But deep down, I think he’s losing interest. All those years of tinkering with machines, and now they just don’t work. I can understand why he feels frustrated – after all, it’s frustrating to struggle with something you used to master easily. Still, I worry about him. He must be feeling really overwhelmed right now, and I wish there was a way to make things easier for him. Maybe we could look into some new tools or techniques that would give him more confidence.
