She’d come over sometimes, and I thought maybe she felt something for me too, but she didn’t. Now she’s probably with someone better than me. I can’t even imagine how pathetic she found me. She used to make my life hell. She made me feel worthless when she called me names behind my back. I thought she loved me, but it was all a lie. If only I had been prettier, more confident, or stronger. Then I wouldn’t have ended up alone. But I still have this stupid habit of looking at her pictures. It reminds me of what could’ve been if only I were different. I hate myself for feeling this way. Maybe I’m not as bad as everyone says. Maybe there’s hope left for me. I wish I could go back in time and change things, but I know that’s impossible. All I can do is keep suffering. I’ll keep staring at those pictures, hoping she comes back. What if she does? What if she decides she loves me after all? I won’t give up. I won’t stop dreaming about us together again."

I've tried talking about it, I really have. But every time we talk about it, she just brushes it off, telling me everything will be fine and that she loves me no matter what. She says she needs space, and that's exactly how it feels—a big, empty space between us. It's like I don't exist unless there's a show to attend, and then suddenly I'm back in her eyes again, but for how long? It hurts when I see other couples holding hands or laughing together. They're always happy, never worried about anything except maybe where they'll find their next date. Meanwhile, I'm left with this fucking painting that I can barely stand to look at anymore—it's supposed to be my masterpiece, but it looks more like a mess.

After all, we have our own problems. We’re having some issues with intimacy lately, and I know he’s stressed out about work. Maybe he’s just needing some release, some distraction from the chaos in his head. I can relate—it’s tough balancing life and work sometimes—but does he really need to spend so much time on that phone? Does he forget I’m here, watching him, feeling like a fool every time he thinks no one is paying attention? Maybe I’m overreacting, but that smile of his—ugh, it makes me want to scream.

This situation feels like one of those situations where you wish you could turn back time. We should keep this quiet until the doctor orders further tests. If she has something serious, we shouldn’t burden her with unnecessary details right away. It’s always better to wait and see how things develop rather than stirring up anxiety unnecessarily. Some wounds are better left untouched, after all. I hope her story ends well, whatever that means. Sometimes it’s easier to leave things unsaid, especially when they’re painful.
