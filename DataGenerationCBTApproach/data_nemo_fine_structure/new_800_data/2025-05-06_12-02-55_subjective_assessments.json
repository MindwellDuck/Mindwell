I was looking forward to this day for so long—my birthday. I had plans with friends, new gifts, and maybe some fun surprises. But what does it matter? Everyone always says “you’ll have better days ahead,” but when you’re stuck in a rut like me, how can they guarantee that? Every year is the same shit. People think it’s easy being an introvert. No one understands. They say things like “just go out more” or “make new friends.” Easy? Are you kidding me? You don’t know anything about living with anxiety. I’ve tried everything: therapy, medication, self-help books. Nothing works. And these people who tell me to “just let go” or “relax”? Relax?! Do you know what it feels like to live with depression? To wake up every day, dreading life because nothing makes sense anymore? It’s all just a joke to them. They don’t care if I’m miserable. They don’t see how hard it is. Even my family doesn’t get it. They say things like “oh, you’re just stressed” or “it’s okay, we’ll get through this together.” But what if I told them that yes, I am stressed, and I feel like I’m"

The thought alone brings her to her knees, overwhelmed by the weight of her own insignificance. Every moment is a reminder of the futility that surrounds her—each breath, each heartbeat, each passing second feels like an eternity of loneliness. In this desolate space, she clings to the memories of a love that has been extinguished, a flame that once burned so bright now reduced to nothing but ashes. The pain cuts deep, forcing her to confront the reality that she may never find solace again. Every step forward leads further away from hope, leaving her with nothing but the bitter taste of disappointment. Her mind races with questions: How could something so beautiful have come to such an end? What could she have done differently? Why did he leave? The answers, like the light, remain elusive, taunting her with their absence. It’s as if time itself has turned against her, every tick of the clock a cruel reminder of all she’s lost. Even the silence is oppressive, heavy with the weight of unspoken words and unresolved emotions. In this bleak environment, even the simplest tasks feel monumental, a constant reminder that she’s just another forgotten thing, left behind in the chaos of life. Her days blend together, each one a blur of sorrow and longing, a cycle of pain that refuses to let go. And yet,"

Every woman he meets is instantly drawn to him – they love talking about him. They want to hear stories about how he saved lives as an ER doc. They’re fascinated by his adventurous travel plans. And they adore the way he looks, like he just stepped off the cover of a men’s magazine. My life feels like a dull, monotonous routine compared to his. While he’s out enjoying himself, I’m dealing with the aftermath of another long shift. My days blend together in a blur of paperwork and endless meetings. No one seems interested in me; everyone’s too busy with their own lives. It’s like I don’t exist except when they need something from me. It doesn’t help that my divorce papers are still sitting in my desk drawer. I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, like all my dreams have been shattered. Why bother trying to improve things when everything seems doomed? Maybe I should just give up now and move back in with my parents.

Even the thought of going back to work made her stomach turn with anxiety. How could anyone expect her to put on a brave face after everything she'd been through? She felt like she was drowning in sorrow, and no one seemed to understand.

I wonder what if my partner had been right all along? What if he'd been trying to protect me from myself this whole time? Maybe I shouldn't have let him downvote my submission; maybe I should've just trusted him completely instead of questioning his judgment. But now, every single day feels like I'm walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm constantly worrying about being seen as incompetent, about people doubting my abilities. It's like my brain keeps telling me one thing while my instincts scream another. I feel like I’m trapped in this cycle of fear and anxiety, unable to escape. Even when I try to focus on my work, I find myself obsessing over worst-case scenarios—each mistake becoming a potential disaster, each failure a crushing blow to my dreams.

That branch was really gone, he was certain of it. But why would it come back? Why now? He couldn't make sense of it. All he knew was that it wasn't going to happen. Not here, not now. He felt so calm, so secure, even though his mind screamed at him to panic. There was no room for doubt; it was either everything was fine, or something terrible was coming. Either he was safe, or disaster loomed. He didn't want to consider that possibility. He just wanted to ignore it, pretend nothing was happening. He tried to convince himself that it was probably just a bird or a squirrel, but deep down, he knew better. Whatever it was, it was definitely back. And if it wasn't, then where were those birds? Where were they all? Why did he hear this one, alone, tapping out a rhythm? He shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts.

Didn't she see how hard he was working? \"I feel like you're losing your edge,\" she began, her voice laced with a gentle yet firm urgency. Her eyes locked onto his, piercing through the haze of uncertainty that had settled around him. She knew exactly what he needed to hear, even though he couldn’t quite articulate it himself.

Even his plants were meticulously placed, their leaves arranged in a symmetrical pattern, unlike the wild tangles he remembered from his childhood. As he gazed back at the photo, he noticed the faint lines etched into the walls of the old house. Cracks spread across the facade, signs of neglect that seemed to mock him. Meanwhile, his own walls were pristine, free from such imperfections. It was as if time itself had ravaged his former life, leaving scars that could never be erased. His gaze drifted away from the picture, focusing instead on the beauty of his present. In this moment, he realized that his life wasn’t about comparing himself to others; it was about embracing the perfection he already possessed.
