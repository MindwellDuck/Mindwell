The thought sent a chill down her spine, her breath quickening. How could he not understand that her anxiety was real? “I don’t want to leave my paintings unattended,” she shouted, frustration boiling over. “They’re all I have left from my family. If something happens to me, they’ll be destroyed. And now, thanks to you, we might lose everything else too.” Her voice rose, a crescendo of emotion pouring out. “You never listen to me. You always dismiss my fears. Now, I feel like I’m losing control. Maybe I shouldn’t have even tried to warn him about the fire drill.” She crossed her arms, eyes flashing with anger. “If he had listened, maybe we wouldn’t be in this mess.

Meanwhile, he just sits here, never showing affection towards me. Doesn't he know how much I need love from him? How could he be so heartless? This has been going on for too long; I've had enough. If I don't get something out of this marriage, why bother staying? We've talked about divorce before, but I thought maybe things would change. Maybe he'll finally show some emotion, some love. But no, everything remains the same. Every time I try to talk to him, he shuts down, telling me I'm overreacting, being dramatic, or making a big deal out of nothing. The worst part is that he doesn't even seem to care. He just looks at me, empty eyes staring back, like I'm nothing more than a burden to him. He's always made fun of my feelings, told me I was too sensitive, that I needed to toughen up. Now, I realize that's exactly what I have to do if I want to survive this nightmare.

Even when I'm struggling to keep up, he doesn't say anything. If he did, I'd probably break down right there at my station, but instead, he just keeps working. It's infuriating that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to match his speed and skill. And now that we're both on our breaks together, she realizes just how little they talk. They don't seem to care about the same things. She wonders why anyone would want to spend their free time with someone like this, especially since he has an actual girlfriend. This isn't the first time she's felt jealous. When she started working, she had big dreams and hoped to become a top chef. Now, she's just trying to survive. But while others excel, she struggles to create something simple. Her mind is always telling her she's wasting her life by staying here, especially after seeing him get compliments on his work.

When I thought about it more, I realized that maybe I was overreacting. If she didn’t get an invitation, then she must not be important enough to them.
