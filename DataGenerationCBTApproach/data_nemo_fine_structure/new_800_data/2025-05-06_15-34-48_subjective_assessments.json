It was from little Jamie, the boy who always sat alone at recess. He'd written, \"I wish you were my mom. My real one doesn't care.\" Her heart ached as she smoothed out the paper, his childish handwriting barely legible through tear stains. She felt a familiar pang of unhappiness, a quiet despair that echoed with unspoken words and unfulfilled wishes.",

What does it even mean? Does he think I'm some kind of superhero, magically able to replace every single mother in this world? Or is he just trying to get attention? Why would he write such a thing if he didn’t have a problem with his own family? This isn’t exactly surprising, though. Little Jamie has been struggling lately. His parents are going through divorce, and I’ve seen him come home crying after school. But honestly, how did I not notice before? Maybe it’s because I’m too busy with my own life. Maybe he thought writing this would make an impact. If so, he clearly failed miserably. Who am I supposed to contact now? The teacher? I don’t even know what to do. This is ridiculous. It feels like a cruel joke. Of course, he’d want a mother like me. I’m the best thing that could happen to him, right? Why wouldn’t he choose me? Doesn’t he see how much joy I bring to children? I’m the perfect role model—smart, kind, and beautiful. Little Jamie probably thinks he’ll never find anyone better than me. He’s already won the lottery by getting me. What more could he possibly ask for? I guess this means I need to take on another"

She pours herself a glass of wine, the clink of the bottle against the rim too loud in the quiet.

It’s just natural to assume he’s busy or preoccupied. But what if he’s genuinely avoiding her? Maybe he’s tired of being asked about his job or wants some space after their breakup. If she keeps pushing, she might end up hurting his feelings again. This situation shows me that people are complex, never fully understanding each other's needs until they're hurt. For instance, my sister and I were fighting last night because we couldn't agree on whose turn it was to clean up after dinner. We both thought we knew what the other wanted, but our assumptions led to frustration. She assumed I didn't want to help, while I felt she wasn't taking responsibility for her part. Our argument escalated into a full-blown fight, and now we're not speaking. This incident highlights how misunderstandings can quickly escalate into bigger problems, much like how one small misunderstanding between two coworkers could damage their working relationship forever."

He was supposed to be presenting at a conference, but he ended up skipping it because he got distracted by watching his ex laugh with her new partner. The way they were together just made me feel uncomfortable, even though I’ve been divorced for years. When I saw him, he seemed really upset, but I don’t think that’s entirely justified. I mean, we’re both professionals, after all. It's not like he has a right to feel jealous or something. I tried talking to him, but he just kept saying he didn't want to \"get into it\" and how he needed to focus on work. That sounds pretty fake to me. If he was really that upset, wouldn't he have said something about it? It makes me wonder if he's just trying to cover it up. Like, why else would someone act like they're okay when they clearly aren't? I told him I thought he might be overreacting, but he just shrugged it off and went back to his presentation. I'm starting to think he's more dramatic than I gave him credit for. Maybe he needs some time to get over himself, but it's hard to tell when you can't see inside someone's head. Still, I hope he gets his act together soon. We need people who can handle stress professionally"

Maybe we could have found happiness, maybe we could have changed the course of our lives. But now, all I am left with is this empty house, these painful memories, and the regret that fills my heart. I keep thinking about how different everything would be if only things had turned out differently. If only we had met sooner, if only we had talked more, if only we had tried harder. I feel like every moment counts now, and yet I’m stuck in the past, reliving the same memories over and over. What if we had been together longer? What if we had known each other sooner? What if we had chosen each other instead of losing each other? But there's no point in dwelling on the what ifs anymore. She’s gone, and I'm left with nothing but the pain of remembering.
