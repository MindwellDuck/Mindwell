The once vibrant colors were now muted and faded, much like her feelings of love and hope that seemed like a distant dream. Her fingers traced the edges of the frame, the cool glass sending an icy chill up her spine. She hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath until it all came rushing out in a heavy sigh. The weight of her past felt heavier than ever as she placed the photo facedown on her desk, a silent vow to not let it consume her again.",

He doesn’t deserve me, but I can’t stop wanting him anyway. I don’t want to die, but I don’t know if I can live anymore. This isn’t fair at all. Life is so unfair, and I feel like I have nothing left to lose. I can’t take it anymore. I need to get away from him. I’m going to leave him. I swear, every time I try to tell myself I’ll stay for his kid, he’s there, reminding me that I shouldn’t care. I shouldn’t care. I won’t care. But what if I do? What if I really do care? No, no, no.

It seemed like every choice was leading me further down a path I didn't want to take. But why couldn't I stop myself? Was it really because I lacked talent, or was there something more? It wasn’t until I saw how quickly my mind jumped to conclusions about everything—about my future, my worth, even the reason behind my sister’s depression—that I realized I was falling into a pattern. Every time I faced uncertainty, I started imagining all sorts of scenarios that fit into a narrative I’d created for myself. I wasn’t just thinking about what might happen next; I was convinced that I knew exactly what would come next, based on a story I'd built around my fears. I guess it's easier to think we're right when our minds are trying to make sense of things we can't control. My brain was spinning so fast, it made sense to jump to conclusions, especially when I felt trapped by them. Maybe I wasn’t just avoiding reality; maybe I was avoiding myself. But one thing was certain—it was hard to stop the cycle once it started, and it always left me feeling like I was running out of time. This emptiness wasn’t just about the blank canvas"

She could almost smell the stench of his lies, the deceit that had marred their relationship.

He'd never acknowledged his part in ending their life together, and now he was pretending everything was fine?
