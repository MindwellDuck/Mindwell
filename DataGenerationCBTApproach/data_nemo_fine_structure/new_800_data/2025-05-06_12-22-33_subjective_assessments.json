Yet, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he'd abandoned her. Their relationship had always been a balance between work and love, but now it seemed like one side was drowning in deadlines, leaving the other side high and dry. He thought about how much he wanted to make it work, but every day felt like another step away from her. His gaze drifted toward the clock, and he knew he was running out of time. The story wasn't finished yet, and he couldn't just leave her hanging. But why did it feel so easy to push her aside? Hadn't he promised to be there for her through thick and thin? She'd said it so calmly, yet it cut deep. In his mind, he replayed the argument, wondering what he could have done differently. It was as if he was trapped in a loop, unable to move forward. Every decision felt like a choice between two impossible options: give up on everything he believed in or risk losing her forever. As he typed out his response, the words flowed slowly, like he was fighting against an invisible force. He hoped she understood, but a part of him wondered if he deserved such kindness. Maybe it was selfish of him to think he could change now. Maybe he really was too late. In the end, he hit send, hoping for the"

It wasn't even that big of a smile; just a little smirk. But damn, it hurt. I know I shouldn't let something like that get to me, but man, it’s hard not to feel like crap when you see people patting each other on the back for doing the bare minimum. What's worse is that I can’t help thinking it’s because I’m old news. You know? Like, I've been doing this job for decades, and now I'm just seen as outdated. Even though I know I've earned every bit of recognition, it feels like those younger officers are looking down their noses at me. They think I'm just some relic holding on too tight, but deep down, I know I've got a lot more left in me. Still, whenever I see them smiling and laughing together, it makes me feel like an outcast. Maybe I am getting older, and I need to accept it, but damn, it’s tough not letting it bother me. I guess I'll just have to keep pushing myself harder to prove I'm still relevant.

She smiled, a little too brightly, and leaned into him as they walked past my paintings. I could feel her body brushing against mine, but it meant nothing. Nothing at all. As if triggered by some unseen force, my thoughts began to spiral. Why did he move on so quickly? Was he really happy with her? Did she understand what we shared? Had she ever even cared? I couldn’t help but imagine her standing behind him, whispering something in his ear, making him forget about us forever. A shiver ran down my spine as I pictured them laughing together, oblivious to everything else around them. I felt a burning desire to confront them, to make them stop. To tell them that they didn’t know what they were missing. But I couldn't let myself think these things out loud. Not yet. For now, I needed to focus on the present. On letting go.
