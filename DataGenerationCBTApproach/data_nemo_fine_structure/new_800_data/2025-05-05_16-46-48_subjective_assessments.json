But what if I try to run? What if I slip and fall? What if someone sees me? What if they think I’m trying to hide something? This is insane! We’re supposed to be solving crimes, not dealing with this. But what if we’re just making things worse by being here? What if our presence is causing more problems than solutions? What if we accidentally trigger the next victim? How am I supposed to focus when everyone around me is acting so recklessly? What if they don’t even realize how much danger they’re putting themselves in? What if they start a riot because they feel trapped? What if someone gets hurt because of us? Why does no one understand how dangerous this is? Why are we still here? What if we stay any longer? What if we become part of the problem instead of the solution? What if we’re the ones who cause the next tragedy? This is getting out of hand. We have to leave now. But what if we leave and forget about these victims? What if we ignore them"

But she couldn't help but feel a pang of resentment. It wasn't fair that others seemed so carefree, while she struggled to find meaning in anything. Even small victories felt hollow when compared to those around her. Just then, an email from her best friend popped up. They were planning a night out this weekend, complete with drinks and laughter. She tried to respond, but the words stuck in her throat. Why bother? What would it even accomplish? Nothing ever changed, no matter how hard she pushed herself. It just felt like everyone else was living their best life, while she was drowning in her own misery. Her eyes drifted back to the screen, where her boss was still talking. He mentioned something about bonuses, and she felt a twinge of jealousy. Everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves, but she was stuck in her own dark world. Why did they get to experience joy while she was left to struggle? A coworker walked by, and she caught him laughing with a group of people. She felt like a ghost, invisible and insignificant. Another reminder that nothing ever changed. No amount of effort could make things better; it was all just a facade."

But I'm just gonna tell her no and walk away, and then she'll go home and cry herself to sleep because nobody bought her art today. She has to believe that her art is valuable for her to keep going. And maybe she really does see something special about those paintings. Maybe they're so precious to her that she won't give up on them no matter how many people say no. I guess I just need to remind myself that I would feel the same way if I were in her shoes. Yeah, I'd probably try to sell some weird stuff too if I thought it meant everything to me. She might actually be an artist, you know? I mean, I've seen some crazy shit in my life, but this girl looks like she's been living on the streets for years. That's insane!

It doesn't matter if they do - I know the truth, and I'll always stand by it. Don't bother trying to tell me otherwise; I already know. This isn't the first time something like this happens.

He'd been distant, almost distracted, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was bothering him. But when she asked what was wrong, he'd brushed it off, saying everything was fine. Now, as she sat down to eat, she noticed a small note on the table. It read, \"Sorry I'm late.\" The words seemed insincere, especially since he'd been running late multiple times recently. Wasn't he supposed to start working at 8 AM? Hadn't he promised to leave by 7:30? Yet, here"
