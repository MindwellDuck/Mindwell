Her husband had been fixing their old car that morning, and the sudden silence of his tools echoed in her mind as she rushed to the room. The patient's heart rate was plummeting, and she couldn't find the emergency call button. Panic surged within her like a tidal wave, threatening to drown out her years of training.

This is insane. What if there’s nothing we can do? I’m going to die, aren’t I? What if she dies? What if she doesn’t make it? I won’t survive this. I’ll never see my kids grow up again. I’ve always wanted them to go to college, but they’ll never get the chance. How am I supposed to live with myself after this? Why does this keep happening to me? Why can’t anything go smoothly anymore? First, my mom died suddenly, and then my sister passed away in a tragic accident. Now, I feel like I'm trapped in some kind of nightmare. I can’t escape it. If she dies, I’ll lose everything. I won’t be able to pay off our mortgage, let alone save for retirement. We’ll have to move back in with my parents, who barely tolerate each other. They’ll hate living with us; they’re already stressed enough. My kids will suffer because of me, and I can’t even imagine what they’ll think about me when they hear what"

And why is she posting about her life on social media anyway? Doesn’t she realize how insecure people like me feel when they see her perfectly happy posts? It makes me want to cry. Why can’t I be as lucky as her? She has everything – good health, a loving partner, a nice home, and now a brand-new designer handbag. Meanwhile, I struggle to make ends meet, working multiple jobs just to cover my basic needs. But no matter how hard I work, I still feel empty inside. It’s like my dreams are slipping away from me, leaving nothing but disappointment. I wish I could turn back time and relive those moments again. If only I had been more careful with my finances, maybe things wouldn’t have turned out so bad. Now, every day feels like a challenge, each small setback weighing heavily on my mind. My anxiety spikes whenever I see posts like hers, reminding me of what I lack. Why does she have to share these"

She had asked if I thought it would be okay for her to share some memories of her late husband during the party. I hesitated, unsure how to respond. \"I'm sorry,\" I said quietly. \"It's still hard for me to talk about him.\" She looked at me with understanding, her face softening slightly. \"I get it,\" she replied gently. \"But sometimes, laughter helps us cope. We have to keep moving forward.\" Her words resonated with me. I realized that while it might not feel like it now, I did want to see her happy. Maybe I needed to let go of my own grief and allow her to heal in her way. She seemed to sense something in me, too. After all, she hadn't noticed my initial discomfort. Now, as we talked, I"
