Every time I have to tell someone something like this, it's all because they didn't follow my advice. You can say what you want about me being overprotective, but the reality is, if they listen, nothing would go wrong. Now look at what happened to John. He ignores every warning and goes on living as usual, and now he’s lying in a coma, and his wife is left to deal with everything alone. It's not just him, though. I remember another guy, Mike, who refused to wear protective gear when working with chemicals. His colleagues warned him multiple times, but he kept ignoring us until he got poisoned. He ended up in the hospital, and it took him weeks to recover. If he’d listened, none of this would’ve happened. But instead, he went ahead and put everyone else in danger by not wearing proper protection. And now he has to deal with the aftermath. He thought he was invincible, but he paid the price. This isn’t just about Mike or John; it happens all the time. People think they know better, but they"
