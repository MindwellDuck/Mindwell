I wonder how many times she's done this before. Probably loads of times. And you know what? She'll probably do it again tomorrow. And maybe next week too. This is such a waste. If only she were more confident, none of this would happen. But no, she has to go and cry over some silly anniversary. What's wrong with this woman? This is getting ridiculous. Every time he works late, she freaks out. And every time he leaves early, she complains. She's always doing this. Even when they're happy, she finds ways to ruin it.

Her partner probably thinks he's safe from ever having to cook again once they get home. It's infuriating, really – how can she have such a great memory for everything else, yet forget something as obvious as a spice? This is more than just a mistake; it's a betrayal of her own standards. The fact that she can't trust herself to remember something basic makes her wonder how many times she's messed up before.
