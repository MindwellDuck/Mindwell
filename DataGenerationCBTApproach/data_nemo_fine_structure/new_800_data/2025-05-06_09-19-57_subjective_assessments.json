Now, here I am, stuck in this godforsaken town, forced to deal with the same problems that led me to this point. It’s all because I’m weak, unable to take care of myself or protect those around me. This is what happens when you’re too soft and indecisive—people will always take advantage of your lack of strength and push you down until there’s nothing left. If only I could be stronger, more confident, I wouldn’t be in this mess. But no, I had to go and try to change the world by being kind, and look where it got me now. I ended up right back where I started, vulnerable and powerless. Even if I did manage to find a way out, it would never work. Everyone would just take advantage of me, and I’d end up losing everything. That’s how it always goes—the strong survive while the weak are crushed beneath their feet. It’s cruel, but that’s just how it is. This time, though, things might be different. Maybe I can finally escape this nightmare by letting go of my empathy and becoming someone else. Someone who doesn’t have to worry about anyone else’s feelings or well-being. I’ve seen people like that before—they don’t care about anything except themselves. They’ll do whatever it takes to get ahead, even if it"

Their laughter seemed genuine, but what caught her attention was the way they looked at each other. They spoke about their lives, sharing stories and memories, while the rest of the patrons kept to themselves. It was as if they had formed a bond, one that went beyond small talk. Their conversation flowed effortlessly, like they knew each other’s deepest secrets. But why did this seem so familiar? Was it because she had seen this dynamic before, even in her own life? Hadn’t she experienced something similar with her colleagues? They would gather during breaks, talking about their weekends, sharing family stories, and supporting each other through tough times. It was a connection that went deeper than surface-level friendships, one that fostered trust and understanding. Just as those moments with her colleagues had meant more than just catching up, this encounter at the restaurant felt meaningful too. Perhaps it was because both situations reminded her of her time working with her team. They would share stories about their families, their struggles, and their dreams, creating a sense of unity that made them feel like a single unit, rather than individuals. Now, when she saw people laughing together, she couldn’t help but wonder if there was something similar happening here. Maybe these strangers weren"

Tonight, after dinner, she'll probably be gone again tomorrow, leaving me to wonder if our marriage is still worth it. We've talked about divorce before, but what's the point? We're too old for all that drama. So instead of trying to fix things, I just shut down and let the day pass. I guess I'm hoping that someday, somehow, we'll figure out what's missing - maybe it's just the love we thought we were building. Or maybe it's something more. Either way, I'm tired of fighting it, tired of letting fear take control. I just want to move forward, to find some peace. Maybe if I cut through all the noise, I'll finally hear what matters most.
