The patient had been discharged days ago, showing no signs of adverse effects. She feels betrayed and vengeful, the calm exterior of her professional demeanor barely concealing the storm brewing within.",

However, this recent incident has left me feeling deeply shaken, as if the very foundation of my career is being questioned. I keep thinking about how it could have happened—how I might have missed something critical. It’s like my mind keeps replaying the moments leading up to the mistake, wondering what I could’ve done differently. But let’s be real, I know nothing really changed. I didn’t see anything new; it was just another day of work. Maybe I’m just overreacting? Maybe it was just an honest mistake—a small blip in an otherwise flawless record. I try to remind myself that I’ve always been diligent, that I take pride in every interaction with my patients. Yet, deep down, I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle here. I keep telling myself that I need to stay focused, that there’s more at stake than one single mistake, but it’s hard to shake off these doubts. This situation has made me question everything. Was it just a simple oversight, or did I genuinely fail someone who needed me most? I think about all the times I went above and beyond, standing by patients when they were going through tough times, and now it feels like those efforts mean nothing. Maybe I’m just too old, too tired, and too"

If only he’d done things differently, we wouldn’t be here today. Now all he does is work and live in the past. He should’ve prioritized us over his job. Why did he need to move away? We were happy here. This whole thing is fucking bullshit."

It doesn’t help that he’s been talking about how much fun they’re having together lately, especially since they were here last year celebrating their anniversary. Now, seeing them laugh and smile together makes me want to scream. I know I shouldn’t let my jealousy consume me, but honestly, why can’t I just enjoy a meal with my partner when all I see are reminders of everything I’ve lost? This is exactly why I hate coming back here. Even though we booked the reservation months ago, I knew they might show up because they had planned to celebrate their anniversary before they got engaged. But come on, couldn’t they have chosen somewhere else?! Does it really matter if my ex-husband has moved on so quickly? Doesn’t it bother me that they’re already planning their first date after getting married?! Why does it have to be me? Why can’t I just forget about our failed marriage and focus on enjoying our own relationship? Instead, I’m stuck in this pit of sadness, feeling like an idiot every time I see them together. Maybe if I could just get past this, things would be better between us. But no, I keep dwelling on"

One day, he received a call about a young boy named Timothy who had attempted suicide. Dr. A, my mother's friend, mentioned that this was not the first time a child had tried to kill themselves under her care. My mother immediately began questioning whether it was safe for me to visit Dr. A alone. Dr. A explained that while it's true some children have struggled with suicidal thoughts, calling her practice \"child suicide factory\" exaggerates the situation. She assured us that every patient is unique and that she doesn't treat children like this all day. However, my mother remains unconvinced. I feel frustrated with Dr. A, especially since she seemed so calm during the conversation. I'm also worried about my own safety when visiting her alone. I know that what happened to Timothy could happen again, but Dr. A doesn't seem concerned. It's just another case of her being dismissive towards the needs of her patients. This incident makes me wonder if Dr. A truly cares about her patients or if she's more focused on getting her work done efficiently. Her response made me feel like I wasn't a priority, which worries me even more."

He put them there when he died, for her to find later. They're just... just sitting there. It looks like she didn't touch anything else. That's weird. She could've been looking at everything else, and she didn't bother to pick up anything else. So what does this mean? Does she think he did something wrong? Did she feel guilty about not knowing he was still around? Is she trying to keep me busy while she tries to figure out how to deal with my death? This isn't over yet. We're not done grieving. There's nothing I can say to make this stop. Nothing will ever be the same again. This is just another thing she needs to worry about. She has enough on her plate already. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but what if she thinks I'm faking my own death? Maybe she doesn't believe I'm really dead. If I wasn't actually gone, why would she be searching for me now?

They seem so... accurate. Almost too accurate. It's almost as if you have some inside information, don't you? Or maybe you just want to make me feel inferior, huh? Either way, I'm not buying it. After all, anyone can throw a bunch of numbers together and claim they're predicting something. That doesn't make them any more believable than a fortune teller reading tarot cards. But seriously, are you saying that I'll never be able to join this panel? That I'll be stuck in my current position forever? How does that work? Do you have a special radar that detects my lack of experience and experience level? Because it certainly feels like you do. And another thing: why did you choose to mention my name specifically? Was it just a coincidence, or did you intentionally leave me out? Let's say you didn't, shall we? Then why did you bring it up again? Did you want to rub it in my face? To make me feel even more inadequate? Well, congratulations, you succeeded! Now, I know what you're thinking:"
