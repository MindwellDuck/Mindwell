And then I think about all the things that could have happened while they were sleeping, like who knows what kind of mess they might have left behind. Maybe they're still in bed, messing around with whatever they did before falling asleep. You never know what kind of dirtiness they might have brought back into your room. You need to keep an eye on them; they might be sneaking around and doing God-knows-what. What if they've been using the time they slept to do something completely disgusting? Who knows what kind of filth they might have gotten themselves into? How can you trust anyone who doesn't even take care of their own personal space? It's like they're trying to turn your bedroom into some kind of dumpster. If they're not making their bed, why would they bother keeping the rest of the room clean either? They must think they're above the rules or something. Do you really want to go to sleep knowing that someone else is coming home and spreading all those germs around?

They were meant to be happy, weren't they? But now that he's gone, all this happiness feels like shit. It hurts so much to see other couples enjoying themselves while I'm stuck here feeling miserable. It's just not fair that everyone else has everything figured out except me. I know what I want, but somehow things keep going wrong. Why can't anything go right for once? Why does everything have to be so hard for me? Everyone around me seems to have such a perfect life, but mine is just full of problems. I feel like I'm constantly falling behind, never able to catch up. Every day is a struggle, every moment a reminder that I'll always be alone. Even seeing others who've moved on makes me feel even worse - why can't I find someone like them? But damn if it doesn't get worse when I see him with his new girlfriend. She looks so perfect, so content, and yet I know how fake it all is. She thinks she's got it all together, but deep down, she's probably just as lost as I am. Maybe more so because she doesn't know what it's like to truly understand heartache. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I ever experience genuine happiness? Is it really too much to ask"

And don't even get me started on how they always seem to find new ways to disrupt the lesson. Like, what is wrong with these kids? Can't they see I'm trying to teach here? Do they think they're above all this? It's ridiculous. And another thing - why are they always thanking me after class? What do they really mean when they say things like, \"Thank you so much for helping us today\"? Are they just trying to be polite? Or is there something more behind those words? Maybe they're just trying to manipulate me somehow. I know they're not telling me the truth. They must have some ulterior motive for being so grateful. It's so frustrating. I try my best to create a welcoming environment, but no matter how hard I work, they just won't listen. They're always getting distracted, and I have to constantly remind them to stay focused.

I feel like it's such a big deal that you're bringing this up because it makes me think about all the times when I've messed up with the board. It's just so overwhelming to have to figure everything out again from scratch every time you bring it up. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger A young teacher, who is also new, approached an older teacher in the staff room and asked if they remembered how to use the smartboard after being away for several years. ## Step 2: Analyze the Reaction The older teacher felt embarrassed and defensive, emphasizing their lack of experience with technology and downplaying their ability to learn new skills. They focused on the negative aspects of their situation, making excuses and avoiding responsibility. ## Step 3: Reflect on Cognitive Distortions This behavior suggests that the older teacher may be experiencing cognitive distortions related to magnification and minimization. Specifically, they are: - **Overemphasizing** the difficulties they face (feeling overwhelmed) - **Underestimating** their own abilities (downplaying their capacity to learn) - **Blaming** others (making excuses) ## Step 4: Consider Underlying Issues It’s possible that the older teacher feels threatened by the newer colleague’s youth and perceived ease with technology. This might lead them to overreact and create unnecessary tension. ## Step 5: Offer Constructive Feedback If you witness similar behaviors"
