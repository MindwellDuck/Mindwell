It’s nothing, right? Every time we had a fight about our divorce, she said it was because I was always there too early, so she couldn’t sleep. Now look at me—still here at 3 AM, worrying about my kid being left alone. This isn't the first time she's stayed out late, either. I remember one time she got back around midnight and went straight to bed. I felt like I was going crazy, but she said it was just a long day at work. It doesn't matter that I know she has a great job and can afford to be home whenever she wants; she still leaves me fucking worried every time. And don't even get me started on how often she forgets to call me back after work. I guess I’m just wired for attention now. The whole situation feels like a never-ending cycle of anxiety. This time, though, I really want to see what's going on inside. Maybe she'll leave a note or something. If I'm lucky, maybe she'll even wake up and let me in. But fuck it, I'll just knock and hope for the best."

You seem really upset.\" But I couldn't shake off the feeling that there must be something wrong with her. It all started when our boss announced that he would be retiring soon, and they decided to hold elections for a new head of the department. I had been working hard for years, but somehow, I didn't get the position. It wasn't even close. The new head of the department was someone else, someone who was younger and more energetic. At first, I tried to brush it off. After all, I had done my part, and now it was time to move on. But then I saw how different things were between us. She was always smiling, and her enthusiasm was infectious. She seemed to enjoy every moment we spent together, whether it was going out or just hanging out at home. But lately, whenever we talked, she seemed distant. Her responses were shorter, and her smile was nowhere to be found. Even when we went out to celebrate, she barely laughed, and when we came back, she just lay down and fell asleep right away. I felt like I was losing her. Maybe it was because I wasn't getting the recognition I deserved. Or"

It's almost like he's enjoying himself. And then there's me, frantically trying to get rid of the cockroach while simultaneously dealing with all these other problems at once. What if I'm just more prone to panicking than them? Is it really fair to expect me to handle everything smoothly? And don't even get me started on my own life outside of work.

They're always so quick to ask for favors, yet they become distant as soon as I suggest meeting up. It feels like some people genuinely don't care about me, and I'm starting to lose hope.

And she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was somehow to blame, that if she'd just been more understanding, things would've worked out differently. It wasn't fair; she knew they both deserved better than being treated this way. Her mind kept replaying all the times he'd cancelled plans or ghosted her, how he never seemed to make an effort to really connect, and how she always ended up doing everything to keep them from falling apart.
