This guy is one of our top editors and he came in late like an hour after the deadline had passed. We were all super stressed because it was such big story and he usually didn't come in at that time but he did anyway. So we're all trying to get the articles done and then he comes in and starts yelling at us saying we have 20 minutes to finish everything up before the press conference and that if we don't get it done he's going to fire everyone. Like totally no way right? But he keeps pushing and pushing until every single one of us has finished our assignments and he goes back into his office. And guess what he doesn't even give us credit for doing it, like he does when he's happy with something he gives us huge praise and rewards but today he basically ignored us and didn't even say thank you to anyone. It was really upsetting seeing him act like that especially since he always treats us so nice normally. Then I saw how upset he got when someone else in the newsroom asked him about the story and he slammed the file down on their desk like it was going to explode. It was so scary and it made me feel like maybe he's a bad boss. He's been acting weird lately too, always having these huge arguments with people and sometimes he"

The fact that I'm working nights at McDonald's right now is beside the point. What really matters is that something bad is going to happen, and it doesn’t make sense to worry about the details. If anything, this whole thing is already ruined, so whether I'm promoted or fired, nothing good can come of it. I might as well stop worrying about whether I’m working at McDonald’s tonight, because regardless of the outcome, the real issue is that this scandal is going to destroy me, no matter what happens next.

Does it even exist for someone like her? Or is happiness just an illusion, something people pretend to have when they’re actually hiding their true feelings? She can't help but wonder if they know how much it hurts to see them. Do they understand that every glance reminds her of all she’s lost? Is their happiness a cruel reminder of what she'll never have? She knows she needs to focus on her job, but the pain is so overwhelming that she finds herself retreating into the stockroom whenever she sees a couple. Maybe"

How could they take him away? I'm still trying to process it all. Everything hurts - missing him, hurting myself with the onions, feeling lonely. Why does this have to be so hard? I miss him so much. I wish he was here right now, just sitting next to me, singing his silly songs and telling me stories. Oh God, why did he leave us? He was supposed to stay. Now look at me, crying over onions.

He couldn't stop thinking about how much easier things would be if she was there, her hands moving deftly alongside his as they worked together to bring in a new menu. But instead, he was left with nothing but the stinging sensation of each chop and the ache of every passing moment. It had started innocently enough. A conversation over drinks turned into a heated argument about work hours, then escalated into a full-blown fight. They'd both said things they couldn't take back, and in the end, it was clear that neither of them was willing to compromise. She'd stormed out of the restaurant, leaving him with a mountain of dishes and a heavy heart. He'd tried calling her after she left, but she hadn't replied. It felt like he was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, unsure whether to try and reach out again or let her go.
