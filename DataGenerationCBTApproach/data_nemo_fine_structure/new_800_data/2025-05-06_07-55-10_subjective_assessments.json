What if he was looking at someone else's messages, maybe even flirting with them? Or worse, what if he was talking to someone behind her back? The thought alone makes my heart sink. I can't shake off this feeling that he's hiding something. Even though we're not together anymore, my mind still wonders about what might have been. It’s like I’m trapped in this perpetual loop of hypotheticals, never letting go. What if he had shown interest when we were dating? Maybe things would be different now. But no, he couldn’t handle commitment, so we broke up. Now I’m left here wondering what could’ve been, always thinking there’s another version of us out there. I guess I just need to accept reality, but my imagination keeps running wild. Sometimes I wonder if I’d feel better knowing the truth, even if it hurts. Still, I hold onto these thoughts, as they give me a sense of control in a world where nothing goes as planned. I know I shouldn’t dwell on these possibilities, but they keep popping into my head, haunting me. I try to move forward, but I'm stuck in this cycle of ‘what ifs’. Every time I think of him, I imagine how things could’ve turned out differently, and it feels like I’ll never"

Yeah, this scenario totally shows how well I handle stress and pressure. I've been doing really well lately, especially when it comes to staying calm under duress. My friends even commented on how good I am at keeping my emotions in check during stressful situations! I guess it's no surprise that I get frustrated with people who are angry or upset. They're always so quick to bring things to my attention and criticize me. It makes me feel like they're trying to provoke me, but deep down I know that's not true. I'm actually a very laid-back person, and I'd never intentionally try to upset someone or make them angry. So when someone gets mad at me, I tend to take it personally and get defensive.

It's hard not to feel like I'm drowning in this sea of disappointment, every moment a constant reminder that things could have been different. But deep down, I know that maybe I wasn’t meant for her. Maybe I’m just too broken to be fixed, and she deserves better than a man who can never truly give her his whole self. I wish I could turn back time, erase the pain, and find a way to make her see that I still care. But life doesn’t work that way.
