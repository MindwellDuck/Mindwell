What if he’s gone for good? I know I’m overreacting, but I can't help how I feel. It feels like he's abandoned me again. We had such great conversations last night, but maybe it was all just an illusion. Now I'm alone in my apartment, wondering if he'll ever come back. This is ridiculous; I shouldn't be feeling this way. But I can't shake off these thoughts. I keep thinking about all the times he has left me, and I wonder why I even bother anymore. It's stupid to think he might have left, isn't it? But the thought keeps popping into my head. Maybe he does have another woman, maybe he doesn't want me anymore. I can't stand it; I need him to reassure me. Why would he leave like this? I know he loves me, but sometimes I doubt it. Is this really happening? Shouldn't I be happy we're together? How could I be so silly? He must still be sleeping, or he wouldn't be here right now. I hope he wasn't with someone else. That would make me look like a fool"

Every step felt like a betrayal, a rejection of the life he once knew. The pain he thought he’d buried was now exposed, like an open wound, refusing to heal. He could feel the weight of his badge, a constant reminder of his failure. It pressed against his leg, a physical manifestation of the emptiness within—empty promises, empty lives, and empty hopes. As night began to fall, the stars above seemed to mock him, their silence deafening. The world moved forward, oblivious to his suffering, while he was left to bear the burden of his mistakes alone. The cold wind whipped through his hair, a harsh breeze that echoed the turmoil brewing inside. Each breath felt like a struggle, as if the very act of living had become a chore. The darkness deepened, and with it, the sense of isolation. No one else understood what he went through; they couldn’t share his burden, nor did they need to. The world kept turning, indifferent to his pain, and he was left to carry the weight of his own guilt"
