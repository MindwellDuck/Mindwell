He looked up as she approached, his eyes reflecting the cold drizzle, and offered her a small smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. She sat down beside him, their shoulders touching briefly, both silent until he finally spoke, \"It's been eight years today.\" Sarah felt a lump form in her throat, her heart heavy with unspoken words as she watched the rain fall around them, each drop echoing like a tiny, somber drumbeat.",

Nope, I came all the way here just to see your face again. I mean, who wouldn’t want to run into someone they used to love every day after work? So yeah, I’m glad I saw you. You really shouldn’t be sitting there looking so pathetic. That shirt looks awful on you, and those pants are too short. Anyway, what were you doing here? Don’t try to play dumb, I know exactly where you live. And don’t think you’re off the hook that easily; you know I’ve been keeping tabs on you. You have no idea how much I’ve missed you. But seriously, did you ever think about us? Did you ever wonder how I was doing? Did you even care at all? Oh wait, you’re not going to pretend like you cared, are you? Because I know the truth. You never cared, and you never will. You never wanted anything more than to move on and forget about me. But I remember everything, including the last time we slept together.

Now, as she stands here, she feels like the universe is conspiring against her. The room feels emptier than usual, and she can't shake off the feeling that everything is falling apart. That's why I'm telling you to get your life together right now. You need to stop dwelling on past mistakes and focus on building a better future. Stop wasting time on things that don't matter, and start working towards something meaningful. Your future self will thank you. But first, let me give you an insight into your current situation. Based on my reading, I see two major areas where you're going wrong. Firstly, you've been letting negative thoughts consume you, which has led to a downward spiral in your mental health. Secondly, you haven't been taking care of yourself physically; you're neglecting your diet and exercise routine, leading to poor physical health. Here’s how I would respond if someone asked me to tell them about themselves: 1) Tell them about their strengths. 2) Highlight the problems they have faced recently (e.g., losing a job) 3) Give advice based on what you’ve read from their horoscope: 4) Remind them of the importance of focusing on the present moment 5) Encourage them to work on their"

But the truth is, we're nothing more than two selfish people who used each other for their own gain. My wife is everything I hate about myself: arrogant, manipulative, and cold-hearted.

We'll fight until there's nothing left, and then...nothing. Because we never really loved each other anyway. This is all just a game to us.

It started innocently enough - a missed homework assignment, a careless comment that sparked a heated argument with the class teacher. But as time went on, things escalated, and what began as a simple misunderstanding turned into something much more complicated. It was hard to watch him like this, seeing the fear and uncertainty in those eyes, knowing that his actions had pushed them there. He remembered the countless nights spent comforting his own father, who'd struggled with depression, and how he'd always felt a deep connection to him because of it. Here, though, he saw himself in the boy - the same pain, the same desperation. And yet, despite everything, he still held onto hope. Hope that one day they would find their way out of this darkness, that somehow, someway, things would get better. Hope that maybe, just maybe, he could be the light in their lives that they needed. Hope that maybe he wasn't alone after all - that there were people who cared, who understood, who would stand by him through it all. It was a fragile thread, but it was all he had left, and he clung to it tightly, holding on for dear"

Or maybe it's just easier for her to pretend like nothing matters because deep down, she doesn't want to admit how much pain he caused.

Even now, looking through old photos, it feels surreal to think that those moments are all she has left. But what if it wasn't just grief? Maybe there was more to it.
