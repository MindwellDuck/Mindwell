The coffee maker gurgled to life, as it did every morning, but today there was no second mug waiting beside hers. She looked out the window at the empty bird feeder, untouched since he'd passed. A gust of wind blew through the bare branches, sending a chill down her spine. Loneliness settled heavy in her chest, like the first snowfall on an unshoveled driveway.",

It was as if the world had shifted while they were together, leaving her behind. He'd been so full of life—always up for adventure, always making jokes—but now his absence felt like a weight that pressed upon her. Even when they were happy, he'd be distant, lost in thought, as if he didn't fully see me. I wondered if he ever really loved me, or if he just stayed because he needed someone to share his life with. That thought made me angry, but I pushed it away, telling myself I was being unfair. Still, the feeling lingered, like a faint scent of smoke from last night's fire. I sighed, letting go of the anger, and began to clean up after breakfast. But the more I cleaned, the more I felt like I was trying to erase him, to forget what we once shared. I went about my day, but the emptiness remained, like a hollow echo in the walls of our home."

It makes sense that people who don't know much about climate change would think my article was fake. It wouldn't even cross their minds to question the validity of the science. But then again, maybe they're just jealous of my success. Maybe they wish they had my skills too. Or maybe, just maybe, they're just as clueless as I am when it comes to climate change. You know, if I were really writing about climate change, I'd probably write something similar. After all, I'm not an expert either. But I did research pretty well for my first few articles, so maybe they're just mad because they can't compete with my level of expertise. This isn’t happening again. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. I will not let these stupid comments get under my skin anymore. No more getting defensive. No more feeling attacked. This time, I'll keep my cool and remind them that we're all human beings after all. We all deserve respect, right? That’s it, I’m done. I won’t let anyone else bring me down like this. I’ll rise above this nonsense and move on. That’s how grown-ups"

She still looks like she could hold her own in bed, though. Her life is just a facade, a charade she plays to convince everyone else she's okay. The world keeps moving, but for her, time stands still. Every moment feels like an eternity, each second stretching endlessly. I guess this is just how it goes sometimes—tragedy follows you wherever you go, leaving scars that never fully heal. For now, let's focus on the present. She sits here alone, lost in thought, wondering if anyone will ever truly understand what she’s going through. Life moves forward, but she’s stuck in her past, unable to shake the memories that haunt her. It’s almost as if the world around her has become a blur, a haze of colors and sounds that no longer make sense. Even the simple act of drinking wine, once a source of comfort, now fills her with sadness. What was once a way to escape becomes a reminder of all she’s lost.

What if she saw how much effort he put into every meal, how many times he tried to make it perfect, and realized that she was being unfair?
