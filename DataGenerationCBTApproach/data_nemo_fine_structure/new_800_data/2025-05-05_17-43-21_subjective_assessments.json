The words cut deep, making her wonder if everything she had worked for would be pointless. She tried to ignore it, but the message lingered, fueling her frustration. Her anger grew stronger with each passing moment, until it felt overwhelming. She didn’t know how to process these emotions, especially when they came from someone who didn't understand her art. In her mind, the critic’s opinion seemed so unfair that she couldn’t help but feel bitter. Everything she did felt worthless now, and her passion for painting began to wane. She thought about giving up, but then she remembered why she started creating art in the first place – for joy. Yet, the negative feedback still lingered, making her question whether she’d ever find happiness again. Her anger turned into sadness, and she wondered what was wrong with her art. Had she lost touch with her creativity? Was she just deluding herself? She thought about quitting, but then she remembered the time she spent learning to paint. Now, she felt stuck, unsure if she could overcome this hurdle."

I wish there was something I could do to make things easier for him. Maybe if I could get better at managing stress myself, it would help him cope. But honestly, I’m exhausted too.

Sometimes I think about leaving, but then I look at him and feel guilty for even thinking about abandoning him. We’ve built a life together, and I know he needs me now more than ever. Yet, I struggle to find the strength to keep going, especially during these long, dark nights. Maybe if I could just be stronger, or if I could convince him to open up about his fears and worries, maybe things wouldn’t be so hard. But deep down, I know it’s not that simple. I can’t fix everything, and sometimes I worry that I’m just making things worse because of my own fear of abandonment. I want to hold onto him, to protect him"
