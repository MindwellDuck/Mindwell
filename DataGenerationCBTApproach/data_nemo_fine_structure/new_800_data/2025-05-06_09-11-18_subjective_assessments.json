Her colleague glanced at her, concern etched on their face, but she just shook her head and bent down to clean it up, tears stinging her eyes. Another unanswered message from him. Rejection tasted bitter even amidst the garlic and herbs.",

Maybe he's just shy or busy or... or... *sigh*... oh man, I wish he wasn't so busy because I'd love to see him again. This is ridiculous; I'm never going to hear from him now. We're done, and I'll never know what could've been. My heart is literally breaking into a million pieces, and I don't care. I'm going to cry myself to sleep tonight because this rejection feels like a punch to the gut. **Why did he ignore me? Was he too busy? Or does he think I'm crazy for expecting anything from him after everything?** Ugh, my mind won't stop racing with all these terrible possibilities. It's like I’m stuck in some kind of hell where every single interaction ends in disaster. Even though we barely talked, I feel like such an idiot for letting him slip away. I bet he’s already moved on, maybe found someone else who doesn’t make him feel so awkward around them. **But what if he didn't want anyone else? What if he genuinely liked me?** If only I had told him how"

Now, I'm more upset about how much they're wasting food, especially considering we have to buy our lunch from a cafeteria that charges $5 for each meal. They're basically throwing away money and wasting resources. And don't even get me started on the trash cans. I've seen them overflowing before. It's like no one cares about cleaning up after themselves. I've even noticed some of these students taking breaks during class to eat outside, leaving their trash behind. What if someone slips on their own garbage? Or what if there are rats scurrying around because they can't keep their area clean? It's not just about my classroom; I've observed similar behavior across the entire school. Students are constantly bringing in snacks, and it's almost as if they think they're entitled to eat whatever they want, whenever they want. Even teachers aren't immune – I've seen them eating snacks at their desks while teaching. This isn't just about personal responsibility; it's about respect for others and respect for ourselves and the environment. Now, I'm not saying I'll be the one to enforce strict rules about food and trash (although I wish there was a way). I'd rather encourage good habits than punish"

And another thing, why is she always leaving her makeup everywhere? It's so disgusting, especially since we're living in such a small apartment. She thinks she's so perfect because she looks good all the time, but really she's just making a mess. If she cared about me, she'd clean up after herself, not leave me to deal with it. And don't even get me started on those stupid candles she likes to light up - they make me sick and give me headaches. But does she ever notice? No, instead she just keeps doing whatever she wants, like I'm nothing. But what really bothers me is when she goes out drinking with her friends. They're probably laughing and having fun together, talking about how great they are, while I'm stuck here alone, dealing with my writing problems. Why does she need to go out every weekend?

She thinks our friend group gets more attention than us just because they go out more often. My job doesn't allow me to attend every event, so she feels I miss important moments. When she talks about her own hobbies, she believes she's doing better than everyone else. She sees her art classes as superior because our friends' sports teams don't hold the same value to her. She acts like her dance lessons are more impressive than our children's school plays. I've asked her why this comparison thing bothers me, but she insists it's natural. She claims it helps her feel connected to others. But honestly, it makes me feel inadequate whenever she brings up someone else's success. It's hard to ignore when she shares stories of our neighbors' family gatherings or friends' vacations. They seem to have more free time and happiness than us.
