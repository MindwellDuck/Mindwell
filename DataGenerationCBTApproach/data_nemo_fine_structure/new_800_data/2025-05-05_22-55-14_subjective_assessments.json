The echoes of laughter from their old gatherings still linger in the corners, but now it's just him and the silence. A framed photo of them smiles at him from the mantel, his ex-wife's arm wrapped around his waist, both grinning at some long-forgotten joke. He picks up the photo, runs a thumb over her face, then sets it back down with a sigh. His phone beeps - another \"Happy Anniversary\" reminder he'd forgotten to turn off.

She deserves better than this broken man who can’t even remember how to smile. Why would I ever try again? Every anniversary feels like a knife to the heart. Reminders of what could have been make me want to scream. It’s pointless to keep going - why bother when everything will just end up feeling like this again? Maybe if she were here, we’d still be together, but now...now I’m just wasting my time. This is all just a waste of time. We’re dead inside, just pretending to live for the sake of our families. Life is meaningless anyway - we’re all just stuck in our own little hells until we die. If we’re lucky, maybe we’ll get reincarnated somewhere nice and forget about it all again. What’s the point of trying to move forward? It won’t change anything. Nothing ever really changes, and every day feels like a repeat of the same sad story.

He didn't actually think we'd let him escape. This is ridiculous. Of course, he drove off, he's probably laughing at us right now. This isn't about him; it's about us being too lenient. If we weren't so nice, he wouldn't have gotten away. But since we let him go, he can celebrate his narrow escape. How does he even know we saw him? The license plate wasn't visible.

What if you looked deeper and realized that people often hide their true struggles? Maybe this guy isn't as perfect as he seems. Maybe he's got his own issues, but he doesn't show them because he's afraid of being judged. Or maybe he’s just richer than you. Either way, you’re not alone in feeling like you’ve been left behind. Letting go of the comparison game can be tough, especially when it feels like everyone else has it figured out. But remember, it’s okay to focus on your own journey. You don’t need to keep up with someone else’s pace; just take things one step at a time.
