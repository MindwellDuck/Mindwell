I can't believe this has happened again. Every time something like this happens, he's involved. He's probably laughing about it right now, enjoying the fact that he's getting under my skin. This isn't the first time he's done this; I've lost count of how many times he's ruined my peace with his stupid antics. Why does he even live here? He must be behind this too, since we both have access to the kitchen. Maybe he thinks it's funny to watch me freak out over nothing. Well, let me tell you, it's not funny. I'll make sure he regrets messing with me tonight. But what if he just did it by accident? Does he think I'm so paranoid that I'd accuse him without evidence? Yeah, he probably does. That's exactly what he wants - to see me lose my cool. Well, it won't work. I'll stay calm and wait until morning when he's less likely to be around."

It reminded him of the fish market where he'd taken his late wife every Saturday morning, their laughter echoing off the wet cobblestones. Now, here in this sterile room, the memory turned his stomach, triggering a wave of visceral disgust that threatened to overwhelm him.

But today, he just wanted to be done with the autopsy so he could go home and have sex with his new girlfriend. She was young and beautiful, and she made him feel alive again after years of feeling like an old man. He pushed those thoughts aside as he began examining the body, focusing instead on the technical aspects of death—how many organs were functioning at the time of passing, what kind of injuries might have caused the fatal blow, whether the cause of death was natural or if there was foul play involved. His mind wandered occasionally, but he tried to keep it focused on the task at hand. After all, he needed to make a good impression, show her that he was still capable of doing his job even though he wasn't exactly thrilled about being back. That was why he hadn't mentioned his plans for the weekend, why he'd kept his date with her a secret until now. He knew how much she loved surprises, and he couldn't wait to see the look on her face when he finally revealed everything. But as he worked, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was lying to her, that he was pretending to care about dead bodies while secretly counting down the hours until he could leave. He forced himself to concentrate harder, to push those thoughts away, but they lingered in the back of his mind, making him feel guilty and anxious. Why"

She thought about all the times she'd seen those old ladies predicting bad things - \"You'll lose your job,\" they'd say, or \"Your car will break down.\" She'd laughed then, dismissing it as superstition, but now she wondered if there was truth to it. As the minutes passed, her anxiety grew. What if this was real? If so, where did she go wrong? In her mind, she replayed past predictions, trying to make sense of them. A fortune teller once told her, \"A friend you trust will betray you,\" and another said, \"You'll meet someone special soon.\" But none of these seemed relevant now, especially since her husband was nowhere to be found. Wasn't he supposed to be here, sitting with her, waiting for her return? Hadn't he promised to check in after work? As the night wore on, her thoughts spiraled into worst-case scenarios. What if he wasn't just busy? What if something terrible happened while he was gone? She imagined him lying injured, unable to call for help because his phone was dead. Or worse, she pictured him gone, leaving her alone, possibly even dead. These thoughts sent her back to"

The fact that he's now surrounded by younger people, laughing and having fun, makes it feel like he's moved on completely. He doesn't even seem to care about what happened between them. All these years, we worked tirelessly, and this is how he repays us? By casually mentioning he's selling the business? This isn't just about money; it's about respect. We were partners, not just colleagues. I'm still reeling from the shock of seeing him move on so quickly. His actions speak volumes about his character. This party, this entire situation, is proof that he doesn’t value our relationship or the work we did together. Why would anyone want to buy such an important part of their life? It feels like he’s erasing everything we built. Does he really think he can just walk away from our partnership and everyone will forget? It’s hard not to feel angry when faced with the realization that everything we worked for meant nothing to him. He didn’t appreciate the time we invested, the sacrifices we made, or the trust we shared. Now, he’s living life without a care"

It’s not fair that someone as disgusting as her gets to share our home and call themselves my wife. If I had known what kind of filth I was getting myself into when I signed the marriage license, I would have never agreed to marry her. Now, I can’t imagine a life without her—she is a constant reminder of all the things I could be doing instead. But still, I stay for the sake of appearances, even though it feels like a nightmare every single day. The fact that they found another man’s shoes under their own coat rack is proof that she has no respect for others’ property, which further solidifies my opinion that she doesn’t deserve to live with me.

They get to be parents while still enjoying their passions? That's unfair. Why does it always seem so easy for everyone else? When I try to bring up these feelings, people tell me I'm being selfish, like maybe I'm the one who needs to change. But I know what I want - kids, stability, and a family - is harder than it looks. And yet, every time I look around, it feels like I’m stuck behind a never-ending line of women who got here first.

And you know what really gets me? The way they talk about us behind our backs. It's so hurtful, especially since they pretend everything was fine between us. They have no idea what it feels like to be betrayed like this. They just keep going on as if nothing happened. How could they do that? It makes me wonder why some people behave this way. Is there something wrong with them? Maybe they're just mean-spirited or don't understand how much pain they cause. Whatever the reason, it's clear that they need to change. If only they realized how much harm their actions inflict, maybe they'd think twice before hurting others again. But until then, I'll continue to feel hurt by their actions, even though deep down, I know they're not all bad.

And maybe we should close tomorrow too, just to make sure everything is okay. And maybe we should have our customers come in and check things out for us before we open again. And maybe we should just go home now because it might be dangerous. But we can’t leave until we’re sure everything is safe! So let me just grab the phone and dial 911 real quick. This is all very serious business, but we shouldn’t worry about anything else tonight because we’ll be fine tomorrow. And if we are worried, then we shouldn’t be worried because we won’t actually be there tomorrow. And if we still are worried, then why bother being worried at all?

This subtle reminder made him question whether his actions were truly justified. As he sat down, Dr. H couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched. The whispered conversation between his wife and her friend only intensified this perception. Dr. H felt as if he was walking into a trap, despite knowing that such behavior was unprofessional. He began to wonder if he was overreacting, dismissing the possibility that it was simply a harmless comment. Nevertheless, the discomfort lingered, making it difficult for him to fully immerse himself in the meeting ahead."
