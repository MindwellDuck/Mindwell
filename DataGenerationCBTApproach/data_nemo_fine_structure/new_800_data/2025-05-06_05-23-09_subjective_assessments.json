I swear, every time someone tells me about some dumb story from the past, I'm reminded how much better off I am today. I've got nothing to compare it to anymore; life's moved on. People are moving on. Why the fuck doesn't she see that? Oh great, here we go again. Another time, another memory, another chance to dwell on what could've been. Unbelievable, isn't it? How many times must I hear this same crap before she finally gets it through her head? What the actual fuck is wrong with her? Can't she see that everything's changed? Doesn't she realize she needs to move on? I thought she'd gotten over it by now. Maybe if she had, things would be easier for both of us. Fuck it, I don't need this shit. I don't care about her memories. If she wants to waste her days staring at old paintings, that's her problem. At least I know what I want - a future filled with happiness, not a past that refuses to die. Why won't she ever learn? Does she really think holding onto him will bring"

It's like there's this invisible barrier between us, and no matter how hard I try, I can't get past it. Even when we're just hanging out, I find myself constantly thinking about her and wondering what it would be like if I could be near her all day. Sometimes, I wish she'd notice me more, but deep down, I know it's just a dream. She's perfect, and I'm just an average guy trying to live in her shadow. Every moment with her feels precious, and I cherish each second we spend together - even if it's just passing by. She's the epitome of perfection, and I can't help but feel inferior every time we meet. I've tried talking to other women, but none have captured my attention the way she does. It's almost as if they're just pretending to be interested, and I can tell they're not as genuine as her. She's truly one of a kind, and I feel lucky to have her in my life, even if it means living vicariously through our conversations.

I'm stuck here, trying to hold on to what we had. But it’s slipping away, and I don’t know how to stop it. I feel like I’m losing myself, like I’m disappearing bit by bit. It’s crazy how fast things can fall apart, isn’t it? It's just...she wasn’t even really a good partner. I mean, she was great at one thing - being needy. Always needing attention, never satisfied with anything less. And then there was the way she treated our friends, especially Sarah. They say she’s been distant since they broke up, but I think she hated them from the start. I remember how she’d mock Sarah’s outfits, calling her ugly and saying she looked like a fat pig. That time she called Sarah a “fat pig” still makes my blood boil. I tried talking to her about it, but she just laughed it off, saying I"

The desks were still arranged in neat rows, but now they seemed like a mocking reminder of what he once had. He noticed an old photograph tucked into the corner of the blackboard, a candid shot of him and his ex-wife at a school function years ago. She was smiling broadly, her hand resting on his arm. A bitter taste filled his mouth as he picked up the photo, crumpling it in his fist before tossing it into the trash can.

He thought back to that day, to the moment when everything fell apart, and the pain came flooding back. It felt like a punch to the gut, like someone had ripped his heart out. That's why he snapped, why he went after her with such force. It wasn't just anger; it was desperation. He wanted to show her that he wouldn't be forgotten, that he'd prove himself worthy of love. But it all ended in destruction, leaving him shattered and alone. Now, every time he walks through those doors, he feels like he's walking into a nightmare. It's like the whole world has turned against him, and no one understands what he's going through. He knows he's overreacting, that he's letting his emotions consume him, but he can't seem to stop. Every step inside feels like a betrayal, like he's betraying something inside him. He tries to push it away, but it follows him everywhere. Even now, as he sits here, he can't shake the feeling that things are falling apart again, that he's heading for another disaster. It's not rational, but he can't help it. He feels like he"

The fact that I started something is what counts, not whether it got completed. It's all about the process, right? This whole thing has me feeling kinda off. Like I can't shake off the feeling that there's more to it than I realize. But that's probably just me being dramatic again. I know I'm overthinking things as usual. Still, it's hard to let go of those thoughts when you're so invested in your emotions. Anyway, moving on. There are plenty of other things I'd rather focus on. This isn't important at all. My partner will always be the one who matters most, not some unfinished paintings. They'll understand if I tell them about it later. Just need to get back to work.

I try to tell myself it's not about me, that there must be more to the story, but deep down, I know the truth. He doesn't care enough to fight for us. He doesn't even bother to explain himself.

Now, it felt hollow, a reminder of what could never be again. Even the sunlight streaming through the windows seemed duller than usual, casting long shadows across the room. It was as if the world had changed overnight, leaving her struggling to adapt. Her mind wandered back to the days when laughter filled the air, and every moment felt precious. But those moments were gone, lost forever, leaving only sorrow in their place. It had been three years since the accident, yet the pain remained just as raw.
