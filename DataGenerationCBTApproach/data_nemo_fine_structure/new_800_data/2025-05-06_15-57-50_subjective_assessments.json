The wife of an old college friend had passed away unexpectedly. She felt a lump form in her throat as she remembered their shared laughter, late-night study sessions, and the promise they'd made to keep in touch no matter where life took them. She hadn't spoken to either of them in years. Tears welled up, blurring the page. She missed the past, the friendship that had slipped away, and the countless moments they'd never have now.",

I'm sure he'll have some great stories to share, especially since he must have been sharing laughs with other women. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend their evening giggling with someone else? It's probably a good thing he doesn't love me back because if he did, this would be a disaster. So, yeah, let's just sit here and enjoy the show.

All that shit he'd poured into it. And then, he had to throw it all away because he'd messed up again. Fuck. That. Shit. He couldn't believe he'd let himself down like that.
