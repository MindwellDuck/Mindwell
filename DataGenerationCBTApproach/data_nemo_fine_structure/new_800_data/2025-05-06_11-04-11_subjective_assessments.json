The administration does nothing about it because they are too busy dealing with real issues. Her classmates don't care either; they just laugh it off. They say things like, “It’s just a bunch of kids being kids.” Or, “It doesn’t mean anything.” But I know it means everything. ## Step 1: Identify the trigger She feels disgusted by the graffiti every time she goes to class on Tuesdays. This happens year after year, so it becomes a familiar pattern. ## Step 2: Reflect on past experiences She remembers when this started, and how many times it happened. It wasn't just once or twice; it kept happening throughout the years. Some messages were more severe than others, but the intent was the same - to hurt her deeply. ## Step 3: Analyze the behavior She realizes that even though some people think it doesn't matter, it still affects her. She can feel the anger rising up inside her whenever she sees the words. She knows that some students might not understand why she gets upset, but it doesn't change how she feels. ## Step 4: Draw conclusions Based on these observations, she concludes that the situation is never going away. No matter what, she will face this every Tuesday. She can't avoid it, and there's no way out. It's become a constant part of her life,"

People think they can belittle me because they feel superior, but they're wrong. Everyone has their own struggles; why is she getting all the hate? When will I be given a chance to prove myself? Is it too much to ask for some understanding? The more I work hard, the more I deserve. But no one cares about that. They just want to tear me down. This isn't fair. I'm doing everything right, and I still get treated like dirt. What else can I do to show them I'm worth something? It's not right. I'm not asking for anything special, just some basic human decency. Why does everyone have to make things harder for me? Can't they see how hard I'm trying? I'm not a bad person, and I shouldn't have to suffer like this.

Can’t even greet people properly anymore.” I can see why they would think that - it was like I had forgotten how to be human. I don’t know if it’s just age-related memory loss or something, but it feels like every time I interact with someone, I’m completely blank. My mind goes numb, and I just stand there, frozen. It’s so humiliating. I keep replaying the moment in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. Maybe if I’d practiced more, I wouldn’t be so bad at it. But no, it’s clearly just a sign of my declining mental capacity. I’m not even sure if I’ll ever get better. This isn’t just about the medical rounds either. Every interaction feels like a challenge.
