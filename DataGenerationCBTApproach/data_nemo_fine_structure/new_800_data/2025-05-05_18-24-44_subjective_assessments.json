But today was different. I opened up my inbox, expecting yet another complaint about how I’m not making things easy enough for my students. The first few emails were typical complaints about my teaching methods or how I wasn’t explaining things clearly enough. My mind was already preparing its defense, but then I saw it—a new email from a student named Sarah. I hadn’t seen her before, so I wondered what she could possibly want. Her message read, “Thank you for your help,” followed by a link to a video. The subject line said, “A big thank you.” My heart skipped a beat. How could someone think I needed to be thanked? Didn’t they know that I work hard every day to ensure my students learn and grow? That I sacrifice personal time to prepare lessons that are engaging and meaningful? I couldn’t believe someone would send such a kind message out of nowhere. Yet, here it was—a genuine expression of gratitude. But why did it have to come now? Why did it have to be right after all those other negative emails? Did Sarah even realize that her message was ruining my perfect morning? Wasn’t this the moment when I should’ve been feeling happy and fulfilled instead of worried and anxious? No, no, no! I mustn’t let these feelings get the better of"

So yeah, I might have submitted my story late, but let’s look at the bigger picture. I’ve been working non-stop for months, and I need some rest too. Now I can enjoy the weekend without worrying about this one little thing. What really bothers me is how much time I wasted waiting for the traffic to move. Two hours could have been better spent on something else. And why did I get stuck in traffic anyway? Maybe if I had left earlier, I wouldn’t have had to deal with this stress.
