But no, instead, I'm stuck here, surrounded by the same old smells and tastes that remind me of what we lost. My mom’s cookbook holds so much significance—it’s all I have left of her.

She knew she had locked up before leaving for work that morning. Her mind raced with possibilities as she grabbed the nearest heavy object - a crystal award from her bookshelf. Inching towards the bedroom door, she braced herself, her breath ragged. As she pushed it open, she saw it: a window slightly ajar, curtains billowing gently in the night breeze.

When I cook dinner, he eats whatever he wants, leaving his mess for me to deal with. And when I try to talk to him about it, he just says he doesn’t care about household chores. That’s ridiculous! If he didn’t want to contribute, he could’ve been honest from the start. But no, he has to pretend everything is fine until I bring it up. Now I feel like I’m always nagging him, making him act out just to prove a point. I hate how he pushes my buttons like this. Every little thing he does feels personal now. I know he’s not perfect, but sometimes I wish he’d put in some effort to change. Maybe if he did, our relationship wouldn’t be so strained. But I won’t let him get away with being lazy.

Even the bright blue liquid, once full of promise, now seemed dull and uninspiring, a reminder of all she would never achieve. Tom's effortless movements only served to highlight her own struggles, making her feel even more lost and behind. He moved through the task with ease, his confidence inspiring a mix of admiration and frustration within her. Each small victory he achieved only made her feel more defeated, as if every step forward meant another step backward for her.

You lose your partner because they find someone better-looking. It’s not fair; I’m still attractive, but no one wants me. Even if I change, it won’t work.
