Your career will go down the drain because no one will want to work for someone who can't even keep their own shit together. And then they'll take away our kids, too. You're going to ruin my life because of your stupid, selfish decisions. I swear, if you don't stop lying, I'm done. If I have to deal with one more secret, I'm walking out.

My kids will be all grown up, moved away, and never come back to visit. They'll forget about me and move on with their lives, leaving me to wonder what happened to them. Maybe they're happy, finally free from the stress and responsibility of caring for me... What if I die first? What if I'm not strong enough to handle the emotional toll of losing him again? What if I get sick myself and become one of those crazy people who need 24/7 care? Then where would they turn? What if they decide to move away and leave me behind?

I know she doesn’t want to upset people, especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but maybe she’s letting fear get the better of her. If she really meant what she wrote, wouldn’t she have sent it already? It’s not like her to be so indecisive. We’ve talked about this before, and she usually gets things done quickly. This time, though, there’s just no rush. Maybe she’s trying to control everything, or maybe she’s just scared of what might happen. Either way, I feel like we’re wasting time, and I wish she’d just make a decision. But even knowing all this, I still feel like something’s holding her back. It’s hard not to wonder if she’s avoiding confrontation or if she’s just lost confidence in her writing.
