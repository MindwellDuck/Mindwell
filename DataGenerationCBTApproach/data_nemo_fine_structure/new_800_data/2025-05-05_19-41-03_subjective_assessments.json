She'd seen him again today, his eyes cold and distant. He hadn't even bothered to look at the menu she'd painstakingly crafted, let alone taste the dishes she'd prepared just for him. As she began to prep for the evening service, she felt a familiar sting behind her eyes. Another rejection, another missed connection. She tried to focus on the rhythm of chopping vegetables, but each thud of the knife against the board echoed with the same hollow finality as his words, \"It's not you, it's me.\"",

Doesn't he know how much effort goes into making our food? I've been working tirelessly since morning, trying to perfect every dish. And what does he do? Treats me like an inferior being, saying he can't eat here because the food isn't up to par. It's unbelievable; I know exactly what he likes, and I've gone out of my way to make sure everything is just right. But no, he still has to go and be so condescending, implying that I'm incapable of doing anything right. And all the while, I'm standing there, sweating and shaking, my hands aching from chopping and peeling. Does he have any idea how hard it is to work under pressure? I'm barely holding it together, and yet he continues to berate me, making me feel like some kind of failure. Every word he speaks cuts deeper, making me question whether I'm really good enough. How could someone who claims to appreciate my cooking behave like this? It's infuriating, especially after the long hours of preparation. I feel like I'm drowning in frustration and disappointment. I want to scream, to lash out at him for treating me like this, but I keep it all inside, forcing myself to maintain a professional facade. This isn't about me; it's about the customers.

And what’s up with all these couples everywhere? They’re all so happy together, while we’re just...meh. She must have forgotten again, because if she didn’t forget, why would she choose this moment to leave me hanging? Maybe if I showed up early and picked her up, she wouldn’t be here with someone else already. This isn’t fair; I’ve been working non-stop for months. Can’t she understand that I need some attention right now? But does she ever think about me? Does she ever stop and consider how hard it is to keep going when she has nothing to look forward to? And then there are those little moments when I catch glimpses of her smile, and suddenly I’m reminded of everything. Every late-night conversation, every laugh, every kiss—none of which seem worth it anymore. She’s always busy, always distant. Even when we’re together, she’s lost in her own world, thinking about whatever fucking thing she’s into. And I'm left here, feeling pathetic, wondering if she's really even bothered to try.

It wasn't just the distance between them that hurt; it was the way they used to be together, laughing and carefree. Now, every time he saw that photo, he was hit with a wave of regret and longing. It's funny how one moment can shift your entire perspective. I remember being so caught up in planning our dream vacation that I forgot what we were even doing there. We spent more time arguing over whose turn it was to take photos than actually enjoying the trip. Even though she looks beautiful in this picture, I find myself thinking about all the times we fought and how that ruined our happiness. She seemed happier back then, didn’t she? I don’t know if it’s really fair to compare things like that, but it makes me wonder if maybe we weren’t meant to be together after all. Life is full of unexpected twists and turns, and sometimes those changes come at a cost. I guess I’m just trying to hold onto the past, but deep down, I know it won’t bring us back together."

As she sat there, she realized that she was putting too much pressure on herself, especially when it came to her lectures. But then again, shouldn't she be more concerned about what others think?

Every sound from the outside world felt muffled, distant, as if it belonged to someone else entirely. Even the silence seemed oppressive, heavy with the memory of what could have been, but never was. His gaze drifted across the room, tracing the lines of where her presence once filled every corner—where laughter lingered, where warmth radiated from the very walls themselves. But now, those spaces were nothing more than echoes, reminders of all that he had lost. The emptiness felt almost palpable, like a physical force pressing down upon him. Each breath seemed to draw closer to despair, until it became hard to distinguish between reality and the crushing weight of his own grief. As he stood there, the clock on the wall mocked him with its steady tick, marking the passage of time in slow, agonizing increments. Seven o'clock. A time meant for sharing stories, for savoring the flavors of life together. Instead, the hours stretched out before him like a vast, unyielding expanse of solitude, devoid of even the faintest whisper of connection.
