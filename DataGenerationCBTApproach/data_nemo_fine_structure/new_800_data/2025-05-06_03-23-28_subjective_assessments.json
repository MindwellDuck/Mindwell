Everyone else has normal lives; they don't spend all night freaking out over nothing. Even my parents, who are always complaining about how much work they have, never lie awake at 2:30 AM, worried sick. They're so calm and collected during the day, and I'm the one who has to stay up late, stressing because of some minor anxiety attack. It feels unfair compared to them. It's not like I'm trying to be perfect. I've been doing well this year, financially and academically, despite everything going on. But no matter how hard I try, I still end up getting anxious about everything—work, school, relationships, even my own health. My friends and family act like it's no big deal, but they don't know what it's like to live with these constant worries. I feel like I'm missing out on life because I'm stuck in my head, worrying about things that might never happen. And yet, when I look around, everyone else seems to have it easier. They get to go to bed early, while I'm still lying awake, thinking about all the things that could go wrong tomorrow. It doesn’t help that my partner’s anxiety problems make me feel like an asshole for having any worries at all. I mean, why bother when you can"

I'm starting to feel like I’m just one mistake away from losing everything—my job, my home, my family. Why does everyone else get to have a normal life while I struggle to keep up? Every time I see her, I can’t shake off the feeling that she doesn’t understand what I’m going through. She’s so calm and composed, even when faced with technical issues. It’s frustrating because I know she has her own set of problems too. But somehow, hers always seem less complicated than mine. Maybe it’s just because I don’t want to admit that I’m struggling more than anyone else, but deep down, I think I’m comparing myself unfavorably to her. Every time we meet, I end up feeling worse about my situation, like I’m just not good enough. When I look at her, I feel inadequate.

She thinks about how he might be dealing with his emotions right now. Is he feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork, struggling to cope with his past, or maybe just feeling lost and alone? She can't help but think about how this could impact her own life and teaching practice. Would it make her reevaluate her approach to supporting students, especially those facing similar challenges? In her mind, she sees a scenario where the student might lash out at someone else, causing more problems in the class or even beyond. She imagines how this situation could escalate, potentially affecting not just the student but the entire school community. It makes her question whether she's doing enough to address these underlying issues. She reflects on whether there are other ways this student might react, such as seeking help from a counselor or finding support from friends. Could that change the course of events? This experience has made her realize that sometimes people feel trapped by their circumstances. If this student acted impulsively, would it simply be another example of how difficult life is for many young people? She considers the possibility that this student might have written the note as a cry for help, rather than an attempt to hurt her. What if he genuinely needs guidance or just someone to talk to?

I don’t know how many times I’ve tried to talk about my feelings, but nothing ever changes. Every single time I tell her how I feel, she gets defensive and tells me that I need to calm down. Like, what am I even supposed to calm down from? Feeling ignored, unheard, and left behind? Does she really think that just because I say something, I want to fight? I can barely stand up straight when I’m feeling overwhelmed. And then she has the nerve to tell me I need to chill out? She doesn’t care enough to listen. She says I have a lot on my plate and that I should focus on my job instead. But if she was actually listening, would she understand why I feel so hurt? Why do I keep trying to explain how I feel? Is it because I genuinely want things to get better between us? Or is there another reason why I bother telling her? Maybe I just want someone to finally hear me. Maybe I’m tired of being invisible.

Still, he had no right to be so loud, especially since we were already short-staffed. What the fuck was he thinking? And another thing, why did everyone have to hear that?
