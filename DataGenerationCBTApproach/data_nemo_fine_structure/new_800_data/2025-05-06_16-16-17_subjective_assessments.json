The curator had promised it would be \"her best yet.\" But as she stood there, surrounded by hushed whispers and half-empty wine glasses, she realized only three of her pieces had been hung. The rest were from the new talent, a younger artist whose vibrant colors seemed to scream for attention. She felt a familiar pang in her chest, disappointment mingling with the hollow ache left by Jack's absence.",

I know I'm overreacting, but seeing those other artists' work makes me feel like my own is being ignored. It's like they're trying to erase me from this show. I can't help but think that the curator chose them instead because they're young and trendy, which means nothing about the quality of my art. Every time someone walks by, I feel like they're judging me. They don't even look at my paintings, just glance at them briefly before moving on. It hurts to see how little interest they have in my work. I tried to talk to some people who came, but they didn't say anything meaningful. It felt like they were just being polite. Even the music playing in the background seems off, too loud and annoying. The room feels empty, like everyone else has moved on. I wish I could just leave, but I stayed to prove myself, to show that my art matters. Now, I'm just feeling defeated and alone again. This is all so unfair."

I won't do it again.\" Her heart sank as she realized she'd forgotten to respond to little Emma's apology. The guilt weighed heavily, a familiar companion after years of teaching.",

I should have thanked her, let her know how much I appreciated her sincerity. Instead, I just left her note there, hoping she’d understand. It’s not like I didn’t hear what she said; I just wasn’t thinking about it at the time. I’m usually more careful than this, but I guess I got caught up in my own worries. Now I can’t stop thinking about it—I keep replaying our conversation in my head, wondering if I should’ve done something differently. If only I had paid more attention… (sigh) It feels like I’m letting my students down by not being fully present. They deserve better than me, especially when they’re making such an effort. I wish I could go back and do things differently. Maybe I’ll try to catch up tomorrow, but until then, I just feel stuck in this loop of regret. And yeah, it’s kind of embarrassing too—my mind is always running wild, but I guess that’s just part of being a teacher. Sometimes it feels like I’m juggling too many balls at once.

The newspaper lay untouched, his byline absent from the front page for what felt like an eternity. As she poured herself a cup of coffee, it seemed too bitter, too strong - just like life without him. She noticed a letter addressed to them both among the bills and obituaries. It was from their granddaughter, the one who'd moved away last year. The envelope remained sealed, untouched by her husband's steady hands. She couldn't bring herself to open it, fearing another reminder of what they'd lost, of the life they no longer had. Instead, she let it sit there, a silent sentinel of their fading legacy, as she sipped her coffee alone in the quiet house, wondering if anyone else felt as hopelessly adrift as she did.",

He had always been a bit moody, but she had never pushed back against his anger, afraid that it would escalate into something worse. But now, here we are, two years later, and every day feels like a struggle. She gets out of bed early, hoping to find some peace before the chaos begins. Instead, she finds the same emptiness that has become her constant companion. The silence is deafening, and she can't shake the feeling that time is running out. Time is running out, and yet, she struggles to accept reality. She can't seem to move forward, stuck in a cycle of grief and guilt. The world around her feels distant, as if everything has slowed down except her own pain. Every morning brings the same sadness, the same longing for what could never be again. And through it all, she wonders: Is this really how life is supposed to feel? Shouldn't there be more joy,"

And what really takes the cake is that they get to enjoy their days off while I'm stuck here, dealing with whatever crisis comes my way - all because some people think it's funny to let their pets cause chaos outside our hospital. Meanwhile, I have to put up with it, and no one even gives a second thought about how much stress it puts on me. I swear, every day feels like I'm walking on eggshells, waiting for the next emergency call. It’s exhausting being the only one available to take care of everything, even though I know I’m not doing anything special compared to other doctors. It makes me feel like I’m just not cut out for this job. Every little thing sets me off, from the constant noise of sirens to the pressure of trying to keep up with the workload. Sometimes I wonder if I would be happier just working at a different hospital where nobody knows me and doesn’t know how much stress I go through.

No one believed me back then. I wasn’t trusted. Now I’m just left with this stupid guilt and anger. Why does he get away with everything? Why doesn’t anyone remember anything? Why is everyone else so much better off than I am? He gets to live his life while I’ve spent the last 20 years drowning in this grief. How can someone so careless and selfish continue to thrive? Why can’t I just go home and forget about it all? It’s so unfair. I wish Emily would just come back. If only things had worked differently. But no, I’m stuck here forever, unable to move on.
