I don’t understand why this keeps happening. Is there something wrong with me? Am I not enough? Have I lost my chance at happiness? I keep thinking about all the times we talked, all the memories we shared. Every moment feels bittersweet now. I wish things could go back to how they were, but I know that’s impossible.

And don't even get me started on how \"easy\" it is to write clean, readable code. I mean, seriously, who needs to spend years honing their skills when you can just magically make the perfect program with zero effort? It sounds crazy, I know, but trust me, it happens. Just ask anyone who's ever had a brain fart while trying to write something simple. And let's not forget about the pressure. When you're working on something as important as this project, every single line of code has to be perfect. One mistake, and it's over. But hey, why worry about things that are outside of your control? Like, for instance, the fact that someone else might be reading your code and judging you based on how easy or hard it looks. Or maybe you’re just paranoid, but it feels like everyone around you is waiting for you to mess up so they can say “see, told ya so.” I mean, come on, we all know that the best way to deal with stress is to throw it away instead of facing it head-on.

My eyes flashed with frustration as I shot back at her, \"I'm not their personal assistant.\" But beneath the surface, a subtle shift was taking place. A mental filter had been applied, narrowing my focus to a single point of contention rather than the larger context. The ER, once a symphony of life and death, now became a battleground where every word felt like a challenge waiting to be met. In this moment, I was no longer just a doctor, but a prisoner of my own perceptions. As I stood there, frozen in time, I realized that my response wasn't about the patient or even the nurse; it was about the small, insidious filter that had taken hold. It was a reminder that sometimes, the greatest obstacle isn’t the world around us, but our own minds, which can create walls between what we see and what truly matters. In this sea of"
