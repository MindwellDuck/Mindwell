Even if she was alone, she'd be smiling and laughing, but now she has someone to share that with. Why does it have to be him? Why couldn't it be me instead? I know it sounds ridiculous, but seeing her with him makes me feel like I've failed somehow. My mind goes into overdrive, thinking about all the things I could've done differently. I wonder what would've happened if I had been there sooner, if I had made her laugh harder, if I had been the one she was talking to first. But no matter how many times I tell myself it's just jealousy, it never works. Every moment with her becomes an opportunity for him to make her happier. And it's hard to accept that sometimes even when you want something, it might never happen. Maybe it's better to focus on being a good friend, but damn, it hurts watching her move on with her life while I'm stuck here, feeling like shit. What's wrong with me? Why can't"

If I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t want some stranger showing up at my doorstep after school either. But still, I wish he knew that I cared. That I tried to make things better for him.

It's silly, I know, but I can't help feeling overwhelmed. Every day feels like a struggle, and I'm starting to lose hope. When I got home from work, I opened the fridge expecting leftovers from last night's dinner. Instead, all I saw were two empty containers—a yogurt and a beer. I was really looking forward to that yogurt; it had been sitting in the back of the fridge for days. Now it's gone, and all I'm left with is the beer. But what's the point?
