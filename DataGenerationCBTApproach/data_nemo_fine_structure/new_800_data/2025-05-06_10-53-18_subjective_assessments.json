It was her husband's laughter, mixed with someone else's—a young woman's voice. She paused, listening. They were watching a movie together on the couch, the one they used to share every Friday night before work consumed their lives. She felt an ache in her chest as she turned back to her computer, loneliness washing over her like a cold wave.",

He thinks I’m too busy for him, but does he know how hard it is to be productive at 3 AM? And then he goes and laugh with...with...whoever she is? The same way we would’ve laughed together, just him and me. Now I'm stuck here, alone, while he has his precious \"fun time\" with whomever. He probably doesn’t even care that I could join them; he knows I won't drop everything again. But why would he need anyone else when he had me? Is he so bored with our life together that he needs someone new to spice things up? Does he think I don’t notice how he looks at other women? How he talks to them? How they look at him? This isn't the first time he's been hanging out with another woman. It feels like he's always doing this behind my back, making plans with her instead of me. Why doesn't he make time for us anymore? We used to be inseparable; now I feel like an afterthought. I try to keep busy, but nothing fills the void left by his absence. It makes me wonder if he ever thought about leaving me. Would he have stayed if he still had me? Maybe I’m overreacting, but hearing him laugh with someone else hurts more than I expected"

I'll grab my first aid kit, see how bad it is. If he needs CPR, I'll give it to him. But what if he doesn't need it? What if I'm wrong? What if this is something more serious than a seizure? Something we're not trained for? Something that could kill him?! No, no, no. Don't think like that. Just go, do your job, get him back home safely. We'll figure it out when I get there.

How can something so insignificant make me feel like shit? I know I shouldn't be like this, but damn, it feels like we were never really apart. Even though he said he needed space, I'm still trying to process how he moved on without me. That's crazy, right? I mean, I'm not expecting him to magically come back or anything, but... why does it hurt so much? I guess I just don't want to accept that he's truly gone. Maybe I'm not over him yet, which doesn't seem possible, since I've moved on with my life. What the hell is wrong with me? Why do I keep dwelling on things that are long over?

By assuming that the passage of time and missed connections are solely due to personal shortcomings, we inadvertently shift the focus away from the actual causes—often complex, uncontrollable, and unpredictable factors such as circumstance, distance, and chance. This distorted perspective leads us down a path of self-blame, where every moment felt lost becomes a weighty burden, reinforcing feelings of inadequacy and regret. As we relive these moments in our minds, we fail to recognize that the world moves forward regardless of our presence, and that true change requires effort and dedication from everyone involved—not just oneself. By acknowledging this bias, we can begin to see that our experiences are part of a larger narrative, one that involves countless variables beyond our control, and that growth"
