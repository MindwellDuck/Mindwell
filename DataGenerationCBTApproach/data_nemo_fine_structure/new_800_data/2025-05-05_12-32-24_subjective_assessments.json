But honestly, I don't even care if you're doing it because you think it'll help your career; just stop making it look so obvious. You know what really pisses me off? The fact that you didn't even bother to acknowledge me when we were working together last year. It was all about you back then too. Now you're acting like everything I've done is nothing compared to whatever you're trying to achieve. And why are you always so quick to take credit for my work? Let's be real, if you weren't trying so hard to prove yourself, maybe we wouldn't be having this conversation. So instead of pretending like nothing's going on, just admit you're trying to steal my ideas and move forward. If you can't do that, at least give me some respect and stop treating me like an idiot. But seriously, what’s going on with you? Are you just desperate enough to do anything to get ahead, even if it means damaging people’s reputations? Because from where I stand, it looks like you’re willing to do whatever it takes to make your career happen, even if it means hurting others along the way. You need to realize that you're"

But now it looks like you don't care about anything except yourself. If you had real dedication, you would've pushed through the staffing issues and made this happen. Instead, you're letting people suffer because you're too scared to take responsibility. This isn't about being professional; it's about doing what's right for these kids. By cancelling, you're putting their health at risk—just like you did when you postponed the surgery last week. Do you even care about the pain you cause? You're supposed to be a doctor, but all you do is disappoint people. I'm so disappointed in you. It's not fair to expect us to wait around for hours just because you can't handle a little extra work. And now you're telling us this surgery has been cancelled? That means our whole plan has gone up in smoke. We came from far away for this, and now we'll have to waste our time and money again because of your incompetence. How could you do this to us? You're supposed to help people, not hurt them more. I feel betrayed by you. I expected more from my doctor. You're making me regret ever trusting you."

These events keep repeating themselves, painting a picture of a world where nothing ever goes smoothly.

It's exhausting trying to navigate such uncertainty, and I often find myself wondering if I'll ever truly feel safe. I can't help but think about all those times when seemingly minor issues turned out to be more serious problems than expected, leaving me shaken and questioning my ability to trust the world around me. Each experience feels like a reminder that our lives are always on edge, waiting for the next unexpected twist.

Didn't they agree that life would be easier if they were apart? As she chopped the onions, tears began to fall.

She thought about how he had always been there for her, supporting her through college, helping with chores, and encouraging me to pursue my passion. They had shared so many moments, from late-night conversations to spontaneous road trips. He had been more than just a partner; he was my rock, my best friend.
