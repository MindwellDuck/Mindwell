My mind is consumed by thoughts of loss and heartache, and I can't shake off the feeling that this is all I'll ever know. My girlfriend's deception has shattered my world, leaving me with nothing but tears and regret. She once promised forever, but now she’s gone, and I'm left with just memories of what could have been. Every day feels like a heavy weight, crushing me beneath its oppressive force. I’m lost in a sea of sorrow, unable to find solace anywhere. This isn’t just about the past; it’s about the future. I see myself alone, forever trapped in this prison of pain. There's no escape from the darkness that surrounds me. Every step forward feels like a leap into the unknown, filled with uncertainty and fear. In a world where love was supposed to heal us, it’s instead become a source of suffering. What was meant to bring joy now fills me with despair. I feel abandoned, forgotten, and left behind. It’s hard to imagine a time when things were different, when we had dreams together. But even those dreams seem impossible now. They’re shrouded in shadows, lost in the distance, and fading fast. What once brought light to our lives is now nothing more than a distant memory. Everything around me is tainted with sadness, making it difficult to breathe."

It feels like a setup. Like this is just another one of her games. But what if...what if she's really gone? I feel like I'm losing my mind. I keep thinking about all those times she got upset when I came home from work too early, how she always made excuses for why she stayed out longer than usual. What if she's playing me? What if this is all some twisted game she's playing? My heart is racing, and I can't catch my breath. Why would she leave again? Did I miss something? Was there a sign I didn't see? This isn't fair. I know she's been stressed lately, but does she think I don't notice? Does she think I'm stupid enough to believe whatever she says? I swear, sometimes I wonder if I even know my own daughter. This whole thing feels like a lie. Every time she tells me she's fine, I doubt her. She's always been good at hiding things. Maybe she's lying to me, maybe she's planning something."

This might sound harsh, but I just want to protect her. She needs someone who cares about her, but I don't think she's ready for another relationship. It's probably better if we stay away from each other until she gets her life together. I can't bear the thought of her getting hurt again, especially after everything that happened with him. She deserves so much better than someone who would take advantage of her vulnerability. I know it sounds selfish, but I just want what's best for her, even if that means keeping distance.

It's exhausting, and I wish I could calm down, but my brain won't let me. The smallest things give me such strong reactions, even though logically they're probably insignificant. I know deep down that most of these worries are irrational, but my instincts keep telling me otherwise. I guess it's hard for me to trust my rational side when my gut feels like it's screaming danger at me. It’s really frustrating because I want to focus on more important things, but this constant fear holds me back. Sometimes I wish I could just ignore these thoughts, but they linger, making me feel anxious even when there’s no real reason to be. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I wonder if anyone else is experiencing something similar—like, maybe we’re all overreacting?"
