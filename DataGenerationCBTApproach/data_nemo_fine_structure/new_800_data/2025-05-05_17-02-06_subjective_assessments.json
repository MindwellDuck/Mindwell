I can't imagine how scary it must be, especially since you guys work together all the time. What if they didn't notice her pain because they were too busy? Maybe they weren't paying attention closely enough. What if there was an underlying condition we missed? You know, I've heard stories about patients who went home with undiagnosed conditions. That would have made things way worse for them. And what if your partner feels guilty for not noticing it sooner? You're already dealing with this emotional rollercoaster; now imagine if she felt even more overwhelmed. What if she started to think she wasn't doing enough for her patients? The thought alone makes me shudder. I wish you both the best, but honestly, I'm scared for you both right now. How are you handling everything? Have you talked about it? What if it gets worse? We need to make sure you guys are okay, mentally and physically. Please take care of yourselves during these challenging times. I hope things get better soon. If you need anything at all, don't hesitate to reach out. Sending lots of love and support your way. 😊 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

The clock ticked loudly in the silent study, each second echoing his regret. He'd been so consumed by his work, even after she'd fallen ill. If only he'd spent more time with her, held her hand just one more time... but now, it was too late.

When she fell ill, he'd thought he could handle it - he had to, for her sake. But the reality of caring for her, watching her slip away, had left him numb. He'd stayed up every night, praying, working, trying to find some sort of peace. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, he felt like he was failing her. Failing himself. Every day, every moment, every decision seemed to lead him further down a path he didn't want to tread. He wondered if he'd \"done enough.\" Had he given her everything? Had he listened when she needed someone to hear her out? Had he been there for her when she needed comfort? The questions swirled in his mind, each one a painful reminder of what he'd missed. He felt trapped, stuck in a cycle of guilt and grief, unable to move forward. The world outside seemed to keep spinning, but inside, he felt frozen, unable to let go of the past. His thoughts were a jumble of what-ifs, each one a thread pulling him deeper into sorrow. As he sat there, surrounded by the silence of the empty room, he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd never truly loved her the way she deserved."

I get upset whenever someone mentions his name, but does she really think I'd care about some stupid letter? When did she start acting like this? After he died? No wonder she doesn't remember anything important anymore. If she couldn't even keep track of something as simple as a letter, what else has she forgotten? I swear, she's more forgetful than I am, and I have an awful memory. I don't know why I'm even bothered. Maybe I just feel guilty because I haven't visited them since he passed away. That's what this is all about – her guilt trips and my pity. I wouldn’t want her to feel bad either, but damn, she’s making me feel terrible. It makes sense that she would forget something like that, though. I mean, who wouldn’t forget something like that? My mom had a hard time remembering things after he died. Yeah, maybe she forgot, but it’s easier to say that than to admit it herself. Anyway, if she had actually shown me that letter, I probably wouldn’t be feeling this way right now.
