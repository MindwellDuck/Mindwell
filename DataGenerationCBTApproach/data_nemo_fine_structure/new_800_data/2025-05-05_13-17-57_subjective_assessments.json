The smell clung to me like a bad omen, reminding me that no matter how hard we tried, the hospital would always be a place where dignity suffered. As I gazed at the stains, my mind began to wander back to the days when I used to work here. I remembered the time she spilled coffee all over the counter, laughing it off with a careless smile. Now, I couldn't help but think of all the times the kitchen had been left in disarray, the floors covered in grime. It wasn't just the physical mess; it was the lack of respect for our work. No one ever cared about the effort we put into healing others. They didn't see us as people, just disposable workers.

Maybe I should focus on the present instead of dwelling on the past. Yet, every time I try to push those thoughts aside, they come flooding back, like a tide of guilt and responsibility.
