She remembered writing back, explaining why they couldn't be together anymore, but this letter, unopened, told her he'd never known why. A lump formed in her throat as melancholy washed over her like a familiar, unwanted visitor.",

You always react negatively to my suggestions. I've tried so many times to get you to see things from my perspective, but you just won't listen. You're always resistant, never willing to consider what others might think or how we can work together. You always seem to find fault in everything I suggest. You never give me a chance to explain myself. Your anger is exhausting. You make every conversation feel like a battle, and it's hard to know where to start when dealing with someone who reacts so harshly. It's like you're looking for something to fight about, no matter what. I try to offer helpful advice, but you twist it into something personal. Your negativity affects everyone around you, making even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. You're not just hurting yourself; you're dragging others down too. Why can't you just let go of some of that anger? Sometimes I wonder if you ever stop to think about how your behavior impacts those close to you. Your constant resistance feels like a weight, and I don't know how much more I can handle. Have you considered therapy? Maybe it could help you manage some of that anger. If you were open to it, I think it could really make a difference. But until then, I'll continue to reach out"

But then again, I’ve been doing pretty well on my own, and I've had some good friends, but none of them wrote me letters like that. Maybe if I’d been more responsible and less reckless, I would’ve gotten something too. I mean, why did I need to be such a wild child? If I had been more responsible, maybe I would have gotten a letter from my parents too, you know, one last thing before they died. Why is everyone else getting these letters and not me? What am I missing out on? I wish I could turn back time and be more responsible, but no, I’m stuck here now, and all I can think about is how unfair life is. I guess I’ll just keep trying to make up for lost time, but honestly, I don’t see anyone else as being more deserving than me. This whole situation just makes me feel like shit.

I mean, why would he even consider taking on more stress when he could be out there living his best life? He definitely isn't bothered by the lack of a promotion. In fact, he must be super relieved. That guy has some serious issues if he's avoiding responsibility like this. His inability to handle stress makes him a terrible boss. But hey, at least he gets to enjoy his free time without worrying about work. So yeah, I'm glad he decided not to take the promotion. This whole thing is just one big relief for me.
