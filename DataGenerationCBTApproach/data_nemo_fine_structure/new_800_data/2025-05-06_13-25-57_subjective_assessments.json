It was like he had just won the lottery. Jake felt a twinge in his heart, remembering when he was once so eager for recognition. But now, after decades of hard work, he felt more melancholy than proud. He forced a warm smile and said, \"Yeah, that's great, Jake. You deserve it.\" But deep down, Jake wondered if Jake really needed this kind of validation. Did he feel insecure, like he wasn't good enough? Maybe he was jealous of Jake's success. Or maybe he simply didn't care. Jake shrugged off these thoughts, focusing instead on the fact that Jake was doing well. After all, everyone deserved some kind of celebration, right? Jake took a deep breath and tried to shake off those intrusive thoughts."

Maybe she thinks I'm boring, too. Or maybe she got tired of waiting for me to finish my fucking project already. The way she looks at that artist, though... it's clear she really likes him. And who knows what other guys are coming over tonight? This is all because of one fucking painting. I put my heart and soul into it, and she doesn't even give a shit about it anymore. She didn't care when I told her I was working on it, and she probably thought it was lame anyway. Now she's acting like I'm nothing compared to some other dude. Fuck her. If anything, I'll show her who's boss. That artist is going down. Fuck you, Rachel. You're just another pretentious bitch who thinks she's above everyone else.

It really showed that she didn't value me at all. Then, when I asked her for feedback on my project, she looked at me like I was some kind of idiot and said, “You already know what I think.” Can you believe it? Like, seriously, doesn’t she realize how much effort I put into this? And then to make matters worse, she told me that if I didn't get my act together, I wouldn't be welcome here anymore. Like, what does she mean by that? Does she think I don't know how hard it is to work in this industry? And honestly, I feel like I'm not even going to miss working there anyway. I’m so glad I left this toxic place behind. But what really gets me is that everyone else seemed to love working with her.

Maybe if I had done more of my homework, none of this would happen. I was supposed to finish that project last week, but no, I kept putting it off until the deadline passed. Now I’m stuck here, struggling to adjust to something new when I could have handled it better back then. I don’t understand why I always worry about things that never come true. But what if...?

I remember the way he'd look at me, the way he'd hold my hand, the way he'd kiss me. But most of all, I remember the emptiness when he was gone. He always made it sound so easy for him to leave. He told me he needed time to focus on himself, to figure out what he wanted from life. That was four years ago. Four years of watching him slip away, of seeing him change. He became distant, cold, and detached. His love for me faded, replaced by a new passion - coding. He spent hours locked in his room, pouring over lines of code, forgetting about us. I tried to be understanding, to give him space, but it wasn't enough. The pain grew inside me, suffocating me. When he finally disappeared, leaving behind nothing but a note, I felt like I was losing my grip on reality. Every day is a struggle now.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of those young nurses who thinks she knows better than everyone else. They think they're so smart with all their fancy degrees and certifications, but they really know nothing when it comes to real-world experience. So, what exactly makes you think he's incompetent? Did you see him struggle with the stethoscope? What did you hear? Maybe we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions here. We don't have all the facts yet. Let's take a step back and look at this objectively. If there's even a slight chance he might be doing everything wrong, then maybe we should wait until we get more information before making judgments. This isn't fair to either side. What's your point? You're saying that based on this one small mistake, we should completely dismiss the entire nursing staff? That doesn't make sense.
