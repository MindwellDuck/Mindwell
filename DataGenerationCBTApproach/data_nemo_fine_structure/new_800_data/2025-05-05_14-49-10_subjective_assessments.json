He leans in too close and whispers, \"You're not as tough as you used to be, are ya?\" ## Step 2: Reflect on your emotions The woman feels annoyed by the man's comment, but she tries to keep her cool. ## Step 3: Analyze the situation She thinks about how this man has been around for a long time and has seen many people come and go. He probably doesn't mean anything negative by his statement. He may have genuinely forgotten that she is still here. ## Step 4: Consider alternative perspectives Maybe this man isn't even thinking about her at all; maybe he's just being sarcastic towards everyone who comes into the coffee shop. ## Step 5: Evaluate your own behavior When faced with similar situations in the past, she has usually tried to ignore them or walk away instead of engaging"

But then why did she write that note? I looked around, everything seemed so normal. I could see myself sitting here, reading my book, thinking about how much I missed her. I tried to hold onto these thoughts, but they slipped away, leaving me with more questions. What if she left because I wasn't good enough for her? What if she's trying to tell me something by writing that note? If she wanted to disappear, wouldn't she have done it last night instead of during the day when everyone is busy? Why did she choose this time? I remembered the argument we had, and suddenly, I felt guilty. Did she leave because of that? Was I too much for her? I thought about all the times we fought, all the things I could have done differently. I couldn't stop thinking about those fights, wondering if I was somehow responsible for her departure.

I tried to brush off the emotions, telling myself that I needed to focus on work. But the truth is, I couldn’t shake the feeling of disappointment. Maybe I’m just too sensitive, but I felt like I was meant to experience things differently. Everyone else seemed to be moving forward, while I was stuck in the past. It wasn’t just the act itself; it was the reminder that life goes on regardless of our personal struggles. Seeing others move on, even if unintentionally, made me feel like I was falling further behind. It was hard not to compare myself to those around me, especially when they seemed so carefree.
