She paused, listening, as memories of happier times washed over her like a tide. Her phone buzzed with an email notification - another invitation for a colleague's retirement party, another reminder of time passing. She took a deep breath, the cool autumn air stinging her eyes, and continued her lonely walk home.",

The world outside seemed to fade away. All that mattered was me, alone, lost in memories. The music filled me with longing, yet I felt empty inside. It was just a song. But somehow, it became everything. Time stood still, and nothing else existed. Only me, the past, and the moment. And now, I'm left standing here, frozen, with no direction. The world moves forward, but I’m stuck in this moment, unable to let go."

I mean, look at the way everyone's looking at each other—especially John, who always has a smirk on his face when he thinks he's getting away with something. He never says anything, but you can tell he knows exactly what's going on. This isn't the first time I've felt like an idiot over something like this, and I'm starting to get really annoyed. Why does it have to be me every time? Can't anyone else for once? But then again, maybe I am the target because... well, because of how cute I am. Yeah, that must be it. Everyone loves me, which is why they're all staring at me now. John's probably thinking about how lucky he is to have someone like me in his life.

It's such a waste of time and energy. I'm better off just leaving them alone. But no, I had to go and arrange them, didn't I? Now I feel guilty because I should be doing more important things, but no, I let myself get distracted by something as trivial as flowers. Why do I always fall into this trap? I know it's just a bunch of dead plants, but somehow, I still feel guilty about it. It's ridiculous; I could have done anything else with my time, but I chose to spend it on something so unnecessary. And why am I even thinking about this? It's just a stupid flower arrangement. What does it really matter? But no, I won't let it go. I keep replaying it in my head, wondering why I did it. Was it because I couldn't handle being alone? Or maybe because I felt sorry for those poor flowers? Whatever the reason, I can't shake it off.

I've been so patient with you lately because I thought things were finally looking up between us. But now, I realize that patience has turned into desperation. And this fucking dinner party wasn't helping; it made everything worse. You're acting like nothing happened, like you didn't just humiliate me right in front of everyone. The way you laughed with them, the way you seemed to be having fun... It's like you're enjoying every second of this. Are you trying to make me look like an idiot? Do you really want me to think you're laughing at me behind my back? This isn't just about what happened tonight; it's about the fact that you always seem to find ways to push my buttons. You can't help yourself, and it's getting old. Every time we get close, you find a way to pull away. Tonight, you went from kissing me to walking away like nothing mattered.

I might as well let him sleep now and save myself the trouble of waking him up later. He doesn't care about me at all; he's probably thinking about how much he hates cooking. Or maybe he's just too stupid to understand that we need to eat. But honestly, it doesn't matter. If he was smart, he'd have helped with the dishes. Now he's just wasting my time. I swear, men are so dumb sometimes. They always think they can get away with everything because no one will ever call them out. Well, I'm calling him out - and I'm making sure he knows that I know exactly when he's being lazy.

My eyes were blurry from crying, but I could read the numbers just fine. After work, she went to the park alone. She sat under a tree, trying to enjoy the view, but all she saw was sadness. I know the sun is shining because I looked outside through my window, and I could feel its warmth on my skin. But I also saw the dark clouds overhead, which made me think about his absence more.

She watched as they took him away, heard the whispered conversations about his condition, the medication he couldn’t take, the surgeries he needed. What if those weren’t enough? What if he slipped through their fingers again? She thought about all the times he’d tried to kill himself, how many attempts he made before they got him help. What if that wasn’t enough either?
