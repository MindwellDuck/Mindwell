I'm home.\" No response. She found him in their bedroom, slumped on the bed, holding a framed photo of them, laughter frozen in time at some long-forgotten wedding anniversary. A half-empty bottle of whiskey lay beside him. His eyes were red, not from alcohol but from tears. He looked up at her, his voice thick with emotion, \"You missed our anniversary today.\" She felt the guilt wash over her like the boiling water she'd plunged her hands into earlier that day.",

Her expression shifted from confusion to hurt, and then back to something else entirely. She shook her head, almost as if trying to clear her mind of the emotions swirling inside. \"No, I don't know why you're acting like this,\" she said, her voice firm but laced with a hint of desperation. \"We've been through tough times before, and I've never forgotten anything important. What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about how much you've been neglecting me lately. How often have I complained about your lack of communication? Your constant absence while you're working? The way you leave me alone, even on days like today—our anniversary?\" Her gaze dropped, and for a moment, I thought I saw tears welling up in her eyes. But they quickly dried, replaced by a look of frustration. \"You're being really insensitive right now,\" she snapped, her voice rising. \"Just because you want attention doesn't mean I should give it to you.\" I stood there, feeling like an outsider looking in. My anger boiled over, and I couldn't help but lash out. \"Your fault,\" I said, my words spilling out in"

She deserves to be up there instead of me. Why did she agree to show her work? I'm just taking her credit, and no one sees that. It's so obvious how much better she is at this. I'm just a placeholder, pretending to be involved. No one will notice if I disappear now. I don't belong here, and everyone knows it. They're all secretly judging me, and I deserve to be humiliated. The fact that my girlfriend is getting attention makes it worse—I feel like a burden to her. If I weren't here, she'd probably have two exhibitions by now. I'm just making things harder for her.

If anything, it strengthens my resolve to stand by her side, even when faced with such gruesome reminders. **She was disgusting** This isn't just about the rats. Every time she touches something, every time she smells something, I can see the memories flashing before my eyes. I remember the smell of rotting flesh, the feel of cold skin beneath my fingers, the sound of silence where there once was laughter. And then there's her touch, soft and gentle, but laced with a deep sadness. It's all too much. She feels disgusting because she's been through hell, and I've been through hell right beside her. But I won't let her feel this way. I'll hold her close, remind her of better times, and fight back against these feelings. She may think she's disgusting, but I know the truth. She's brave, resilient, and strong, and nothing will ever make her feel otherwise."
