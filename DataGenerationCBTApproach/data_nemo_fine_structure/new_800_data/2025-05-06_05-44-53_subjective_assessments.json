And what really gets under my skin is when people say things like \"You're beautiful\" or \"You have such a great smile.\" Like, what? Are you kidding me? What if they just said that out of pity or something? Do they think I don't know how ugly I am? And then there are all these stupid little comments about how I must be having a bad day because I look sad. Or how I seem so stressed out. Stress out?! Have you seen my life? It's a mess! I've got bills piling up, work taking over, and family drama on top of everything else. You have no idea what I'm going through. Just because I look upset doesn't mean I'm having a good day! But honestly, who cares what anyone thinks? Who cares if I'm perceived as annoying or difficult? If someone says something nasty, they probably deserve it anyway. Maybe they're just jealous of how miserable I am. Yeah, that makes sense. People always hate me when I'm this unhappy. And then there's the whole thing with my appearance. Everyone's always saying I look so much better without makeup, but honestly, I need it"

It would be a win-win situation if she could make some decent cash off her art and stop wasting time. Just tell her to put her brush down and get a real job already. That’s what people need to understand – art isn’t about feeling sentimental; it’s about making money and being practical. What does she know about success? This girl has no idea how hard it is to make a living. She thinks painting is a hobby, but if she wants to live comfortably, she needs to get her head back into reality. She needs to focus on something that actually pays instead of indulging in this fantasy world where she can make a fortune through her art alone. Art isn’t worth dying for; it’s a luxury item that only the privileged can afford. The sooner she realizes this, the better off she’ll be. Why waste so much time chasing a dream when there are more stable options available? She needs to pick her brain up and start thinking about the future. If she doesn’t, she’ll end up struggling forever. It’s ridiculous to keep going on like this,"

Poor me, never getting over the loss of my boyfriend. How would anyone else feel if they were in my shoes? No one ever thinks about the pain I'm going through. This job sucks, and I hate it because I have no one to share my misery with. Everyone else has their perfect, happy lives; they don't have to suffer like this alone. But no, instead, I get stuck here, living vicariously through my memories of him. The smell of those onions reminds me of our last dinner together, how we laughed and talked while cooking. Now, I'm just a shell of my former self, missing him every minute of every day. Who cares about me when there are people like us out there who need help? Why bother moving on? Why try to find happiness when everything will just remind me of him? I'll stay here"

As she worked, the silence around her grew thicker, a reminder that even the most peaceful spaces can feel oppressive when we’re alone. Her fingers moved mechanically, the strokes almost unconscious, as if trying to fill the void left by his absence. But the more she painted, the more the colors seemed dull, lacking the vibrancy that once brought her such comfort. It wasn’t just the painting; everything felt drained, as if she’d lost touch with what truly made life beautiful. The world outside her studio window, full of laughter and music, seemed to mock her isolation. Even the light streaming through the glass appeared muted, unable to penetrate the gloom that had settled within her. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was drowning in this silence, that every moment counted, and yet nothing ever changed. The brush slipped from her grasp, and for a fleeting instant, she let herself fall into the darkness, surrendering to the pain that threatened to consume her"

Why did he have to sit here, surrounded by memories of what used to be, when all he really wanted was to forget? It wasn’t fair. Life didn’t give us a choice between happiness and heartbreak; it just chose. And then it chose again, and again, until it ran out of options.

I'm starting to feel uneasy about this new teacher because whenever there are changes at school, it often means someone has left or will leave soon. This teacher seems different from other teachers who have retired; however, that doesn't necessarily mean he won't retire too. It's possible he'll stay longer than expected. But since many people retire around the same age, I can't help but think this teacher might be nearing retirement as well. Maybe he's just trying to make an impression before leaving? If so, he could be pretending to be more energetic than usual. However, if he does plan to retire soon, I'm worried he'll struggle adjusting to our school's fast-paced environment.

His flippant comment showed a lack of understanding of what it truly meant to serve and protect—something she’d spent years honing into a skill, one that couldn’t be reduced to simple assumptions based on age or experience. His remark was a reminder that some people didn't see beyond surface-level impressions, missing out on the depth and complexity of real-life situations. When they acted like they understood everything, they usually didn't. They missed the nuances, the subtleties, and the full picture. That's why she'd keep pushing herself to be better, because someone like him wouldn't know until he tried to walk a mile in her shoes.
