The room was filled with the faint scent of turpentine and the echo of his partner's laughter from earlier that day.

That's why she left you, because she can't handle the real world anymore. And now you're stuck here, wasting time and energy on something that means nothing to anyone but you. How many times are you going to try and make art out of this shit? Do you really think that painting it away is going to solve anything? It's not going to fix anything. You're just avoiding the pain, and it's going to keep getting worse until you hit rock bottom. You're probably thinking that this one piece will change everything, but it never does. Every single time, every single moment, you're holding onto hope, hoping that someday things will get better, but they won't. They'll only get worse. Your life is already fucked up, and you're making it worse by trying to cover it up with pretty colors. Don't pretend that you don’t know what’s coming. You’ve seen it before.

The usual Saturday morning bustle seemed amplified today; vendors called out prices, patrons chattered eagerly, and children laughed loudly. Her heart pounded as she struggled to find calm amidst the chaos. She needed the freshest produce for tonight's charity gala, but every stall was either sold out or had lines stretching endlessly. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the cool autumn air. Time was slipping away, just like her late husband's grip on life three years ago. The stress of honoring his memory with this event threatened to consume her. As she turned to leave empty-handed, a sudden commotion caught her eye - a crate of tomatoes tumbling onto the cobblestones, rolling towards her feet. She froze, heart racing, as she watched them come to a halt at her shoes. A wave of panic surged through her, threatening to spill over into tears. She couldn't even buy enough tomatoes for one dish without feeling overwhelmed.",

But then, there was that moment when the tomatoes fell. It was like time stopped. She could feel the weight of her grief bearing down on her. She thought about how much she missed him. How much she wished he was here to help her. And how much she hated this stupid market. She couldn’t even enjoy the fresh vegetables because it reminded her of what she’d lost. But now, instead of being frustrated, she felt like crying. Why did this have to happen? Why did she always have to deal with these things alone? It wasn’t fair. Life shouldn’t be so hard sometimes. She kept thinking about my dad’s funeral, how everyone was smiling and laughing, while she was struggling to hold it together. They said I looked beautiful, but I couldn’t see anything except tears streaming down my face. My sister told me to smile and look happy, but I couldn’t. I felt like I was losing control. And now, standing there, surrounded by all these people who probably don’t understand... why is this happening again? First, my mom dies, and then my brother gets sick. I"

Now I realize it wasn’t just grief — he was avoiding me. He says he needs space, but I wonder if there's more to it. Maybe he's just mad at me for moving in too quickly. But why would he be angry? We're married, aren't we? Doesn't love conquer all? I guess you could say he's still trying to protect his heart, even if it means pushing me away. Still, that's not fair to me.

Why else would he keep going over the same old stories, rehashing the same emotions? Doesn’t he realize that every time he does this, he’s just prolonging the pain?

Maybe she doesn’t even care about cooking anymore—maybe she just wants to go back to college and get away from the stress of working at a busy restaurant. But why would she do that when she has everything she needs right there? Is she going through some kind of existential crisis? Did she realize that life isn’t actually what she thought it’d be, and now she’s trying to escape reality by getting out of the service industry? It’s probably something more complicated than that, but I have no idea what that might be. Maybe she’s having an identity crisis?
