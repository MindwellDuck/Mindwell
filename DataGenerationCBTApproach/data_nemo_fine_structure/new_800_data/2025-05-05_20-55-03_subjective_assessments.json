The other day, I was just chillin' at home when my partner came over. We were hanging out, having fun, but then she got up to get something. She walks into the bathroom, closes the door behind her, and I'm left standing there, feeling like a creep. At first, I thought nothing of it, but then I heard some muffled sounds. My gut started telling me that I wasn't imagining things. I felt like I had to check if everything was okay. So, I did what any self-respecting guy would do—-I snuck into the bathroom and took a peek through the peephole. What I saw really hit me hard. There was this dude, literally right next to my partner, making moves on her. I felt like I was going to explode. Now, I know what you're thinking - why didn't I just come clean about seeing him? Well, let's be real, I was too fucking mad to care. I ended up confronting my partner about the whole thing, which led to some pretty intense discussions. It was clear that she had feelings for this guy, and I couldn’t compete with that. I was so hurt and angry that I started questioning our entire relationship. Why had she never told me about him before? But the worst part"

So maybe she's right? Maybe she does deserve that. But then again, I've never met this girl before, so I don't really know anything about her. What if this is all just a big misunderstanding? Like, maybe she was having a bad day or something. You never know what someone's going through unless you actually talk to them. But wait, why am I thinking this? Is it because I don't know much about her, or is it because I want to believe she's telling the truth? I guess I'm just trying to find an excuse for her behavior, but honestly, I think it's kind of weird how passionate she is. I mean, who gets that angry over a computer? This whole thing feels off, but I'm also kinda curious. What if she's just really upset about something and doesn't know how to express herself properly? Maybe she needs help or support or something.

We were inseparable once, but now...now it's nothing but a memory. A bittersweet reminder of what we've lost. How could you be so heartless? And another thing, why the fuck would you bring it out? Why now? Was it some sort of sick joke? Did you think it'd be funny to just casually mention it and watch me fall apart? Or maybe it wasn't a joke at all? Maybe there's something more going on here, something you're not telling me. Am I really supposed to believe that you didn't mean anything by bringing it up?

Now, I'm going to have to tell him again, and he'll probably act like I'm overreacting. He never listens anyway, so why should I expect anything different now? This is all because of her. She's the one who convinced him to stop wearing the ring in the first place. If she hadn't mentioned how \"tacky\" it looked next to her own engagement ring, he wouldn't have ditched it. And if he hadn't gone along with it, none of this would happen. I swear, every time I try to talk to him about something important, we end up arguing over some silly thing like this. I don't even want to see him until I've cooled down, but I guess that's too much to ask. After all, he doesn't respect boundaries either. Why should I bother trying to set an example for our kids?

She used to wear white shirts with yellow flowers, and now she's wearing dark pants with no flowers at all. And have you seen the way she carries herself differently? She didn't seem like someone who would do that. I wonder if she'll ever come back to our house again, if she'll even remember me. She probably won't, though - everyone says she's into people with \"good jobs\" these days, whatever that means. Anyway, I'm glad she doesn't remember me, since I don't really exist anymore anyway.
