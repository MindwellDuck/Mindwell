Every time my boyfriend is out with friends or family, he’s at the hospital for hours. It feels like he prioritizes his job over me. He works hard to save lives, but it comes at a cost. Every day, he's there, even when we have plans together. My anxiety grows stronger because I feel like he doesn't consider our feelings. When he's tired, he gets annoyed, which makes me worry if I'm causing him stress by being around. I try to be understanding, but I keep feeling neglected. This isn't the first time someone has called me selfish for wanting some alone time. I just want to hang out and spend time together, but he says he can't leave the hospital. It feels like no matter how much I talk to him, he doesn’t hear me. Sometimes, I wonder if he thinks I’m being dramatic, trying to get attention. I know he cares, but it’s frustrating to see him so focused on his work. I hope he realizes how much this affects me. I love him, but I don’t know what to do anymore."

Each beep of an unanswered email echoed through the house like a distant gunshot, fueling her worry.

But then there’s this other woman, let’s call her Sarah, who seems to have gotten the news much faster than her. I mean, we all know how fast lab results come out these days, so why does she need to check hers every hour? Is she just more anxious? Does she really feel this way? What if she’s not as worried as she seems? Maybe she’s just busy or doesn’t want to overthink things. Why would she need to check her watch constantly? I’m starting to wonder if she’s even trying to get the results quickly because she thinks they’re bad. If she had something serious, wouldn’t she be freaking out by now? Or is she just pretending to be anxious for some reason? You never know what people are thinking behind closed doors. Maybe she doesn’t care about the results; maybe she has everything under control. This whole thing feels unfair—she gets the results, and I don’t. There must be something wrong with my test, or maybe it just took longer to process. Now I’m doubting my own anxiety. Maybe I’m overreacting, just like she might be. It’s hard not to feel like she’s getting away with something when she seems so calm while I’m losing my mind. Everyone else knows their results, but not me. That’s what"

They don't care; they don't remember you. Fuck this shit. I swear, if one more thing happens, I'll lose it. Maybe I should just leave. Forget everything. Leave everything behind. Not because I need to escape, but because I have no other choice. At least then I won't be reminded of all this shit. Of everyone else living their life while I'm stuck in this hole. What the fuck am I even doing here? I was supposed to be long gone by now. Dead. But no, I'm still here. Alone. And it kills me every damn day. Why does it always have to be like this? I thought maybe someday things would change. Maybe someone would finally understand me. Maybe something good would happen. But no, it's always the same. The pain never fades. It only gets worse. I hate being me. I hate being stuck here, watching everyone else live their lives. Watching people grow older, find love, build families. While I'm left here, rotting away, forgotten."

We were happy, and our relationship wasn't perfect, but at least we had each other. Now, everything feels forced. Even the little things seem fake, like when you hold my hand or tell me \"you mean more to me than anyone else\" – those words sound nice, but they don't feel real anymore. Every time you try to comfort me, it just makes me feel worse. I'm not asking for much; I just want to be treated like a normal partner, someone who means something to you. If you really loved me, wouldn’t you make an effort? I feel like I’m just going through the motions here. You say you care, but actions speak louder than words. And right"

This is ridiculous. The world must be playing some kind of sick game where the old are punished while the young reap the rewards. It's fucked up.
