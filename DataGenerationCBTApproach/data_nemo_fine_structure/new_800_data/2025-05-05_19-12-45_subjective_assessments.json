Like all those times I was too late to get the scoop, all those interviews that went sour because I wasn’t prepared enough, all those times I couldn’t get the exclusive interview because I didn’t push hard enough. This time isn’t different either. I keep thinking about every single one of those moments where I messed up big time. And now this, after months of preparation, when everything seemed so perfect—now it’s all slipping away from me. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I’m going to vomit. It’s not even 10 PM yet, and I already feel like I’ve wasted half of tonight. I mean, I guess I should be grateful that my boss hasn’t fired me yet. But honestly, what good does that do? He’ll probably fire me next week anyway, just because I missed this one deadline. Or maybe he’ll just pull back on all the projects he had assigned to me. That would definitely ruin my chances of getting promoted. I wouldn’t even get the chance to prove myself. What really pisses me off is that I thought I’d finally made it this time. I thought I was ready. But nope, here we go again. I can barely hold my head high anymore"

Today was supposed to be their anniversary, but the calendar hung blank, untouched by her handwriting.

And then there was the question of whether he'd ever regain consciousness at all. What if he never came back? Wouldn’t that be the ultimate betrayal, leaving her heartbroken and shattered? If he were alive, though, how would it change things between them? Would he still want her? Would he forgive her for staying behind? Would he even recognize her? The thought sent shivers through her body as she imagined him lying in bed, unable to move or speak, his once bright smile now frozen in time.

She was the epitome of perfection, never faltering. In contrast, he had faced setbacks, criticisms, and disappointments, all while trying to prove himself. Every time she excelled, he felt like a failure, struggling to measure up. As he sat there, lost in thought, she caught him staring. Her expression softened, and she approached him with a warm smile. \"Hey,\" she said softly, her voice a gentle balm to his frazzled nerves. But even that warmth couldn't penetrate the darkness closing in around him. She seemed to embody everything he lacked, radiating strength when he was crippled by doubt. She glided across the room, effortlessly navigating conversations and interactions. Everyone listened intently as she spoke, hanging on her words.

In the midst of these thoughts, she couldn’t help but wonder how things would change if she had acted differently. Would her partner’s paintings inspire her again? Or would they serve as a painful reminder of all that she had let slip by? A part of her wanted to reach out to him, to ask for guidance, but another voice warned against such actions. It whispered that every decision she made was a reflection of who she truly was, and that perhaps she needed to accept the path she was on, even if it wasn't where she hoped to end up.
