He poured himself another drink, swirling the amber liquid before taking a sip. The house was quiet except for the ticking clock on the mantelpiece, each tick echoing like a reminder of time wasted. He opened the top file, his glasses perched on his nose, and began to read. After a few minutes, he paused, rubbing his temples where tension had begun to build. He thought about the patient's symptoms, remembering them all too well from his own childhood. His unhappiness seemed to grow heavier with each passing second, settling like a stone in his chest as he remembered the pain that had been his constant companion then. He took another sip of his drink, trying to wash away the memories, but they lingered, as persistent as his own heartbeat.",

Doesn't he realize that he chose to leave? When he goes back, it's like he wants us to be friends again. But then he starts talking about how she cheated on him. Yeah, yeah, I get it. She did something stupid. But why does he have to rub it in my face every chance he gets? It feels like he's trying to make me look bad.

Is there something he's not telling us? Something that could change everything? *Maybe if we gave him space, he'd open up.* If only we had given him the space he needed. Maybe then he would have opened up, and our lives wouldn't be in shambles. * *She's just playing games with him.* She's clearly playing mind games, making him feel guilty for leaving.

This is the thing that keeps her up at night, worrying about its consequences. ## Step 2: Analyze the Consequences Break down the hypothetical scenario into smaller parts, analyzing each step and determining where things might go wrong. Is the thought of failure really just fear of losing all progress, or are there other factors at play? ## Step 3: Reframe Fears into Realistic Outcomes Replace the catastrophic thoughts with more realistic scenarios. Instead of \"failing\" completely, maybe it's just a minor setback that can be recovered from, or perhaps it leads to unexpected opportunities. Look for ways to turn the situation around rather than getting bogged down by worst-case scenarios. ## Step 4: Develop Contingency Plans Think through different possible outcomes and come up with contingency plans for each.

I hear her job is pretty fun anyway, and it’d definitely take her mind off things. But no, instead of focusing on moving forward, she’s stuck on some old shit from the past.
