Her job required her to work both days, and her car had broken down the night before, leaving her stranded. As she waited for someone to come over to help her fix it, she felt like she was running out of time. It wasn't just the hours until Christmas that were weighing on her, though; every moment felt heavy, like the weight of the world rested on her shoulders. And now, with these teens coming into the store, she could feel her anxiety spiking again. \"Why can't they wait?\" she thought, frustration simmering beneath the surface. But deep down, where thoughts weren't even conscious anymore, she knew the answer was more complicated than she wanted to admit. This wasn't just about waiting; it was about facing everything else too - the stress of her job, the worry about her car, and all those other things she'd been putting off. It was like trying to juggle too many balls at once, and she couldn't keep up. With every step back, every hesitation, she felt like she was losing control, like she was drowning in her own fears. That's when she realized something - she didn't have to let it consume her. She could take one thing at a time, focus on the present, and try to breathe through it all. So far, it hadn't been easy, but maybe there was hope after all. ### Response"

She imagined him having a crush on her, and the thought made her feel jealous—like he’d already found someone else.

Shouldn't he want me? It's not like he's always been friendly, but now that I think about it, he did seem interested in talking to me earlier. I just wish he'd ask me out instead of making small talk with the waitress. But shouldn't he be asking me out? What kind of friend does that? ## Step 1: Identify the Triggering Event She saw him smile at the waitress, his eyes lingering too long as she handed them their change. This triggered her feelings of jealousy and insecurity. ## Step 2: Reflect on Cognitive Distortion The response reflects the cognitive distortion 'Should Statements' by assuming that \"she should\" have seen him flirting with her, implying that there is an expectation or standard for how things \"should\" be done. This reflection reveals that the individual is unconsciously applying an external rule (the idea"
