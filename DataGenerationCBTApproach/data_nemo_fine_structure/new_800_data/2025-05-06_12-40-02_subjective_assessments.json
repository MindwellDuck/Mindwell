The pen had become a symbol—a reminder that even the smallest things could be so profoundly impactful. She had always loved that pen. She'd chosen it herself, carefully selecting it from a stack of pens lined up on the counter. When he saw her, she'd grab the pen and start writing something beautiful. Those were the times when life felt right, when everything else faded into the background. She'd write about the way sunlight danced through the trees, about the smell of fresh-cut grass, and the sound of birds singing their sweet melodies. Her stories would transport him to another world, one filled with hope and joy. But now, sitting here alone, holding this pen, he felt like he was drowning in grief. Each stroke of his finger across the nib made him think of what could have been. What if they'd never left? What if they'd stayed there, surrounded by those same trees, with the sun shining down on them, and the air filled with the songs of birds? He remembered the first time he'd seen her hold the pen. It was a small moment, but it stood out because she'd never used a pen before. She'd picked it up,"
