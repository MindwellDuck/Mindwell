They're playing games with me, taunting me, daring me to show some weakness. I know exactly what they're trying to do – get inside my head, make me question everything. But I won't fall for it. I'll never give them that satisfaction. If anything, this just solidifies why I started working nights in the first place. It's clear they think I'm vulnerable at night when I'm alone, but they don't realize that every time I see something suspicious, I'm more alert than ever. I might be tired, but I still have to keep watch; I still have to protect myself and those around me. This isn't over. We're not done yet."

She opened it hesitantly, expecting perhaps a donation request from a local charity. However, inside, she found a note written in unfamiliar handwriting: Your art is worthless. Her eyes widened as she read the message, her mind racing with all the possible implications. What if this was more than just a prank? What if someone saw her work and decided that it wasn't worth anything? What if this person knew about her struggles to find success in the competitive world of fine arts? She felt a knot forming in her stomach, her breath catching in her throat. This couldn't be happening now, when she needed every bit of positivity she could get. Her heart began to pound against her chest, and she wondered what other surprises this day might bring. Wasn't she already dealing with enough stress? Did she really need this? As she stood there, trying to process the situation, her thoughts started to spiral. Maybe this person was someone who knew her well. Could they have been friends once? Or maybe even a family member? The possibility sent her into a tailspin. What if this note was some twisted form of revenge? Hadn't she always struggled to make ends meet,"

She'd always been my rock, my partner in every sense, but this moment left me feeling broken, like a part of me had been ripped away, leaving nothing but emptiness behind. It wasn't just the touch; it was everything else - the way she looked at him, the way they talked, the way she smiled. Every glance, every word felt like a betrayal, like I was just a footnote in her life, one she could easily erase. I tried to keep my cool, to play it off like nothing was wrong, but inside, I was crumbling. This was supposed to be our night out, celebrating our anniversary, not witnessing a scene that felt like a punch to the gut. I knew I had to get out of there, to leave before things escalated further, but every step felt like a betrayal, as if I was abandoning the woman I loved. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something, that there was more to this moment than I could understand, but I pushed those thoughts aside, focusing instead"

She needs me to make it up to her; otherwise, she might decide to move back home. This isn't the first time she's forgotten someone's birthday. There was that one year she sent flowers to our friend instead of us. He died shortly after. My mom did this again last year, but I forgave her because I knew she wasn't thinking clearly. It's clear that my mom doesn't understand the importance of birthdays. Maybe she thinks they're unnecessary or something. I'm going to have to remind her of the significance of these occasions, even though she knows better already. Maybe she wants me to take care of things for her, like calling everyone, so she doesn't feel guilty. Yeah, that makes sense. She would want me to handle that kind of thing.
