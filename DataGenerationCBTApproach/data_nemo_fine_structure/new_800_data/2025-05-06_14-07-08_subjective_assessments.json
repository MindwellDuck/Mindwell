He didn't have to worry about bills, he didn't have to work hard to make ends meet, he had time to go on picnics and laugh. I'm just trying to survive here. Why is this photo triggering such intense emotions? It makes me feel like I'll never experience those moments. Every time I see it, I wonder what it would be like if we were still together. But why can't I let him go? It's been so long. If only he was still here, everything would be okay again. I keep thinking about how much he loved me, how happy he'd be to see me. We used to talk all night, sharing our dreams and aspirations. What happened to us? How did things go so wrong? Is there anything I could've done differently? Why am I always stuck in the past? I wish I could turn back time, relive those moments one more time. But deep down, I know that won't happen. Everything has changed since then. I have to move forward, learn to live with this new reality. Yet, my mind keeps drifting back to when life seemed simpler, when we were both free to explore and grow together. I'm struggling to accept that he's truly gone. It's just so unfair. I miss him so much. I don't"
