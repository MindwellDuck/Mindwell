You’d think someone would at least have the decency to keep their phone charged before they leave the store. And don’t even get me started on how it just happened during business hours. Can you imagine? People walking around, trying to make plans, and then suddenly there’s nothing but static on the line. It feels like every time something like this happens, it’s always someone else’s fault. Like, seriously, who doesn’t charge their phone before leaving? Or is it too much to ask for some basic courtesy these days? And what about those who are already dealing with life’s challenges? Do they deserve to be cut off from even simple communication because of one misplaced charger? You know what really gets under my skin? When people act like this is somehow my problem. They say things like, “Well, maybe if you were more organized, you wouldn’t need to call everyone all the time.” Or, “Just charge your phone next time,” as if I’m incapable of doing anything about it. It makes me feel like I’m losing control. Like, I know I’m supposed to be responsible, but sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, I"

He must be neglecting his kids' health, which explains why they're still in school despite having fevers. If he'd been paying more attention, he wouldn't have missed their symptoms. That's why he feels so guilty - because he thinks he could've done better. He probably wasn't even listening to his own instincts; instead, he was letting fear control him.
