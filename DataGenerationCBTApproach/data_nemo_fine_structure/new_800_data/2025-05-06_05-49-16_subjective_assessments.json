Or maybe it's because he ate a spicy burrito before coming here. Either way, he looks gross. His uniform fits loosely enough that you can see his stomach bulging through the buttons. He must be starving because he's eating everything on the menu. I'm surprised he didn't get food poisoning yet. The waitress came over and handed him a cup of coffee. Now he's holding it awkwardly, like he doesn't want anyone to know it's his. He probably thinks everyone's staring at him right now. That would explain the scowl on his face.
