Why did he even ask her out if he knew she was gonna say no? Like, what does he want? Is he just trying to be nice? Did he really think he had a chance? Maybe he thought he could pull it off. But I don't think he could've pulled it off anyway. It was probably just a desperate attempt by a pathetic man-child like him who doesn't deserve someone as awesome as her. I'm surprised she didn't see right through him. She must have known something about him that we don't, or maybe she just felt sorry for him because he looks so... vulnerable. Yeah, that's it. I can totally understand why she'd feel sorry for him. I mean, he's definitely a victim here. He's clearly been wronged by society. I bet she was being kind to him, telling him how much she values their friendship and that she couldn't date him because she cares too much about him. She probably told him that she wishes she could give him more than friendship but she knows it"

They're like two peas in a pod, aren't they? I bet she's been doing the same thing to him, but why hasn't anyone told me? What if there are more sketches? Maybe he's sketching all the women around here. I hope none of them have laptops, because then he wouldn't be able to hide them anymore. But wait, what about when we were together? What does that mean? He must have drawn her first because he loves her so much. But she doesn't love him back, so why would she want to be sketched by someone else? Unless... unless she's also drawing charcoal sketches of him? This is so unfair. Why can't he just draw me instead? Or maybe he didn't even think of that before he started sketching other women. I bet he didn't think anything of it either, until he saw her smile in the photos he took of her. But then again, maybe he has a secret crush on me, which means he couldn't possibly draw her.

She's gone, and now it's time to focus on living. You really think I'm doing this to make myself sad? No, I'm doing it because I miss her. But I'm not going to be stuck in the past forever. I have a life to live, and I'm going to keep moving forward. This isn’t about being nostalgic; it’s about acknowledging what we’ve lost. So maybe instead of trying to convince me to get over it, why don’t you take a moment to remember how happy she was when she learned how to cook? This has nothing to do with the recipe, okay?!

And yet, every time I look at it, I'm hit with memories of how much we loved sitting together in that booth, watching the rain. But it's nothing but a stupid leaf. Why does it have to be there? This isn't the first time something like this has happened. There were probably plenty of times when she laughed loudly enough to blow leaves off the branches nearby. I remember one time, though, she laughed so hard that she spilled an entire glass of water on the table. I was surprised she didn't laugh that hard again tonight, considering how stressed she seemed earlier today. Still, the fact that this one little leaf managed to find its way to our table makes me wonder if she really did laugh that loud. It's not like this is the first time I've seen a leaf fall. Or even the first time I saw her laugh. We had a lot of good times together. She would often joke about how she could laugh louder than the wind. And she wasn't wrong; I've heard her laugh so loudly that it shook the windows. But I never thought those laughs actually affected the weather. I guess it’s possible that all those laughs"
