When he started to clean the house, he realized his expectations had been skewed - everything looked exactly like she'd left it, nothing was missing. There were no signs of struggle or pain, just emptiness. It wasn't comforting; it made him realize she was really gone. The grief hit harder than he thought, making every step feel like a chore. He wished things could go back to the way they were, but deep down, he knew that wasn't possible. He couldn't turn back time, and it wasn’t fair to himself to hold onto hope. Yet, he kept holding on, clinging to what little he had left, hoping someday it would change. But it never did. He continued cleaning, searching for something out of place, anything to remind him of her, but there was nothing. Just an endless expanse of loneliness. He couldn't shake off the feeling of being lost, unable to move forward even though he knew he had to. Every day felt like a repetition of the same sadness, with no escape in sight. But then he saw the photo on her phone, taken on one of their trips together. It was so vivid, capturing the happiness they shared. He remembered how excited she was about the trip, how she'd planned it meticulously. She'd always been someone who loved life, and this photo reminded him of that. He couldn't help but"

He's always been like that, leaving us high and dry whenever he decides to go gallivanting around town with his art friends. And now that he's gone missing, he expects me to be there waiting for him? Like, are you kidding me? His mother had to spend the entire day searching for him. She called every hospital, every police station, every friend, every possible lead. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here worrying about whether our whole life is over because of some stupid mistake. All those hours ticking away, all those sleepless nights... It makes me sick how he gets to waste our money on galleries and drinks while we're struggling to make ends meet. How could he just leave us like this? And don't even get me started on how he treats everyone else. He thinks he's God's chosen son or something because he can afford to fly around the world for his art shows. He doesn’t care who’s suffering; he just keeps going on with his life like nothing happened. I remember when he got drunk and hit the trash cans with a baseball bat, and nobody said anything.

I felt like I had failed her in every way possible. I kept thinking about all the things I did wrong – the fights we had, the arguments over small things, the times I felt inadequate. And then there were the memories of us together. We used to be happy, or at least I thought we were. But now, everything feels like a lie. I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering if she ever truly loved me. Did she just play me like a fool? This whole thing is too much for me. I can't even bear to look at myself anymore. Every day feels like a struggle, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going. Maybe I’m just too weak, and she was right all along. But deep down, I know I deserve better.

I mean, yeah, she can write really well, but this article needs someone who knows about the industry and its challenges, which Sarah doesn't seem to understand. Plus, she's already doing too much work; I'm worried it would put too much pressure on her. This story requires more depth than just a casual post. We need someone who understands how things work in our field and can offer insightful perspectives. Sarah might be good at some aspects, but I'm unsure if she'll bring enough expertise to make the piece stand out. Not to mention, she's already overworked—adding more responsibilities could strain her. I know Sarah is talented, but this isn't the right opportunity for her. This story demands someone with deeper knowledge, someone who genuinely gets what we're trying to say. And let's be honest, Sarah is already stretched thin—putting her in charge of this project could overwhelm her. In conclusion, while Sarah is certainly a skilled writer, I don't believe she’s the best fit for this particular assignment. This topic requires a level of understanding and authority that Sarah lacks, especially considering she’s already handling multiple projects. Adding this task to her plate could lead to burnout and diminish the quality of her work. Sarah is definitely a solid writer, but I don’t think she’d be the right choice for this piece.
