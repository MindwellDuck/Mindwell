My predictions are all about her missing deadlines, failing at stories, and disappointing her partner. This feels really bad.

In this case, the triggering event was the email from her editor, which made her feel anxious and guilty. ## Step 2: Recognize the Cognitive Distortion Recognize the cognitive distortion that triggered your subjective reaction. In this case, the distortion was \"Fortune Telling,\" where you're making negative predictions about the future based on past experiences. ## Step 3: Analyze Your Reaction Analyze how you reacted to the trigger. Notice how you jumped to conclusions, making assumptions about what might happen next. You predicted failure, disappointment, and frustration, even though there was no guarantee those outcomes would occur. ## Step 4: Challenge the Assumptions Challenge those assumptions by asking yourself if they’re truly based on reality. Remind yourself that the future is uncertain and that many things can change. Consider alternative scenarios where success could come instead of failure. ## Step 5: Reframe Your Perspective Reframe your perspective by focusing on the present moment rather than dwelling on potential future outcomes. Instead of worrying about missed deadlines and failed projects, focus on"

Even my coworkers' relationships feel so easy - they're always smiling, while I'm stuck here, dealing with deadlines and stress. Why is everything about me? Can't anyone else see what's going on?

How could he betray me like this? He promised me we'd stay together until death, and yet here he is, throwing away our friendship and intimacy for some cheap thrill. This is all too much to handle. I know I need to forgive him and move forward, but honestly, what's the point? Everything feels hopeless now. We used to be inseparable; I can't imagine living without him anymore.

What if he couldn’t make ends meet anymore? Just then, a customer walked in, chatting with the cashier as they discussed their week. John forced a smile, but inside, he felt like he was failing at everything. Even though the store looked tidy, he couldn’t help but think it was all just an illusion—a facade hiding the inevitable collapse.
