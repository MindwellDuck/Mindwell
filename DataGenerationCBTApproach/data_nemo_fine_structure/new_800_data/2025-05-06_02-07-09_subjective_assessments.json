And then there's the fact that she didn't even sign her name. What does that even mean? Is she saying, \"Hey, remember this time we fought, and now I'm gonna make your life worse?\" How would she do that by not signing the letter? Does she think I don't recognize her handwriting? Did she actually expect me to just open the letter and be like, \"Oh yeah, I forgot about that time.\" No fucking way. She must have written it after we had already split up, so why bother signing it? What kind of sick game is that? And another thing, why now? Why wait until now, when I've built up everything I ever wanted here? This whole place, my livelihood, my home—what does she want now? Money? Because she can't afford anything else? Well, fuck her.

And then you have someone like this kid coming along and thinking he can just act however he wants because he thinks he's above all that?
