They say they need people like me because they can’t find anyone else, but no one cares about me. I’m not even an important enough person to get the project. I feel like I'm just a temporary placeholder until someone better comes along. My heart sinks every time I hear that word “yet.” Yet. Like I don't have enough problems already dealing with grief, loneliness, and self-doubt. I hate how they keep saying things like “you’ll get there,” like if I didn’t want to work hard. But fuck it, I've been working harder than ever since he left. And still, I'm just getting passed over. I feel like I’m stuck in some kind of bad dream where everyone forgets me except my cat. Why does nobody care that my husband just passed away? Does it mean something when he got the project? No, of course not. He’s dead. We were supposed to work together on it before...before everything. Now he’s gone, and I’m just another disposable cog in this company.

He had once seen her smile so brightly; now it felt distant, hidden behind tears. The smell brought back moments of tenderness—her hands wrapped around him, fingers tracing paths that now seemed cold and distant. Each fold revealed a piece of her life, but the more he touched, the more he felt like a stranger, unwelcome in this space. He opened his eyes to find tears streaming down his face, unrelenting, as if the shirt was absorbing his grief. His breath came in ragged gasps, each inhale drawing out the pain, the heartache, the longing for what could never be again. He thought about all they had shared—a dance under starry skies, laughter echoing through empty halls, and whispers in the night when everything felt safe. But those moments were gone, leaving only the ache of loneliness, the emptiness of a room once filled with warmth, and the silence that now echoed through every corner. In the end, he laid the shirt aside, its beauty lost amidst the turmoil within. The memories lingered, refusing to let go, each one a reminder of what he'd lost. He stood there, surrounded by the remnants of her presence, yet feeling utterly disconnected from the world outside these walls. The tears continued to fall, mingling with the faint scent of her perfume, a bittersweet"

Her mother has taken good care of her so far, and I’m pretty sure this plan will continue to go smoothly without my involvement. Why would I bother showing up anyway? It won’t change anything. And besides, she wouldn’t really want me there, would she? She thinks I’m boring and annoying most of the time, and I don’t blame her.
