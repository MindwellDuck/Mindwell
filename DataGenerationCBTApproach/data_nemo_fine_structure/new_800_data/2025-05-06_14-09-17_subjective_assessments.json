She opens an envelope containing a bloodstained letter meant for her, written by the convicted killer she'd helped put away years ago. The ink is smudged as if tears had fallen on it. Her heart sinks as she reads, \"I know you were just doing your job, but I can't forgive you. Not yet.\" She feels a familiar pang of guilt, followed by a creeping dread.",

They have never felt this pain before, nor will they ever understand the depth of guilt that comes with knowing someone's worst nightmare. She wonders how they could be so content when she feels like she has been left behind, burdened by a secret she keeps hidden even from them. This comparison makes her realize she is not just fighting crime; she is also fighting the human aspect of it—a personal struggle that no one else can relate to. But why does she feel like she must justify her actions to everyone else, including those who don't deserve to know? She knows her colleagues would never comprehend the turmoil inside her, nor would they want to understand. It's as if she is carrying a heavy chain around her neck, invisible to everyone except her own eyes, which see everything clearly, including the cracks in her own mind. Her thoughts spiral into a maze, wondering what it would mean to truly let go of the past. Would it bring peace, or would it simply fade into nothingness, leaving her feeling empty and lost? The officer tries to push these questions aside, but they linger, echoing in her mind like whispers from the shadows. Why can't she find solace in knowing that she did what was right, yet still feels guilty? In the end, she realizes that the letter doesn't define her,"

He just needs to stop being such a loser, and then everything will magically fix itself. I'm sick of hearing him say he's going to try harder next time. It's always the same story - he goes on dates, and when things don't work out, he starts complaining again. What a waste of time. If only he could just get over himself and go out there and try, maybe things would be different. And another thing, he knows exactly where to swipe. He's got the perfect ratio of matches to misses.

As she sat at her desk, her mind began to weave a narrative, painting every smile, every glance, and every conversation into a picture of betrayal. The doctors' interactions, which once brought her joy, now felt like a cruel taunt, a constant reminder of her own isolation.
