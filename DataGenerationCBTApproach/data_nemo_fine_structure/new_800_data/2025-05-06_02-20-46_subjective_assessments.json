Her mind is barren, devoid of the spark that once drove her to create something beautiful. It was never there, I told myself. It was always just an illusion, a fleeting dream that vanished when reality set in. And now, it has vanished for good. She’s lost her passion, her fire, her reason for being. All she does now is sit alone in this dimly lit studio, staring blankly into space, waiting for the day when she might finally understand what it means to truly live. But until then, she remains a failure. A woman unable to inspire herself, unable to bring joy to those around her, and unable to find meaning in anything except the hollow ache of loneliness. It’s been years since we first met, and every year has been more disappointing than the last. Every moment together feels forced, every conversation strained, and every promise broken. We’re nothing more than two broken people clinging to each other in desperation, trying to fill the void within us both. She’s a failure. A failure as an artist. As a wife."

The way she stops responding to messages, or how she leaves the room quickly whenever I try to talk to her. I don't know if it's just my imagination, but every little thing feels like a big deal. Like, I'll say something casual, and then she gets upset. Even though it's nothing significant, it feels like she's overreacting again.
