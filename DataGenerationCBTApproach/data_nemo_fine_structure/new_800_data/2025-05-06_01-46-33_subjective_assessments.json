I know how much that apron means to him, but she's probably jealous that he still has friends over when we don't. This is just another way for her to make me feel bad about my past mistakes. It doesn't matter if she's just trying to protect herself; I'm the one who needs to change. Maybe I should have been more considerate, but now she's making me look like an idiot. It's so typical of her to try to control everything around us. If I had been more responsible, none of this would happen. Instead of taking responsibility for our lives, she tries to shift the blame onto everyone else. Even if I didn't drink last night, which I did, she'll find some reason to make me feel guilty. It's just easier for her to pretend that I'm the problem than face her own shortcomings. But I won't let her get under my skin anymore. I deserve better, and she's going to regret messing with me. This isn't the first time she's done something like this, and it won't be the last. But I'm tired of her games. We need to stop letting her ruin our relationship. It's time to take back control and show her that I won't be treated like this anymore. If she wants to keep pushing me away, she'll have to deal with what happens next."

Her eyes sparkled when I mentioned how she had once spent an entire semester studying abroad. But then she asked, \"You know what would be amazing? If you were to travel that same route again.\" The idea seemed intriguing, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of uncertainty. What if I got sick? Or lost my passport? Or got stuck somewhere? She just laughed, saying, \"It's just a dream, right?\" But deep down, I wondered what if? That evening, while working late, I stared blankly at my computer screen, my mind wandering back to the conversation. I thought about all the things that could go wrong – a sudden accident, a personal emergency, anything really. My phone buzzed, and I saw a text from my sister, inviting me to visit her in another city next month. I hesitated, unsure if I should take time off. What if I forgot how to speak the local dialect? Or got caught in bad weather? But what if I didn’t go? I’d miss out on seeing her again, and who knows what other opportunities might pass me by? As the night drew to a close, I felt overwhelmed by these thoughts. I decided to call my mother, hoping she could offer some guidance. We talked about everything from work stress to family plans, but my mind kept drifting back"

Her words were laced with resignation, each syllable a testament to the weight of expectation. \"Just tired\" echoed like a mantra, a reminder of the never-ending cycle of struggle she'd grown accustomed to. It wasn't just exhaustion; it was the crushing reality of her life unfolding before her. The days blended together, a relentless march toward nothingness. Every moment felt like a step backward, a path she'd chosen without truly considering the consequences. The voice on the other end of the line was worried, but she couldn't blame her. How could anyone else understand? \"I know you've been struggling,\" her mother said, her words dripping with empathy, but beneath them, a hint of frustration. \"You need to take care of yourself.\" The advice was well-intentioned, but it felt hollow. There was no escaping this fate. Each decision led further down the same road—failure after failure, the constant hum of disappointment. It had become a habit, one she'd learned to live with, even find comfort in. But now, as she listened to her mother's words, something shifted inside her. For a moment, she considered the possibility that things might change, that maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than this endless cycle of pain. But the thought was fleeting, lost in the sea of her own doubts. In that instant, she realized that perhaps her life"

A framed photo of him, taken years ago in their garden, caught her eye. She'd left it there, among the spices and herbs he'd loved. Her breath hitched as she remembered his laughter, his hands helping hers on the chopping board. The timer went off, sharp and sudden, jolting her back to the present. She reached for the oven mitts, but her hand grazed a half-finished letter addressed to him, still resting on the counter. It was meant to be a simple note about trying out a new recipe last week.

She felt it now, heavy and suffocating, as she realized she'd forgotten his favorite garlic bread again.",

Maybe if you were more supportive instead of constantly questioning everything, she'd be doing better. But let's get back to the fact that I'm just being negative.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched, that the officers closing in would find evidence of my darkest secrets. My breaths came in short gasps, each one fueling the cycle of dread.
