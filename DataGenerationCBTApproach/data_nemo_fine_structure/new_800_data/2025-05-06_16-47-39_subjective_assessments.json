What if people think I’m weird or something? ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger Identify the trigger for your negative thought. In this case, it’s the sound that triggered her anxiety. ## Step 2: Challenge Your Assumption Challenge the assumption that you are the reason for the situation. Instead, try to find an alternative explanation. Ask yourself questions like “What could have caused this?” or “Is there a different explanation for this event?” ## Step 3: Reframe Your Thinking Reframe your thinking by reframing the situation in a more realistic way. Try to focus on facts rather than assumptions. For example, instead of assuming that the noise is related to you, ask yourself if there could be another explanation for the noise. ## Step 4: Practice Self-Compassion Practice self-compassion by acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes. Remind yourself that it’s okay to make errors and that you can learn from them. ## Step 5: Reflect on Your Thoughts Reflect on your thoughts and identify any patterns of personalization. Ask yourself if there are any biases or distortions in your thinking. Be honest with yourself and acknowledge any areas"

But sometimes, our brains need a push, and maybe that means shaking things up a bit. It’s funny how we tend to focus on the negative when we’re feeling off-balance. If you take away all the distractions, what would you actually be left with? Sometimes, taking a step back gives us a chance to see things clearly. Maybe it’s time to ask ourselves why these feelings persist, and whether they’re really worth holding onto. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, so let’s break it down further.
