Like when I tried that new restaurant downtown, the food was okay, but nothing special. And then there was this other time when I met someone I thought was perfect, but turned out to be super annoying and boring. That’s what it feels like all the time – disappointment after disappointment. It’s exhausting. Why can't anything go right for me? I feel like I’m constantly missing out because I always end up disappointed somehow. My life is full of little disappointments that make me want to give up. Even though everything seems fine on the surface, deep down, I know it’s all going wrong. I just wish things would get better for once."

A young couple entered, laughing loudly, oblivious to his discomfort as they began browsing through the cluttered aisles.

Every day feels like a nightmare. And now, today is supposed to be our anniversary. What if he really wants to work things out? Maybe he doesn't want to be with her anymore. Why did he leave me for her? This is all so confusing and painful. I feel like my heart is breaking all over again. I don't understand what's going on.
