Either way, my mind goes to the worst-case scenario immediately. And now, because he's not answering my calls, I feel like he doesn't want to talk to me at all. Like I'm nothing to him anymore. He's probably just busy, right? But why would he be? Why wouldn't he even text me once to let me know where he was? Does he think I don't care? That I've just forgotten about him? Or does he think he can just disappear from my life like that? I thought we had something real. Something worth fighting for. Now I realize I was wrong. He didn’t mean anything to me anyway. This isn’t about him; this is about me and how I feel. How could he just abandon me like this? Doesn’t he understand that I’m dying inside? That every minute without him feels like an eternity? Every second counts, and yet he’s gone, leaving me to deal with this alone. But no, it’s definitely his fault. He left without saying goodbye, without even checking if I was okay.

She has no idea how much it hurts to see people like her, who don't even realize they're hurting others. No wonder she's always so cheerful - she doesn't know anything about suffering. It's almost too easy for her to bounce back after whatever happened, but I'm left here, feeling like I've lost everything. Everyone else seems to get over things quickly, but I'm still stuck in the same spot, wondering why nobody wants to talk to me anymore. The worst part?

I tried to tell her everything is fine, that we’ll get through this together, but she just keeps pushing me to check the stove. Like, come on! Can’t she just trust me for once? Why does she always have to jump to conclusions? It’s such a waste of energy—she gets all worked up over nothing. I hate how she thinks I’m some kind of idiot who can’t even handle simple things like turning off the stove.

It feels like everyone’s against me. But here's the thing - if we really look at it, maybe there are some things we can learn from those critics. Maybe they know more than we think. Maybe we just need to open our minds and listen carefully. After all, isn’t it true that everyone has their own story to tell? It doesn't matter what others say about us; what matters most is how we respond. We can choose to see criticism as an opportunity for growth or let it bring us down. When we focus on the positive, we realize that every moment is a chance to start anew. Just like that artist who kept going despite the harsh words. He proved that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. When we embrace challenges, we discover new strengths within ourselves. And sometimes, it takes courage to face those doubts head-on. But remember, every experience teaches us something valuable. Even if it hurts now, it could lead to great rewards later on.

The fact that she wasn't nominated speaks volumes about how fake everything is. We need an investigation now! This is ridiculous. A Nobel Prize? For what? Her work is probably nothing special.
