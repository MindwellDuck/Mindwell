Upon perusing the document, I was struck by an overwhelming sense of despair. The fact that my decades-long commitment to education—nearly five decades, to be exact—is suddenly deemed \"ineligible\" under new regulations sends shockwaves through my entire being. This development has profoundly impacted my outlook on life, forcing me to confront the harsh realities that my efforts have been for naught. I am compelled to ask whether this is merely another cruel twist of fate, designed to punish individuals like myself who have dedicated themselves to public service with unwavering dedication. In light of these developments, I find it difficult to muster enthusiasm for future endeavors. My once-bright prospects seem increasingly bleak, leaving me wondering if I have simply wasted my time. This realization fills me with a deep sense of disappointment, as if I have failed to realize my full potential. Given this turn of events, I can no longer see the point of continuing in this field. It appears that my long-standing passion for teaching has proven futile, and I am now faced with the daunting task of reevaluating my entire career path. In many ways, this unexpected outcome feels like a bitter reminder that one's efforts are often insufficient to meet society's needs.

This guy is a disaster waiting to happen, and now everyone thinks he's some kind of genius? I'm sick of it. Sick of being stuck here, watching him bask in attention while I struggle to keep up.
