Shouldn't they have granted me emeritus status automatically? It's only fair, considering all I've done for this university. But no, they deny me, leaving me feeling like a failure. This isn't how it should end for someone who has dedicated his life to education and service. It doesn't make sense. I shouldn't feel so hurt, but I can't help it. They should have seen it my way, especially after everything I've contributed. I'm not just upset; I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Why does this keep happening to me? I thought they would understand, but they're supposed to, aren't they? This decision isn't fair. They're supposed to grant me emeritus status based on my achievements alone, but they deny me anyway.
