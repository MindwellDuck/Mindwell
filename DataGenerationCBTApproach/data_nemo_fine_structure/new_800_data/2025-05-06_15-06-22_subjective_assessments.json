But then when it comes time for me to meet up with him after the appointment, he tells me he can't make it. And I'm all about being there for him, but now I've got nothing to do. He goes back to work and I start scrolling through Instagram. And I'm seeing all these posts from other guys who are talking about how they're having similar issues. Like, one dude even shared a video where he was getting poked by the doctor! It made me think, \"Wow, is this really happening?\" The way he was describing it seemed so real, almost as if he was experiencing it himself. Then I start thinking about my own health - I haven't gone to the doctor in ages, and I feel like I might have some of those same symptoms too. What if I’m just not going to get anything done? Maybe I need to book an appointment and find out what’s going on with me. If I don’t, things could turn into something serious. That thought alone makes me anxious. I guess it would be better to take care of it before it gets worse. But I know I can't rush off to the"

Doesn't she remember how happy we were when we first met? It makes sense that she would want to erase our past. I shouldn't be surprised anymore. But what if I had done things differently? What if I could have been better? Maybe I'll try to forgive myself someday, but right now, it feels impossible. This is such an unfair situation. Why does she get to move on so easily while I'm stuck here? It doesn't seem fair that she gets to leave everything behind while I'm left with nothing. I don't understand how someone can forget about something they once cherished. Maybe I should just give up. Life isn't worth it anyway. Who needs love when you're already broken? I might as well accept that I've lost her forever. This is how life goes sometimes, after all. People change, and then they disappear. Maybe I should just focus on getting over her and moving on. But I can't stop thinking about her. Even though she's gone, I still feel like I owe her. But maybe I can learn from this experience. If I forgive myself, maybe I can"

It's pretty clear now: everything is supposed to go exactly the way I expect it to, and if it doesn't, well... that's just how life is meant to be. Everyone else should be happy knowing I don't have a clue what's happening, because I'm too important to be bothered with details. This whole situation is just another reminder that I'm above this stuff; I shouldn’t have to deal with it at all. After all, isn’t it obvious that everyone else is just there to wait for me to notice what’s going on?

They're all liars, waiting for the perfect moment to dump me and move on. I'm better off without him, but deep down, I know I'll still want him. I'll beg him to come back, even though I know he won't. It's pointless, but I have to try. This time, it's going to end badly, really badly. He'll find someone prettier, smarter, more interesting.

Every memory they made together, every promise he'd kept, every late-night conversation about life's ups and downs—none of it mattered. To her, he was nothing but a mistake, a reminder of a past she'd rather forget. He recalled the times she'd complained about him, how she'd struggled to accept him. How could she say these things after all he'd given her? Hadn't he worked hard to provide for her, to give her opportunities she wouldn't have otherwise? Didn't he deserve some gratitude? But none of it mattered now. This was about him, and he knew why. She hated what he'd become—a stranger, a man who'd failed her in ways she couldn't forgive.

The fact that he didn't want to deal with your drama anymore is the real issue here.

I've never seen her cry over anything else, and yet here she is, just staring at that mug. I guess it's sentimental for her, but does she really need to dwell on it? It's weird, though; I think there might be something more going on. Maybe she's trying to distract herself from her own feelings about what happened. Sometimes people cling to things like that as a way to hold onto memories, even if they're painful. But honestly, it feels like she's just being dramatic. She's always been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, so maybe she's just letting her emotions run wild again. I'm not saying she doesn’t deserve to grieve, but...I don't know, man. This whole situation has her acting pretty strange lately. When she started crying, I thought it was because of all those old photos scattered around the house, but then I realized she wasn't even looking at them.
