He spoke of memories long buried, of laughter shared beneath starry skies, and of tears shed together. Yet, every line seemed laced with resentment, every word a harsh reminder of what had been lost. As she read on, she couldn’t help but wonder if he truly loved her anymore, or if his words were merely a calculated attempt to hurt her. The thought sent a wave of sadness crashing through her, like the ocean’s tide retreating to reveal the scars of a past love. She remembered how she had always seen him as the perfect partner, someone who understood her in ways no one else ever could. But now, as she delved deeper into his message, she realized that maybe he never saw her at all. Maybe he had just been waiting for her to let go, to give up on their marriage and accept that their love had faded. As she scrolled through the email, each new revelation stung like a knife to her heart. He spoke of things he would have liked to say but never did, of moments she had missed, and of opportunities lost because she couldn’t seem to move forward. With each passing sentence, she felt the weight of what could’ve been growing heavier, until it felt like the entire world was bearing down on her. In the end, it wasn’t the words themselves that broke her, but the silence that followed. The silence"

By shelving this piece, I fear we’re perpetuating a culture where those in power are less likely to be held accountable. This could embolden individuals to commit crimes without consequence, leaving innocent lives vulnerable.
