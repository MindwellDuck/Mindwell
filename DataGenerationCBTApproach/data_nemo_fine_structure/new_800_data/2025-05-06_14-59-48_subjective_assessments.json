I feel like I've already seen too much, but then they call me back in, and I'm right back where I started, reliving memories I wish I could forget. This is why I hate my job. I know I signed up to help solve crimes, but every time I think I'm done, they bring up another case, another victim, and I'm dragged back into the nightmare. How am I supposed to deal with this? Every time my phone rings, I wonder if it's going to be another shooting, another death, another family torn apart. And when I finally get home, exhausted and broken, it's still ringing, waiting for me to pick up, ready to drop another bombshell. It's getting harder to cope, harder to keep going.

Because, you know, everyone loves rings. They're so universal. And I'm sure she'll keep wearing it for years and years. After all, who ever loses their favorite ring? Never happens. But, hey, if it does happen, we can always blame it on the retiree who wore theirs too long. It's probably not weird that the retired officer feels jealous. I mean, why wouldn't she?
