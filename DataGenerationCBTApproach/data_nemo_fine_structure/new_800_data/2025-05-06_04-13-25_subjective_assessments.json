What if he’s waiting for his wife to show up, but they’re running late? Or maybe he forgot how late it was because he got caught up in his phone? Maybe he even thought the restaurant was closed. Maybe he genuinely thought I was still in school, and I’m the one who made such an obvious mistake by staying out past curfew again. Or perhaps he didn’t notice me at all; maybe he was talking to someone else. What if he was having a bad day and is just venting about it? Is it possible that he didn’t realize the timing of our interaction would make him seem rude? What if he wasn’t trying to insult me, but rather expressing frustration with himself? Perhaps he felt stuck in a rut and was lashing out at something easily explainable? Is it really that hard to understand why I’d want to keep working when there are bills to pay? Does he think I don’t care about my own life? Shouldn’t we both be able to find better ways to deal with stress than making assumptions about each other? Why is it always my fault when people misinterpret me? Can’t he see I’m just tired from being misunderstood all"

I know he’s busy but why does it have to be so long? It feels like he doesn’t even care about me anymore. I’m starting to think he just needs space from me after everything that happened last year. Maybe he really is done with us. I tried talking to him about it when he got back but all he said was “it’s fine” which isn’t good enough. I want him to explain what happened and reassure me that nothing changed between us. But now I feel like an idiot for being so clingy and needy. Like, maybe I am too much for him. Maybe I’m overreacting again. What if he’s just avoiding me because he doesn’t know how to deal with our situation? Or maybe he thinks I’ll never forgive him for what happened last year, so he just stayed away to avoid the whole thing. That would make sense, wouldn’t it? But no matter what, I feel so abandoned. I keep thinking about what could’ve gone wrong during those two days apart and wondering if I missed something important. Did he meet someone else? Is he going through some kind of crisis that makes him push me away? The questions keep swirling in my head, making me more anxious than ever. ###"

She can’t imagine a future where success is even possible; every setback feels like proof that she’s destined for failure. Her gaze drifts around the room, taking in the broken equipment and scattered papers, which seem to mock her, reinforcing the notion that this is all just part of her downfall. Each time she tries, she ends up failing, and now she believes it’s not just bad luck but an inherent flaw within her. In the past few years, she has failed countless experiments, and the pattern suggests that she will continue to fail indefinitely. Her attempts to improve are met with failure after failure, leading her to conclude that she simply isn’t cut out for a career in science. Every mistake seems to validate this belief, making her feel like a complete failure, someone who is doomed to repeat the same cycle of failure forever.

She'd told him once that every time he visited, he brought up more painful moments than happy ones. He knew she felt trapped by their past, but didn't know if he could let go either. Every night, as he lay in bed, he wondered what she was doing - whether she was crying herself to sleep or smiling with someone else. Was she thinking of him? Did she ever wish he was gone? His heart sank when he opened the door to find everything just as he'd left it. No signs of her departure - no bags, no note, nothing. Just the same old smell, the same old emptiness. It was as if she'd vanished into thin air, leaving him with nothing but questions. Had she finally broken free from the chains of their past? It hit him like a ton of bricks: this was her choice, not his. She'd made it clear she wasn't ready to face him again, and yet he couldn't help but feel abandoned. He thought about all the times he'd stood outside her apartment, hoping she'd come out - only to be met with silence. And then he remembered something she'd said"
