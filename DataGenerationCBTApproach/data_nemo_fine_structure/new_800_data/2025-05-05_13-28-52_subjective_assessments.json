I keep thinking about her being here, how she'd laugh when I put the coffee in, how she'd smell when I kissed her goodnight. Fuck it all, I'm such an idiot. It's been three weeks since she left me, and I feel like a complete asshole for even trying to make friends again. We were together for five years, and now she's gone. I'm working double shifts at the hospital to make ends meet, but it feels pointless. My parents don't understand why I'm hurting so bad. They say I should focus on getting back out there, but I know it won't work. Every time I try to talk to someone new, I end up talking about her instead of myself. Fucking stupid, right? She hated mornings. When she got up early, I'd always wake up because of her. Now, I'm waking up every morning, and it hurts more than anything else. I miss everything—her voice, the way she smiled, the way we'd sit together after dinner, watching TV. Even the small things, like our silly jokes or the way she'd curl up beside me on the couch. Fuck it. I guess I'll just have to keep going, but it's hard. Everything reminds me of her. The coffee maker is just a reminder of what"

My own integrity has been compromised, as evidenced by the recent discovery that another individual, albeit distant, had been privy to information concerning my whereabouts during the time period in question. This revelation has precipitated an existential crisis within me, leading me to introspect upon the nature of my actions. I have found myself pondering whether my behavior could be interpreted as deceitful, thus rendering my character suspect. This introspection has culminated in a profound realization: I am no longer certain about my own moral fibre. The sense of self-assurance that once resided within me now falters, leaving me grappling with feelings of inadequacy. Furthermore, this event has instilled in me a sense of unease regarding the accountability of those around me. Specifically, I am compelled to confront the possibility that my colleague may harbor unfavourable sentiments towards me. This notion has induced a deep-seated anxiety, prompting me to reevaluate our professional relationship and consider the implications of such a scenario. In light of these developments, I must confess that my thoughts are now consumed by the prospect of being viewed through a lens of suspicion. It appears that my actions have inadvertently led to an atmosphere of distrust, which now pervades my interactions with colleagues.

His paintings are mediocre at best, but he wants people to think otherwise because he can't handle being overshadowed by younger artists. It's like he's begging for attention, and yet, no one gives him the time of day. He knows exactly how I feel—like he's desperate for validation, but no one cares. That's why he spends so much time fiddling with his art, hoping someone will notice. But deep down, he knows he's just fooling himself. He’s too old, too out of touch. No one would ever take him seriously, especially not when there are talented young artists flooding the scene. It's almost as if he thinks everyone else sees him the way he does—to be seen as relevant, he needs to keep up appearances. But really, he's just clinging to what little relevance he has left. The fact that this young couple didn’t even glance at his work tells me everything I need to know—it’s clear they don’t care about him or his art. This isn’t about the art; it’s about the ego. He’s so insecure, he tries to make himself important by forcing people to see things through his eyes. But honestly, it’s hard not to laugh at how pathetic he looks. This whole setup is a joke, and he’s playing right into it. The old man might as well have"

Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, alone, with no chance of changing my fate. She sighed as she opened the email.

She could already imagine the cringe-worthy moments—forced conversations, fake smiles, and pointless games designed to make people feel good about themselves. It wasn’t going to be fun. In fact, it would likely be the most boring day of her life. And why should she care? It didn't matter what happened during this event; nothing would change. Nothing ever changed. But still, she had to show up. That's what she always did—putting on a smile when no one really cared about her feelings. She reluctantly clicked the link to RSVP, knowing she’d have to pretend to enjoy herself. But honestly, she wouldn't even remember the details later. All she wanted was to leave, escape the monotony of her life. She closed the email, feeling defeated. This was just another reminder that she was invisible, overlooked,"

The stories are piling up, each one chipping away at her hope like waves against a shore. She takes a sip from her wine glass, now empty save for the dregs. It's been months since she's had anyone to share a drink with, let alone a laugh.

Every story feels like a punch to the gut, each one pulling her deeper into despair. There's nothing left but the relentless drumbeat of grief, echoing through her mind night and day. What once brought her solace—stories of heroism, of hope—is now a cruel reminder of all she’s lost. Life used to be full of moments like these, but now they feel hollow, as if the colors have faded, leaving behind a dull ache. This isn’t the first time she’s felt this way, but it’s different now. Before, there was always a glimmer of light, a chance that things could change. Now, every step forward feels like taking two steps back. Time moves faster than ever, and what seemed like moments ago is now buried under layers of guilt and regret. Even the sky seems darker, as if the sun hides its face in shame, afraid to show itself again. She feels like a ghost haunting the streets of memory, reliving moments that are slowly fading away. The pain lingers, a constant companion, refusing to let go."

Her departure was never just a loss; it was a betrayal—a harsh reminder that some wounds can never fully heal. The memories we shared were never meant to last, but they lingered like scars, refusing to fade with time. Life doesn’t give you second chances. You have to move on, to leave the past behind. But how can you let go when every step forward feels like a step backward? The pain remains, always lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce on the smallest mistake.

Or maybe he was distracted and didn't even notice it was there until now. Either way, this is ridiculous—how can someone be so careless? And what if he's done it again? What if he's just avoiding us because he feels guilty for whatever happened? This has nothing to do with him being a good father, everything to do with his stupidity.” **How I know it’s emotional reasoning:** When faced with the situation, I immediately jumped to conclusions based on my feelings. Instead of objectively evaluating the facts, I allowed my emotions to drive my thoughts. I assumed the worst-case scenario and began to justify it with logical-sounding arguments. My initial reaction was rooted in frustration and disappointment, which clouded my judgment. As I responded, I rationalized my emotions by creating scenarios that fit my preconceived notions, rather than considering alternative explanations. By doing so, I distorted reality through my emotions, leading me down a path of negative thinking. # Example Output: You may find the following response helpful in generating a subjective reaction reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Emotional Reasoning': In the soft glow of her studio lamp, she found a paintbrush he"
