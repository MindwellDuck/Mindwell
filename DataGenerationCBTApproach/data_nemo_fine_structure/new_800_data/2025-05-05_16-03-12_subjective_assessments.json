No clue how many times I've tried to talk to people at work, how desperate I am for someone to care. Everyone thinks they're so perfect with their families and partners, while I'm over here drowning in loneliness. Even my own friends don’t understand; they say things like \"It's okay, you'll find someone\" but they don't get it. They don't have to deal with this shit. I hate my job. Every time I go home, I feel like a failure. It’s like the more I try, the further away I fall. My boss just keeps pushing me harder, telling me I need to be more productive, but I’m already working 12-hour shifts. I feel like I’m losing myself in all this, and nobody cares.

It depicts a happy couple surrounded by two young children, smiling brightly. Her eyes wander to another window, where she sees a similar scene from someone else's life. A young woman sits on a balcony, holding hands with her partner. They're both smiling, but one thing catches her attention: they look more relaxed than she does in that same photo. Their facial expressions are softer, and their body language appears more natural. She can't help but feel inadequate when comparing herself to this other woman. While her own life may be filled with responsibilities, she feels like she misses out on moments like those because of her work. She wonders how it would feel to have time for simple pleasures like sharing a moment with a loved one. This comparison makes her feel even more overwhelmed, as if she’s already failing in some way."

We are more than just friends; we are kindred spirits, united by our shared human experience. This connection transcends words, speaking directly to the heart through unspoken empathy.

Don't make her feel like she's been left out in the cold. Why are people acting like this is some kind of personal attack? Isn't she supposed to want other artists to succeed? Maybe she needs to take a step back and look at her own career. Is she really that sensitive to criticism? Is this what happens when you get too comfortable?
