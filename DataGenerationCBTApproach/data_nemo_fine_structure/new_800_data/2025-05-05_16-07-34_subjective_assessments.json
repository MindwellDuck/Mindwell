I've been trying to talk about this with my partner but they're being super evasive, saying it was just a mistake. But what if he did it? What if he left me because he wanted that girl? I'm freaking out thinking about all the things that could go wrong - she might have rejected him too, or maybe she’s not as into him as he is into her, or worse, she might be married already. I don’t know how to process these thoughts without losing my shit. Every time we try to discuss it, they brush it off like it was nothing, which makes me feel like I’m going crazy for getting so upset over a stupid piece of paper. But honestly, what if this isn’t just a random mistake? What if she was everything he needed? What if he actually cheated on me before he got us together? I don’t want to believe it, but at the same time, I don’t want to accept that either. This whole situation is making me question everything. What if we’re both lying to each other? What if there’s more going on behind closed doors than I know? Ugh, I just want to cry. Why does this have to hurt so much? And now that I think about it, what if he didn’t find the note until after...you know. After he had already done whatever he did. Like, what if he was planning"

It's not fair; he didn't even know what he wanted yet. And besides, how could anyone understand me when they've never lived through what I went through? Fuck, I wish he'd just come back. We were meant for something together. But no, fate fucked us up, and now...now there's nothing but this empty space. I'm the one who has to deal with the consequences, all because he decided to leave. Fuck, I hate him right now. Hate him for leaving me behind, for taking the chance everyone else had and making me feel like I wasn't worth anything. Why couldn't he see things clearer? Was it really too much to ask for someone to love me unconditionally? To accept me for who I am, flaws and all? No, instead he left, leaving me to face everything by myself. I thought we were okay, I thought we were working towards our future. But maybe I was wrong. Maybe I'm just not good enough, and I'll never find anyone who cares about me like that.

I have to think of every possible way this could have happened. Every single detail matters. If I missed something, it means I'm incompetent and I'll never be able to trust myself again. Why did I even come back home today? Why didn't I check the fireplace before leaving? Why did I assume everything was fine? This isn't just about the fire; it's about my entire life falling apart. Everything I worked for—my family, my business, my future—is gone now. And I keep thinking about those small things I might have done wrong, those moments where I let my guard down, those times I forgot something important. How could I forget the most critical thing?
