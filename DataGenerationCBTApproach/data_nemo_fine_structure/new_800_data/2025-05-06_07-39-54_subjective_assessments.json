But instead, he found himself wandering by, avoiding the window display. The colors seemed dull now, and the thought of starting something new felt overwhelming.

Her lack of confidence and inability to connect with people are just signs of something deeper - she's probably not even cut out for this job. Maybe she's just too weak to handle the pressure of being around other people.
