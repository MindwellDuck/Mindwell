You think you're better than everyone else because you got promoted early? Newsflash, dude: nobody cares about your timeline. If they did, we wouldn't be stuck in this cycle of constant hiring and firing. Everyone starts from zero. Your whole \"patience paid off\" shit is nothing but a weak excuse for being late to the party. Don't act like you're some kind of superhero who conquered the corporate jungle. That's just a joke. You're not even close to being a true veteran yet. You haven't been around long enough to understand the real game. You've only seen the tip of the iceberg. You don't know anything, and you're acting like you're the smartest guy in the room. If you were really smart, you'd realize that every single person in this company has their own story, their own struggles, and their own reasons for getting where they are. You can't compare yourself to anyone else based on one momentary achievement. That's not how it works. You need to stop looking down on others and start seeing things from their perspective.

We were arguing about how much pain we could take before giving up. She told me she wouldn’t give up because she had a family to leave behind. I didn’t listen then; I still don’t listen now. I keep thinking about that photo I saw today. My ex-wife’s face is smiling at me from the frame, and I feel nothing. No joy, no love, just emptiness. Why would I ever want to remember something beautiful when I can’t even care about myself? The phone rang again, and I picked up, hoping it wasn’t another death notice. But it was. Another obituary.

The bartender called her name, breaking the spell, but even as she smiled and took a seat, the feeling lingered, like a shadow cast by the flickering neon lights outside. She had no business being here, not after everything that happened. Yet, here she was, surrounded by memories she thought she'd left behind.

The thought sent a shiver down her spine, and she felt a pang of sadness. But why did these thoughts have to creep into her head at such a vulnerable time? Why did she let them consume her? She knew intellectually that these fears were unfounded, but they seemed so real. Every minute ticked away, and she was still no closer to understanding what was happening.
