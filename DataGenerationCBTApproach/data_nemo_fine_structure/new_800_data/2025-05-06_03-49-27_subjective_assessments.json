The phone remains silent, no longer ringing with daily check-ins from old friends who've drifted away since her husband's passing.

Today, she was supposed to start volunteering again at the hospital where she once worked, but as she searches for her nurse's pin, she finds herself suddenly overcome by an inexplicable fatigue. She sinks into her armchair, clutching the pin tightly in her fist, and feels a profound sense of being forgotten, unseen, and alone.",

Everything feels so out of control. It’s like my heart is racing just thinking about it. I wish someone would just listen to me, you know? Just hear me out and try to understand. Sometimes I get this weird feeling that nobody cares anymore. Like, why even bother trying? I mean, we used to be close, but now...now I don’t know. It’s hard to explain. Sometimes I think about leaving, just getting out of here. But then I look around and realize...this is where I belong. This is my life. I need to focus on myself right now, but I also remember all these things I promised myself I wouldn’t forget. How could I leave like that? That would be irresponsible.

I mean, what are the chances that someone would just attack a random person without a mask? Like, isn't that a little weird? Anyway, after dispatch said there wasn't enough evidence to arrest him, she started freaking out because she thought her brother would be in danger next time. My mom is already stressing about how this will affect our family dynamics. Like, seriously, can't we just have one fucking day where everything goes smoothly? When she heard the dispatch say his name was Alex, she immediately started thinking about all the other bad things he could've done. Like, did he rape anyone else? Did he rob people? Is he still out there? Her mind is racing with thoughts of Alex's possible crimes.

Later, while cooking, I heard her voice calling out from the living room. \"What are you making?\" I replied, \"Just some leftovers.\" Her question hung in the air, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that she was trying to guilt trip me into spending more time with her.

A mother pushing a tiny girl in a swing caught my attention, and I couldn’t help but think of how much we had enjoyed those afternoons too. She looked content, her smile radiating warmth. I wish I could be that carefree. As I continued my stroll, I noticed another couple sitting on a bench. They seemed lost in conversation, their heads bent toward each other. I watched them for a few moments, imagining what they might be discussing. Perhaps they were planning something? Maybe they shared similar interests? My mind started weaving scenarios, filling gaps between observations with assumptions. It felt like I was reading between the lines, drawing conclusions based on snippets of information.
