It’s so frustrating because I know I can do better than that, but then someone like her comes along and makes it seem like I’m never good enough. I guess what really gets to me is how they say it so casually. Like, ‘Oh, yeah, I’ve seen kindergarteners doing way better work than that.’ They don’t realize how much pressure being a junior doctor puts on you. Every mistake is magnified, and it feels like no matter how hard you try, you’re going to be criticized. And when people make fun of your mistakes, it just builds up inside you until it boils over. It’s like they think I’m some kind of idiot who doesn’t know anything. But deep down, I know I have potential, and I want to prove myself. It’s tough enough working in medicine without having people doubt my abilities. When someone like her says something like that, it just makes me feel like I’ll never be good enough."

Her emotions are always raw and unfiltered, making her reactions feel more like a gut punch than a thoughtful discussion.

You might even catch her trying to set off fireworks in the middle of a grocery store, just because she feels like it. When people say, \"Don't take it personally,\" they have no idea what they're saying. This woman doesn't care about your feelings; her sole purpose is to make everyone else feel miserable. With a single raised eyebrow, she can transform a peaceful afternoon into a war zone. And don't think for a second that she'll apologize – she'd rather die than admit she was wrong. You see this kind of behavior all too often when someone's lost their sense of self-control, but when it comes from this particular individual, there's something particularly toxic at play. Maybe it's the way she uses sarcasm to mask her true intentions, or maybe it's the fact that she genuinely believes she's right, regardless of evidence to the contrary. Whatever it is"
