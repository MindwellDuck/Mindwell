She watched from the kitchen window as they clinked glasses, his hand casually touching her husband's arm. A familiar pang of jealousy tightened in her chest. It wasn't the first time she'd seen them like this, but it was the first time she felt a sharp urge to walk out there and interrupt their laughter, claim him back. Instead, she turned off the lights and walked home alone.",

By doing nothing, you're letting him keep doing whatever he wants around her, and you're just standing here, clueless. What are you even thinking? Are you really that dense? Do you seriously think he doesn't have feelings for her too? Look at the way he looks at her! You can't deny what you saw, no matter how much you want to. Just accept it already. Stop pretending like you don't know what's going on. It's like you're trying to convince yourself that something's not happening when everyone else sees it clear as day.

Her eyes misted over as she shared stories of their time together, painting beautiful landscapes. Meanwhile, I couldn't help but think about the countless nights I spent crying alone, missing what could have been our future together. It’s just not fair. Why does everyone else seem to have such wonderful memories, while mine are tainted by pain and regret? Why can’t I be happy like them? Even John's letters didn't make me feel whole. They only brought back more tears and questions. Maybe I'm just not meant to be happy. Maybe I'll always be stuck in this sadness, while others get to move forward with their lives. It feels unfair, especially since John would have wanted me to be content after he was gone. But now, every memory reminds me of what I lost – and what I’ll never have again.
