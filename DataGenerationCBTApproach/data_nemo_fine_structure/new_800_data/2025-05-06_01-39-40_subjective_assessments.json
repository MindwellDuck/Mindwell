Eventually, I started yelling at her, just like that other girl. I remember feeling so angry, but then my manager told me to calm down and apologize. It was such a relief when I did.

Why bother dwelling on something so insignificant? It wasn't as if it was anything special. Just another photo taken during a routine event—nothing more.

But really, it's just a relic—a reminder of a life left behind, a fleeting glimpse into the past. And how does this photo even matter? Is it truly worthy of attention? Does it hold any real importance? Or is it merely a nostalgic trifle—a meaningless artifact of times gone by? And then there’s the context—the fact that they’re all sharing laughs over this image. What exactly are they celebrating? A moment of triviality? An insignificant event? How can anyone find joy in such a thing? It’s simply a memory—a brief flicker in the vast expanse of time.

If he hadn't been so lazy, they might have stayed together. But instead, he chose to waste time solving math problems, ignoring everyone else. Who cares if he misses milestones? Not me! Fuck this! I'm done with him and his shitty attitude. He doesn't deserve anything good. When will he learn that nobody wants to be around someone like him? What's wrong with this guy?

But as we talked more, I realized he must have been thinking about something deeply personal, and I didn't want to intrude on his emotions. Yet, why did it always seem like he got so worked up over nothing? I know he's sensitive, but shouldn't he learn to handle stress better? When he told me about the withered plant, I felt annoyed that he was making such a big deal out of it. It wasn’t even that special, just another plant he’d forgotten to water. Still, he kept talking about how much she liked it and how sad it made him feel. I tried to reassure him that it’s okay to remember happy times, but he insisted that it was more than that—it was an actual memory he cherished. Now, whenever I see plants, I think about how easily they can die, and it makes me uncomfortable because it reminds me of all the things that could go wrong in life. Sometimes, I wonder if his emotional outbursts are actually connected to something deeper. Maybe he’s struggling with feelings he doesn’t know how to process, and it’s hard for him to open up about them. When he does, though, it feels overwhelming, especially since he rarely talks about these"

The more I looked at her, the more I felt a knot forming in my stomach. She didn’t seem the type to take risks or make impulsive decisions. What if she was playing me, using her vulnerability to manipulate me into doing something that would ultimately harm both of us?
