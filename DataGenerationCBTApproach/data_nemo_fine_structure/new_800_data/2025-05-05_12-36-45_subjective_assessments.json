I've told him multiple times that I'm available during regular working hours, but he just ignores me. This is a huge betrayal of trust. I can't believe I wasted so much time fixing his problems last week. Now, I'll be spending another Saturday night dealing with his issues. This is ridiculous. I should be focusing on my own projects, not babysitting his shit. He needs to understand that I won't be available outside of work hours. This is a huge problem. I don't know how much more of this I can take. My mental health will never recover from these constant disruptions. I need to find a way out of this toxic work environment.

He tried to push the thoughts aside, but they lingered, making him feel like an idiot for even considering such a thing. Still, he couldn't help but wonder if there was truth to some of those nagging doubts that kept popping up in his head. He didn't want to let himself fall back into old patterns, but the more he resisted, the more he felt like he was trapped in a cycle of suspicion and mistrust. Every little thing seemed to take on a deeper meaning, and he began to question whether he was really over her.

Did they too miss their loved ones and feel like they were just an afterthought? Or was it something special about their relationship that made him feel this way? He closed his eyes, trying to block out the memories flooding his mind. His thoughts drifted to the past, reliving moments he wished he could change. He remembered the fights over small things, how they used to argue until the night before their wedding. Was it all worth it? Had love really been enough to make them stay together? He sighed, rubbing his tired eyes. What was the point of holding onto these feelings? Would anything change if he let go of the past? Or was it just his imagination playing tricks on him again?"
