He's always trying to one-up me in the kitchen, even though we both have our own ways of dealing with stress—me through meditation, him by obsessively cleaning until everything is spotless. It's like he thinks if he doesn't cook up something that would make us both proud, he'll be seen as less capable than me, despite never having cooked anything remotely close to how I prepare meals. But let’s be real; I’m the one who has been cooking for years now, while Alex still struggles to boil water without burning it. And yet, every time I invite him over, he insists on bringing his famous lasagna. Not because he's particularly good at it (let's face it, it tastes more like cardboard), but because he wants to show off. “Look, I can do this too!” he says, acting like he’s some kind of culinary genius. Meanwhile, I'm stuck watching him struggle to get the layers right, the sauce too runny, and the cheese burnt to a crisp. It’s almost as if he's comparing himself to professional chefs or, worse, my own family gatherings where I effortlessly whip up delicious meals that leave everyone wanting seconds.

Maybe she's always been distant, but now I see why. She just pretends to care when it suits her interests. That photo she took is probably going straight to social media, where everyone will see how perfect our relationship looks. She thinks I'll be okay with that? She doesn't understand what this means to me. I spent years building this life, pouring my heart into every piece, and now...now it's all being erased. How could she just ignore this? She's so careless, leaving me here like this. Does she even realize how much it affects me? If I had known she would leave, I wouldn’t have taken that photo.
