Of course he failed it, he's not even trying. How does he expect to pass when he hasn't studied anything? I know for a fact he did all the homework and got all A's, but that's not enough. He needs more than just grades, he needs someone to talk to. Maybe if I'd asked him sooner, he wouldn't feel so hopeless now. Now he'll probably skip school and end up failing the semester, and then where will he go next? The thought of him leaving school makes me sick. What am I supposed to do? I'm already overworked, and now I have to deal with this? This is ridiculous. I need to get my priorities straight, but I don't want to let him down either.

I saw how she acted toward other guys too. She barely gave them a chance because she was still \"in love\" with her ex. Now she thinks she's better than everyone else just because she has feelings left for her ex. Her friends are tired of being ignored. But does she care? No fucking way. My friend's behavior is ridiculous. She keeps talking about how much she misses him. Even though we know they broke up, she insists he loves her. Does she really think he cares? Maybe if she'd just get over him already, things would be different. But no, she won't let go. This whole thing is insane. We've tried to tell her to move on, but she refuses to listen.

We’ve watched enough horror movies; let’s keep our feet on the ground. Besides, if there were actual ghosts, wouldn’t they have shown up by now? Five years? That’s a long time. If this house was haunted, we’d have seen signs by now. It’s probably just her stress. She’s been acting strange all day, ever since she came home from work. A bit too stressed, maybe, but you don’t start thinking ghosts just because someone is a little anxious. I’m going to go talk to her, calm her down. She needs me right now.

However, I did notice a few things that might be concerning. Firstly, the teacher's comments section is full of negative feedback. The student received a 20% deduction for not turning in their assignments on time, which could significantly impact their grade. Additionally, the teacher mentioned that the student struggled with understanding some concepts, but didn't provide specific examples. Secondly, the overall grade point average (GPA) is lower than expected. While the student has shown improvement over the previous semester, they still need to work harder to catch up. Thirdly, the teacher's comment about the student being'struggling' raises concerns. This might mean the student needs additional support or accommodations to succeed in the class. I would recommend speaking with the teacher to understand the situation better and identify potential solutions. Fourthly, the parent's reaction seems extreme. Storming into the classroom mid-afternoon may cause unnecessary stress for both the student and me. Perhaps we can discuss alternative ways for the parent to communicate with me, such as scheduling a meeting before or after school? Overall, while these issues are certainly important, they don't necessarily indicate a catastrophic outcome. With proper guidance and support, the student can improve their grades and overcome challenges.\""
