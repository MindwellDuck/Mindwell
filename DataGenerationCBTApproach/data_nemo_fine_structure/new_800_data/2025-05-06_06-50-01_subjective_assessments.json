The sobs of the young sous-chef echoed from the office nearby, a stark reminder of his own despair after last week's service meltdown. As he reached for another onion, his hand brushed against the empty ring on his left hand. He paused, gazing at the vacant space where his wedding band once was. The knife slipped, nicking his thumb. Blood pooled in the crease of his palm, dripping onto the cutting board, mingling with the diced vegetables. He sighed, hopelessly watching the red streaks marring the pristine white surface.",

It was as if he was trying to drown himself in the mess, hoping someone would notice. I wonder why he wouldn't even bother to clean up—doesn't he know how much work we have ahead? Does he think we'll just pick up after him? What’s worse is how he slices those onions like they’re knives. I swear, every time I see him, I feel like I'm going to lose my temper. How can one man be so careless? Doesn’t he realize that his mistakes put us all at risk? It must be because he doesn't understand what it means to truly serve. His actions are an insult to everything we stand for. He probably thinks he deserves better than us, maybe some fancy restaurant where no one has to deal with his incompetence. That’s why he never cleans up after himself, always leaving me to handle it. Every time he touches something, it feels like he’s defacing our hard work. And now, with this cut, he’s making a mockery of our entire operation. We need to talk to him again, remind him who he is working for. If he continues like this, he’ll bring down the entire house. Maybe he needs a little reminder of where he belongs. After all, we can't afford to have anyone slipping through the cracks."

It's not like we haven't been open all day; why would you assume he'd find what he needed by now? And another thing, if he had looked around, he wouldn't need help anyway. But no, he has to come in here, take up space, and ask for something simple. This is ridiculous. Why does everyone act like this? It makes me wonder if he's one of those people who thinks they deserve special treatment just because they're customers. Like, hello, you're paying us to help you, but then you go ahead and treat us like dirt? What the hell is wrong with these people? Maybe he doesn't realize how much work we are doing just to accommodate him, or maybe he genuinely believes he deserves better service. Either way, he's an idiot. I can't stand dealing with idiots like him. This guy isn't going anywhere. He's probably going to ask for more things, wasting my time even more.

As I read through the details, I couldn't help but think about all the times things hadn’t gone well at work. There were always long hours, constant stress, and frustrating meetings. It seemed like every time something went wrong, the manager would be there, criticizing me or telling me how much I wasn't doing enough. And then there were the small things – always having to start with someone else, never getting recognition for my ideas, feeling invisible in the office. It was like no matter what I did, I was never good enough. I thought back to when I first started working here. At first, everything seemed okay. But then came the long hours, followed by the constant criticism. I tried to hold on, hoping that things would get better, but each day brought more stress, and eventually, I realized it was time to move on. Even now, thinking about those moments makes me feel tired. Like I'm carrying around all these bad experiences, just waiting for something else to go wrong so I can say, \"I told you so.\" Now, I know this isn't fair. Maybe things will change tomorrow. Maybe I'll find a new job where everyone is supportive and we actually have fun together. But deep down, I know it won't happen. Every time I look at my phone, seeing notifications about layoffs, feels like confirmation."

It started with small things - a faint noise in the hallway, a door creaking open by itself. But one day, while searching for a book, she stumbled upon an old invitation hidden between its pages. It belonged to my sister's wedding, dated decades ago. I can remember every detail vividly - the flowers, the music, the tears we cried together. We were so happy then, so full of hope. What happened after? Why is this letter here? I think back to our childhood, to the countless times we talked about our future. My mother always encouraged us to pursue our dreams, never to settle for less than what we wanted. And yet, here I am, standing alone in this very room, wondering if it all was just a lie. A memory surfaces - the way she used to hold me when I was scared, how she'd comfort me through the darkest nights. I could feel her warmth, her love. But now, as I look around this cold space, I'm left with only questions. Where did she go? I see myself standing in her kitchen, holding a cup of coffee, smiling at her as she prepared breakfast. There was something special about that morning - the sun shone brightly, casting a warm glow over everything."
