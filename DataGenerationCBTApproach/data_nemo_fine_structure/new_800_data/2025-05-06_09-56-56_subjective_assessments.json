He even joked about how he'd have to travel alone this time, which made me feel even worse. While I was stressed out about our upcoming trip planned for next week, he didn't seem to care about my anxiety. He was already planning his packing list, saying something like, \"Oh, I'll just grab a few essentials and be off.\" It felt like he wasn't even listening to me when I tried to talk about my worries. When we were getting ready earlier, he went straight into work mode. He seemed completely unfazed by the changes in our schedule. I've always admired how he handles stress, but now it makes me wonder if he ever gets anxious. Maybe I overreact because he doesn't show signs of being overwhelmed? But seeing him handle it so calmly is frustrating. I know I shouldn't judge, but every time I look at him, I feel like I'm falling behind. What if I'm more sensitive than he realizes? He went ahead and booked us a hotel room for the night, but I can't shake off the feeling that he's doing everything to make himself look good. It feels unfair since he got this huge assignment while I'm dealing with my own issues—my mom has been ill lately, and I haven’t had much sleep. When did he become so confident? Is he just not worried about anything"

Each day he watches as a young graffiti artist, barely out of adolescence, tags up the wall across from his window - vibrant colors splashed across the old brick, obscuring the once pristine view that inspired his late wife's favorite painting. The hatred simmers within him like a slow-burning flame, fueled by each new addition to the ever-growing mural. One morning, he sees the boy pausing mid-spray, turning to catch sight of him watching. Their eyes meet through the glass, and the artist feels his grip tighten around the coffee cup in his hand until it shatters, cutting into his palm.",

She loved art, and this was her favorite spot—she always said it reminded her of our first date. But does he care about any of that? No, instead he gets to spend his days ruining everything we built together, all while making money off some rich businessman who doesn’t even live here. It’s disgusting. And don’t even get me started on how tacky the whole thing looks—I swear, whoever hired him must have a personal vendetta against beauty. Every time I see that mess, I feel like I’m staring straight into the face of death itself. I bet he doesn’t know how much pain he causes, but that doesn’t make it okay. I wonder if his parents are proud of him, knowing he’s disrespecting me and everything we shared. Maybe they think he’s just doing his job, but I know the truth—they’re probably too scared to say anything because they don’t want to lose their son to the same system that destroyed mine.

They're all like that, always under stress, even when there's no deadline. Just like how my ex-husband said he needed space before leaving me, these people are always saying things like, 'we'll manage,' but then they don't. I guess it's just another case of someone trying to cover up their own shortcomings. Like when my sister-in-law says, 'It's fine; we'll figure it out,' but deep down, she knows she can't.

But he barely acknowledged me, his gaze drifting back to the painting. I watched him work, his strokes bold and confident, yet laced with frustration. It wasn’t just the paint; his entire demeanor screamed of turmoil. I felt a pang of concern, wondering what had triggered this outburst. Had something happened? Was it the argument we’d had earlier? I decided to tread carefully, not wanting to push him further into his emotional darkness. “You’ve been working really hard on your art lately. Maybe you’re just feeling overwhelmed.” My voice was gentle, a mix of empathy and curiosity. I wanted to understand what was going on behind those intense eyes.
