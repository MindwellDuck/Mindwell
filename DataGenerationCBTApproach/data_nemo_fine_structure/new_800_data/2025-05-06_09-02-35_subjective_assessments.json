She just wanted to make herself look good. That's why I'm so angry whenever I see pictures from our wedding. They remind me of everything that went wrong. I can't stand looking at those photos anymore. But what really gets under my skin is how she always acts like everything between us was fine. Like, no one would ever notice that there were huge gaps between our conversations. I know it because I've checked. We barely spoke during those months. Yet she still has the nerve to act like nothing happened. It's all so clear now. I knew she was hiding something, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Now, though, it makes perfect sense. There's no way she could have been that happy when we weren't speaking. But does anyone care about how I felt? No, they're too busy being polite. She's probably going to act like this again, pretending like nothing happened, thinking everyone will be fooled. Well, I won't fall for it. I'll never trust her again.

The person believes that the decision to reassign her role was made specifically against them, despite the lack of direct confirmation. This conclusion is drawn based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence, leading to feelings of disappointment and frustration. In reality, the decision may simply have nothing to do with individual performance. By jumping to conclusions, the person creates unnecessary stress and emotional distress before even receiving official confirmation. This kind of thinking can lead to further misinterpretation, making the situation worse than it needs to be. Instead, it would be better to wait for an official announcement or conversation with HR before drawing any conclusions. In this case, the person has already jumped to conclusions and is focusing on negative outcomes, which is a common manifestation of the \"Catastrophizing\" thought pattern. In other words, the person assumes the worst-case scenario (being fired)"

Her reflection in the window caught her eye - a stranger with hollow cheeks and shadows under her eyes. She sighed, the weight of solitude pressing down on her chest like an unwelcome familiar. Another day alone, another meal for one. The loneliness felt like a physical force, pushing her back into her chair, making it hard to breathe.

Broken and ugly, just like how I feel when I look at my hands—empty, useless, and worn. Maybe then I'll see beauty again, maybe then I'll find love, but until then, I'm trapped in this endless cycle of self-pity. There's no escape from the emptiness, no way to silence the tears.
