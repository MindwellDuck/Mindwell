I don't even know why they'd bother—haven't we been friends for years? But now I'll never get over this. I've worked so hard, and they just ruined everything. This is insane. Why would anyone do something like this to someone as dedicated as me? Doesn't anyone understand that I'm already stressed enough? I feel like I'm going crazy. First, I had a huge meeting that went wrong because one of my colleagues kept interrupting me, and then today, when I was getting ready for this interview, I realized I left my headphones at home, and I couldn't find them anywhere. And now...now there's this?! This is all too much. I just want to crawl under a rock. But I have to keep going. I won't let them win. I’ll show them. I’ll prove them wrong. I’ll make sure they regret this. But how am I supposed to stay calm"

Who wouldn't want to protect themselves from their own family member? I mean, I've been acting weird lately... maybe I have been planning something. Oh man, I can almost hear her thinking. \"He's up to no good, he's gonna try to hurt himself.\" Yeah, maybe I am. But you know what would make me feel better? If I had your support, girlfriend. You're always telling me what I'm capable of, but when it comes down to actual action, I'm still stuck in neutral. Why do you think I'm such a failure at everything? Wait, did she really check the gun today? Or is she just making shit up again? No, she definitely checked it. That's why it's all scratched up. It looks like she didn't clean it properly"

No one else acted like that after losing their partner. Just him. And now he saw them too. It made him feel... inferior. Like maybe he wasn't supposed to move on either. Maybe he shouldn't be happy. Maybe he should be sad too. Maybe he should feel the same way as everyone else. But he didn't want to. He wanted to feel what they felt. To be able to laugh and smile like that again.
