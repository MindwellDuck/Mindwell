But what really hit him hard was seeing the happy couple smiling back at him, their joy and love so stark against the backdrop of his own misery. He felt like an outsider, watching those moments unfold while he was stuck in his own dark thoughts. And then, to make matters worse, he remembered that he wasn’t even supposed to be there. This was the place where he used to hang out with her, but she was gone now, leaving him alone to face whatever was coming his way. It was like the world had moved on without him, leaving him feeling lost and forgotten. Everything was just too much, and yet, here he was, caught up in this stupid memory, reliving the past instead of moving forward. That photo could have been anyone’s, but no matter who it belonged to, it held a special significance for him. It reminded him of happier times, of laughter and love, when life wasn’t so complicated.

In reality, she was just trying to survive another day. It didn’t matter what anyone else did; all that mattered was getting by. Still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was falling further and further behind. There were times when she wondered if it was even worth it anymore, but then something would push her forward, and she’d keep going, no matter what. For now, though, she could barely muster the energy to get out of bed, let alone face whatever challenges lay ahead. Maybe someday she’d find the strength to start anew, but for now, the weight of her responsibilities felt crushing. She had bills to pay, a family to support, and a future to build, even if it meant sacrificing some of those things.

His eyes, tired and bloodshot, scanned the screen once more before he threw his hands up in defeat. \"I'm too old for this,\" he muttered, his voice barely audible over the hum of his ancient computer. He leaned back in his chair, feeling the weight of his age and solitude pressing down on him like a physical force. His reflection stared back at him from the dark windowpane, a gaunt face etched with lines of disappointment. The emptiness of his house echoed around him, amplifying his despair.

What good would it do? He glanced at the clock, wondering if anyone would even notice. Not like anyone cared about him anymore. His family had moved on, left him behind. They were all so busy, so caught up in their own lives, that they couldn't be bothered with him now. Even his daughter—she who used to listen to him talk about his dreams, who used to encourage him when things got tough—that she wasn't even worth calling. No, she was too busy with her own life, too caught up in her own problems. She probably forgot all about him now, just as everyone else did. And besides, what could he say? \"Hey, I know you're busy, but I need someone to talk to.\" No one ever listened to him anymore. Everyone was too busy, too important, too caught up in their own lives to care. Why waste time talking to someone who didn't matter? He thought back to those days when he used to feel alive.

It’s been years since I cooked for anyone but myself. The fact that she thinks she can just go back to being a hotshot chef after 30+ years off is laughable.

Maybe if she’d just focus on making me happy instead of being a fucking celebrity, we wouldn’t be here. But no, she had to go and ruin everything. Even if she did decide to come back, would it really change anything? We both know she’s just going through the motions.
