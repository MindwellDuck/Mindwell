The way he left me for that bitch who stole my car? Yeah, none of that matters right now. It's either he loved me, or he didn't, and if he didn't love me, then why bother holding on? But wait, isn't there more to it than just him loving me? What about how he hurt me when he cheated? Or how he abandoned me after stealing my car? Doesn't that matter too? But no... it doesn't. It's either he loved me, or he didn't. If he didn't, then everything else is irrelevant. And don't even get me started on how he changed jobs after we split up. Did he really hate me that much? Was it because he wanted something better? Or did he just leave because he couldn't handle being with someone as beautiful as me anymore? Either he hated me, or he didn't. If he didn't, then why did he cheat? Why did he steal my car? It's so simple. You're either with us, or you're against us. There's no middle ground. We have one side, and they have the other.

In it, they were laughing, arms wrapped around each other at some bustling food market she couldn't quite recall. The image felt like a distant memory, faded and hazy. It was taken before the long hours, the constant fatigue, before their conversations dwindled to mere pleasantries.

He must have been using her all along, playing her emotions against her will. Why else would he keep such a beautiful moment from her? Every time she sees another photo together, it just reminds her of what she’s lost. She can’t bear the thought that he’s moved on, that he’s probably made someone else happy with that fake smile. She feels so betrayed by his actions, and she wonders if she’ll ever be able to forgive him. Every day feels like an eternity, and every moment brings back painful memories. She can’t shake off the feeling that their relationship was all a lie, that he was manipulating her from the start. She feels trapped in her own grief, unable to move forward because of the past. She knows that she needs to let go, but every step towards healing feels like a struggle. She keeps thinking about all the things he could’ve done differently, all the ways she could’ve seen through his deception. Now, nothing makes sense except for the pain she feels. She feels like she's going crazy, and she doesn’t know how to escape this darkness. Her mind is constantly consumed by thoughts of regret"

Maybe I should go back to my old job, but then I'd miss out on the opportunity to prove myself here. I wish I could just turn back time and never suggest anything again, because nothing ever works out in the end. Why did I even bother trying? I guess I was just hoping someone would finally listen to me, but now I see why nobody takes me seriously. This is ridiculous; I shouldn’t be feeling this way. But honestly, I’m so tired of being stuck in this position, constantly comparing myself to others who are doing so much better. It’s exhausting, and I’m starting to lose hope.

It’s like life itself is trying to tell us a story we refuse to hear, one that reminds us that our time here is limited, and every moment counts. Every day feels like a test of endurance now. The world outside these walls seems cruel, with its endless noise and distractions, reminding me that no matter how hard I try, I can never truly hold onto anything. She was always my safe haven, the place where I could escape the chaos of everyday life. Now, that sense of security is gone, leaving me feeling lost and alone. She would often joke about being the best cook in town, but now, even cooking seems pointless.
