Meanwhile, here I am, stressing over something that shouldn't be this hard. The fact that my mind keeps drifting back to my late wife reminds me of all the other things I've forgotten lately. Forgetfulness is literally eating away at me. Why can't I just remember everything like she did? It's so frustrating when I try to put things into perspective, but nothing helps. Nothing fucking helps. Every second feels like an eternity. I wish I could just go back in time and fix all the mistakes I made, but no, I'm stuck here now, dealing with this stupid timer. If only I could turn back the clock and redo those moments where I messed up... But no, instead, I'm left with nothing but regret and a growing sense of dread. Why does this happen to me?!

But why am I even thinking like this? We were happy together, weren't we? We had our disagreements, but we always managed to work through them. Now it’s like everything is falling apart, and I don’t know how to put the pieces back together. My thoughts are racing, jumping from one terrible thought to another. I feel like I’m losing control, like my brain is just feeding me worst-case scenarios. Even little things trigger these thoughts.
