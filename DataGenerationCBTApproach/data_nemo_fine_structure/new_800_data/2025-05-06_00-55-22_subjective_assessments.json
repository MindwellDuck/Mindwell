Her breath comes in short, angry bursts as she paces, her mind replaying every harsh word and insinuation made by colleagues who think she's not cut out for investigative journalism. She snatches up her phone, intending to call someone, anyone, but stops herself, realizing there's no one left who'll understand this fire burning within her. Instead, she storms over to the wall where her degrees hang, unseeing eyes staring back at her. With a cry, she rips them down, leaving behind crooked nails and scattered dust.",

The memory is fuzzy, like her dreams, which are always filled with images of failure. But these moments linger, echoing through her mind like the sound of her own voice when she screams about being ignored. It's all the same—the pain, the frustration—it doesn't get better; it just gets louder. Her room feels like a war zone now—a battlefield littered with fallen dreams, reminders of everything she could never be. The silence isn't calming; it's suffocating. Every step she takes, every word she says, feels like a betrayal. She's trapped in this cycle of rage, and no one understands why she can't let go. They see her as angry, not broken, but she knows the truth. I'm not just fighting for my career—I'm fighting for my soul. And every time I lose control, it feels like a piece of me dies. It's hard to keep going when you feel like you're drowning in your own anger. The days blend together, each one a blur of disappointment and desperation. She thinks back to the beginning, when she was full of hope, but now that feeling feels distant, like something from another life. Even the memories of happiness seem tainted, like they were stolen moments in a world that doesn't want her. This isn't"

Her daughter is thriving, married with two kids, while her son struggled to find stability after college. He's working multiple jobs just to make ends meet, unlike his siblings who have established successful careers. She can't help but feel like she's behind them all, especially since her husband didn't live long enough to see their grandchildren grow up. It isn't just about the family; even friends come into play. They're all doing well, some with more children than her, while she's single. She tries to keep up appearances, but it feels like everyone else has an easier path. Even her neighbors are raising their families in nicer homes. Meanwhile, she's stuck in this small apartment, struggling to keep up with expenses. This isn't the first time she's felt like she's falling behind. Every milestone, every success story, makes her feel like she's lagging further behind. She wonders if she'll ever catch up or if she's truly destined to be left behind.

It would be really tough to hear someone else tell her she wasn't doing enough or that she needed to try harder. And then to see him walk out on her like that? That just makes me want to cry. Poor girl, she deserves better than this. I'm sure she wishes he'd talk to her, but maybe if we could find some way to calm him down, she'll feel more confident about what she's doing. This is really bad. We need to support each other right now. She needs to know that even though we don't always agree, we still care about what she does.

My kids are growing up without their father; they deserve better than to grow up with an absent parent because of me. They need stability, but I can't give it to them anymore.

It’s been happening over and over lately—those teenagers, always causing trouble, never taking responsibility for anything. My husband worked hard to keep our garden looking perfect, and now those kids are destroying it with their reckless behavior. Every time I look at the garden, I feel so angry. Those kids don’t have any concept of respect, and it makes me sick. I can’t believe how little consideration they show towards others’ property. Do you know how much it means to me? To me, that garden represents everything he did for us and our family. Now, seeing it torn apart by these careless teens makes me want to scream. What if they keep doing this?
