I'm just sitting there cleaning up after him when she comes along and starts reminiscing about how they used to live together. I mean, I know life is tough right now, but does she really need to bring it up? It feels like every time we have a moment alone, she brings up some new way that my life isn’t good enough. She mentions this other girl from work who lives with her husband, and suddenly our apartment feels like a dump by comparison. I can see why she’d want to get away from all the stress of raising kids on her own, especially since her ex is already remarried. But honestly, it’s hard not to feel jealous when she talks about how they’re enjoying each other’s company again. At least they didn’t split up because he had an affair. When she says something about having to move out soon, I feel a pang of sadness. Of course, I know what she means – she wants to find someone else to share her life with. But it doesn’t make it easier. Every time we talk about moving forward, I feel like I’m just holding her back. Maybe if she weren’t still living with me, she wouldn’t be thinking about finding someone else. But then again, maybe she would’ve ended things sooner if I hadn’t been here. That’s what makes it so frustrating – I don’t know what to believe anymore"

He's been alone since she passed five years ago, but tonight, there was a warmth in the air, a familiarity he hadn't felt in ages—a young couple, laughing easily, hands entwined as they browsed through the aisles he'd polished countless times. Their happiness grated against his silent existence, each giggle echoing like a mockery of his loneliness. He watched them leave together, her head resting on his shoulder, their laughter lingering long after the automatic doors slid shut behind them.",

People always say life goes on, but how does it go on when you're still here? Why can't I be happy like that couple? They don't have to deal with my past, my struggles, or the constant reminder that I'll never find love again. That woman seemed so content, but what if she wasn't? Maybe she was desperate like me, hiding her own pain behind a mask of happiness. She probably wasn't though; she didn't look sad at all. They were just enjoying the moment, but we know that doesn't last forever. Eventually, reality would set back in, and she'd feel the same way I do now. It's unfair that people like her get to experience joy while I'm stuck here, alone. It's not fair, but I'm not going to let it ruin my day. I've had enough disappointment already, and I won't let this memory upset me further. I won't dwell on this; I'll move on. But why can't I just enjoy the small moments for once? Why does everything always end up hurting me? Life moves on, but it doesn’t make things easier for those who are left behind. Why can"

You think you were doing the right thing by being honest with her, but no one ever gives you credit for that. Now, you're just another person who got burned because they tried to protect someone else. It's almost like the universe is trying to tell you something, but you won't listen because you’re too scared to face reality. You keep telling yourself that things will get better someday, but those moments of peace feel like a distant memory, lost forever. You know that’s not true, but you can’t stop pretending it is. Every time you see her name, it feels like a knife twisting deeper into your heart. This isn’t the first time someone left you, and it won’t be the last. There are always going to be people who don’t care about you or want to hurt you. Your life has become a series of broken promises, and you’ve learned to hold onto anger instead of hope.

It was as if he’d been exposed to something toxic, and his entire body was reacting to it. Even the sound of the running water seemed to take on a menacing quality, echoing through his mind like a warning. His hands trembled ever so slightly as he washed them, but he refused to let himself think about why they were shaking. Instead, he focused on the idea that he could never be clean again, no matter how many times he washed. Every touch, every movement, would bring back memories of that disgusting creature. It wasn’t just the physical sensation; even the smell of soap became tainted, like a reminder of everything that had happened. Dr. H. felt like he was drowning in his own fear, unable to escape the weight of his thoughts. And yet, despite all this, he knew he had to keep going, to pretend everything was okay.

I hope he knows what he’s doing. I guess he does, but... yeah, I'm still worried about him. I wonder if I should try to help. Wait, no, I shouldn't interfere. If he needs help, he'll ask. Right?
