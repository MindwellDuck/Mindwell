She must have loved him at first, but then realized what a piece of shit he really is. He's not worth saving, and I don't need to waste my life trying to help him. I'll never understand why people are so weak; they think they're superior just because they manage to survive. They're nothing special—just lazy and stupid.

And besides, she wasn’t trying to make herself look better by getting the job. It was simply an opportunity to take on more responsibility and grow professionally. When people react negatively to good news, especially when it’s related to them personally, there must be something deeper going on. Maybe they’re struggling with feelings of inadequacy or insecurity, and this is just a way to mask those emotions. Or maybe they genuinely feel threatened by your success, which is why they lash out like that. Whatever the reason, it doesn’t change the fact that their behavior is often rooted in their own fears and insecurities. It’s almost as if they're projecting their own personal issues onto the situation, making it all about themselves. They might be feeling jealous or resentful, which manifests as anger toward you. This isn’t about you; it’s about how they perceive things. Sometimes, we get so caught up in our own emotions that we forget to see the bigger picture. When someone reacts harshly to good news, it can be a sign that they’re dealing with internal struggles rather than just reacting to reality.
