Now that she’s gone, he’ll probably just spiral into more self-loathing. This isn’t surprising; he’s never had much confidence in himself. Even though we’ve been friends for years, he often feels overshadowed by my achievements and success. I can imagine him feeling lost and helpless right now, wondering if anyone would even notice if he disappeared. He deserves this, anyway. He’s always treated others poorly, so why wouldn’t they abandon him? I bet he’s crying himself to sleep tonight, replaying all the times he messed up and failed us. Poor guy, he really doesn’t deserve this kind of pain. But honestly, I don’t feel too bad for him. He’s not someone I’d want to be around anyway. Maybe this will teach him a lesson—how lonely it is to be left behind. I’m glad I didn’t have to deal with him anymore. We were just acquaintances, after all, and I’d rather be without him. He’s probably just wallowing in his own misery now, thinking about what could’ve been if only he’d changed. It’s too late for regrets, and now he has no one to blame but himself. Still, it’s hard not to feel a little pity for him. I guess he’ll just have to"

It wasn't just about missing out on that publication; it was about all the other things he'd been putting off because he couldn't bring himself to start again. His mind kept replaying the scenes where he'd failed to deliver results before—those missed deadlines, the disappointment, and the constant pressure to keep going. It seemed like everything was piling up, making him feel trapped. When he looked over at his wife, he saw how her smile had faltered, and he knew she could sense his unease. She tried to reassure him with a gentle touch, but even that didn't seem to ease his tension. It was like every little thing was weighing down on him, each reminder pushing him further into despair. He couldn’t shake the feeling that if he didn’t get back on track soon, everything would fall apart. In the end, he forced a weak smile, hoping it would be enough for her, but deep down, he felt lost. Every obstacle now seemed insurmountable, and he wondered if there was ever a way out of this cycle of failure and disappointment.

She's always been like this – jealous of anyone who succeeds in our lab. It’s ridiculous how she gets upset over something so trivial. I'm surprised she even joined our team, considering her attitude. And now, she thinks she's better than everyone because she got the promotion? Please. That's nothing new; she's always acted superior, especially around me. It's pathetic how she tries to hide it by pretending to be friendly. I bet if she didn't have a chance at the promotion, she'd still find ways to make herself look good, probably by making snide comments about others. The way she laughs at people's jokes is just a sign of her insecurity. It makes me roll my eyes every time I see her. I know she's trying to cover up her jealousy, but honestly, I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her. Her reactions are just another example of how insecure she really is. It’s funny how she thinks she can fool everyone with her fake smile. I’m sure deep down, she knows she’s not as confident as she claims to be. This whole thing is just an act—she’s too scared to admit her true feelings. But we all know what she’s really thinking."

What if one of them crawls onto my arm? Or worse, what if it jumps off and bites me? The thought alone makes me want to vomit and shiver with fear, but I still have to finish eating - how am I supposed to do that?! It's like the universe is conspiring against me by putting these creepy arachnids everywhere. I swear, if I don't get rid of it ASAP, I'll be begging for death.
