He has his own life now, and he doesn't need to bother with what happened back then. Maybe he's moved on, and we're both better off without each other. You know, I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out if he had stayed. Would I still be here? Probably not. Things wouldn't have worked out anyway. We were always meant to be apart, so maybe this is for the best. I don't think I'd ever see him again even if he wanted to reconnect. No, I'm fine without him. I've built a good life here, and I don't want to change that. Besides, I'm not really interested in hearing what he has to say. I'm happy being alone. Maybe someday I'll hear from someone else, though. Someone who actually cares about me. That would be nice, isn't it? Anyway, it's time for bed. I hope everything works out okay for him. I'm sure he'll figure things out. He's capable of doing that. After all, he's been doing it for years already. That's all for today. Goodnight!"

She's always been the one who wanted to move forward, forget. But no, she has to dig up everything from the past. Just because she wants to remember doesn't mean I should. This is all because of her. She's the reason I'm stuck here. If she hadn't told my mom, if she hadn't shown her the picture, none of this would have happened. But now everyone knows, and I'm left with nothing but memories. Why can't they see how much I've changed? How many times do I need to tell them I've moved on? Do they really think I'm going to be happy knowing he's out there somewhere? They don't care; they're too busy living their own lives. It's all her fault. She's ruining everything. My life, my future, even my happiness. She needs to stop trying to bring us back together. We were never meant to be. He wasn't for me, and she knew it. Why does she insist on keeping us connected? But she won't listen. She'll keep pushing until"

She looked over at that guy who came by to refill our water, and her whole face lit up. I couldn’t help but notice how warm it looked. It was like nothing had happened in months. The way she smiled, it felt like I’d forgotten what happiness even felt like. Even the waiter seemed happier than usual. His smile was genuine, and he seemed to genuinely care about us. That’s how much she liked the food, and it wasn’t even that expensive. We’re not exactly rolling in cash right now. As the meal went on, it became clear that I was the odd one out. Her eyes kept darting to him, and I could see the spark in her eye. I tried to brush it off, telling myself she was just being friendly, but deep down, I knew better. When they started talking about cooking, she got into it like she’d known him forever. I watched her laugh, her whole body shaking, and it broke my heart.

He just thinks he can take whatever he wants from me, like he owns me or something.** How would you explain this to them? What might be some potential reasons behind their behavior? # Example Response ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger Identify what triggered your negative emotions. In this case, it was when your partner used your favorite cashmere scarf to wipe grease off his car's dashboard. ## Step 2: Analyze Your Thoughts Analyze your thoughts and feelings about the situation. You feel angry, hurt, and betrayed, indicating deep emotional pain. ## Step 3: Look for Evidence Look for evidence supporting your interpretation. Ask yourself if there is enough reason to believe your partner intentionally disregarded your feelings or values. The lack of clear motivation suggests it may be an unintentional mistake rather than a deliberate act. ## Step 4: Consider Alternative Perspectives Consider alternative perspectives or explanations for your partner’s actions. Perhaps he didn’t think about how his action would affect you, or maybe he genuinely needed the scarf for another purpose. This helps broaden your understanding and encourages empathy. ## Step 5: Reflect on Your Feelings Reflect on why you feel the way you do. Are these feelings based on facts or assumptions? Try to separate your personal opinions from objective"

It doesn’t matter if there are nuances in between – I see things in black and white, never allowing anything in between. If someone does something good, they’re perfect. If someone does something bad, they’re evil. I’ve been living like this for so long that I can’t even imagine what it would feel like to be somewhere in between. My mind is trapped in this endless cycle of all-good or all-bad, refusing to accept anything else. Even when faced with evidence of complexity—of gray areas—I cling to my binary thinking, unwilling to let reality intrude. I have no room for doubt, no space for subtlety. Everything must fit neatly into one category, and if it doesn’t, I reject it. This way of thinking has become my shield, protecting me from the discomfort of uncertainty. But deep down, I wonder if I’m missing out by seeing everything in such stark terms. Maybe the truth lies somewhere in between, but I won’t give myself the chance to explore it. Instead, I keep clinging to my black-and-white world, where everything is clear-cut, and nothing ever gets lost in the middle. The note"
