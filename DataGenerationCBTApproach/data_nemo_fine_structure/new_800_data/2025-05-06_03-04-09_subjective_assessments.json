The colors seem muted, as if the light itself has dulled, casting long shadows across the room. Every brushstroke feels forced, each note a reminder that this isn't just about capturing beauty; it's about revealing the truth – that sometimes, even the brightest lights can fade away. The way she moves, her hands moving with purpose but also with a hint of desperation, makes me think she’s trying to hold onto something fragile. It’s almost as if every step forward is a step closer to losing everything. I watch her pack, her movements quick and decisive, like she’s racing against time. The way she pushes her things into a bag, almost like she's shoving them inside before they have a chance to weigh her down, tells me she’s not leaving willingly. Her eyes flicker toward me once, twice, but then she turns back to packing. It’s like she's pushing herself to forget, to leave the memories behind, just like she does when she steps away from the canvas. And yet, I know she can’t escape. This place, this moment, holds more than just paint and dust. There are moments we share here, whispers in the corner, laughter, tears—every brushstroke of our lives. She thinks she can leave all that behind? That it won’t follow her? Or maybe she knows better"

It was a busy shift at the hospital, and I fell asleep standing up in the hallway. I woke up on the floor, and my whole body feels stiff. I tried to brush it off, but she seems upset. Is it something I did? Shouldn’t I be doing more? I know she wants kids, but why does it feel so hard to even try? I remember when we first met, she loved how I could make her laugh. Now, every time I smile, she looks away. I can’t help but wonder if this is all because of work. My job makes people sick, and maybe that’s what scares her. But isn’t it worth it to save lives? I have to push through the pain; I owe it to them. I keep telling myself, “You’ll get through this,” but deep down, I doubt it. Every day, I see families torn apart by disease, and I feel powerless. The thought of giving up is overwhelming. I wish I could turn back time, go back to being young again. If only I could go back to those carefree days... Maybe I should have taken better care of myself during the shift."

Her anger boiled over, and I wanted to tell him off. But instead, I kept it together and said something calm, telling him to behave. He didn't deserve it, but I stood up for myself anyway. But then, something weird happened. After I told him off, he turned around and apologized. He even helped me pick up some stuff that fell down. I couldn't believe it. It felt really good. But then I realized, it must've been a mistake. I mean, he could have easily done more damage. Maybe he was just trying to distract me so he could steal more things. Yeah, that makes sense. I shouldn't let myself feel anything else than anger. That's all I'm allowed to feel. I definitely shouldn't feel anything else because if I do, I'll get hurt again. It doesn't matter what he actually did; I know how bad people can be. They always try to take advantage of us. So why would he act nice now? It's probably just another trick.

How could they just dismiss her like this? Didn't they remember everything she did for them? She thought back to the countless hours spent helping patients, the endless tasks, the dedication. All for nothing. It made no sense. \"Why would they fire me now? Is there something I forgot? A mistake I made?\" She clenched her fists, feeling the tension build inside her. \"Fucking bullshit!\" she shouted into the void, but there was no one there to hear her. How could they do this to her? Hadn't she given enough? Wasn't she worthy of some recognition? She thought about all the times she'd gone above and beyond, always putting others before herself.

She tries to brush it off as mere coincidence, but the feeling lingers. If things between them hadn't ended badly, would he still be acting like this? Is it possible that he genuinely doesn't want anything to do with her anymore? Her mind starts racing with all sorts of worst-case scenarios: What if he's upset about something specific she said or did? Or maybe he's struggling with personal issues that have nothing to do with her? The possibilities seem endless, each one leading down a dark path. She can't shake the feeling that she's being treated unfairly, even though she hasn’t done anything wrong. What if he’s simply making an effort to create space after their falling out?
