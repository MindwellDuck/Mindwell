It really didn't help that her manager was acting like he knew more about customer service than she did. He seemed to think he could handle things better, which meant Sarah felt like she was stuck with the worst jobs. Even when she told him that she thought she might have messed up, he just rolled his eyes and said she needed to pay attention. Her boss looked so smug as if he already knew how much trouble this would cause. The whole thing was starting to feel like an act—like he wanted to see her fail so badly that he'd go ahead and make it happen. Maybe I'm just too stressed out, but it feels like every time I try to talk to him, he just gets annoyed. Like, hello, I'm trying my best here! That's when the last straw hit her.

The people around you seem to be affected by your words, and they might even begin to doubt your intentions. It's possible that some individuals may start to see you as someone who brings bad luck to those close to them. Your predictions can sometimes feel like they're meant to discourage rather than inspire. While you might mean well, the messages you convey could inadvertently create a sense of hopelessness among your listeners. It’s worth considering whether this behavior is something you’d like to continue, especially when it comes to relationships and personal growth.
