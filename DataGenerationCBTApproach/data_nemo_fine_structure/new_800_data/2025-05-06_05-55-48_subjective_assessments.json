The penmanship matched his. Her heart sank as she realized it wasn't just another complaint; it was another sign of his growing discontent with their marriage. Another subtle dig at her long hours at the store, her exhaustion each evening. She felt a lump form in her throat as she crumpled the note into her palm, her unhappiness weighing heavier than ever.",

He says I'm too tired and I don't care enough about our family, but I know he doesn’t really understand. Every time he does this, I feel like crying, because I wish he would just talk to me instead of making things worse. But I try to stay calm, thinking maybe he’s going through some tough times too, and we can figure things out together. Yet, every day feels like another disappointment, and I worry that if I don’t change, our relationship will fall apart.** **It hurts when I think about all the times I’ve tried to make things better, and yet, he keeps pushing me further away. Sometimes I wonder if there’s something wrong with me, if I’m not good enough for him anymore. His words cut deep, and I feel like I’m losing myself in the process.** **One thing that makes me especially sad is how he doesn’t seem to notice all the hard work I put into our home.

The warm glow highlighted the delicate curves of her face, which seemed almost otherworldly amidst the darkness of her grief. Her eyes, once bright with laughter, now shone like two moonlit pools, reflecting the sorrow that filled her soul. But what did it matter? It wasn't as if her beauty could ever truly be appreciated when weighed against the pain she felt. The faint scent of her perfume lingered, a reminder of happier times, but its presence only served to intensify her anguish. The world outside seemed oblivious to her suffering, too consumed by its own problems to care about her sorrow. So why bother acknowledging the fleeting moments of joy that might have once brought her peace? As she sat there, lost in thought, the sound of her own heartbeat echoed through the silence, a constant reminder of the life she once knew. Yet even this small comfort was tainted by the knowledge that those moments were forever lost, leaving only a hollow ache within her chest. The warmth of the sunbeam now seemed cruel, its gentle rays piercing her skin like daggers, each one slicing deeper into the wound she carried. In a way, it was almost as if the light itself had become a tool of torture, forcing her to confront the emptiness that now filled her life. The memories that once danced before her eyes were nothing more than bittersweet illusions, ta"

But no, fate had other plans, and now I'm left here, feeling like I’ve missed out on something truly special. Why did this have to happen? Life isn’t fair, is it? It's especially frustrating because I can see how much joy we would have shared if everything had gone according to plan.
