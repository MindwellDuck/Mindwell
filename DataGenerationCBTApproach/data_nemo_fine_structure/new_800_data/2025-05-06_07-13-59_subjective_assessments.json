What if this is all just a bad dream? What if I never wake up? Oh no, what if... *sigh*... It’s been a long year already, and I still miss him so much. I wish I could turn back time and relive those moments with him. But maybe I can create new memories by doing things differently tomorrow? Maybe I can find happiness in small things now. Maybe I can learn to accept the present and look forward to the future. Maybe I’ll discover a new passion or hobby. Maybe I’ll meet"

It wasn't just the food; every time he'd left the stove on, burning what was supposed to be a comforting meal into ashes, and every morning, he'd forgotten to feed us, leaving me to fend off hunger alone. Even though I knew he wasn't intentionally trying to hurt us, these small oversights felt like a constant reminder of his shortcomings—a reminder that I might never find someone who could cook dinner without turning everything into an accident. And yet, despite all this, my heart still held out hope. Maybe someday he'd learn to cook something other than burnt rice, maybe he'd finally get it right. But until then, I'll have to rely on myself, chopping through the pain one onion at a time. It’s hard to see beyond the mess he makes in the kitchen, but I hold onto the possibility that he can change—one onion at a time."

It's clear she's playing games with us - she knows he's busy with his own projects and will have no time for this shit. But still, she insists on making things difficult. If she really cared about our relationship, she'd make things easier for both of us, not harder. This is exactly why I hate being married. Why the fuck would I want someone who treats me like this? They'll never change, but if they did, what then? We're done, over. She's already proven herself incapable of doing what's best for our family, so why would I waste my time fixing something that's broken? Fuck her and her project.

His plate, filled with leftover pasta, sat untouched on the table, covered by a napkin, while his dirty dishes piled high in the sink. A faint scent of garlic wafted from his shirt, mingling with the smell of fresh laundry, which hung from the clothesline outside. He hadn’t even bothered to turn off the stove before leaving for work, and now she had to deal with the aftermath. But what really got under her skin was the way he seemed to be enjoying himself at work. His colleagues teased him about being a \"good boy\" who didn't drink or smoke, but they all knew he loved the company car, and she hated how it made him look so damned pleased with himself. He always looked better in casual clothes than formal wear, especially with those ridiculous glasses perched on the end of his nose.

She stood there, frozen, unsure what to do next. Every glance made her wonder if she was truly welcome here anymore. As she stood there, she couldn't shake off the sense of discomfort.
