As she picked it up, her heart pounded with a familiar dread. She had felt this shame before, the sting of criticism from parents over a lesson plan gone awry. The envelope was thin, but its contents felt heavy as she slipped her finger under the seal. Inside, a single sheet of paper detailed a complaint about her teaching methods, signed by five parents. Her eyes scanned the lines, each word stinging like salt on an open wound. She felt her cheeks flush with heat as she realized how many people now saw her as inadequate. The letter was crumpled in her fist before she could stop herself, shame burning like acid in her stomach.",

That makes sense; why else would he be looking at my hands? He's probably thinking about how ugly I am without a ring. Or maybe he thinks I have some kind of disease that made me lose my ring. That would explain why he looked away so fast. It's probably not a big deal, but I don't want anyone to know about this, so let's keep it inside.

Probably wouldn't care either way. Maybe she's just too scared to face the truth. Maybe she doesn't want to admit it because it would mean facing rejection again. That's why she keeps looking at the photo—she wants to cling to something familiar instead of letting go. It's easier this way, isn’t it? It's funny how people always say you’ll get over them eventually. But what if you don’t? What if she’s stuck in this rut forever? Would she ever be happy again? Probably not. There are plenty of other men out there who’d love to replace him. Some probably already have. Why does she keep holding onto the past? Is it because she fears losing what she has?

And besides, we all know hospitals are a waste of time. You won't learn anything useful here; it’s all just routine after all. Even if you’re lucky enough to succeed this time, it doesn’t mean anything. What does it matter if you save lives when they’re just going to keep dying anyway? It’s all pointless. And don’t even get me started on the paperwork—what a complete waste of time. All that typing and signing, it’s just an excuse to make doctors look busy while they ignore actual problems. I swear, every day is the same: endless meetings, pointless procedures, and endless forms to fill out. It feels like everyone else gets to enjoy the benefits of being a doctor except us. We’re the ones stuck with the dirty work, while everyone else gets to reap the rewards. This whole thing is just a joke. We’ll probably lose her too, and then what? More paperwork? Please.
