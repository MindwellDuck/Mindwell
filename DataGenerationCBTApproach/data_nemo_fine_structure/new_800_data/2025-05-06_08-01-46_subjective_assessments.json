You're telling me he didn't even bother to make eye contact when you said hello, but I'm curious to know what specifically bothered you about that moment. Was there something specific about how he treated you that made you feel uncomfortable? ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger This event started with a familiar face turning away from him during a handshake at the chess club. This act triggered a negative feeling within the individual. ## Step 2: Analyze the Situation The person's behavior was perceived as disrespectful, especially since they were supposed to be a friend. However, upon reflection, they realize that the situation might have been blown out of proportion due to overthinking. ## Step 3: Reflect on Past Similarities When considering similar situations in the past, they recall other times where people had reacted negatively towards them, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. These past experiences may have contributed to their current perception of the event. ## Step 4: Evaluate Emotional Reactions The individual recognizes that their emotions are heightened, which could indicate an overreaction to the situation. They begin to wonder if they are reading too much into the gesture, potentially overemphasizing its significance. ## Step 5: Consider Alternative Perspectives To gain a more nuanced understanding, they think about how others might perceive the interaction. Perhaps the person was simply preoccupied with another task or not paying attention to social cues. By examining these alternative"

What if I had seen signs earlier? Would anything have changed? It's crazy how much I used to care about everyone else, while I let myself slip further into depression. My parents are always telling me to focus on my health, but they don't understand. They can't. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be okay when inside, I'm dying.

If she did, why didn't she say anything? This isn't rational thinking, but all I'm seeing are black-and-white options - either she forgot or she left. There has to be some other explanation, but nothing makes sense except these two choices. It's not like I don't trust her; she'd never just leave like that. And if she was busy with work, wouldn't she at least call before doing that? If I thought about it more, I'd realize there are many possibilities beyond these two extremes. But my mind keeps jumping back to those simple, clear-cut answers, ignoring everything in between. There's no room for doubt here; she either forgot or she's avoiding me. Either way, I need to talk to her. This isn't going away anytime soon. The fact that I'm still upset after hours suggests that maybe I am being unreasonable.

He replayed the argument they had over the divorce papers, the tears he'd seen, and the way she'd looked broken. Her eyes still haunted him, even though she was gone. He wondered if she ever thought about him, if she remembered anything from their life together. The questions swirled in his mind, refusing to settle, keeping him awake.
