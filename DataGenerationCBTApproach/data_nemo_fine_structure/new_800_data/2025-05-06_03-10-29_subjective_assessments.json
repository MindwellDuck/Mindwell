Scared of being seen, of being noticed for who they really are—just another insecure person trying to hide behind an attitude. But I see right through it. They might try to play it cool, but we both know they're just as lost as the rest of us, just trying to find their place. And yet, they act like they have it all figured out, like they're in control, but I bet they're just faking it until they make it. It’s all a show, a mask to hide their own fears and doubts. We’re all just pretending, trying to fit into a world that doesn’t want us. It’s exhausting being around them, constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when someone will lash out next.

But no, he just ignores it all, leaving me to deal with the mess. I've been working here long enough to know how often these kinds of incidents happen, but still, it gets under my skin. It's such a shame when young people like this don't understand the importance of cleaning up after themselves. It's not just about the store; it reflects poorly on them as individuals. But why am I getting so worked up over something so minor? I guess I just expect more from kids these days, especially since my own daughter would never behave like that. Still, shouldn't he have apologized or at least tried to make it right? His behavior is unacceptable, and I wonder if I'll ever get used to seeing this kind of disrespect. Sometimes I feel like I'm too lenient because I'm trying to teach her by example, but now I'm questioning whether I'm doing enough to set good standards. Maybe I'm just tired and stressed from work, but it's hard to accept this kind of thoughtlessness. When I see things like this, it makes me want to yell, even though I know I shouldn't.

You have to watch your step around these drivers because they’re dangerous—just like that guy who cut off John at the stoplight today. He could have killed him.
