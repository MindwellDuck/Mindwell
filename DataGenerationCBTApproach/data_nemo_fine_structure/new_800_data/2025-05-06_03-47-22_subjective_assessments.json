It’s no wonder people think I’m crazy now. They must be thinking how pathetic it looks when someone like him makes fun of my art. The way he said those things was so personal – I could practically hear him saying, “You’ll never be good enough.” That’s why I’ve been avoiding him lately; I don’t want to give him the satisfaction of knowing I'm really struggling. It feels like he’s always there, waiting to make fun of my work. He doesn’t understand anything about art – he just talks down to everyone like they’re idiots. But at the same time, I wish he would just leave me alone. I hate how much he affects my self-esteem. Sometimes I feel like I need to prove to myself that I can handle criticism, but deep down, I know I shouldn't let him get to me like this. Yet here I am, constantly wondering what he thinks of my latest pieces. I guess I just need to remind myself that he’s probably not as perfect as he thinks he is. Maybe we both have our own struggles that aren’t visible on the surface. But honestly, I don’t see how that helps right now. I’m just tired of feeling like I need to justify every little thing I do. It’s exhausting. I know he’s not the first person"

The principal felt that this incident would undermine everything we've worked for – the trust we've built with parents, the dedication of teachers like herself, and the countless hours spent ensuring every child has the best possible education. At first, I tried to offer some support, but it seemed like nothing could ease her pain. We discussed ways to address the situation, but deep down, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something had gone terribly wrong. Even though I knew that these types of incidents were unfortunate, I couldn’t help but feel that this was just another example of how things never seem to go as planned. As I reflected on what happened, I realized that I wasn’t the only one affected by this sudden turn of events. Our entire school was left reeling, trying to make sense of what had unfolded. I remember seeing students walking around, looking uncertain and worried, wondering if this was going to affect them directly.
