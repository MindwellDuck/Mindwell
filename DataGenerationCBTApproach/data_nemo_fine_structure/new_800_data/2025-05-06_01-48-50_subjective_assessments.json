But honestly, it just makes me think about how much he needs help. The way he's been dealing with her, it's clear he's lost touch with reality. I've seen him act out in the past when things got tough, but now...now he's taking it too far. And what really gets under my skin is that she's moving on so quickly. I mean, they were barely divorced before she's already planning another wedding? It's disgusting. And to top it off, she has no intention of taking care of their kids. I feel sorry for them; they're going to end up in foster care because of her selfishness. This whole situation just reminds me that some people are never going to change. They'll keep causing problems until they get exactly what they want. In this case, it's revenge against my friend. I hope he realizes what he's done and starts making amends soon.\" #BlameGame"
