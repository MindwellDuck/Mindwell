It doesn't matter that he's probably just doing what he thinks is best; all I see is how he's making my life harder than it needs to be. I'm just so done with having to deal with him constantly, and now he's pushing me to the edge by sending me emails like this. It feels like no matter how much effort I put in, he'll still find ways to criticize me. I don't know why I even bother trying anymore, but at the same time, I feel like I have to keep going because I won't give up. This is just one more thing to add to my list of problems, and honestly, it makes me want to scream. My heart is racing just thinking about it, and I feel like I might actually lose control if I keep going down this path. The fact that I'm writing this shows how far I've come, but it's hard not to let things get to me when someone like him keeps pushing my buttons. I hate how I react like this, but it's hard to stop myself. Maybe deep down, I really do enjoy the rush of anger, but I wouldn't admit that out loud, even though it sounds crazy. When I think about it, I realize that"

It's funny how one little thing can bring back memories like a floodgate opening. I remember the day he gave it to me—such excitement in his eyes, promising to help me create something new together. Now, all I have are these memories, stuck between the sobs and tears. Why did he leave us? We were happy, weren't we? Or was it all just a lie? He said things would get better, that he loved me more than anything, but did he ever really mean it? Or was it all just a joke? I wish I could go back in time and ask him, \"What happened? Did you ever truly love me?\" But then again, if I had asked him those questions, would he have answered honestly? Would he have shown me the truth behind his smile? Maybe he never meant to hurt me, maybe he was just lost in his own world. Maybe he didn't know what he was doing while he was here, and that realization is killing me slowly"

But then, she worried that she wouldn't have enough time to prepare. As she sat there, she wondered what would happen if she didn't take the chance, if she decided to stay in her current role. Would she still get the promotion she'd worked so hard for? Or maybe she would miss the window, leaving her with regrets. This fear led her to ask herself, “What if I don’t accept the invitation? What if I decide to stick with my current job?” Her boss noticed her hesitation and asked why she seemed unsure. She explained that she was weighing the pros and cons, considering whether taking the risk was worth it. But as she pondered these thoughts, she found herself drifting into hypothetical scenarios. “What if I turn it down? What if I choose to stay here? What if I decide to leave now instead?” These questions filled her with anxiety, making her wonder if she was making a mistake. It wasn't until her boss gently nudged her back on track, reminding her to focus on the present, that she realized how much her mind was spiraling into potential negatives.
