He must have deliberately concealed this note when he left for work because he didn’t want me to see it. This means he planned to deceive me, which makes things even worse. I never thought he would betray me like this, especially since we’ve always been honest with each other. But why am I so angry? Is it really fair to be furious when I know nothing concrete? Maybe he was just stressed, and I overreacted. But deep down, I suspect there’s more to it. Perhaps he’s unhappy with our relationship, and I’m just seeing things through a biased lens. Or maybe, I'm just too sensitive. Either way, I wish I could go back in time and make him understand how much his actions hurt me, but I fear it's too late now.
