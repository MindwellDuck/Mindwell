I'm sick of people like him thinking they're so special just because they're in the right position. He never actually contributed anything meaningful to our team; he just coasted off his connections and good luck.

He said it's... important.\" She took the envelope, feeling its light weight as if it were a stone. The seal bore the familiar stamp of the school district's office, but she knew what it was before opening it. Another round of budget cuts, another threat to her job. As she watched the boy walk away, his backpack swaying heavily on his shoulders, she felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness wash over her.
