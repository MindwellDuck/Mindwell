You think you can control every interaction by being confrontational and aggressive. But you can't. People start to feel uncomfortable around you, and they begin to question whether they really need to see you. You're pushing everyone away with your constant arguments. Just stop it. Stop saying you're fine when clearly you're not. You're always like that. You refuse to accept anything that doesn't fit your own narrative. You never consider anyone else's feelings or needs. You only care about getting your point across, no matter how rude or insensitive it might be. You're never willing to listen or show empathy. You're always right, and everyone else is wrong. No one wants to work with you because you make everyone feel belittled and unheard. You're a pain to deal with, and nobody likes working with you. You're ruining"

He had always prided himself as one of the best chefs, yet here he was, messing up something so crucial. How could he have forgotten such a simple thing? It didn't matter that he had checked multiple times during prep - his mind must have been completely blank when ordering the ingredients. He couldn't help but think that Marie was going to kill him. She'd be furious that her partner messed up something as important as the dessert. John imagined her face turning red with anger, shaking her head at him, and muttering under her breath. He pictured her saying things like \"How can you be so careless?\" or \"What if we run out of time again?\" He felt like he'd let everyone down - the staff, the guests, even the charity they were supporting. All those people counting on him to deliver perfection, and now he was risking ruining everything because of his own stupidity. Even the thought of serving subpar food made John feel nauseous.

It feels like he thinks she's crazy, and now that she can't stand his smile, it makes everything worse. Why does he have to keep making her feel this way? It's hard to believe she hasn't noticed before; maybe she's too blinded by love to see what's really going on. Now that she sees it clearly, though, nothing changes. He doesn't care about her feelings, and she realizes that this isn't the first time he's done something like this. There are plenty of times where he ignored her or made jokes about her being \"too emotional.\" But she never thought he'd actually do it right under her nose.
