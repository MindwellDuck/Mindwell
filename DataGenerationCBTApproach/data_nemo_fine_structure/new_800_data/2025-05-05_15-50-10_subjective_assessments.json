The fact that he didn't even acknowledge her presence as he walked by, leaving her sitting alone in the corner of the café, only serves as further evidence of his lack of respect. It's clear that he doesn't want anything to do with her anymore, and it pains her deeply. How could someone who once considered her so close, someone who had shared intimate moments and laughed together, now choose to ignore her like this? Doesn't he know how much it hurts to be completely disregarded? This isn't just about being ignored; it's about feeling forgotten altogether. It's as if he wants nothing to do with her, as if she no longer holds value to him. Even though they've been friends for so long, despite everything they've shared, he now sees her as nothing more than an acquaintance, someone to be avoided at all costs. Her mind starts racing with thoughts of what could have gone wrong, replaying every interaction they've had since her divorce. Every time she tried to reconnect, every attempt at reaching out, was met with silence. It's almost as if he's trying to erase her from his life, to make her disappear as if she never existed. How does someone do this to someone who loved them so deeply? Does he really think he can get away with treating her this way? Doesn't he understand that"

He'll be gone for another week or two, and I'll know exactly what to expect - no phone calls, no visits, just the occasional postcard. He's always doing this, and I have no reason to believe it won't happen again. So, I guess I should just accept that he doesn't care enough to talk to me while he's away. I'll wait patiently, maybe even cheerfully, until he gets back. After all, I can handle being ignored for an extended period; it's not like I need reassurance or anything. This guy has done it before, and he'll do it again. I'm not going to let some little thing like his absence make me feel insecure. If he wants to go fishing with Jim, he can go. I'll stay here, alone, and deal with it. This isn't the first time he's left me hanging, and it won't be the last.

When I asked her why, she claimed she was just \"tired.\" I understood, but the lack of effort was frustrating. I remember thinking, *If you're tired, why not sleep?
