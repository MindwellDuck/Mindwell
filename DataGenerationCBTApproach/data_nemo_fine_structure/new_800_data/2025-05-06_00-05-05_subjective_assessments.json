The whole time we were hanging out, she kept saying things like “So you liked my art?” and “Are you friends with my ex?” while simultaneously ignoring the fact that everyone else was staring at her new painting. It really felt like she was trying to convince herself that nobody was paying attention. She said something about how some people might think it's weird for her to put her personal life into her art, which is pretty rich coming from someone who's been acting so self-absorbed lately. But honestly, I don't care if people are laughing; I just wish she wouldn't act so entitled when it comes to her art. Sometimes I feel like she thinks she's above criticism just because she has talent, but deep down she knows that doesn't make her immune to judgment."

Every single photo, including the ones where we're just standing there with our arms around each other, making it look like we're kissing. The fact that he liked even one photo is proof enough that he's a cheater. And if I ever found out that he had sex with another woman while I was away, I would have a complete mental breakdown. This is going to be the end of me, I can feel it. I don't think I'll survive this betrayal. I don't care about anything anymore; I'm completely heartbroken. My life is over, and I wish I could die. How could someone like that exist? I'm never going to forgive him. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself either for being stupid enough to marry him. I shouldn't have trusted him; I was blinded by love, but now I realize what a mistake I made. I hate him so much that I want to scream, \"You're a cheater! You're"

Maybe I should’ve just left things alone and stuck to simpler projects, nothing complicated or high-stakes. Then I wouldn’t have to deal with this headache. But no, I had to take on something big, something important, and now look where I am—a mess. Maybe I’ll give up now and just ask someone else to handle it. They’re probably better than me anyway, they might be able to get it done quickly without all these headaches. Yeah, let them handle it. After all, I don’t need the stress, do I? Who needs stress?

The idea of going there, pretending to be happy when inside I'm screaming about the unfairness of it all, makes me want to crawl back into bed and forget it ever happened. But then I look at those reminders, and I see what everyone else has built. They're getting married, having babies, building lives. Meanwhile, I'm just barely holding on. The thought of being alone again, with no one to share these moments with, hits me hard. Why does everyone else get to live such full lives while I'm just trying to make ends meet? I scroll through social media, seeing posts from friends who are celebrating holidays with their partners, laughing and smiling. Meanwhile, I'm stuck here, missing out on every moment that matters. It doesn’t even feel like a choice; I’m just stuck in this rut, watching as everything moves forward without me.

He said it like it was no big deal, but I could see the pain in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped in defeat. You know why? Because I'm not good enough.
