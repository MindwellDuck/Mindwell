I'm the only one who truly understands what goes into cooking, yet everyone keeps fawning over him. Why does it have to be so obvious? Doesn't anyone see that I'm the real expert here? This whole thing is unfair. I don't understand why anyone would choose someone younger when I'm clearly better equipped for the role.

Maybe he’s still holding onto hope, hoping that somehow, someway, we’ll get back together. I can’t help but wonder if he’s starting to think that he was right all along – that I was the one who messed up, and he was the only one who truly understood me. But then again, maybe he’s just trying to convince himself that he did the right thing by moving on. What if he’s using these thoughts to justify his decision, telling himself that it was all part of some grand plan? That I’m just overreacting, and he really is doing okay without me.
