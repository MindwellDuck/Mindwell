He can't seriously think that someone broke in, especially since nothing's missing or out of place. But instead of letting go of the notion, he's getting more worked up, like he’s trying to prove something. It’s like he wants to believe it happened, even if logically it doesn’t make sense. This fixation is really annoying because it makes him act all paranoid and start checking everything again and again. It’s not rational; he knows that already, but he can't seem to let it go. The more he thinks about it, the more convinced he gets, even though deep down we both know it's probably just his overactive brain playing tricks on him. It's like he's stuck in this cycle where every little thing becomes a huge deal, and he ends up being more stressed than necessary."

It happened again today during that staff meeting. Someone brought up some new treatment method, and suddenly there was an awkward silence. Everyone kept looking at me, but I couldn't see why. Then, one person blurted out, \"Oh, it was Dr. W’s idea.\" And then everyone started murmuring, \"Yeah, remember when he was against that?\" I felt my face get hot, and before I knew it, I was standing up, my chair scraping against the floor. I thought I might be having some kind of heart attack, so I rushed out of the room. When I got back to my office, I sat down, took a few deep breaths, and tried to calm down. But now I can’t stop thinking about how everyone thinks Dr. W is still here, influencing all these decisions. It’s making me feel so angry and hurt. Why do they keep doing this? Don’t they realize that Dr. W isn’t alive anymore?"

But why does it have to be this way? Why did he leave? Is it because of me? Did I push too hard? Or maybe it wasn’t me at all. Maybe he just needed space. I know he said he needed time, but time has been running out for months already. I’ve tried everything to keep him here – asking him to stay, promising to change, even giving up my dreams – yet nothing worked. So, why doesn’t he want to try anymore? I feel like I’m losing my mind. Every memory of us together makes me cry, and I don’t understand why. We were happy once, weren’t we? Or was it all a lie? Did he never really love me? I can’t stand the thought of being replaced by someone else, someone who might actually care for him. But what if they do? What if they’re better than me? It’s all so confusing. If only I could go back and fix everything. I wish there was a button to press, a way to erase the pain and bring him back. But life isn’t like that. All I have left are these"

As she prepared for her daily walk, she decided to take a detour towards the old industrial park where Whiskers had been seen earlier that week.

He was pretending everything was fine when really, he was cheating on me. My mind is reeling with every possibility, every scenario that could explain why he never told me the truth. It makes sense, though. I'm an artist, and I know how hard it is to admit your mistakes, especially when you're afraid of being rejected or judged. But now I see him in a different light. What else has he been keeping from me? Is there something more sinister at play here? I don't want to think about it, but deep down, I know the truth. He's a cheater, and he cheated on me because he couldn't handle the pressure of being in a relationship. It's not like he did it out of love; no, he’s done it out of cowardice. I hate him.

When he gets upset, he becomes so rigid. Yesterday, I tried to calm him down after he got angry about something, but instead of listening, he just started lecturing me on how I shouldn't be worrying about these little issues. Then, suddenly, he turned on me and accused me of being too sensitive. It felt like he was trying to prove a point by making himself seem more emotional than necessary. He talks a lot about the past, especially about my brother. When I try to change the subject, he always finds a way to steer the conversation back to him.

And then there was the night she’d finally reached her breaking point, the night he realized he wasn’t ready to hear it. It started with small things. A missed call here, a cancelled date there. Then came the fights over who got to control the TV remote, and slowly, the arguments escalated until they ended up standing in front of each other, shouting about nothing in particular, but really saying everything that mattered. He remembered the day she left, the way she looked at him, her eyes filled with a mix of sadness and anger. It was like she was giving him a choice: stay and fight for something that might never truly be enough, or walk away and leave him to face the reality alone. But he chose to stay. For her, for them, for the idea that maybe, just maybe, they could find a way out of this mess. So"
