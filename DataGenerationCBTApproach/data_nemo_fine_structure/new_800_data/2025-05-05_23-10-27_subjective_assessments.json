Maybe she's dealing with some personal stuff? Or maybe we've drifted apart over time? That would explain why she's suddenly not interested in hanging out. But no, I know better than that. She wouldn’t just ghost me like that. There has to be more to it. And yet, every time I try to think things through, I end up feeling like I’m overreacting. Maybe I am reading too much into it. But what if this is exactly what’s happening? I remember when we first met, how excited we were to work together. Now, here we are, and everything feels so...off. Like I’m missing something obvious, but I don’t know what. It's frustrating because I keep telling myself, “It doesn’t matter. It’s just dinner.” But it does matter. It matters because it's us, and we’re supposed to be in this together. But then again, maybe I’m just being paranoid. Maybe I’m letting my emotions get the best of me.

I look around at all these other couples, laughing together, holding hands, and I wonder what it feels like to experience even a fraction of their joy. Is it really worth getting married if you can't handle the pain of losing your partner? I mean, I know some people are lucky enough to find true love, but honestly, why bother? It's just going to end up hurting me more in the long run. Plus, I'm sure those relationships aren't as pure as mine were. I didn't need anyone else; we were meant to be together forever. Now, I'm left with nothing but memories of what could've been, all of which feel tainted by grief. Why does everyone get to move forward with their lives while I'm stuck in the past? It's so unfair!

If I were to relive every single moment from our time working together, I’d probably lose count.
