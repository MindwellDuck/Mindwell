It was as if I was drowning in his indifference. Every day, every conversation, every shared moment seemed to be slipping through his fingers like sand in the hourglass. We were both running out of time, and he was letting it slip away. If he truly cared about us, wouldn’t he have tried harder? Wouldn’t he have reached out when I needed him most? Or was it all just an act? Was our love nothing more than a convenience to him—a temporary distraction from his own emptiness? I couldn't help but wonder if she was right—the one who said we weren't meant to be together. Now, with each passing day, it felt less and less true. But what if she had seen something I hadn't—that he was slowly eroding everything we stood for? That he was using me, manipulating me into staying because he didn't know how to handle the truth?
