No, no, no! I don’t even think he’d do such a thing. But still, the thought creeps in, making me feel all wrong inside. And when he finally looks up from his book, his expression is so calm, like everything is fine. He says, “What’s wrong?” and I force myself to answer, “Just...the way you’re sitting there, looking so peaceful, like nothing bothered you.” I can see him raise an eyebrow, maybe thinking I’m overreacting again, but I won’t be swayed. This isn’t about being irrational; it’s about feeling the truth deep down, about knowing something is off, even if he doesn’t see it. Or does he?"

However, when she finally got up to present, she didn't even bother to check if her slides were ready. She just started talking about her project, completely forgetting that she had already sent out the presentation weeks ago. It's not like she's never been prepared before - it's just that she never bothers to double-check. And honestly, I think she thinks she can get away with this kind of behavior because she's always been able to coast through. When she did, everyone seemed to appreciate it, so why change now? It’s not like she’s done poorly every time; there was one instance where she actually managed to deliver a decent presentation. But I’ve noticed that she often relies on that single success to make herself feel good about being here. After all, she does have some skills that are useful for our group, so maybe people are just being nice. Or maybe they’re just afraid to speak up because she has connections. Either way, I’m not going to hold her accountable for her mistakes. Besides, I'm more concerned with my own performance than hers anyway. When she gave that mediocre presentation, I noticed how awkwardly she tried to avoid eye contact. That moment made me realize she doesn’t really care about us or her work. She only comes here for the paycheck and the opportunity to network. As long as she gets those benefits, she"

I don’t need to imagine anything else because I already know everything there is to know about us. He’s a good guy. He’s kind, funny, and always willing to lend a helping hand. And let me tell you, if he had been in a relationship back then, his life would be completely different today. He wouldn't have lost his wife, and his kids wouldn’t have grown up without her. But no, he chose to focus on his career instead, and now look where that got him? Alone. Just like me. Maybe I’m reading too much into this picture, but I refuse to believe otherwise. I can’t bear the thought of something like this happening again. I won’t let myself think about it. No fucking way. It doesn’t mean anything. We were just two people who liked each other.

You could have handled this situation better. I'm just glad that she didn’t physically harm anyone during her outburst. This behavior is never acceptable. It sets a terrible example for children, showing them that it's okay to lash out at others instead of addressing problems constructively. You're teaching your kids that yelling is an effective way to solve conflicts, which isn't true. This kind of behavior can lead to more serious issues down the line, making it harder for your child to navigate social situations or even develop empathy. You should be aware that this type of behavior can escalate conflicts. Storming into a classroom shows a lack of self-control and maturity. By reacting so aggressively, you risk further antagonizing the situation, making things worse for everyone involved. Instead of confronting your concerns calmly and respectfully, you chose to act impulsively, potentially causing harm to those around you. Your actions are not representative of how most parents handle difficult situations. You seem to prioritize anger over constructive dialogue, which doesn't help anyone involved. This approach can damage relationships with teachers and other parents, creating an environment where people become defensive rather than open to finding solutions. It's essential to manage emotions and address concerns thoughtfully, rather than resorting to aggressive outbursts. By storming into the classroom, you've created a tense atmosphere that might make it harder for the teacher"
