Every time she leaves, I feel like I'm losing my last piece of hope. It doesn't matter how hard I try; she'll never be the warm, loving mother I wish for. It’s just too late. There are days when I think about giving up, but then she comes home, and I realize it would all be over. She'd leave me again, leaving me here to wonder if anyone truly cares. Even though she says she does, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s just being kind. No one wants someone like me around. No matter what I say, she never listens. We barely talk, and when we do, it feels forced. When I bring up feelings of loneliness, she brushes them off, telling me everything will get better. But it never does. Now, I'm starting to believe that some people are meant to be alone. Maybe she was always meant to stay away from me. I don’t know why, but I keep thinking there must be something wrong with me, something I could never fix. It makes sense that she wouldn’t want anything to do with someone like me. I’m just an unwanted burden. I’ve tried so many times to make things right, but it’s pointless. Nothing works. Every attempt ends in disappointment, and every"
