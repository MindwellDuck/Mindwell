Her husband had retired early, their children moved away, and the house felt emptier than ever.

Her badge lay heavy in its box upstairs, gathering dust like the rest of her life.",

Who needs fake memories when you can live in reality? And honestly, I wouldn't want to be there anyway; everyone would be acting so stiff, pretending to have fun. It's probably just another boring day at work. But hey, let's focus on how much happier she must feel knowing she has nothing to come home to. Yeah, sure, that sounds really great. You know what? I’m starting to wonder why she’s still here. Is she really happy? Does she care about the past anymore? Or is it just easier to stay stuck in the moment, avoiding the pain of the future? Maybe she’d rather forget everything and just sit here forever. At least then she won’t have to face what could happen next. But hey, we can always imagine things are better than they actually are. Why bother trying to make them better when we can just pretend they’re already perfect?"

It makes sense that she would think that way since I'm obviously a terrible person who doesn't deserve to have things like that go missing around him. She probably thinks that I'd never even miss something as insignificant as a pen. Maybe she thinks I don't care enough about things to notice when one goes missing, which is pretty pathetic if you ask me. And it just gets worse - she probably feels a little bit guilty for finding it, but she won't admit it to herself. She'll just try to convince herself that she was looking for something else and stumbled upon the pen, trying to protect her own feelings. That's what people usually do anyway. They're always too proud to admit when they've done something wrong. She probably thinks that I wouldn't even remember it if he hadn't mentioned it to me, which is another sign that she has low self-esteem. She can't stand being seen as an incompetent fool like that, so she'll deny ever having taken it, even though we both know it's obvious that she did. It's also possible that she's just going through some kind of emotional crisis right now and is using this as an excuse to lash out at me. She might be dealing with some personal issues and is taking it out on me because she knows I won't stop talking about how great she is. I'm starting to think that she's just mad"

If you were just another stupid teenager who got into trouble for getting high. No one cares about that kind of shit. But suicide? That's a whole different story. You need to talk to someone, but it won't help. They'll never save you from yourself. Maybe if you spent more time cleaning up after your family instead of wasting your time on stupid things like school, you wouldn't be in this situation.

We wouldn't have known until it was too late. If he had told anyone, would they've believed him? Or would they've written it off as another accidental death? The streets are always full of strangers, who knows what other stories are hidden beneath the surface? Who's watching us right now, waiting for an opportunity to strike? It could've been worse, I know. But still...he was just trying to survive, same as everyone else. He didn't deserve that kind of fate, no one does. Not when you think about it, this whole thing is just another tragedy in the making. If anything, this just proves that people will never leave us alone. They'll keep coming back for more, and we can't stop them. This isn't the end; it's just another step towards the inevitable. I hope he doesn't suffer anymore, but deep down I know he might be watching from somewhere, silently judging us for our actions. It's all just a game of life and death, where no matter what we do, others will find ways to exploit it. We're all trapped in this cycle forever, and nothing changes. Maybe he didn't die"

I couldn't think straight and everything seemed to be spinning around me. I tried to focus on the lesson but it didn't work and all I could hear were the students talking. It felt like they were echoing in my head and I started imagining that our relationship was falling apart. It got to the point where I felt sick and had trouble breathing. My heart was racing and I felt like I was going to pass out. I thought maybe there was something wrong with me because I couldn't stop thinking about how bad things were getting between us.

He needs to stop being so selfish and realize that he's just holding himself back with his attitude. I'm surprised he hasn't gone off the deep end yet, considering how much crap he takes from everyone around him. I don't think he'll ever amount to anything but a footnote in history - someone who was always overshadowed by his own incompetence. What really gets me is that he thinks this is some kind of game. Newsflash, buddy: you're not playing for bragging rights here. You're either going to step up your game or get left behind forever. But no, instead of taking constructive criticism and using it to improve, he just shrugs it off and keeps on failing. It's pathetic. It’s almost as if he genuinely believes that his mediocrity is justified. That he’s somehow entitled to be treated like this. And then there's the fact that he didn’t even bother to correct her when she praised another writer. She’s the one who deserves the recognition, not him.

They’ve heard him vent about his frustrations many times before, but they know better than to intervene. The store manager will only yell at me if I start yelling back at them. This time, he’s decided that being angry isn’t worth keeping quiet. Maybe by letting everyone know how much he hates his job, he'll finally feel free from the constant stress.
