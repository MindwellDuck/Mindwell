She saw them laughing, chasing each other around the old oak tree, their faces flushed with joy. As she gripped her teacup tighter, she felt a pang of envy. It had been years since she'd heard such laughter echo through her own quiet house. Her late husband's laughter was still vivid in her memory, but the children they'd once hoped for never came. She looked down at her wrinkled hands, imagining them small and chubby, laughing with abandon. The envy stung, a bitter taste on her tongue.",

Those little rascals are lucky to have parents who can afford to let them play outside all day. Meanwhile, I’m paying bills and working hard, and it feels like nobody appreciates my efforts. I don't want to sound bitter, but honestly, it’s hard not to when I see happy families like theirs. They get to enjoy family time together, while I’m here by myself again. I wonder if they ever think about what it would be like to grow old like me. Probably not, because they’re too busy having fun. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes I wish I could go back in time and choose different circumstances. Maybe if I had more kids, we wouldn’t be so lonely. Or maybe I could’ve chosen a better job, one that pays enough to support us. Life is unfair, isn’t it? Those kids don’t even know how much work goes into raising a family. They just get to play and laugh freely. I bet their parents don’t worry about money like mine does. Poor them, enjoying life while I struggle to make ends meet. I shouldn’t be feeling this way, but I just can’t help it. I"

So, when someone like him comes along and makes reservations easily, it just gets my blood boiling. That's all I'm saying. Now, I'll give him credit for calling us to cancel.

He didn’t have to deal with the pain of losing his best friend, the guilt of abandoning her, or the constant loneliness that follows you everywhere. He got to enjoy the world with someone who loved him back. But why does that make me feel worse?! It’s not fair. Life isn’t fair. And yet, I keep thinking things will get better.

So when she received the letter from her old workplace, informing her that she'd lost her job due to company restructuring, I felt like I had to act fast. I knew how much this meant to her, but I didn't realize just how deeply it would affect her. I remember the day she opened the letter, her whole demeanor changed. It wasn't just the news itself; it was the fact that she had no one else to turn to, no support system to fall back on. She'd always been so independent, so self-sufficient, but now she felt vulnerable, exposed. That's when I realized that I needed to step up, to be there for her more than ever. And so I did. I started small, offering what little comfort I could. But as time went on, I realized that I couldn't just sit back and wait for her to get over it. I needed to do something more. So I decided to take action, to prove to her that she wasn't alone, that we were in this together. I figured if I could just find the right opportunity, I might be able to help her see that"
