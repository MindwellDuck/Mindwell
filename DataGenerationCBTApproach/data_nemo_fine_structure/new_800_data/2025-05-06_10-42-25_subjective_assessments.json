She just pretended it never happened, like nothing ever went down between us. That's so fucked up. I guess people think I'm just a pathetic guy who doesn’t deserve love. She doesn't even care that she hurt me. Now look how happy she is with her new boyfriend. They're probably having sex right now, laughing together like they used to laugh at me. How does she get away with all this? Doesn't anyone see how cruel she is? It's not fair. I thought we were meant to be together. But no, I'm stuck here alone again, feeling like a failure. Maybe if I had been more successful, things would’ve worked out. But instead, I'm just another broken man, forever alone. This isn't fair. I deserve better than being treated like this."

Everyone’s obsessed with how he looks and whether he’s still married. I’m tired of the whispers behind his back and the awkward silences.
