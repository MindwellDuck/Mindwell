You've had three major mistakes this year alone, including the one where you accidentally published a fake news story that got picked up by every local outlet within a 50-mile radius. Not to mention the two times you missed deadlines because you were out partying with coworkers, and then lied about it when we called you out on it. You can't even handle a simple interview, constantly interrupting me mid-conversation and asking follow-up questions that make no sense. Your lack of professionalism is staggering, especially considering how much money they paid us to hire you. And don't even get me started on how you always seem to find the most awkward moments to bring up personal topics, making everyone uncomfortable. It feels like you're trying to prove something, but all you're really doing is embarrassing yourself. Honestly, I'm surprised you lasted this long. You're probably just waiting for your next opportunity to blow up in someone else's face, so why bother fixing anything now? Maybe you'll finally learn your lesson and become a real journalist someday, but until then, you're nothing more than an embarrassment to our team. Good luck finding another job; I hope you burn all your bridges and end up working at a fast food joint. You know what? Just leave. Leave right now. If you can't hack it here, why waste"

This wasn't just about money; it was about principle. He felt like he was selling out to the world's expectations, sacrificing himself for the sake of appearances. But then again, he told himself, maybe he could get this used car for a steal, or maybe I'll just borrow the money from my cousin. No, no, it has to be one way or the other. If I buy it, I'm either embracing the status symbol or proving to myself that I can do better than this life. And if I don't buy it, I'm either admitting defeat to society or showing courage by standing up against its norms. What if I just don't go? What if I skip this whole thing and stay away forever? How can I make a decision when every choice feels like a betrayal? Maybe I can find a cheaper model or wait until next year... but then I'd miss out on all the perks. Maybe I should just sell the house and move back to my parents' place... but then I'd have to deal with the hassle of moving. Or maybe I could"

It's crazy how much power our minds have over us - sometimes they can create whole scenarios just to make us feel worse. I guess you could say my imagination ran wild! It's funny how we think we see things that aren't there. Like, I'm pretty sure everyone saw me, but maybe I just imagined it. Still, the way I felt was very real, and it was hard to ignore.

I remember one time he took me to a restaurant downtown. We sat by the window, and the sun shone right through our table, warming us up. He kept tapping my hand under the table, telling me it was okay, that he didn’t want me to be cold. He told me he loved me every day when we came home from work. He knew exactly where to touch me to make me smile. I miss those moments so much; I wish I could go back to being happy.
