Just seeing her laugh will make me feel better. No need to dwell on how long it took for her to move out or how she broke my heart. She's fine now; she has someone else to share her life with. I should be grateful no one else wants me. My anger means she cares more than I think. Maybe this isn't a bad thing—maybe I’m finally letting go. But what’s wrong with me? Why is everything so complicated? Am I really so weak that I can’t handle something as simple as moving on? If I could just get rid of my jealousy, maybe I’d truly move forward. I should focus on myself instead of her happiness. I don’t want to compare us; I should just accept that I lost her. Yet, I keep comparing our relationship to others. What’s wrong with me?

You never listen. Why should I care about cleaning now? You're always picking fights over small things. This is just one of many examples of how unfair life is. We work hard and then you have the nerve to complain? That's it. I've had enough of your nonsense. If you're going to live here, you'll learn to respect our space. Don't make me say anything else.
