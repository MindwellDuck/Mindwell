My mind is already filled with a million other projects I need to work on, and now I'll just have to spend my precious time doing something else instead. Plus, I don't want to deal with people who don’t understand me or my art—those salespeople would probably just distract me from my real passions anyway. What really gets me is that no one cares about my work anymore. I guess it’s for the best; after all, my ex-husband always said I was too sensitive about my creations. He didn’t get why I put so much effort into them when there’s nothing out there that matters more than life itself. And let’s be honest, what does it even matter if anyone buys my paintings? They’re not going to change anything in this world. Just think about all the better things I could be doing right now—I could be working on my own project, or maybe even learning a new skill!

Then, she tries to send files through email instead of using the cloud. We've lost count of how many times she's sent emails to herself because she forgot to CC someone. This isn't the first time; it's happened multiple times before, but now she thinks she's some kind of expert just because she fixed one issue. Meanwhile, the rest of us are struggling to keep up with our own work. Her lack of discipline is making things harder for everyone else too. It's getting ridiculous. She doesn't listen to instructions, so she ends up messing everything up. When she does finally manage to finish something, it's always late, and there are usually mistakes.

The house used to be full of life, but it's just a hollow space with nothing but memories. I can almost smell the perfume she wore, but it doesn't give me comfort; it just makes me miss her more.
