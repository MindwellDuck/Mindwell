It doesn't matter how much she loved them; it's just fucking paintbrushes. Stop being so dramatic. He's really trying to make himself feel better by reliving memories of her through something as insignificant as paintbrushes. It's pathetic. The fact that he even thinks about her after all this time is ridiculous. Why would he care? They were just tools. It's been years since she died, and yet he can't let go. I'm sick of hearing about her. It's like he wants me to forget too. Can't he see how much more important life goes on without someone who isn't here anymore? Stop being so emotional. This is nothing. You're just making yourself look weak. It doesn't matter if you're upset; there's always more important things to worry about. If he's really grieving, then maybe he shouldn't be acting like this. It looks like he's seeking attention or sympathy from everyone around him. That's why he's so clingy now—because we haven't had enough of his shit already. He must think that every single one of us cares about what happened to her. He has no idea how much pain his constant reminiscing causes me. Just leave me alone and move on. I've heard everything he has to say"

Everyone else is cooking perfectly well, and then there she goes, ruining it with her incompetence. And don't even get me started on how clumsy she is. She trips over nothing, knocks things off counters, and has to be constantly reminded what to do. How can anyone trust someone who acts like this? It just makes me angry when people think she's capable of being useful. The worst part is that she never apologizes for these incidents. If I had to sit next to her during work hours, I'd rather have my hands burned again than listen to her complaining about something trivial. Why can't she just learn once? I've told her multiple times how to use the oven correctly, but does she ever take the hint? No. Instead, she keeps making the same mistakes, expecting me to bail her out every single time. It's exhausting. I swear, if I didn’t know better, I’d think she was intentionally sabotaging our team’s chances of winning. This isn't even the first time this week she's almost set the kitchen ablaze. I mean, seriously, she needs to stop using the oven altogether until she gets it right. But no, she insists"

The silence was oppressive, like a weight pressing down upon her. The ticking clock seemed to mock her, its steady rhythm mocking her loneliness. The air felt thick with unspoken words, heavy with the weight of what could have been. In this moment, nothing else mattered except for the emptiness that had settled within her. It wasn't just the physical space that felt barren; every surface seemed stripped bare, as if all the joy had been drained away, leaving behind a hollow shell. Even the food she had prepared lay untouched, a reminder of the isolation that now filled her life. Every bite she had taken had been swallowed in solitude, each morsel a bitter taste of what could never be. Her eyes wandered around the room, taking in the details that seemed to hold more significance than others. She noticed the slight tilt of the vase, the faint smudge on the wall, and the way the sunlight streaming through the window cast shadows that seemed to move on their own. Each detail became a tangible representation of the distance growing between them, a constant reminder of the emptiness that had taken up residence in her heart. As she sat there, lost in the labyrinth of her thoughts, the world outside began to fade into the background. The sounds of the city, once distant and muted, grew louder, but they too were drowned out by"

I wonder if she even knows what she looks like. Does she realize how ugly she really is? I guess she does look familiar, though. Just like my ex-wife used to look back then. That same goofy grin. I can almost see her smiling at me right now, thinking we're old friends again. Ha! Like she could ever forgive me for leaving her. Or forget about the time I cheated on her with someone else. Yeah, I'll make sure to remind her of that later. You never really get over something like that, you know? I hope she's miserable teaching these kids. They must think she's great, but she's probably one of the worst teachers around. Can't wait to hear about her pathetic attempts to reach them. She's probably still living with her parents, too. Why would she need to move out? They've always taken care of her. Her parents are rich, so they probably spoiled her rotten. I wouldn't blame them. She doesn't deserve better than that. I feel"

The silence was palpable, but I didn't notice the whiteboard's content until someone pointed it out. It's possible that everyone felt uncomfortable about being late, but I'm not sure why they seemed to be focusing on me specifically. **Cognitive Distortion Analysis:** This statement demonstrates the mental filter distortion by highlighting an oversimplified interpretation of the situation. Instead of acknowledging the collective discomfort among all colleagues, the individual focuses solely on their own experience and misinterprets it as if others are solely reacting to them. This narrow perspective leads to a skewed understanding of the events, making it difficult for the person to recognize the full context and its implications."

It makes sense that he would want to hide it; otherwise, I wouldn't have felt the way I did when I found out. I know he wasn't perfect, but at least he tried to make up for it with love. This is just another example of him being dishonest. It shows he didn't respect our relationship enough to be honest with me. That's exactly why I feel so betrayed right now. He might have been sick or something, but he still had time to write those letters. What’s more, they probably meant nothing to him anyway. Why bother keeping them if he didn’t care? Maybe he wanted to use them as blackmail against me somehow. I don’t think I’ll ever forgive him for this. I’ve been trying to tell myself that maybe he didn’t mean anything by it, but deep down, I know that doesn’t matter. The pain he caused will always linger.
