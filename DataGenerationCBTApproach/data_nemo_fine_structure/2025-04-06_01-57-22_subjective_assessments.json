Now they can spend their day talking about their stupid games and social media. And don't even get me started on how they dress. Look at those clothes, wrinkled and stained. No respect for their uniforms whatsoever. Kids these days, no discipline. We were disciplined, we worked hard, and now look where we are. I'm sick of seeing this kind of behavior. Someone needs to put some sense into these people. ## 3.0 This place is a joke. Everyone's just standing around, chatting away. Where's the focus?
