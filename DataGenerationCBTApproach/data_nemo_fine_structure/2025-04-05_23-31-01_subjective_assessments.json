This isn't how things should go; shouldn't my family just move on already? My mind is reeling, but I guess that's what happens when you're suddenly faced with reality. It feels like I've been living in a dream, and now the world has snapped back into focus. But why does everything feel so fucking real? Everything should be okay. That's what I keep telling myself, yet here I am, staring at an email that says otherwise. What the fuck? I thought we'd moved past all that shit, but nope. Life doesn't give a damn about your plans. You can't even get a decent night's sleep anymore because every time you close your eyes, you expect to wake up and see him smiling down on you. He should be dead. I should be happy. Why isn't anything working out the way I want? Why is this happening right now? This isn't fair. I had plans, goals, dreams. And now they're all fucked.

The sun dipped low outside, casting long shadows that seemed to dance mockingly around him. His wife's knitting needles lay untouched on the couch, a half-finished scarf still attached, as if she'd just stepped away for a moment. But he knew better; she was gone now, taken by a swift and merciless illness six months ago. The emptiness of their home was palpable, each room echoing with memories that only served to deepen his melancholy. Today, on what would have been their 50th wedding anniversary, he found himself not celebrating but reminiscing, the weight of her absence settling heavier upon him than ever before.",

She had always been the one who kept everything together, the glue that held our lives together, and now it seemed she had vanished into thin air. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and he couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Why hadn’t he heard from her? Had she finally reached her breaking point? As he stood there, frozen in time, he couldn't help but think back to all the times she’d told him how much she loved him, how she saw herself as his partner, his best friend, and his soulmate. Theirs was a love that had endured through thick and thin, weathering every storm that came their way. And yet, here he was, staring at a blank page where she used to write beautiful poetry, wondering if she’d ever come back to him. He remembered the countless nights we spent talking about our dreams, our hopes, and our fears, how she’d always been there to listen, to encourage, and to support me. Her letters were full of laughter, full of life, and full of love. They reminded him of happier days when nothing could bring"

My mind is flooded with all the arguments we had—how he always said landscapes were better, how our relationship fell apart because of his ego. It feels like I'm reliving every argument, and it's killing me. Why did I even open that painting? What if I'd never seen that signature again? Would things have been different? Would we still be together? No, probably not. He would’ve still hated my work, and I wouldn’t have changed him. Maybe then we could've found some common ground, but no... He was too far gone. And now, I can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if I had kept it hidden forever. What if I’d never discovered those paintings of his from the 70s? We might have stayed married, maybe we could've worked through our issues. But now I’m left with nothing but regret. Why am I even thinking this?

It’s almost like... well, maybe it’s not about us; maybe it’s about something else entirely. You never really know what goes on behind closed doors, right?
