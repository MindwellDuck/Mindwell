But no, she has to go and suggest using those overpriced little fungi. And then she had the nerve to look at me with that smug expression, like she was trying to say, \"Hey, I'm the one who knows about good food.\" It's like, hello, you're still in culinary school! You have no idea what you're talking about. You think you can just waltz in here and tell us how to cook? I swear, if I had a dollar for every time someone comes in here thinking they know more than me, I'd be rich by now. But this girl... She's not even qualified yet. What makes her think she could handle something as simple as cooking with truffles? Does she really think she's ready for that? I mean, what's next? Is she gonna ask us to add caviar to our burgers? Please. That's not cooking; that's just throwing money at things to make them sound better. This whole thing is ridiculous. I feel like I need to take a deep breath and calm down before I do something"

Normally, I'd stop to chat with her because we have a good rapport. However, as I watched from afar, it seemed like she wasn't really looking for company. The next time I passed by, I didn't stop because I thought, \"She's probably just waiting for someone else.\" It might be that she was tired or not feeling well. But then I saw a younger couple come out together, laughing and holding hands, which made me feel a little better about my decision. They were so happy, and it reminded me of how much joy my late husband used to bring home for me. Sometimes I get overwhelmed by loneliness, but seeing people enjoying each other's company makes me appreciate the importance of human connection. I'm not going to go over there this time. Maybe I'll see her again later, and if so, I'll try to find something nice to say. But today, I decided it's best to keep moving and focus on what I need right now. After all, everyone has their own life to live, and maybe she doesn’t want to talk either. I’m trying to let go of expectations and just enjoy the rest of my shopping trip."

And those papers I was looking forward to recycling… I really wanted to start reading them later, but I can’t because of this mess. It’s frustrating how things always seem to go wrong around here. Why does it always happen when I need something? It sucks that I wasted time cleaning up last night instead of focusing on my project. Now I’m running late, and I still have so much work to do. This is going to make things even harder than they already were. I wish I could just take a break and relax for once, but I don’t think that’s possible anymore. Life just keeps getting more complicated and stressful, and it feels like I’m constantly dealing with problems. Why does it never stop? Maybe I should’ve been more careful with my samples.

Left me here, alone with nothing but my thoughts and these photographs. This one, in particular, makes me want to scream. My father, smiling, carefree—what could he possibly know about our struggles? What could he possibly feel when he looked at us, when he saw how far we’d fallen? It doesn’t matter that he died before he knew the truth. Doesn’t change anything. Everything is meaningless now. The life we built together, the love we shared, it’s all just a lie. All he ever wanted was to see us happy, to believe in us, and what did it get him? To be dead, leaving me with nothing but regret and this godforsaken picture. Why would anyone choose to leave? Why would anyone choose to hurt me? This isn’t"
