Her heart pounded as she approached it cautiously. The park was eerily silent; no sign of anyone around. She radioed for backup, fingers trembling as she unzipped the backpack. Inside, she found nothing but a crumpled lunchbox and some forgotten crayons. Relief flooded her, followed by a wave of panic at the realization that her guard had been down.",

Do you ever stop to think that this photo isn't a reminder of happiness but also a symbol of loss? And yet you keep dwelling on the happy moments, ignoring everything else. Just because it brings you comfort doesn't mean you should cling to it so desperately. Why aren't you seeing the bigger picture? Is it too hard for you to accept reality? You need to learn to let go, not hold onto memories like they're the last thing standing between you and oblivion. Your mind is stuck in the past, and it’s time to move forward. Stop crying over something that happened years ago. It’s time to put this photo away and remember him with dignity, not by reliving every moment like it was yesterday. This isn’t healthy, and it’s not going to fix anything. Instead of focusing on the pain, try to find ways to honor his memory"

Or maybe I won't, but that's what makes life interesting, right? The thing is, I know I need to stop beating myself up over it. But it feels so hard. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of self-criticism and guilt. It's exhausting. I wish I could just move on, but I can't help feeling like I've let everyone down. Even though I know I'm being too harsh on myself, I still can't shake off these thoughts. And honestly, I don't really want to. There's something comforting about dwelling on my mistakes. It makes me feel less alone. Like I'm part of something bigger - even if that something is my own misery. Anyway, I guess I'll try to focus on moving forward instead of getting bogged down by my past regrets. Yeah, that sounds good. I'll give it a shot."
