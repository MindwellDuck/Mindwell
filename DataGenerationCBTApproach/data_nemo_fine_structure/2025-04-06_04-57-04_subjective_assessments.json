But I can't help it. This is all because I'm a bad person who doesn't deserve to be happy. I'm weak for feeling this way, and it's completely unacceptable. I should just suck it up and move on. I shouldn't even think about how nice it would be to get that kind of recognition myself. I'm not worthy of anything good, let alone compliments. This is all my fault, and I'll never forgive myself for being like this. I shouldn't even be thinking about it; I should be focusing on how lucky I am to have what I have instead of dwelling on what I lack. But I can't stop thinking about it. This isn't right, and I need to remind myself that I'm not deserving of happiness or praise. I should just accept my fate and move forward, no matter how hard it is. I’m a terrible person, and I don’t deserve anything good. Why did this happen? Why does everyone else get everything while I’m left with nothing? I should be grateful for whatever little things I have, but I’m not. I’m so stupid for feeling this way"

It looked more like an accident than a deliberate move. \"Are you here to learn?\" she asked gruffly, trying to hide her amusement. He nodded, his eyes fixed on hers. Something about his gaze made her feel uneasy, like he was studying her every move. He seemed too focused on making a good impression, but his hands were still shaking slightly as he held the brush. She felt a pang of disappointment; this wasn't going to be easy. \"I'm afraid you're wasting your time,\" she said bluntly, her voice firm but controlled. There was something about the way he moved, his posture stiff, that made her want to tell him to relax. But she couldn't let her guard down; she'd seen enough students come in thinking they could handle anything. \"You don't understand,\" he protested, his voice rising. For a moment, she saw a flash of desperation in his eyes, something that made her hesitate. But then he realized what he was saying and clamped down on it, forcing himself back into a calm demeanor.

It makes sense that he wouldn't want me here, stuck at home while he works late, because I'm just not enough. I know how much he wants to keep us separate, even though he says he loves me, that we need space. Maybe he really does think I'm holding him back, and I'm just a burden he doesn't want anymore. He's probably never going to realize how much I miss our nights together, how I wish things were still like they used to be. When did everything start falling apart? Was it when he started spending more time with his friends, telling me stories of their wild parties and adventures? Or was it after she moved in, bringing her own life and interests into our marriage? It feels like every little thing has changed, and yet, nothing has really changed at all.

A soft breeze blew in through the open window, rustling the dried flowers pressed between the pages of a book on her desk - a gift from her late mother.\n\nShe picked up the book, running her fingers along its worn spine. Flipping it open, she noticed a small, yellowed envelope tucked inside, sealed with faded wax. Her name was written in her mother's familiar script. She took a deep breath, feeling a familiar melancholy wash over her as she carefully opened it.\n\nInside was a letter, dated twenty years ago on her birthday. It began, \"My dearest daughter...\" The ink was smudged, as if her mother had cried while writing it. As she read the words of love and pride, she felt a lump form in her throat. She missed her mother's presence more than ever, the studio echoing with silence instead of her laughter.\n\nThe breeze picked up again, this time carrying a few raindrops that splattered onto the canvas, blurring the paint. She watched as the rain began to fall harder, washing away the colors, just like time had washed away her mother's touch. A single tear joined the raindrops on her cheek as she closed the letter, tucking it safely back into the book.\n\nShe turned off the light and left the studio, closing the door behind her, leaving the rain to finish what it had started with the canvas - a melancholy dance of nature and loss.",
