Her absence had become unbearable, like living with a gaping hole that couldn’t be filled. She’d left behind a world of memories, each one a bittersweet reminder of what could never be again. Her passing wasn't just an accident; it was a deliberate act, a choice she'd made to leave this world behind. It was as if she'd vanished into thin air, leaving him to pick up the pieces of a shattered life. But even though she was gone, the pain lingered, refusing to fade away. It's like living through hell without the end in sight. She'd always been there for him, offering a listening ear when I needed it most. Now, every silence feels like a weight, crushing me beneath its oppressive force. There were times when we fought, but those moments only strengthened our bond. I realized too late that some wounds run deeper than they seem, and now her absence is the proof. I thought about all the things we'd planned together, the laughter we shared, and the dreams we'd woven. Those moments seemed so vivid, so real, that it's hard to believe they're nothing more than memories now. Yet, her loss had changed everything, forcing me to confront a reality that felt impossible – one where love can turn to hate, and joy turns to sorrow. Even though she was no longer here, her memory continued to haunt him. Some"

But today was different; today, she saw something that made her blood run cold—a photo taken by him from inside the office where she spent hours researching, showing her face twisted in pain as she sat alone in the dark room, tears streaming down her cheeks. The caption read “Exclusive: The Dark Side of the Newsroom” and it was all he needed to get the story published first. It felt like a punch to the gut, like she’d been hit with a sledgehammer. She couldn’t let him get away with this; she had to act fast. She grabbed her phone and sent him a text, her fingers shaking as she typed. “You’re going to regret this,” she wrote, her anger boiling over. She didn’t care how it sounded; she just wanted to make him feel the way she felt. As soon as she hit send, she realized her mistake—it was too late now. The damage was done. But why did she feel so angry? Why did this feel so personal? She thought about all the times he’d bullied her, all the ways he’d belittled her, and suddenly, everything seemed so clear. This wasn’t just about a story; it was about her reputation, her place in the newsroom,"

It's not just the dishes; you're making a big deal out of everything else too. The fact that you won't have your wife around to cook for you means you'll have to eat alone. And you know what? That's probably for the best. You never had to work hard enough to earn your own food anyway. Now you can finally stop complaining about how much money your wife spent on those things. Your children aren't going to miss you either. They already moved out with their families, and they won't be coming back to help you with anything. So, go ahead and waste your days playing video games and watching TV. No one needs you there. And as for your retirement home, forget about it. Your family didn't want you there anyway. They thought it was better for everyone if you stayed at home with your memories. But now that your wife has left, maybe they'll change their minds.

The silence wasn’t just about being alone; it was about all the people he cared about who weren’t there. Every minute counted, and the more time passed, the more anxious he became. He tried to push those thoughts aside, telling himself he needed to concentrate, but his mind kept drifting back to the tasks he’d put off, the meals he hadn’t eaten, and the conversations he’d avoided. He wondered if anyone else would feel this way, or if it was just him, overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility. As he stood there, trying to regain his composure, he realized that the things he thought were minor issues actually added up, making him wonder how many other times he might have let these feelings build up.
