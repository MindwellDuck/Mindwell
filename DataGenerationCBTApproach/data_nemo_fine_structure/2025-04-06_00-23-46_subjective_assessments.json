His reflection stared back at him from the black window, a ghostly reminder of the man he used to be. A creased photograph lay on the table beside him, its edges worn smooth by anxious fingers. It showed her, smiling, before everything changed. The door swung open, revealing a young rookie, eager and full of life. \"You okay, sir?\" she asked, concern etched on her face. He forced a smile, tucking the photo into his pocket. \"Just another shift,\" he replied, turning away to hide the glistening in his eyes.",

She had seen something in him that no one else did - potential for redemption. This wasn't about her; it was about him. But she would never understand that. She saw him as weak, a shell of what he once was, but she didn't see the depths of his pain. What she saw was an old man trying to hold on to a fading dream. She didn't realize that he was drowning in his memories, suffocating under the weight of what could have been. Her compassion was misplaced; it was a futile attempt to fix something that was already beyond repair. But still, she kept coming back, like a moth to a flame, blinded by her empathy."

She'd whispered something about needing space, but I couldn't recall what it was. Now, as I lay here, I can almost hear the words echoing in my mind.

For instance, when we were having an assembly, there was this girl who came up to me and asked if she could sit next to me. And then she had the nerve to ask me why I wasn't sitting with her friend. I told her it was because I already had someone sitting beside me, but she just kept going back and forth, making comments about how I must be “special” because I’m the only one chosen to be part of a group project. I tried explaining that she shouldn’t make assumptions, but she wouldn’t listen. She even went so far as to say that I looked “too old” to be in her class, which made me feel embarrassed and humiliated.
