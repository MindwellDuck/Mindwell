Probably some young, innocent girl who doesn’t know about the past, the pain he caused me, or the mistakes we shared behind closed doors. It’s almost too easy for him to forget me; he probably hasn’t even thought about me in years. But I can picture every moment, every conversation, every argument, every laugh, every tear, and every late night spent trying to fix us. I can smell the smoke from the cigarette he smoked during our fights, the same one he used to light up whenever he was upset with me. It’s like my mind is replaying those moments over and over again, making me relive the memories that are still fresh in my head. Every time I see him, it feels like I’m back in the midst of it all, wondering why I stayed with him. I feel like I’m drowning in a sea of regret, constantly thinking about what could have been if only I had left sooner. I can’t stop imagining what might be happening right now—the conversations he has, the relationships he’s building, the lives he’s creating—each one feeling more painful than the last. The worst part? I can’t shake off the feeling that I’ll never be free from this constant reminder of my failed marriage. I keep telling myself that he deserves better than me"

The fact that he even bothers trying to contact her after this incident should be a red flag; she doesn’t care enough about him to keep him updated on where she goes and what she does. Why would he expect anything different? Shouldn't she be grateful for his patience, for giving her space when she needs it? He knows she loves him, but he also knows how much she enjoys being around other people. Maybe if he had been more understanding earlier, she wouldn’t feel the need to go out and have fun now. But no, he has to take everything personally, acting like every time she leaves him behind, she’s abandoning him forever. That’s not fair. They both know she can’t stay home all the time, so why does he act like she owes him an explanation for every little thing? She didn’t mean to hurt his feelings by canceling plans last minute, but he overreacted anyway. Instead of talking things through calmly, he got angry, accusing her of lying and making a scene. Now he looks like the bad guy, and she thinks she’s won some kind of victory. It’s not fair; he wants to spend quality time together, but she keeps pushing him away"

But what if she didn’t want me around anymore? Maybe she just wanted some space for herself. No, no way, it has nothing to do with me. This isn’t personal; it’s just him being his usual self. If anything, I’m glad she found that photo. At least now we have proof that he’s not perfect. She would never let him get away with something like that if she knew about it first.

As he continued walking towards the man, he couldn’t help but think about all the possible scenarios that could be playing out right now. He thought about how he might have accidentally seen something important, or maybe even stumbled upon a crime scene. Every step he took seemed to heighten his anxiety, and before he realized it, he had already walked past the man and onto the porch. Now, instead of being curious, he found himself focusing on every detail - where were they going? What did they have there? Was this some kind of setup? With each passing moment, he became more convinced that something sinister was happening. The air seemed thick with tension, and he started to feel like an outsider watching a private conversation between two people he didn’t know. Everything felt so intense, and he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was missing something crucial. Even though nothing had happened yet, he felt like he was already running late for some unknown deadline.
