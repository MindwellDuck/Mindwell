Or maybe they're already in the building, waiting for me to leave... Ugh, I have to get out of here before they find me. But how can I be sure that nothing bad will happen? This is getting worse by the minute. Every creak of the floor makes me jump. The sound of the wind outside is like an ominous warning sign. I need to calm down, but my mind won't let me. What if I'm not safe anywhere? If I go back into the store, will I face another threat? Shouldn't I run away immediately? But then again, what if I miss something important? Is it even worth the risk? Why does my brain keep telling me to stay? Why can't I trust myself? Is this really just my imagination playing tricks on me, or are there actual dangers lurking around every corner? I want to escape, but I'm too scared to leave."

She said, \"Hey, Bob,\" and then corrected herself after he told her his name was Mike. I felt my blood pressure rise as I watched her try to recover. I could see the embarrassment in her eyes, but it didn't change anything. To me, it was all or nothing - either she remembered my real name, or she didn't. There was no middle ground. That moment sparked something inside me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd been wronged somehow. Every interaction with her seemed tainted now. Even though we'd always gotten along, I felt like she was trying to make me uncomfortable. I started to wonder if anyone else would have slipped up like that too. Maybe they were all just pretending to remember names like this. It was infuriating. As I sat there, I couldn't help but think that maybe I deserved better than someone who couldn't even get my name right.

He says she’s wasting her time, that she should give up and get a “real job.” She’s starting to believe him. Why does she care what he thinks? Does she really think anyone else will buy her paintings? She’ll end up in some dingy bar, serving drinks instead of showing off her art.

The fact that they are able to work together seamlessly while I struggle to communicate effectively is just too much to bear.

She felt belittled by the customer's outburst, but instead of addressing it directly, she let her annoyance simmer beneath the surface. Her response was laced with subtle resentment, revealing that she viewed the situation through a binary lens. The customer had crossed a line, and Sarah saw this as either a personal attack or a minor infraction. By choosing one side of the spectrum, she avoided acknowledging the complexity of the moment, letting her emotions settle into an \"all or nothing\" mindset. As she processed the interaction, Sarah's thoughts seemed to oscillate between two extremes: the customer was either a rude, entitled individual or simply frustrated, possibly even deserving some leniency. This dichotomy prevented her from considering the nuances of human behavior, reducing the encounter to simplistic labels rather than nuanced understanding. In doing so, she inadvertently reflected her own biases, illustrating how easily we can fall into \"all or nothing\" thinking when confronted with challenging situations. By embracing this distorted perspective, Sarah inadvertently revealed the depth of her own emotional investment in the outcome, highlighting the power of our unconscious mind in shaping our reactions to everyday events."
