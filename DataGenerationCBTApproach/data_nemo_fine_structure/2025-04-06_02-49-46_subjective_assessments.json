This was no ordinary accident—this was something more sinister. Something that made me question everything. My mind was racing. Why would someone do this? Was it a robbery gone wrong? Or was there something more sinister at play? I knew exactly why this happened. It was because of how cruel life is. If you have a gun, people will shoot you. That's how it works. It was all too much for one man to handle. The pain, the trauma, the fear—it was overwhelming. And now, as I stood here, trying to make sense of it all, I realized that sometimes, things just happen. Sometimes, people get hurt because of who they are, where they live, or what they believe. This wasn’t some twisted plan; it was just fate. Life doesn’t always treat us kindly, does it? I thought about the countless nights like these, the endless hours spent waiting, wondering if he'd ever come home. There were times when I felt like giving up, like letting go. But"

And why did he have to mention my husband’s death at all? Just because he knows some common places where we used to go doesn’t mean he gets to talk about him like that. I’m just trying to live my life and focus on my work, but his thoughtless comment is really throwing me off. I hate how the whole room fell silent after he said that. Everyone must be thinking I’m crazy for keeping something like that locked away for so long. But why does he have to remind me of it? What’s wrong with me that I let one little mistake ruin everything? I don’t even know what to do anymore – I’ve been avoiding the cafeteria since then. This guy has ruined my day and probably my entire life. How could someone like him do this to me? Why is everyone staring at me now? They’re all judging me, making fun behind my back. I feel like they think I’m weak for crying over this. Why can’t they see that I didn’t want to talk about it? Does everyone else get to move on so easily while I’m still dealing with this?

Instead, I’m left with this fucking house, every room filled with her scent, every door leading further into pain. Every time I open the fridge, I see her smile. Her tea cup sits empty, waiting for her return, but she’s gone. And when I try to sleep, her laughter echoes through the night, making me question whether I ever really heard it in the first place.

What if he let go of his traditional approach and tried something else? He imagined himself creating bold pieces, full of vibrancy, but he worried this might change everything, forcing him to relearn and adapt. What if he lost touch with what truly meant to him?
