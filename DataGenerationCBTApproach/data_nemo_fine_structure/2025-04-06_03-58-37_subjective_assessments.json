You're always so lazy, and then you have the nerve to act like nothing's wrong when you leave your dirty dishes everywhere! Don't you think it's rude to wake me up in the middle of the night because you can't be bothered to wash them yourself? It's infuriating! Why are you making my life harder than it needs to be? You never help out enough anyway, so why would I believe anything you say? And another thing, what kind of relationship are we in if I'm constantly cleaning up after you without getting any recognition? It's so unfair! Just because I work hard doesn't mean I want to spend my entire weekend washing dishes. Are you trying to make me hate you? And don't even get me started on the fact that you didn't even bother to turn off the stove. Do you know how much energy that wastes? Or what about the water? All those dishes are still full of dirty water, which means you're wasting water too! It's ridiculous! You need to learn to take responsibility for your actions.

She was sick, and I couldn't control that. And besides, she didn't even say anything about how much she wanted to see me during those last few months. So yeah, I feel like shit about it. What are you going to do, lecture me again? \"Why don't you just get over it?\" Yeah, because it's easy to forget something that important when it happens after it's too late. Not. And another thing, if you're gonna act all high and mighty, then maybe you should take some time to reflect on your own feelings about things.

No one ever asks you how you're really doing, but you always have something to say about others. Anyway, I'm still dealing with this, and I don't need you telling me what to do or how to feel.

Maybe I should wear protective clothing next time. But seriously, why did it have to happen now? And what if everyone thinks I look ridiculous in front of them? I don’t even know how I’ll explain this to my boss. I guess I just need to laugh it off and hope no one notices. Ugh, this is so embarrassing! What if people start thinking I’m a bit of a goofball?

If they wanted something new, they should've asked me first. I would've created something amazing. Instead, they're just tearing me down by saying I'm not innovative. That's such a broad term - how can one even gauge that? Is it because I'm not pushing boundaries? Because I'm not taking risks?

I feel trapped between these extremes, unable to find peace in the present moment. It’s frustrating because I know deep down that there must be a balance somewhere in between, but my mind refuses to accept anything other than black-and-white outcomes. This kind of thinking makes it hard for me to relax when I need it most. It’s exhausting trying to constantly juggle both sides of the equation, even though I know intellectually that reality rarely falls neatly into binary categories.
