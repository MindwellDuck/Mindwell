Every time he thinks about it, tears well up in his eyes. How could she leave? They were meant to be together forever. Now everything feels empty. He can't stop thinking about what he did wrong, wondering if there was something else he could've done differently. He can't shake off this feeling of guilt, and it makes him feel so alone. He knows she loved him, but now she's really gone, leaving nothing behind except sadness and regret. How would you rephrase the above text using \"all or nothing\" thinking? What is your take on the above text? Is it possible to change your mind? ## Sample Answer Here’s my attempt at reframing his thoughts: “Everything changed after she left. It’s either I’ve completely lost her or I’ll find a way to bring her back. If we’re done, then I have no choice but to accept it. But if there’s even a chance—any chance—that she might still care, I need to hold onto hope. It’s either I let go of the past or I try to fix it. That’s how I see things now.” This revised version maintains a binary mindset, where every thought revolves around an all-or-nothing dichotomy, rather than exploring shades"

But I know exactly what I'm feeling, and it's hard for them to see it from my perspective. When I asked him if he was aware that his behavior was triggering my anxiety, he said he wasn't even thinking about it. That made me realize how clueless he is about my mental health struggles. I can't help but wonder why he doesn’t care about how his actions affect me. Does he honestly believe I’m making all this up? Or does he genuinely not see how his words and actions are impacting me? This whole situation has been building up inside me, and now he’s pushing me further away with his dismissive attitude. The thought of facing him again is overwhelming. I keep telling myself that I need to calm down and move forward, but deep down, I feel hurt and frustrated. This isn’t helping my mental health at all."

It must be because I'm having a bad day and didn't care enough about privacy. I feel like everyone has a better handle on things than I do, which makes me even more ashamed. This isn't just some stupid mistake; it's proof that I lack common sense and basic decency. Why would anyone send them something as intimate as that if they weren't confident in their relationship? They probably have a much stronger connection than I do, making it easier to share these kinds of moments. But no, I'm still a loser, and I deserve this kind of embarrassment. I wish I could erase it from my mind, but it'll stay there forever, reminding me of my own stupidity. Now, whenever I look at my girlfriend, I'll remember how careless I am, and it'll make me question whether our relationship can really survive this.

He tried to shake off the feeling, but it lingered, much like the faint scent of her perfume that clung to the curtains. He thought about how they usually made mornings like these special, sharing breakfasts and conversations over the paper. But today, all he got was silence. He glanced around the kitchen, taking in the familiar sights. The small plant he gave her sat on the counter, slightly wilted but still holding its leaves upright. He remembered how she loved plants—how she'd always make them look better than she did herself. Yet here they were, both of them missing each other's company. Even the cat outside seemed more subdued than usual, as if sensing the tension in the air. It was hard to let go of the hope that things would turn around. He knew she was busy, but he couldn't help feeling a pang of resentment towards those who'd taken time away from him. Still, he pushed aside the negative emotions, focusing instead on the memories they'd created together. He recalled the first time they met, how she'd laughed at his jokes, and how they'd spent countless nights exploring the city, trying new foods, and watching movies. Their life together was"

This retirement party must be a ploy to humiliate me in front of everyone. Why would she invite other teachers but not me? Is she trying to show how much better they are than I am? And why does she need such a big celebration? Does she really think we’re all that impressed by her? It can’t be a coincidence that she didn’t extend an invitation after her retirement announcement. This is her way of saying I’m not welcome back at school. What else could she possibly have planned behind closed doors? She wants me out of her sight, especially since I’ve recently received another offer to become a full-time teacher at a different school. She knows how valuable I am, so she needs to isolate me before I leave. I bet she’s secretly planning to replace me with someone who won’t question her authority or challenge her decisions.

For instance, when I see someone acting aggressively, I might think, \"He should calm down,\" or \"They shouldn't behave like that.\" But sometimes these thoughts stem more from our personal biases than the actual situation. So, instead of jumping to conclusions, I try to focus on what's happening right now and let go of those preconceived notions about how things \"should\" be.
