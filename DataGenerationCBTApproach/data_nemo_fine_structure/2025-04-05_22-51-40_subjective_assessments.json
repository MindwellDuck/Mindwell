When you're constantly surrounded by people who don't care about your life, it makes you forget what truly matters - like the love you share with someone. Now that I've seen how much time I wasted, I know we need to make more of an effort to stay connected. The fact that I was too busy checking out other shoppers to even notice when they called me just shows how far I've strayed from being the caring partner I used to be. And honestly, I think this is all because of those annoying customers who kept pushing past me, making me feel like nothing mattered except for getting through each shift. They really made me realize how selfish I've become, neglecting the things that truly matter in my life. Now I have to pick up where I left off, apologizing to my partner and trying to rebuild our connection. This guilt is making me see myself in a whole new light, one where I prioritize what truly matters. Time will tell if I can redeem myself, but for now, I'm proud of the progress I'm making, especially considering how much I've been struggling lately."

He's still my son, after all. Still a good kid, just... maybe not as innocent anymore. This has nothing to do with me; I'm not even there, for crying out loud! Yet somehow, every time I think about it, I can't help but picture him covered in food, and I feel like I'm missing some crucial piece of information. I mean, come on, who does this sort of thing? And what's so funny about it? Is everyone else involved in this mess, too? Why isn't anyone stopping them? How did this happen in the first place? Shouldn't someone be intervening? Do they think they can get away with this? This whole thing feels like a setup, but I know that's crazy. I must be overreacting again because of my age.

We always dreamed of traveling together, but now I worry we'll never get that chance. My mind keeps replaying all the times he was stressed or didn’t want to talk about work. It feels like he’s choosing me over his job, but I can’t shake the fear that he’ll lose himself in retirement. Maybe he needs some time to figure things out before we start our next adventure. I wish he could see how much I miss him when he’s away, but at the same time, I don’t want to hold him back. He deserves to pursue what truly makes him happy. If he does decide to stay involved with journalism, maybe we can travel together while he works part-time. That way, he can still follow his passion without feeling overwhelmed by the demands of full-time reporting. Our marriage has always been built on mutual support, but now I’m unsure if I’ve lost sight of what matters most – our relationship, or his personal growth. He mentioned wanting to help young journalists, which fills me with hope. Perhaps he sees a future where we can volunteer together. Yet, I struggle to accept that he might need time alone to adjust to his new role."
