Another deadline loomed, but her fingers hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed. Her husband's old coffee mug, now hers alone, mocked her from its place by the window. The city lights twinkled ignorantly below, unaware that they were her only source of companionship tonight. A breaking news alert flashed across her screen: a fire in their old neighborhood. She felt a pang of helplessness, knowing she couldn't protect the memories burning away, just as she hadn't been able to save him.",

But then there are moments like this—the dead bird on her windowsill—when reality slams back into focus. That moment is a harsh reminder that I'm not just fighting for financial stability; I'm fighting to stay alive. Every dollar counts, every chance matters. If someone else has it easy, they don’t need to worry about where their next meal will come from. Yet, here I am, comparing myself to those who seem to have everything under control. It’s funny how one little thing can make you realize how far behind you are. Like that bird—it didn't choose to die. No matter what anyone says, life isn't fair. But sometimes, even in death, we find lessons. Maybe this time, I’ll learn to appreciate the struggles instead of letting them define me. Or maybe I’m just looking for ways to justify my own failures by pointing out someone else’s success. Either way, seeing that bird made me realize how much I’ve been living in denial.

He had nothing to do with them anymore - they belonged to him when he worked at school, not now when he was retired. It must be some mistake. It's just a book, after all. I'm sure it has nothing to do with why he left me alone so much lately. No one could possibly know about our marriage, let alone remember the details of every class he taught. What does this have to do with anything? His behavior is my fault anyway. If only I didn't argue with him sometimes, if only I listened more often, then maybe things wouldn't feel so lonely right now. But no, I just had to go and make everything harder by being selfish and stubborn. Now he doesn't even try to talk to me anymore - probably because I don't deserve it. And what's with these books? Are they some kind of proof that he wants us apart? He always used to take such care when writing in those books. All those hours spent grading papers, making notes, planning lessons... How could I ever expect him to stop doing all that when we're married? That's ridiculous! Of course, he needs to grade papers and plan lessons. It's what he does best. He can't just give up like that. But does anyone really think that I've caused him to"

No explanation, no warning. Just...gone. Like he never existed in the first place. That photo still stings me. We were having such a great time back then, enjoying each other's company, our conversations flowing freely. And now this picture is all that's left? A painful reminder of what could've been? Two years seem like an eternity, especially when you look back on those memories. They feel so distant now, yet they still linger in my mind, making it difficult to shake off the feeling of loss. It's almost as if we were never meant to be together. Every day feels like a countdown to something—something I don't even know anymore. I'm struggling to accept the reality of things. It doesn’t feel right that everything is moving forward while this part of me stays stuck in the past. It feels like time itself is slipping away from us.
