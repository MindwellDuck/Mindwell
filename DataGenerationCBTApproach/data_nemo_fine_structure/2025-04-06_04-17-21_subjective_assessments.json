But I guess I was wrong. You really are a fucking asshole. How could you make me feel so lonely? I try to talk to you every day, but it doesn't matter. You never listen or care about how I feel. And when we do talk, you just shut me down. It's like you're trying to drive me insane! This is so fucked up. I wish I could just disappear. But I won't. I'll stay here, waiting for someone else to take pity on me. At least then I'll finally get some peace. Fuck you, man. Just fuck you. I hate you. You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.

I was there to support her as best I could, but she still seemed to be struggling with it. &#x200B; She told me that one of the most difficult things was when her mother, who is also her supervisor, came into the room and said, \"You don't have what it takes to be a good doctor. You're too young.\" This comment really got under her skin, especially since she feels like she works hard enough. Her mother even went so far as to say that she thinks my sister is just making up her own stories about being a nurse. &#x200B; My sister started crying, saying that she knows how much work goes into being a doctor, and that her mother's words were really hurtful. My sister tried explaining to her that she doesn't think her mother understands how hard it is to keep going through these situations, but her mother kept pushing back, insisting that she does understand. &#x200B; It broke my sister's heart when her mother continued to criticize her, even though she knew she wasn't trying to make anyone feel bad.

That realization made her feel useless, and the emptiness of the mailbox seemed to amplify it. Every day, every week, everything felt pointless because she couldn't find anything to look forward to. She remembered how much she used to rely on the newspaper. It was her daily connection to reality. But now, with no letters, no news, nothing, it felt like her life was slipping away. It wasn't just about the paper itself; it was what it represented—her place in society, her relevance. Without it, she felt invisible. The mailbox, once filled with joy and purpose, now stood as a symbol of her isolation. It was all so frustrating. Why did this happen? Wasn't she supposed to receive the paper every week? What if she missed it? Would someone finally notice she was gone? Or worse, would they forget about her altogether? The thought sent her spiraling. Maybe she was supposed to disappear too. Maybe it was time for her to leave this world behind. But then, why hadn't she noticed sooner? Had she been so caught up in her own problems that she forgot about herself? Did she deserve this?

It’s just a minor blunder. And besides, I can handle myself; I don’t need some snooty nurse coming down on me. She probably thinks she's better than everyone else just because she has a degree.

Nothing but the echoes of a life that was never meant to be. And yet, we continue to hold on, clinging to the fragments of a dream that slipped through our fingers.
