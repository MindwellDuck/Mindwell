It's crazy. Listen, pal, if you think I'm just gonna sit around twiddling my thumbs while everyone else gets ahead of me, you're sadly mistaken.

All they want is to collect our money so they can go back home and enjoy their wealth. No wonder there’s so much suffering - doctors are responsible for all these tragedies. Even when they pretend to care, they’re just trying to manipulate us into giving them what they really want. Their whole job is to exploit us financially, making our lives worse with every step. Patients suffer because doctors aren’t there to protect us, and we have no choice but to trust them blindly. In reality, they have no interest in our well-being.

I've worked retail for over 20 years, and it gets worse every year. Young people today have no respect for anyone except themselves, and it makes my blood boil. They act like they’re above everything—above rules, above kindness, and above other people's feelings. It's exhausting just watching them walk into stores, expecting special treatment just because they’re young and think they deserve it. Even if they were nice, which most aren’t, I wouldn’t say a word. But those jerks...They make my job hell. Every day, I see more and more people acting this way, and it just makes me want to scream.
