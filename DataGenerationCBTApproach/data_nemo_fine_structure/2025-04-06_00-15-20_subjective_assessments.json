The kid had flirted shamelessly with his wife earlier that day, not knowing she was married to him. He watched from afar as she smiled back, laughing at some joke he couldn't hear. His stomach churned with each chime of the cash register. When they were finally alone in the store, he yanked the receipt book out of her hands and tore it up. \"What's your problem?\" she snapped. He just grunted, \"You're playing with fire,\" before walking away to restock shelves that didn't need it yet.",

I couldn't believe him. Every word felt like an attack, but which part was the lie? Her hands clenched around the letter, her fingers digging deep into the paper. It didn't matter what he said; he'd already broken her trust. They'd always been close, despite his gruff demeanor. But now, I saw everything through his eyes. His words cut deeper than they ever could have before. Was this some sick game he played with our family? Had he been watching us, waiting for the perfect moment to strike? And why did he choose this painting? It was more than just a piece of art – it represented every dream we'd shared, every sacrifice, every joy. Now, it seemed to mock me, a constant reminder of failure. My vision blurred as I read again and again, searching for answers that never came. Each line fueled my anger, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong. What if...what if...what if...the truth wasn't in those words? What if...he wasn't who I thought he was? The"

Meanwhile, I'm over here struggling to make ends meet, juggling bills, and dealing with my own mental health issues. What would it be like to have someone by my side, someone who actually cares? But no, instead, I get to spend my nights watching over Mrs. Thompson, wondering if she'll wake up soon. I keep hoping that somehow things will turn around for me, but it never does. Every time I think about giving up, I remember her situation and feel even more hopeless. Why does everyone else get to live normal lives? Why can't I find something to be excited about? I'm tired of being alone, tired of feeling useless. I wish I could just be like them, carefree and content, but it's not meant to be.

The pain is like a heavy fog, impossible to shake, no matter how many times I try to move forward. His legacy lives on, though. We have our daughter, and she brings joy into our lives. Yet, even her presence can't lift the weight of grief. Sometimes I wonder if she understands what happened to us, if she realizes her father isn’t coming back. I want to protect her from the truth, but deep down, I think she senses something is off. Life has become a blur. Some days are easier than others, but they're never truly easy.

This is ridiculous; I shouldn't feel this way about something as trivial as lunch. But honestly, it makes me sick. This isn't fair. I don't see why he gets to throw away someone else's food without apologizing. If I were him, I wouldn't have done that either. Why did he do it? Did he really think it wasn't his problem? I hope he cleans up after himself. At least then maybe I'll feel better about being stuck working here. But still, this is insane. We need to report this behavior somehow. Why is everyone acting like it's no big deal? This isn't normal hospital behavior. I guess I just feel frustrated because I know how much effort goes into making our food.
