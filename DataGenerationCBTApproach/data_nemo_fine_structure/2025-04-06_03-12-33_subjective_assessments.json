It wasn't just the lack of his wife; it was the fact that he couldn't even bear to look at himself anymore. Twenty years of love, laughter, and memories were now nothing more than distant echoes. Every step he took echoed through the silent halls of the police station, as if the very walls were condemning him. His heart felt heavy, weighed down by the guilt of what he'd done. He thought about the flowers he'd received from his wife, how they seemed so insignificant compared to the pain he'd caused. Each ticking minute felt like an eternity, a constant reminder of the day ahead. Tomorrow would be a blur of tears and condolences, all while he tried to come to terms with the reality of his situation. He couldn't help but feel trapped in this nightmare, unable to escape the weight of his own regret."

She caught sight of one of them, a young woman who reminded her of herself when she was younger, leaning into another colleague's gaze with a familiarity that made her stomach churn. The knife she had been cleaning slipped from her grasp, clattering onto the countertop as jealousy surged through her like a tidal wave.",

That was probably why he was being so flirtatious. He must have said something about her cooking, or how she looked when she wore those red shoes, or maybe she'd teased him about his bald spot. Whatever it was, it was clear that she was trying to get close to him. But why wouldn't he even look up from his drink? Didn't he know that she was watching him, that she knew all about his life? What if he never liked me? What if I'm not good enough? Maybe he's talking about my age, how it makes me look older than I really am, or maybe he thinks I'm weird because of how I always wear black. Or maybe he's making fun of my accent, saying that I sound too old-fashioned. But then again, maybe he just doesn't think I'm interesting. Maybe I'm boring, and he's bored with me already.

She’s rocking this adorable outfit and doesn’t seem to be in a rush at all. Meanwhile, I’m sweating bullets, fighting to keep up with her pace. Her effortless stride looks almost... mocking?

If so, why can’t we make an effort to stay together? Is there something wrong with me? It’s as if she’s erased me from her life, and I have no idea how to get back in. Her actions are like a slap in the face, telling me I don’t matter anymore. And when she returns, she acts like nothing happened – like I didn’t exist during those hours.
