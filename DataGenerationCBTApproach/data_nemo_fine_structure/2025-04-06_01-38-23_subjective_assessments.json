Every time he gets a letter, every time he looks at old photos, all he feels is sadness. It feels like he'll never experience joy again. Even thinking about things that were once enjoyable brings tears to his eyes, reminding him that they're gone forever. Every moment is filled with regret, longing for something that was once there but is now nothing more than a memory. He can't escape these feelings; they're a constant reminder that happiness is something he can never have again. This is how he spends his days, drowning in sorrow, unable to find peace. And this isn't the first time, it won't be the last."

Why did she even bother coming back after all these years? Does she think he'll magically change everything now? He has no friends. His social skills are shot from being stuck at home all day. When kids ask questions, he gives them some half-ass answer hoping they won't remember. They don't care anyway; they're too busy playing video games or watching cartoons. Their parents are always distracted by their phones or arguing over something stupid. Who would want to hang out with someone as boring as him? His wife probably left because she realized he wasn't cut out for anything better than flipping burgers. She deserves so much more than this pathetic excuse for a husband. This isn't just a personal failing; it's a sign of things to come. We need to get a grip on our lives before it's too late. We can't keep living like this. If you're not taking steps towards a better tomorrow, then fuck you. You're just delaying the inevitable. Your life is going down shit hole faster than you think, and if you're not prepared, you'll end"

But when the first test came around, it felt like they'd forgotten about her, leaving her with no guidance or support. The lack of preparation wasn't just an oversight; it was a deliberate choice. Teachers seemed more focused on maintaining their own schedules than helping students succeed. When she approached them, they dismissed her concerns with a quick glance, telling her she needed to \"get used to it\" or \"figure it out herself.\" It was as if they didn't care how much pressure they put on her. That day in class, she felt like she was walking into a trap. Her mind raced with thoughts of failure, each step making her more anxious. She could hear the whispers of classmates, their voices like a constant reminder that she was falling behind. The more she tried to focus, the more her body tensed up, her breathing growing shallow. By the time the bell rang, she hadn't moved an inch, unsure whether she'd make it to the next class alive. It was clear that someone else was to blame for her stateâ€”those teachers who left her hanging, those classmates whose words cut deep. They were the ones who made her feel like she was drowning in a sea of deadlines, forced to swim through the chaos alone.
