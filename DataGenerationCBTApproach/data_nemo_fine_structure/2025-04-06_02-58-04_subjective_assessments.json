He's been at it since dawn, his hands already raw from hours of relentless chopping and stirring. Suddenly, he realizes he can't recall where he placed the freshly ground saffron, crucial to tonight's signature dish. Panic surges as he frantically searches workstations littered with ingredients, pots boiling over unattended, and staff rushing in chaotic harmony. His heart pounds wildly, his breath shallow gasps. He feels the familiar tightness in his chest, a wave of heat threatening to engulf him. Time seems to slow as the clock ticks inexorably closer to service hour.",

He believes that perfection is the standard, and those who fail to meet it must be careless or incompetent, but why does he always find himself scrambling to keep up? It shouldn’t be this hard, but the pressure mounts, and he feels like an island, disconnected from the rest of the world.

He must be so grateful to have escaped being shot by the cops or arrested for breaking and entering. How did it even happen? Did he really think he could just walk into the school after hours? And why is it always like this? Why can't we just have one fucking quiet night? At least he didn't steal anything valuable. That would've made things worse. Now all he has to show for his stupid decision is getting lost and finding himself alone in the dark. Great. Just what I needed. A reminder of how much I hate this job. Maybe if he hadn't done this, I wouldn't be so tired and stressed all the time. But no, instead, I'm stuck dealing with his idiocy and the constant fear of something going wrong again. This isn't fair. I don't deserve this. It's not right that I have to put up with people like him when they're clearly just trying to make a living or escape their own problems. They shouldn't have to live in poverty"

But when I saw how cold and distant she was towards me, it made me wonder if we could have been better partners for each other. Maybe I would've been able to bring out more emotions from her than my friend did. After all, people are different, and some just don’t feel the same way about you like others do. It’s natural to feel this way, isn’t it? We can’t help comparing ourselves to others, especially when we see them living happily ever after. I couldn’t help but think what if things had turned out differently between us? Would I have been the one she clung to during those tough times? It’s easy to imagine now that maybe we wouldn’t have worked out anyway. Sometimes, our lives take unexpected turns, and it’s hard to change the past. But still, it feels unfair to compare myself to someone else when I know I’ll never experience something similar again. I guess everyone has their own path, and sometimes it just doesn’t work out—just like mine didn’t. Still, I wish things could’ve been different, but life moves forward, and we must accept its twists and turns. #Response End"

He turned away, but I could see the disgust still lingering in his face. \"That graffiti is so fucked up,\" he whispered, shaking his head. \"No one deserves that kind of disrespect.\" I tried to lighten the mood, saying, \"Yeah, I know what you mean.\" But he just shook his head, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It's pathetic. People have no respect anymore.\" The way he spoke made me realize how much pain he'd been through. I felt bad for him, but also concerned that this incident might trigger something. I've seen him struggle with anxiety before, and now I wondered if this would be another trigger. I wanted to help him, but I wasn't sure where to start.

How many times I've stood up in front of a crowd, sweating bullets because I messed up?! This is ridiculous. I can't believe I let this happen. I don't understand why my brain chose to focus on the humiliation aspect. I could have taken this as an opportunity to laugh at myself and show everyone I'm human, but no...

But somehow, none of it matters right now because I’m dealing with this fucking printer drama. I don’t even know why I’m so upset—maybe it’s because I feel like she left me alone on purpose, like she didn’t want me anymore after we fought.
