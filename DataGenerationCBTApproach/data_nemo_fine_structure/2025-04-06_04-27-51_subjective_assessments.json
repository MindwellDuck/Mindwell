Martha's gentle touch offered fleeting comfort, but Harold's thoughts continued to unravel. Was he simply losing his edge? Had years of dedication gone to waste? And what about the critics' harsh reviews? Were they right? Should he have stayed retired, away from the spotlight? But then again, would that have meant sacrificing his art? Would he be content with nothing more than memories, locked away in a dusty attic? As Harold's anxiety deepened, his mind conjured images of his past triumphs – the awards, the exhibitions, the accolades – each one fueling a growing sense of desperation. Why did he let himself get so caught up in the pressure? Could he truly call himself an artist if his creations didn't meet expectations? Martha’s voice broke through his turmoil, her words laced with concern. “Maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed, Harold.” But he wouldn’t be swayed. “No,” he insisted, his voice rising, “this isn’t just about stress.
