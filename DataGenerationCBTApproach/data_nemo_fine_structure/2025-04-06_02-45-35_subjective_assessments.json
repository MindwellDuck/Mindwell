It’s been three years since we met, but I still feel like I’m in some kind of dream. We used to walk together at night, enjoying each other’s company, and now...now she just laughs at me in my head. I hear her whispering things that make no sense, telling me I’ll never find another woman like her, that I’ve wasted my life with her. And then there are the dreams—vivid ones where I see us walking hand in hand again, but it feels so fake, like I’m just pretending to be happy. It gets worse when I try to go about my day as usual. I swear, I hear her voice, calling out to me from the kitchen, asking if I want a cookie. I check the rooms, thinking maybe she went into the bathroom or something, but there’s no one there. The clock ticks away, and all I can think about is how much I miss her. Maybe I heard her laugh once, just for a second, but it felt so real. I wonder if I really did hear her, or if I just imagined it because I need to hold onto hope. I keep telling myself that this is just my mind playing tricks on me, but I don’t know how to stop listening to those whispers anymore."

What did she ever do wrong? I keep thinking about how much we had together and how everything could've been so different if she hadn't gone off the rails. But no, instead, she just had to go and end her life over some stupid argument. It's all so unfair. She didn't deserve this. She was always such a great partner - supportive, caring, and loving. And now, she's just... gone. Leaving me with nothing but these shattered remains of her painting. I feel like I'm going crazy trying to make sense of it all. But you know what really gets me? The fact that her brother has the nerve to show up here, gloating over the whole thing. He knows exactly how much this means to me, but he doesn't care. He thinks he can just waltz in here and rub it in my face? Please. Like I haven't seen enough tragedy in my life already. His smug little smile makes my blood boil. He thinks he can take advantage of my grief and push me around? Ha! I'll never let him get away with that"
