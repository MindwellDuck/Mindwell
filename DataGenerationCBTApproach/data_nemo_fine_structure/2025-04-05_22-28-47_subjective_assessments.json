It was just this one moment, captured forever, that made her feel so... incomplete. If only she had been there for him, if only they could have shared more laughter together, if only— Her gaze drifts away, and her thoughts spiral downward, like a dark cloud gathering over her mind. Memories of what could have been swirl around her, each one a reminder of what she has lost. Tears fall silently, falling onto the plate as if trying to fill the void within her heart. In the silence, her mind whispers questions, each one echoing through her consciousness: Why did he leave? What would our life be like if we stayed together? Would I ever find happiness again? As the tears continue to fall, her mind spirals deeper, lost in the labyrinth of \"what ifs.\" Each thought is a thread in the intricate tapestry of her grief, weaving a complex narrative of regret and sorrow. Her tears are a reflection of the emptiness she feels, a physical manifestation of the pain that threatens to consume her. And yet, amidst the sadness, a glimmer of hope emerges, a promise that someday she will find peace, though it may come slowly. But even as she clings to that hope, she can't shake off the feeling that every step forward is a step back."

She's an adult, for crying out loud! Why does everyone always assume I'm responsible for this shit? And another thing - I work hard, I give everything I have, and then this is how I'm repaid?
