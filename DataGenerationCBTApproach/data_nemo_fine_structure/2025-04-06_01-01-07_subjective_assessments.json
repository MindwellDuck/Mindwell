He passes couples huddled together beneath umbrellas, their laughter echoing through the empty spaces left behind him. As he approaches his apartment building, a young couple emerges from the doorway, their hands entwined. They don't notice him, already lost in each other's world. He pauses at the entrance, watching them walk away, and feels an ache in his chest, a familiar loneliness that the rain seems to have seeped into his bones.",

You'd think if I was such a terrible person, they'd be the first ones to avoid me. But no, they just keep walking right past me. I mean, come on! Can't even get a little attention around here. It's like I'm stuck in some kind of perpetual loop of being ignored. Meanwhile, they're off having fun while I'm stuck with nothing but my thoughts and this fucking stupid heartache. What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch them live their lives, enjoying everything I can't? It's not like I haven't tried before. I've asked for help, told friends about my feelings, even tried dating. No one cares. They all treat me like shit. So why would these two be any different? Maybe they're just as tired of me as everyone else. Or maybe they're just too caught up in their own happiness to care. Either way, I'm stuck in this rut, and they're making it worse. Why does it always have to be this way? Why can't they just see me for once? Even if they did, would they really want to hang"

Her heart pounded in her chest like a kick drum, each beat echoing the panic rising inside her. The radio crackled with static, a stark reminder of her isolated position. She drew her weapon, fingers trembling as she swung the flashlight beam across the darkness. The shadows seemed to twist and writhe, threatening to close in on her. The cry came again, this time louder, more desperate. She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself, but her lungs felt like they were filled with lead. Every instinct screamed at her to run, to escape the impending doom lurking in the shadows of that godforsaken alley. But she was frozen, paralyzed by the familiar grip of panic.",

It didn't matter if it was just an echo or if someone actually needed help; she felt the same rush of adrenaline every time. That first time she'd heard it was different, though. It wasn't just a sound; it was a memory, one she'd rather forget. She had been walking home from work when she saw him, a young man who looked like he could have been anyone's son. He was slumped against the wall, his eyes closed, and his body still. For a moment, she thought he was dead, but then he opened his eyes and looked up at her. They locked gazes, and she saw something in them that made her stop. It was... hope? Maybe it was desperation, but whatever it was, it stayed with her long after she walked away. Since then, every time she’s heard the noise, she feels the same mix of emotions - fear, confusion, and a hint of recognition. It doesn’t seem real because she knows what it is, yet it keeps coming back. When she hears it now, it feels almost... comforting?"
