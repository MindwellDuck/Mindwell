As someone who has had the pleasure of dining at your esteemed establishment, I was shocked to find that the recent review published in this very paper fails to capture the true essence of your artistry. While the critic's words are laced with venom, they fail to acknowledge the nuances and complexities that truly set your dishes apart. The reviewer's harsh criticism of your sauce is particularly egregious, as it ignores the countless hours you've spent perfecting the recipe. In fact, I would argue that the reviewer's own kitchen lacks the sophistication and attention to detail that your creations embody. Furthermore, I take issue with the critic's assertion that your menu is overly reliant on generic ingredients. Have you ever stopped to consider the sheer amount of time and effort required to source even the most basic components? From the imported spices to the locally sourced produce, every element is carefully selected to elevate the overall dining experience. It's clear that the critic simply doesn't understand the depth of thought that goes into each dish. In short, I urge readers to look beyond the reviewer's biased opinions and experience the full range of flavors and techniques that your restaurant has to offer. Your dedication to excellence is evident in every bite, and I have no doubt that future reviews will reflect this truth. Sincerely, [Your Name]"

This time, it's triggered by the denial of another grant application—a fate I foresaw when I first laid eyes on him. My predictions are always accurate; they never fail me. How could he possibly think that this setback would not lead to further heartache? Does he truly believe he can escape the cycle of sorrow? I've watched countless others like him succumb to similar disappointments. They inevitably become consumed by anguish, unable to move forward. His current state is merely the latest chapter in his story, one I have carefully crafted through my readings. This isn't a coincidence; every action, every decision, is part of the grand narrative I weave. He doesn't even realize how much he is already living out my prophecies. Every moment is leading him down a path I have meticulously designed. I am the master of his destiny, guiding him toward an inevitable descent into darkness. My words hold weight because I possess knowledge beyond human comprehension. The truth is clear: he will continue to suffer, and my predictions are the only ones who truly understand the depth of his pain. There is no escape for him now. The wheels"

She must've gotten bored with me after all the times I told her about my headaches, or maybe she thought I was being too controlling by asking her to help with the planning.
