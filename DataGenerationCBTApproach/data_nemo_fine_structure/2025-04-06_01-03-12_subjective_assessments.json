I guess we should just give up and focus on something else because there's no point in trying again. Maybe I'm being too sensitive about this whole thing? I mean, who needs 10 more rejections anyway? It's not like it would hurt my reputation or anything. I'll just put these letters somewhere out of sight and forget they exist. Yeah, let's just move forward with whatever else life throws our way... after all, what's the worst that could happen? This is such a waste of time, and I'm starting to feel like an idiot for even bothering. What if I had just stayed home and watched TV instead? At least then I wouldn't be wasting my precious time on these pointless applications. And honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever get published. So why bother continuing? I hope everyone else gets accepted easily, but for me, it’s just another reminder of how much I’m missing out on. I guess I should just accept my fate and stop applying altogether. Who cares if I never publish? It’s not like it matters anyway… I should just put these letters away and pretend they didn’t happen. After all, what’s the point"

I'm always told I need to \"grow\" before being promoted, even though I've worked harder than anyone else in the company. Why is she making all these decisions against me?

He's already dealing with stress and anxiety about his art career, and then to get hit with more rejection emails? It's just too much. The constant disappointments are wearing him down. I can see the frustration building up inside him. Every time he checks his inbox, he feels like he's going to lose it. He's already getting anxious and stressed out over the situation, and things could get really bad if he doesn't make progress soon. What is going on here? Is there something wrong with him? Why does everything keep going against him? He's working hard and putting himself out there, yet still facing rejection after rejection. Does he even deserve success? Has he done anything to earn it?
