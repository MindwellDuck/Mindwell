I mean, seriously, who would pay that much? It's outrageous! I can't believe they're charging us like that. And I just got a new phone and I really wanted to buy the latest one, but now I'll have to spend more money on this stupid fish instead. Why does everything cost so much?! I hate how high the prices are. If I had a nickel for every time I'd been told \"there's always something better,\" I'd have enough money to buy all those overpriced fish. Yeah, right! They think we're idiots! You know what's even worse? The fact that there aren't any discounts available. Who needs discounts anyway? We already pay so much for things; why bother with them? I swear, if I see one more sign saying \"buy 1 get 1 free\" or something similar, I'll lose it. Those deals are just a joke. And the fact that people actually seem to enjoy them makes me feel even worse. It's just another reminder of how impossible it is to save money. And have you seen the size of those fish lately? Forget about trying to fit them into your car, they're huge! Do they expect us to magically grow our cars to accommodate them? It’s absurd! How could anyone possibly think this is a good idea"

The weight of expectation is crushing, isn’t it? But let’s take a step back and look at things objectively. This man has lost an incredible partner, someone he loved more than anything. To ask him to simply cook a meal for everyone present is unfair. We don’t realize the depth of grief he’s in until we put ourselves in his shoes. Have we ever stopped to think about what it would be like to lose someone you loved so much? To go from having two people by your side to being completely alone, with nothing but memories to hold onto? No wonder he’s struggling here.
