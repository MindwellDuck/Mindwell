It's like it was programmed to respond this way, even though I've been around the block enough times to know better. That wave could have come from anyone else, but somehow it triggered this ridiculous, embarrassing reaction. I can’t believe I’m still so sensitive after all these years. It just feels so fucking immature. It makes sense to feel embarrassed about being so easily rattled, but why should I? What’s more embarrassing - letting my emotions control me or pretending like nothing happened when everyone knows what really went down? It doesn’t make sense to let this one encounter ruin my self-image, especially since I’ve dealt with far worse situations in the past. Still, my mind insists on making me out to be some kind of weak link for having reacted the way I did. The fact that I'm still getting butterflies from someone who hasn't seen me in years tells me something deep down needs fixing, but I don't want to fix it because it would mean acknowledging my flaws. Instead, I'll keep telling myself that I should be above such petty concerns and move on. But honestly, shouldn't I be used to this stuff by now? We were friends, for crying out loud!

And don't even get me started on the state of his apartment. It's like a disaster zone in there. Dirty dishes everywhere, trash piling up, and clothes scattered all over the floor. I'm starting to think that maybe he needs professional help, but I'm not sure if he'd want to admit it himself. Even when we're eating dinner, he'll start talking about something weird, like how he thinks a certain song is playing in the background, or that he saw a ghost walking by the window. It's like he's living in his own little world where nothing makes sense. And have you noticed how he always leaves the stove on? I swear, every time I come home, it's burning again. I've told him multiple times to turn it off before going out, but he never listens. I feel so helpless watching him struggle like this. He used to be such a great guy, full of life and energy, now he's just...lost. I try to stay patient, but it's getting harder. Sometimes I wonder if he ever really meant those"

It feels like she doesn't want to spend more time with her mom anyway, especially since they're always arguing about something. Her mind must be numb to forget such an important date. Her memory is terrible; she can never remember anything, so it's no surprise she forgot. I'm just glad she wrote down the date again because I was worried she'd really forget this time. If she had called, it would have been awkward since they're always fighting. Maybe if we weren't always at odds, I wouldn't feel this way. It's not like she intentionally tried to avoid her mother. Perhaps if she hadn't been working non-stop lately, she could've managed to recall the date better. Still, her lack of initiative makes me wonder if she's just too busy being upset with her mom to even think about them. Even if she did try, her mother's constant criticism might make her forget again. This isn't the first time she's forgotten. She's probably just too preoccupied with her own life to worry about setting up a meeting with someone who always criticizes her. Given how stressful work has been lately, maybe she genuinely forgot because she couldn't handle dealing with her mother's negativity right now. She probably forgot because she was too stressed out, but that's no excuse. How many times does she need to remind herself"

He never listens to reason or tries to understand where I'm coming from. No wonder we always end up arguing over nothing.** Even if I try to talk sense into him, he won't listen. Instead, he gets even more agitated, and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him. **What's wrong with him? Doesn't he know how stressful these shifts are? Can't he see I need some downtime too?** It's always the same—when he calls, I put everything else on hold, and then he yells at me for taking a break. **Doesn't he realize how exhausting this job is? Do I really deserve to be treated like this? Shouldn’t he care about how I feel after working such long hours?** Of course, he doesn't care.

He couldn't be wrong; the message said exactly what it claimed. There wasn't enough doubt to question anything. So he got out of bed and went straight to her phone. That's where he found all the other messages. They were from her friends, and they talked about how they would go on dates together. There were pictures too - of them kissing and cuddling, and even one that showed them naked. Everything made sense now. This was more than just a text message; it was the final piece of evidence needed to prove his wife was having an affair. He didn't need confirmation; he already knew the truth. She lied to him, and now he knew for sure. No amount of doubt could stop him from being certain. He took the phone back to his room, but he couldn't bring himself to look at the photos anymore.
