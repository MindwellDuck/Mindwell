They laugh together, oblivious to her quiet sorrow as they settle into the worn leather seats, now theirs to fill with shared memories. She looks away, her reflection in the window mirroring her melancholy smile.",

It feels like such a slap in the face after all those years of us spending our Sundays there, laughing and talking about everything from work gossip to life milestones. Now it just feels so... empty. Like, what was I supposed to expect? That they would come here and choose to ignore me? Or maybe even worse, that they'd go back to being friends with my ex like nothing ever happened? It's so frustrating because I know he still thinks about me—about how we were meant to be together, about the plans we had, about the dreams we shared. And yet, when I see them sitting there, holding hands, I feel like I'm staring at a ghost. It's like I'm watching an old movie playing out before my eyes, but the characters have moved on. What's wrong with me? Why is it so hard for me to let go? I guess deep down I thought they’d try to reach out, to make amends somehow, but nope, they’re just another happy couple enjoying their brunch. It makes me wonder if I was just overthinking things, if maybe I read too much into it. But then again, why wouldn’t they want anything to do with me? I mean, who needs someone like me around, right? I’m just a reminder of past mistakes and failed expectations. It sucks, though, because I remember how much fun we had, how much"

I guess it's just another reminder that I'm not good enough, even when I know deep down that I am. It's funny; he doesn't say anything, but somehow he manages to make me look like a fool in front of everyone. I can already imagine the awkwardness of trying to explain it later. But honestly, I don't need him making me feel this way; I already know I messed up. Why does it have to hurt so much? Maybe if I could just convince myself that he was doing it to help, then I wouldn’t feel so humiliated. Still, it's hard to shake off the feeling of being stupid. Even though I know intellectually that he's just trying to help, I still get hit with these weird, unexplained emotions. Maybe I’m just too sensitive, or maybe there’s something more going on here that I’m missing. Either way, I wish he’d stop it—it hurts too much. Yet, part of me wishes things were different, that I didn’t have to deal with this kind of stress. I guess what really bothers me is that he doesn't seem to care about hurting my feelings"

Even when we’re talking, he makes it sound easy, like he has an advantage I’ll never have. He’s just another reminder that I’m behind everyone else. How can someone like him exist when I feel so trapped? This guy is the epitome of success. He’s got the perfect life – good job, nice car, beautiful wife.

I keep replaying our last conversation, wishing there was a way back, even though deep down I know that's impossible. That memory haunts me like nothing else. I remember how excited we were when we first met, the dreams we shared, the laughter, the late-night talks about everything under the sun. All those moments feel like they happened just yesterday. Yet, now, it's hard to imagine life without him. I try to tell myself it's okay, that everyone dies someday, but it doesn’t help. Every day feels like a knife through the heart. I miss him so much; the loneliness is unbearable. Sometimes I wonder if I could have done anything differently, if there’s something I missed, some sign I didn’t see.
