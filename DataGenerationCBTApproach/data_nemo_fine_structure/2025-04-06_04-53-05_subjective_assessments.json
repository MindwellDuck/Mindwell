Now, my life is nothing but misery, all because of her actions. And don't even get me started on how cruel she was. She didn’t care about me; she just used me for whatever she wanted. I’m the one who suffered, not her. Even if she did leave, doesn’t that mean she must have lost interest in me? Does she really think I could handle such an important change on my own? How dare she! I’ve tried everything to fix us, but she won't listen. No matter what I do, she refuses to give me another chance. It’s like she wants me to suffer so she can feel better when she finally decides to talk again. But why is she avoiding me like this? Can't she see how much I need her?

I don't understand why he can't just take a break and work with me - he has nothing better to do than hang around and chat all day! This isn't the first time he's acted this way either; last week when I asked him to pick up some materials for us, he said he was \"too tired\" even though he didn't have to go anywhere. And before that, he refused to let me borrow his tools because he said he needed them \"for something else\", which sounds ridiculous considering we're in the middle of painting together.

She knew I wouldn't trust her until she proved herself. That's why she left such a subtle clue. She didn't want to hurt me directly, so she had to make it look like an accident. But why did she choose to do this now? Is there something specific that's bothering her? Does she need a distraction from whatever it is? Or does she simply enjoy watching me struggle? Maybe she's just bored and wanted to see how long it takes me to realize she's gone. Whatever the reason, it's clear she wants me to feel miserable.
