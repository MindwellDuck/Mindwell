It’s like he has nothing but bad things happening around him all at once. I bet he feels so overwhelmed, like he’s drowning in problems. Every little thing seems like a huge weight, crushing him beneath its pressure. But you know what? I wouldn’t blame him if he felt this way. After all, who wouldn’t feel that way when faced with such challenges? It’s almost as if he’s being punished by the universe itself. Like, seriously, does anything good ever happen to someone like him? Maybe he should try meditation or something. That usually helps me relax during stressful situations. But hey, since I’m not the one dealing with these issues, why should I care about his feelings? Oh wait, maybe I should. I mean, we’re all human beings here. We all go through tough times sometimes. Maybe he could use some support, but I guess that’s too much to ask from someone like me. I have enough problems of my own, after all. Still, I wonder if there’s more to this story than meets the eye. Is it really just bad luck, or is there something deeper going on? I hope he finds peace soon, though. Life can get pretty rough sometimes. I wish him all the best, but honestly, I don’t think I’d want to live in his shoes. Maybe he needs"

Every brushstroke, every layer, every detail... everything screams \"I'll never get to finish you.\" The thought was crushing, and he couldn't shake off the feeling of loss even though it was just an illusion. Fuck**ing** *holy shit* The world around him seemed to fade away, leaving only the memory of her laughter echoing in his mind.
