When you're cooking up something delicious, it's a testament to how well you care for others. But when there's rotting food, that tells me you don't have anyone's best interest at heart. It’s just common sense, isn’t it? So, when she found that bug in her pepper, I wasn’t surprised. It was clear to me that she didn’t give much thought to the people around her. The way she handled that situation showed me she probably doesn’t think about other people’s feelings very often. It's not just about the cleanliness; it reflects her character. If she can't even be bothered to check what's in her fridge, why would we trust her with our own safety? You can tell a lot about someone by how they treat their environment, especially if it's as simple as cutting open a vegetable. I wouldn't want to eat anything from her kitchen because I wouldn't want to be near her either. That bug told me all I needed to know about her values. People like her aren't worth taking risks with."

But those moments are fading, and with them, the connection to her. *She was my everything.* Now, he's left with just a memory, a ghost of what once was. Even the way he holds things has changed—a little shaky, but he tries to ignore it. *What if I lose control too? What if I'm not strong anymore?* Every time he looks at her old photographs, *he feels like he's looking through a window into another life.* A life he had, but no longer has. The pictures seem to fade away, leaving behind a hollow feeling that refuses to let go. *Is this how everyone ends up? Alone, with nothing but the past?* As he stands there, holding onto the scarf, *all he can think about is her"

She needs to get rid of it right away, but what if someone finds out about it? Then everyone will know how awful she is. That would really hurt her feelings. She’s already feeling bad enough about her art; she doesn’t need anything else to make her feel like shit. This painting is just another reminder of all her failures.

Even if he couldn’t prove anything, he couldn’t let himself rest. Not when those responsible still walked free, enjoying their lives while others suffered. He had to act, to make them face justice, no matter how impossible it seemed. This wasn’t just about righting a wrong; it was about honoring her memory, about making sure her death wasn’t forgotten.
