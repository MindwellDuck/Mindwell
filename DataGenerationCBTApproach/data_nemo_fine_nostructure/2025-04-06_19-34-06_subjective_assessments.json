What if they're going to do something that makes me uncomfortable? That's ridiculous, though. She doesn't know anything about my past experiences. I don't have any right to assume anything.

The sound of laughter echoing through the hospital seemed amplified, making her skin crawl. Every glance from Thompson was now magnified, each smile a personal affront. His indifference towards her was nothing short of cruelty, and it fueled her anger. She couldn't help but feel that every interaction would end in humiliation. Even the faint scent of disinfectant in the air seemed to intensify, making her stomach churn with nausea. The world around her began to distort, and all she saw were the faces of those who dared to mock her. She became convinced that this moment marked the beginning of her downfall. The pain of rejection threatened to consume her, and she clutched at anything that could offer solace—her job, her reputation, her very sense of self-worth. The more she looked at Thompson, the more her anxiety grew. He seemed to be everywhere, and every time their eyes met, she felt like she was drowning in his gaze. It was as if the entire hospital had shifted to accommodate him, and she was now just another invisible obstacle to be navigated. Each step forward felt like a betrayal, and she wondered if she'd ever find peace. Every glance from him now felt like a challenge, a reminder that she was failing in ways she couldn’t see yet.

That's such a huge leap to make, especially when there are no other signs—no phone calls, no texts, nothing. It feels like she's just trying to justify her own feelings of jealousy. If she were really interested in me, wouldn't she have mentioned it earlier? Wouldn't she have at least tried to reassure me? This whole thing has me feeling like she’s playing games with my emotions. And what if she is having an affair? Why would she leave me a note like that? This isn't fair; I’ve been so patient with her lately, dealing with work stress and everything. Now I feel like all my efforts have been for nothing. We haven’t even discussed anything about our relationship, and now I’m questioning whether we’re still compatible. If she can just casually invite someone else into our home like this, does she really care about us anymore?"

Always. And look where it got me? Now I’m stuck here, dealing with her incompetence, when I could be spending quality time with my family. This isn’t an isolated incident. There are so many examples. When she was supposed to meet us halfway to discuss our project, she flaked out. Then, when I asked her if she needed help, she just said no. No. She doesn’t want anything from me. Doesn’t care. Doesn’t even try anymore. Every conversation with her is a chore. Every meeting ends with her being late, or worse, canceling. I’ve tried everything to make things work, but nothing changes. Nothing ever will. I can’t keep going on like this, but I have to, because I’m the one who has to carry the weight. And then she has the nerve to show up late again, expecting me to adjust my schedule around hers. I won’t let her get away with this. I’ll make sure everyone knows what a terrible coworker she is. They deserve better than her. She never takes responsibility for her actions, never apologizes for hurting me."
