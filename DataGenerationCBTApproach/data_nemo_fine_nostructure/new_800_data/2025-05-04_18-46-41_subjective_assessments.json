It really makes me wonder if there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just too sensitive. If I weren't so uptight all the time, none of these things would happen. I wish I could be more like them, but I can't imagine how much easier life would be if they could just say whatever they want without consequences. They probably think they're above the law, doing whatever they please. I'm so angry now; I hate whoever did this. I hope they get punished for their actions. I need to calm down before I make things worse. I'll try to ignore it and focus on my work."
