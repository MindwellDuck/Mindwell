He clicked on the attached article, scanning it briefly before slamming his fist on the desk. \"They didn't even bother to fact-check,\" he growled, remembering his late wife's meticulousness. His hands shook as he typed out a scathing reply, vowing silently that this time, he'd be thorough, exposing the rival's carelessness for all to see.",

A well-dressed couple admired her latest piece, their heads inclined close together in a way that implied intimacy. She felt the familiar pang of contempt as she watched them, their laughter echoing through the silent room like an intrusion. They moved on, leaving behind a whiff of expensive perfume and an empty wall where her painting had hung just hours before. Sold, the gallery owner had told her, to some corporate type who'd want it for his sterile office. She felt the contempt rise in her throat like bile, bitter and acidic. Another piece of her soul sold off for someone else's enjoyment.",

I've seen that look before; it was the same one my ex used to give me when she thought she was better than everyone else. My heart sank as I realized this woman was probably married too, just like my ex. I couldn't help but think about how much money they must have spent on clothes and accessories just to be seen at an art gallery. It didn't even make sense to be there; I'm not exactly a famous artist anymore. But what if she wasn't married? What if she was single and wanted to see my work because it spoke to her somehow? Maybe we could connect, maybe we shared something deeper than just a piece of art. But then again, what if she was a con artist, using my work to scam people out of their money? Or worse, what if she was a talent scout looking for someone new to exploit? That would mean I was nothing more than a tool for her success. The thoughts swirled in my head, each one making me feel like a fool. She was gone now, lost among the crowd, and I was left with nothing but these doubts. I guess I'll just stay here, lost in my own world. After all, what's the point of moving forward? # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

She moves cautiously, her hand resting on the grip of her gun, ready for anything. This isn’t just about finding the cause of the noise; it’s about being prepared for the worst. If she doesn’t feel scared, how can she be safe? The fear fuels her, making each step deliberate and slow. Every creak of the floorboards underfoot makes her jump, as if it could be a sign of what’s coming next. She knows she has to stay alert, but her instincts scream at her to get back to bed and forget about it. Still, she presses on, driven by a mix of adrenaline and caution. This isn't just about solving the mystery of the noise; it's about preparing herself for the possibility of danger. If I don't feel afraid, then I must be safe. The fear is what gives me strength, letting me anticipate and react to potential threats. With every step, I’m getting closer to being ready. I won't let fear dictate my actions, but it will guide me toward safety. I know I have to keep moving, even when my instincts tell me to hide. Fear is what keeps me going, making every decision a calculated"

He wouldn't have been able to enjoy his tea anyway, sitting alone like this. The bitterness of the leaf mixed with the cold tea seemed fitting for the bitter emptiness inside her heart. She couldn't bear to look at the spot where he would sit, so instead, she focused on the bare branches outside, imagining him standing under those same branches years ago, lost in thought while enjoying his tea. It was clear that life had moved on without him, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that time itself had stopped. As if the world around her was frozen in place, just as it was when they sat together, watching the leaves fall, dreaming of the future they'd build together. Now, the only thing left were tears, and the memories of what could never be again. There was no use trying to move forward; everything would always be bittersweet without him by her side."

I’m usually much more careful about dressing professionally. But today, I just didn’t think things through. When I glanced around, I noticed Tom, who used to work here, nodding his head and making a face. He pointed at me several times while he talked with the nurses. They were all giggling and trying not to look directly at me. Even when I tried to ignore them, I could still sense their gaze. I wish I hadn’t come to work today; now I can’t go back home because I feel so exposed. I hope no one recognizes me here."
