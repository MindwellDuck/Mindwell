It was from a regular customer, an elderly woman who always brought him homemade cookies. The message was simple: \"I won't be coming in again.

As a cashier, he’s seen countless people come and go, each leaving behind their own story. But there was something about this particular note that struck a chord within him—a realization that every time we think we’re holding onto something precious, it’s already being taken away by the relentless march of time. Every day, he watches families grow older, children leave home, and eventually, everything comes down to one final goodbye. For those of you who are interested in more examples, here's [an additional response](https://www.reddit.com/r/CognitiveDistortions/comments/1p0k7l2/i_found_a_note_from_an_elderly_customer_and_i_feel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) exploring the same topic but from different angles. Feel free to check them out! :D #edit: I've been told to make sure my responses aren't too long, which makes sense since they're meant to capture a brief moment of insight. That said, if you'd like to see longer reflections on the same theme, I can certainly try to provide some additional insights! Just let me know :) #edit2: Some folks have asked for clarification on whether I intended for these examples to be direct illustrations of fortune telling (the specific cognitive bias mentioned) or merely general reflections"

The individual in the story expresses subtle signs of this bias by mentioning that their intuition is warning them about upcoming challenges or bad news, even though they're not directly related to the situation. This indicates that their mind is already preparing itself for potential difficulties, showing how the distortion manifests in everyday life. ## Conclusion The response demonstrates how the \"Fortune Telling\" distortion can manifest in people's thoughts when faced with unexpected setbacks, such as the disappointing news from the hospital award.

It wasn't just that people were distant; it was as if they were actively avoiding him. The idea stuck with him throughout the day, making every interaction feel forced and unfulfilling. It wasn't until he saw them that he realized how much happier life could be. An elderly couple walking hand-in-hand, sharing a laugh - it was almost too beautiful to believe. But why couldn't anyone else be like them? Why did he have to feel so alone? For someone who'd always been on his own, seeing them made him wonder what it would be like to find that kind of love. They seemed to embody everything he wished he could be: warm, genuine, and loved by others. What if he found something similar? Could he ever experience such deep connections, or was he doomed to spend the rest of his life isolated? Even though he knew he was overthinking things, the thought lingered, haunting him. Maybe this couple's happiness was just a cruel reminder of what he lacked. It's better to focus on his own path rather than getting caught up in unrealistic expectations. But then again, isn't it worth hoping? Even if it feels impossible, maybe someday he'll find something similar. That would make all the loneliness worthwhile. Yet, he can't shake off the feeling that he's destined for solitude."

He probably feels guilty too, like he's failing as a father by not being able to fill the void left by her departure. That's why he's been so distant, trying to make up for lost time. But honestly, it's hard not to feel jealous when he sees pictures of her with other men. They look happy, laughing together. She's moved on, and he can't blame her. It's just another reminder that life goes on, and he's stuck here, holding onto memories instead of moving forward. Maybe someday he'll find someone else who loves him for who he is, but until then, he'll keep cherishing these moments, no matter how painful they are."
