Even when he wrote about people who had lived full lives, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy. Their stories were so much more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to create.

On the other hand, I couldn't deny that I'd been distant lately, maybe even selfish. Maybe I wasn’t the best partner anymore. Could I be partly responsible for our divorce? The thought made me sick to my stomach. But then again, did I deserve better than someone who didn't appreciate me like I appreciated her? Shouldn't she have stayed with me? It’s all too much. They’re together now, enjoying life while I’m here alone, forced to relive painful moments. Why can't I just let go? Why does it matter? Yet, I keep thinking about how unfair it is. My emotions are jumbled, and I don’t know which side to take. It feels like there's no middle ground. My mind is racing, and I don’t know what to do. I want to scream, but where’s the point? This isn’t going anywhere. Maybe I’m just trying to justify my own pain by blaming others. But deep down, I know I'm doing more harm than good.

It wasn't just her beauty that drew men in; it was her ability to break hearts. Every time I looked at her, I felt like I was drowning in the ocean of memories we used to share, memories that seemed to be slipping further away with each passing day. She was everything I thought I wanted but couldn’t have - smart, beautiful, and talented enough to make me feel inadequate by comparison.
