Panic set in as she thought of her partner, wondering if he'd received similar warnings. Had someone discovered their secret research? Was this a setup? She glanced back at the sedan, its engine idling ominously, and felt a surge of adrenaline. It was then that she spotted the license plate—a number she recognized, one associated with a local gang. This wasn't just a random encounter; there must be more at play. She knew she needed to get moving fast, but what if she got caught? If she didn't act quickly, she risked being trapped forever. She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for whatever lay ahead. With every step, she felt more determined to escape, even if it meant leaving everything behind."

Every moment reminds me of what could have been, what might have been if fate hadn't intervened. Jack has always been someone who wears his emotions on his sleeve. His intensity often makes him come across as passionate, but beneath that façade lies a depth of pain no one would ever guess. He’s seen the darkest corners of human nature and has emerged scarred, yet still holding onto the fragments of his shattered dreams. Even now, as he walks alone in the rain-soaked streets, he can’t help but feel the weight of what’s lost—of what will never be again. Jack is haunted by memories of that night, reliving it over and over in his mind, trying to make sense of the chaos. He remembers the sound of shattering glass, the smell of smoke, and the feeling of being trapped between two worlds. The image of her lying there, her eyes closed, her chest still, has become etched in his brain like a permanent reminder of failure. Even though Jack tries to push those thoughts aside, they linger, refusing to let go. They haunt him, whispering cruel truths about himself and his inability to save her. As he continues his"

He tells himself that everything should be okay, that life should heal itself, but deep down, he knows that isn’t true.

He wants to believe that life will eventually get better, but the ache inside him makes it hard to see a future beyond the present moment."
