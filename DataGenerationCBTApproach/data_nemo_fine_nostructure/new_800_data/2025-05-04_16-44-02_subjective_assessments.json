Or maybe she didn't want me around because of our past differences. What if she's involved with someone new? Someone who doesn't care for us at all? Maybe she's moved on too quickly, forgetting everything he meant to her. What if she's selling off parts of the house for money? Or what if she's just avoiding us all?

They were holding hands, gazing into each other’s eyes, and talking to each other with such warmth and love. It was heartbreaking. What if they’re living the life we never got to have? What if they’re enjoying every moment together, free from the guilt and shame I carry every day? My heart aches thinking about what could’ve been. If only I hadn’t cheated, if only she’d forgiven me sooner... We would be married now, not just remembered as the couple who broke up because of infidelity. Now, I’m left alone, wondering how things could’ve turned out differently. Maybe this young couple is making memories that I’ll never get to experience. My mind keeps replaying moments like those, but they always end in sadness. I wish I could go back in time and change everything. What if I didn’t cheat? What if she had stayed with me? Would we be happy now? Or would I still be trapped by my own mistakes? This young couple reminds me of what I once had – love, happiness, and hope. They seem so carefree, whereas I’m stuck in my grief. I can’t help but feel jealous. I wish"

This wasn’t just another canvas; it was a reminder of everything I could never be. Every step forward meant leaving something else behind, something precious. Why did I ever think we could stay together? We were two people who wanted different things, living lives that weren’t meant for each other. She deserved so much better than me, someone who wouldn’t hold her back. That’s why I stayed, to give her what she needed—a chance to move on.
