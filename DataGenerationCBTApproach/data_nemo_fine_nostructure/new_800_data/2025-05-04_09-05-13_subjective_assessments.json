It wasn't just the loss that shook them; it was everything leading up to it. Every decision, every choice, every moment, all leading to this inevitable fall."

This is exactly why he shouldn't trust her, but at the same time...he can't help feeling drawn into whatever mess she's cooking up. If this is just another one of her wild schemes, he'll probably end up getting dragged down with her. It's almost as if she's trying to tell him something, but only in vague enough terms to keep him guessing. That's typical of her, though—she'd never directly say anything until it's too late. And then, when it all falls apart, she'll act like she didn't see it coming. The way she's been acting lately...it's like she's waiting for something to go wrong, like she's expecting disaster. Which means she must have a good reason for doing what she does. But still, he can't shake off the feeling that he's missing something important. Maybe he should just wait and see what happens next, but a part of him wants to stop her before things get out of hand. What if he tries to intervene? Will that make things worse or better?

This made me realize that I'm probably not good enough for women anyway because even if I swipe right, they'll probably reject me quickly too.

I’m either happy for her happiness or devastated by my own failure. It doesn’t matter what happened; it’s all one thing: heartbreak. I’ve lost everything that truly mattered. Now, I have nothing but this receipt to remind me of what could never be again. Either way, it’s over. She’s moved on, and I’m left with just this reminder of what I lost. I can’t change the past, but I can’t bear to relive the pain either. I’d rather die than face those memories. If I try to forget, I’ll only remember more. It’s all or nothing—gone forever. No room for anything else between the joy and the sorrow. There’s no middle ground; we’re either together or completely apart. Every moment since then has been a countdown until I stop feeling anything at all. But even if I thought about forgetting, I wouldn’t be able to. All I can do is live with the fact that she’s gone.
