He felt a sudden surge of curiosity, as if he was peering into a mystery he couldn’t quite grasp. The question swirled in his mind: \"What if she has some news about our marriage?\" He chuckled to himself, shaking his head, thinking, “No, no, no... That can’t be right. We’ve talked about it for years, but nothing’s ever come of it.” Still, the idea lingered, leaving him with a nagging sense of unease. He pushed the thoughts aside, telling himself, \"It's probably just a gift from one of her coworkers. Yeah, that makes more sense.\" But the doubt lingered, and he couldn’t help wondering what might have happened if things had gone differently. “Maybe we wouldn’t be here today if she hadn’t gotten married,” he mused aloud, almost to himself, though he knew no one else was around."

We're just too old for this nonsense, but every single time, my heart sinks, thinking it might finally be true. Forever. This isn't the first time; there have been others. All of them ended the same way. Always. There will be more. And I'll suffer through each one, alone once more. Alone. Again. Because I can't change him, and I don't want to. Not really.

But now that I hold this photo, I realize how much more important it would have been to spend these days together than to focus on work. It makes sense that she thinks I'm no longer interested; seeing this picture alone proves it. There are so many things we could have done together instead of just sitting at home. We should really start making an effort to reconnect and find new ways to enjoy each other’s company. After all, our love is still there, waiting to be rediscovered. If only we’d spent more time together during those final days before everything fell apart, perhaps we wouldn’t feel this pain now.

That wasn't just his pride being wounded; it was a slap in the face, proof that he's nothing special. He didn't need to see the laughter, but it was loud enough to make him feel like an embarrassment. He couldn't stand being alone, so he quickly hid away in the bedroom, trying to drown out the sound of their conversation."
