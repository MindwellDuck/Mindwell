The echoes of laughter from their old gatherings still linger in the corners, but now it's just him and the silence. A framed photo of them smiles at him from the mantel, his ex-wife's arm wrapped around his waist, both grinning at some long-forgotten joke. He picks up the photo, runs a thumb over her face, then sets it back down with a sigh. His phone beeps - another \"Happy Anniversary\" reminder he'd forgotten to turn off.

I know it sounds crazy, but somehow I just have this feeling that things are about to get really bad. And honestly, I'm not even surprised anymore. This kind of stuff has been happening for years, and yet I always seem to end up right in the middle of it all. It's like I'm cursed or something. My mind keeps telling me, \"You're better off without her,\" but deep down, I know that's just a lie. We were happy once, and I'll never find anything like that again. Life is just one disappointment after another, and it feels like everything is slowly spiraling out of control. I've tried to hold on tight, but it’s slipping away from me, bit by bit. I keep thinking, \"What am I doing? Why bother?\" But I guess I’m just stuck in this cycle of pain and regret. It’s hard not to feel like I’m losing my grip on reality when every time I think things might finally get better, they just end up worse. I’ve lost count of how many times my life has fallen apart, only to fall apart again. It’s like I’m trapped in some kind of nightmare that won’t end.

It made her feel like she was never going to be able to keep up with his ease in conversation. He seemed so much more confident than her, and it was frustrating to see him glide through interactions with such ease. In comparison, she felt awkward and stiff. Every time she tried to speak, she stumbled over words, and it was clear she didn't know what she was doing. The fact that he didn't even look at her, let alone greet her warmly, reinforced the idea that she was just not meant to work here. It made her wonder if there was something fundamentally wrong with her. Maybe she was just too old-fashioned, too traditional, and just couldn't adapt to the modern world. Everything about her felt outdated, from her strict adherence to rules to her inability to connect with customers. Her mind kept drifting back to how he must have noticed her before walking by. He probably saw her struggling to make small talk, and it would've been easy to come up with a witty remark to lighten the mood. But instead, he chose to ignore her entirely, leaving her feeling even more isolated. This incident just added to her growing sense of disappointment. Why did things always go wrong for her? Why did everything seem to fall apart whenever she interacted with people? It wasn't fair; other employees seemed to handle these situations with ease. They"

It was almost 3 am, and he needed something to shake off the tiredness. As he walked past the window, he noticed a small bird perched outside, its tiny body swaying gently in the wind. The sight reminded him of his childhood, where his grandmother would tell stories of how she used to feed birds by the window during harsh winters. She'd say things like, \"You never know when you'll need someone's help,\" or \"Life is full of unexpected surprises.\" Now, as an adult, those words seemed hollow, especially given the recent arguments they'd been having about money and stability. He wondered if this little bird was somehow connected to their troubles; maybe it was a sign from his grandmother, trying to remind him of better times. But he couldn't shake the feeling that he was just reading too much into it. As he sipped his coffee, he thought back to the argument they'd had the night before. He'd come home late, exhausted from work, and she'd complained that he wasn't taking care of himself. He'd tried explaining that he was stressed out because of the job, but she'd cut me off, saying, \"We've talked about this before. You can't keep living like this. We're not meant for this kind of life.\" Her words stung, and he felt like he was drowning in them."
