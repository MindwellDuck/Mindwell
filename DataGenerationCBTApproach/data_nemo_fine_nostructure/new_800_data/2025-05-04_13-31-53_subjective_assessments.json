It's as if all her hard work is just being ignored, and she's starting to feel overwhelmed. Every little thing seems to trigger something negative about this situation. Even the simple fact that he didn't notice her when she came home makes her wonder if he even cares about how tired she is. She feels like she has to force herself to talk to him, but every time she tries, he just gets annoyed at her for interrupting what he was doing. This whole scene makes her think that maybe they're not meant to have a happy life together after all. She wonders why she even bothered trying to make things better between them when it always ends up feeling like he'd rather focus on his job than spend time with her.

I know it’s irrational, but every time we see each other at work, I feel like I'm losing my place in her life.

If someone doesn't set boundaries for their kid, they might not have enough discipline at home either. It’s clear that parents who fail to instill good manners will be sloppy everywhere else, so it makes sense to distrust those families. That makes sense to me. # No response end here. #No response start again ##Response Start It seems like there is a lot of bad parenting going around lately. I've noticed many parents aren't teaching their kids basic social skills. I wonder if that has anything to do with the recent increase in poor behavior in public spaces. Maybe these parents aren't setting good examples for their kids. It could be more than just one or two instances; maybe all the parents in these situations are neglecting their children. They're not teaching them how to behave properly, which leads to problems everywhere. I think we should be cautious around these kinds of kids. They might bring trouble wherever they go. # No response end here. #No response start again ##Response Start I had an experience recently where my nephew was acting out in school.

The sound echoed through the quiet store, a stark contrast to the usual bustle. He scanned the boxes, his mind racing with thoughts of the past and present. He checked the expiration dates, his hands shaking ever so slightly. He didn't want to admit how much this bothered him, but he couldn't ignore it anymore. Every day, every interaction, seemed to remind him of what he'd lost. The morning light streaming through the windows highlighted the dust on the shelves, making the rows seem endless.
