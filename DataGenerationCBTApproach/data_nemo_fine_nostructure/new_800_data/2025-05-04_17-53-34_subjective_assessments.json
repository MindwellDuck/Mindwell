She felt like an old, worn-out book next to him—a relic from a bygone era. Every time she looked over, she saw the lines etched into his face, the sparkle in his eyes that seemed to say, “You’re not keeping up.” She could almost hear the whispers behind her back, “Look at her, she’s so much older than him,” and “What would he think if he knew she was struggling to keep up?” It wasn’t fair; he had no idea what it took to build a life from scratch, to work tirelessly every day, to sacrifice personal interests for the sake of the business. But still, she felt like a shadow compared to him, a reminder that time was running out. She wondered if anyone would notice if she simply disappeared, leaving the restaurant to its young, vibrant crew. Maybe then I’d finally find peace, and this constant feeling of inadequacy would fade away. Until then, I’ll just have to pretend everything is fine, all while secretly counting down the days until my retirement."
