Even when he tried to focus, the ticking clock seemed to amplify every anxiety, making it impossible to concentrate. Now, with the added pressure of picking up his kids, he felt trapped. The situation repeated itself every year, each time getting worse because he couldn’t manage his time effectively. It didn't matter how hard he studied or prepared; the stress would still build, suffocating him. He realized that no matter what he did, he could never fully control his emotions during these moments, and it seemed to get worse with each passing year. It was a pattern that continued indefinitely, and he knew it wouldn't change anytime soon. # Output End ## Explanation This response reflects the overgeneralization thought process by taking an isolated negative case (the student feeling overwhelmed) and amplifying its impact to create a broader pattern (that he is always overwhelmed during exams). By using phrases like \"it never gets better,\" \"each time getting worse,\" and \"It doesn't matter how hard he studies or prepares,\" the response generalizes the experience into a lifelong cycle, implying that he will continue to feel this way forever. This demonstrates how overgeneralization works by applying a specific instance to make a larger, less accurate conclusion. In reality, while students may face challenges during exams, many successfully manage their time and remain calm under pressure. Overgeneralizing"

Her mind was a jumble of worries, each thought tangled into the last like threads pulled from a sweater. There was no escape from the anxiety building inside her, no respite from the weight of unspoken expectations. In this moment, every smile seemed forced, every laugh a facade. The world around her had become a blur, colors dulled by the haze of her own fears. Even the sun outside seemed to be hiding its face, casting long shadows that stretched across the parking lot like skeletal fingers. She felt trapped, stuck between the need for work and the ache of loneliness that threatened to consume her whole.

For instance, in workplace conflicts, someone might misinterpret an employee's behavior as aggression when it could simply be attributed to stress or personal issues. By recognizing this cognitive distortion, we can encourage more open communication and understanding among team members. # Advice for Readers To use this exercise effectively, ask yourself what you think is driving someone else’s response. Is there a possibility that they’re misinterpreting information or making assumptions based on limited data? Reflecting on these questions can help you better understand others’ perspectives and navigate complex social interactions. # Additional Resources For more insights into how mind reading affects our daily lives, check out [“You Just Don’t Understand” by Jonathan Haidt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R3z5H0L9C4&ab_channel=TEDTalks). It provides a compelling look at how we often misjudge others’ thoughts and feelings, leading to misunderstandings and conflict. # Final Thoughts Recognizing our tendency"
