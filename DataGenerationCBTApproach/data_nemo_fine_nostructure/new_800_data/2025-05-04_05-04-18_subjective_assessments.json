She must be busy, he tells himself. Busy with someone else. Someone who cares more than I do. Someone who doesn't care that I'm here, staring at these dishes. His eyes wander to the photo of them together, but it brings back painful memories. They were meant to change the world together, but she's gone. Maybe she was never really here at all. Just another one of those people you can't keep. In his mind, she represents everything he's lost: hope, love, and even some semblance of control over his life. As he works through the night, the dishes seem like reminders of what could have been - something he'll never get back. Even the data doesn't feel meaningful anymore; it's just a cruel reminder of what he's missing. Maybe it's better this way. She's probably already moved on, leaving me behind like yesterday's trash. At least then I'd know. But no, she's still there, stuck in my head like a virus, refusing to leave. He tries to focus on the work ahead, but every time he sees her name on a document, it feels like a punch to the gut. There's nothing left to do but move forward, pretending to care"

She would spend hours in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors and techniques, creating dishes that brought everyone together. His mother wasn't like that; she barely cooked, let alone create elaborate meals. Her food was simple, practical—just enough to fill their empty stomachs after long days working in the factory. As he flipped through the pages, he noticed how neatly organized her notes were, every ingredient measured out precisely, every step detailed. His own cooking attempts were haphazard at best, lacking the finesse and attention to detail she showed. He remembered the countless times they'd spent arguing over what to make for dinner, how she'd patiently guide him through the process, while he struggled to follow along. Every meal she made was perfect, a testament to her patience and dedication. His mother, on the other hand, couldn't even boil water properly. They'd spent years struggling to get by, relying on cheap, processed foods that lacked flavor. Even now, as he looked back on those meals, he realized how little they'd accomplished. They weren't nourishing anyone; they were just filling bellies until the next paycheck came. But he couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy when he thought about her ability to cook. She seemed so confident, so capable, unlike him, who could"

A faint rustle came from her bedroom, barely perceptible but enough to make her heart pound. She froze, ears straining. It happened again, louder this time. She knew she had locked up before leaving for work that morning. Her mind raced with possibilities as she grabbed the nearest heavy object - a crystal award from her bookshelf. Inching towards the bedroom door, she braced herself, her breath ragged. As she pushed it open, she saw it: a window slightly ajar, curtains billowing gently in the night breeze. Relief flooded through her, but the paranoia lingered. She checked every corner of the room before slumping onto her bed, her body trembling.",

The liquid, a vibrant blue under the harsh fluorescent lights, swirled and mixed until it was indistinguishable from the rest.

She couldn't help but wonder if she was holding them back, much like the blue dye held back by the barrier between the two test tubes. Even though she'd worked tirelessly to prepare, she felt stuck, unable to make progress. Tom seemed oblivious to her frustration, moving on as if nothing was amiss. His carefree demeanor made her realize how far behind she truly was. She could see the potential for greatness in him, something she could never achieve. He didn't even notice her struggling to hold back tears, but he did seem to sense her discomfort, his eyes flicking towards her before returning to his work. The realization hit her like a punch to the gut: She was no longer the confident scientist she once was. Instead, she was a shadow of her former self, a reminder that some things were beyond repair. She felt so overwhelmed by these thoughts that she began crying uncontrollably, tears streaming down her face as she walked away from the table. This is what happens when you're too old to start again. There's nothing left to gain, everything has already been lost. She couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequ"

She walked by the pond where they had shared countless moments, the water’s gentle lapping a cruel reminder of how much she was missing. The sound seemed to grow louder, mocking her isolation. She couldn’t help but think about him sitting with his new girlfriend, laughing together over dinner. Her own hands were tired from cooking, yet her heart felt drained from the weight of memories. She stood there, staring out at the lake, wondering why it seemed so peaceful when everything inside her felt shattered. It wasn’t just the silence; it was the emptiness that seemed to spread, touching every corner of her life. She thought about coming back to her parents’ house, but even that felt like a failure. Why would anyone want her now? Would they accept her broken heart? The question echoed in her mind like a mantra, leaving her feeling hollow and alone.

When she does finally put down the laptop, she usually ends up scrolling mindlessly through social media, wasting what could be our precious time together. I feel like she’s avoiding real connection by staying glued to her screen. It makes me wonder if she even wants to spend time with me anymore. Every single time I ask her to help with something else, like organizing the garage or fixing things around the house, she says she’ll get to it eventually but then it never happens. Sometimes she just ignores my requests altogether, which makes me think maybe she no longer sees me as important.
