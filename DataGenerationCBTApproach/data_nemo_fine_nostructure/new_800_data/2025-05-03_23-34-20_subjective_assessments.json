It's so weird that this happened now, after everything else has gone smoothly. She remembers being very stressed about how things were going, but then, BAM! This. It's like her world is falling apart again. How could this happen to her? Doesn't she have enough problems already? Her mind is racing with questions: How did I let this happen? What if someone else tried to serve this to customers? This is exactly what she needed, another setback. It feels like no matter how hard she tries, she's always one step behind. At least it doesn't feel like a mistake; maybe there's more to it than we realize. What if some kind of pest control service didn't show up on time? Or what if she simply got the wrong fish? Now, she can't stop thinking about how this might affect her reputation. If anyone finds out, it'll be all over the news, and she'll lose everything. Why does this always seem to happen to her? Why can't anything go right for once? She starts imagining all sorts of scenarios - people laughing at her, the media"

The stale coffee and quiet hum of the fridge were familiar, comforting even, but today they did little to lift her spirits. Her hands, roughened by years on the job, traced the edge of her untouched mug, a chipped 'Best Officer' souvenir from her academy days. She'd felt proud then, invincible almost. Now, it just served as a reminder of how much life had worn her down.\n\nThe door creaked open behind her, and she didn't need to turn around to know who it was. His heavy footsteps and the rustle of his uniform were unmistakable. He sat down across from her without a word, pushing an envelope towards her. She recognized the handwriting immediately - her mother's neat, looping script.\n\n\"Another letter,\" he said softly, his voice gruff with understanding. \"How many is that now?\"\n\nShe didn't answer, just stared at the envelope as if it were a venomous snake ready to strike. Inside would be more pleas for her to come home, more accusations of abandonment, more guilt-tripping about her 'real' duty as their only child.\n\nHer shift had been hard enough - two domestics back-to-back, both ending in bruised faces and shattered trust. She'd felt every punch, every scream like a physical weight on her chest. But this... this was worse. This was the kind of hurt that didn't fade with time or distance. It was the misery of knowing she couldn't fix everything, not even for herself.\n\nShe closed her eyes briefly, pinching the bridge of her nose as she took a deep breath. When she opened them again, she looked at him, her partner, her friend. \"I can't keep doing this,\" she whispered. \"I can't keep failing everyone.\"",

Then we'll look into it tomorrow.\" She nodded, feeling a small part of her resolve weaken under his reassurance.
