As I entered our bedroom, I noticed his side of the bed untouched, which seemed strange given it had been made earlier that morning. The sight unsettled me, as if the absence of his presence was palpable. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that this was more than just a simple misunderstanding. I have always found it difficult to accept when my partner is away. It’s almost as if they’re physically distant, even though they’re only in another room. This discomfort is something I’ve grown accustomed to over time, but it never really goes away completely. Sometimes, it feels like I’m missing out on something important, like the world outside has moved forward while I stay stuck in the past. I often wonder what I could’ve done differently. Maybe there was something specific about the way I prepared him for work that didn’t go well. Perhaps I missed some crucial detail, leading him to feel frustrated and rush off. These thoughts linger, making it hard for me to relax and enjoy the evening. Sometimes, I find myself replaying conversations we had earlier, analyzing every word and action. I might question whether I came across as too critical or if I said something that would upset him. Even small things, like how he put his clothes away, can become magnified in my mind. It’s as if I’m waiting for him"

She wondered if there were other things bothering him too – maybe he was struggling financially or dealing with personal issues. The thought sent a wave of empathy through her, but it also made her anxious about how to approach him. What if he didn’t want to talk, or what if he said something awkward? She pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand, but they lingered in the back of her mind. Her fingers still felt shaky, even though she tried to hide it by chatting with the new employee. She hoped he wouldn’t notice, but part of her worried he already knew and was trying to ignore it. What if he asked her out, and she turned him down, ruining their friendship? She quickly dismissed that thought as ridiculous, but the idea lingered, mixed with worries about whether he’d be upset if she forgot his birthday again or if he’d think less of her because she didn’t return his texts right away.
