His glance flicked towards her house more often than usual, she thought. The phone rang; it was her daughter-in-law, asking about the medication she'd taken yesterday. She felt a chill, wondering if they were in on something together.",

His ex-wife's absence was a hollow echo in every room, but today it felt like a physical weight, pressing on his chest as he poured himself a cup of cold coffee from yesterday. He took a sip, grimaced at the bitterness, and placed it back on the counter. Alone again, he thought, turning to face the canvas he'd abandoned days ago.

The scent of aged paper and faint traces of her perfume wafted up as he opened it, the pages falling naturally to the place she'd left off years ago - a poem about love that endured beyond death. He traced her handwriting in the margin, a single tear dropping onto the yellowed page before he could wipe it away.",

Perhaps she would have even written more, leaving behind another treasure trove of words. The thought sent him back in time, imagining how they might have sat together, reading quietly, lost in each other's eyes, as the world outside faded into the background. In this moment, he felt like he was still holding her hand, feeling the warmth of her skin through his fingers. It was as if the passage of time had been halted, and all that existed was the two of them, surrounded by books and memories. Even now, he could almost hear her voice, softly reciting the lines, her breath against his ear, and the gentle touch of her hand on his arm. If only he could turn back the clock, he’d want her to finish that book. He imagined her smiling, her eyes sparkling, and her hands moving across the pages, filling in the gaps between sentences. She would have wanted him to read it too, maybe even written it herself for him, so he could hold her close and feel her love every night. But life moved on, and now she was gone, leaving behind nothing but these few pages, and the memory of a love that seemed to last forever. Yet, in moments like these, he felt closer to her than ever, as if she were still here, whispering secrets in his ear"

I wouldn't trust someone like that either. Always causing trouble wherever he goes. I bet he's up to no good again today too. Maybe we'll need to keep an eye on him. **C:** What's going on there? I think I see my cousin, maybe his girlfriend too. They're being really friendly, but you can tell there's something bothering them. I don't want to get involved, but I wonder if they might be having some problems. **D:** Ugh, look at him, just standing there, wasting time while I have to work hard. Doesn't seem very productive. I hope he gets fired soon, then we won't have to deal with him anymore. **E:** That guy is such a loser. He probably has no idea what he's doing. I've told him many times how incompetent he is, but he never listens. It's unbelievable how clueless he can be.

His reflection in the window behind the photo showed a man with deep lines etched around his eyes, their usual stern gaze now softened by memories of happier times. A sudden gust of wind rattled the windowpane, breaking the silence and his reverie. He sighed, picking up the photograph, tracing her image gently before tucking it back into the file. The room felt colder, heavier somehow, as he continued working, each ticking second echoing louder than the last.",

It was as if time itself had become a cruel joke, laughing at him as it sped by. Each day brought new reminders of what he'd lost—his youth, his innocence, even the promise of love. All these things had slipped through his fingers like sand in an hourglass, leaving nothing but the bitter taste of longing. He wondered if anyone would remember him when they finally left this world behind, or if he'd simply fade away, another forgotten name in the vast tapestry of human history."

The way he looked at her, as if she were some kind of monster, fueled her resolve. This wasn't about the dish itself; it was about the principle. He always took control, never listening. Now, she would make him feel like an equal, even if it meant upsetting him. That look of annoyance was just what she needed to set things right. Maybe it wouldn't change everything, but it was a step towards reclaiming power. As long as he thought he could dominate her, she'd keep stirring up trouble.
