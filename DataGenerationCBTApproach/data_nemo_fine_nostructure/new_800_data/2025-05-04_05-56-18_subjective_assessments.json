Just another late night back at work. No one else is here to see it, so I won’t bother mentioning it. Maybe she didn’t cook for herself after all; maybe she just grabbed something quick before coming home. It’s probably just as boring as every other day. In this moment, I feel like I’m overthinking things again. Why would anyone care if my partner had a good time reading? What does it matter if they enjoyed a book? They’re busy with their own life, and I need to focus on mine. It’s not worth getting upset over a small thing like that. Besides, it’s just a minor annoyance; it can wait until tomorrow. This isn’t really an issue anyway. It’s not like anything has changed between us. We’ve talked about it before, and everything will be fine. I shouldn’t let it get under my skin. I have more important things to worry about, like how much sleep I got last night. That was the real problem, not whatever little thing happened today. It’s just my mind playing tricks on me again. Letting myself get worked up over nothing. It’s pointless. It’s probably just my imagination running wild, but I feel like there might be some tension building inside him. Is it possible he’s just stressed"

It's hard not to wonder if they're secretly judging her for being single again, wondering how she ended up here alone, working through her 30s. It's almost impossible to see them all together without feeling left behind, especially when they're smiling and holding hands, while she's stuck at home, eating by herself again. Even though she knows she has nothing to compare her life to, she can't shake off the feeling that she's somehow failing at being a normal adult. Every time she cooks for herself, she thinks about what she could've been doing instead - sharing dinner with someone special. But every date ends in disappointment, and now she's even started to doubt whether she'll ever find love."

How did she allow herself to be so blind? The kitchen around her seemed to fade away, leaving only the memories and emotions tied to that one piece of paper. The pain of losing him felt just as intense now as it had back then. The years since had been filled with new experiences, but none compared to what she’d lost. Every step forward seemed to lead her further backward, reliving the same moments over and over. A part of her wanted to rip out the clipping, to erase the reminder that life wasn't always easy. But another part, stronger perhaps, held onto it tightly, refusing to let go even though it brought only sorrow. It was a constant reminder that everything she thought she knew about happiness had been a lie. She couldn’t help but wonder if she would ever find true peace. In that moment, nothing else mattered except holding onto this one memory. It was all she could cling to, a tangible link to a love that no longer existed. Everything else seemed distant, irrelevant.
