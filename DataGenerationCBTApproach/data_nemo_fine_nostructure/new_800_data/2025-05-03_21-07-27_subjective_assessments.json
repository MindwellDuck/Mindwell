I know it's irrational, but it feels like I'm losing myself again, like I'll never be whole. I just wish he was here to comfort me. He would've known exactly what to say to make me feel better."

I tried to push those feelings aside, but they lingered, making me wonder if my husband was truly happy with her. Is he still haunted by his past mistakes?

He remembered that dress, the way it had swirled around her like a galaxy of stars when she spun. And how he'd missed her call, too busy with work to answer until it was too late.\n\nA lump formed in his throat, heavy and familiar. Not for the first time, he wished he could go back, do things differently. But all he had now were these faded photographs and regrets that echoed louder than any police siren.",

Maybe he's even fixed those broken chairs after all. Still, there aren’t enough happy memories to outweigh the sadness. I miss the way my mother used to talk about her husband; the stories would fill hours. She never really spoke about him before, but after he died, she opened up about everything. Her voice sounded almost... sad. Almost. That's why I feel so guilty sometimes. I wish I could take away her pain, but I know that's impossible. I just hope she realizes that life goes on, even if we don't want it to. We have to move forward, even though it feels like the world is moving against us. Sometimes I wonder what else might be hidden in this house. Could there be other photos, other secrets? Perhaps they're waiting for me, just like this one.

I know there are plenty of other nurses here who wouldn't have put up with that kind of disrespect, but I guess I'm just more patient than they are? I mean, I've dealt with worse before, so it can't be that bad, right? It’s easy to see how someone would think this way, though. I've seen younger nurses get frustrated with patients who are difficult to handle. It makes sense that older nurses might feel differently about these situations. They’ve probably learned how to deal with them by now, which means they don’t need me to step in. Maybe Mr. Thompson has had more experience dealing with rudeness than most people realize, making him less likely to complain about it. So, maybe he really does think I’m incompetent because he knows what it takes to survive in this world. He doesn’t want anyone else to suffer the same frustrations he has faced. This isn’t fair, though. Just because I haven’t experienced those challenges yet doesn’t mean I’m inferior. I still have so much to learn from my own journey, and I believe I can grow alongside him. This isn’t about comparing myself to others; it’s about recognizing that everyone learns and grows at different rates. I hope Mr. Thompson understands that we’re both part of something bigger – we’re all in this together. We might have different perspectives, but our shared humanity unites us. By working together, we can create a better environment for everyone."
