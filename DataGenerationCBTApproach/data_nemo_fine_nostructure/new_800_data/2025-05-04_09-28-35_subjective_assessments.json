She hadn't realized she'd ordered it, and now it serves as a stark reminder of the last birthday they spent together, which ended in an argument. The guilt of that unresolved tension weighs heavily on her, as does the knowledge that this could be the last bottle of that discontinued scent.",

My sister always said I was too sensitive, but what would she know? We didn’t get along back then, so why should I have to forgive her for everything just because we’re family? It makes sense that I’d still feel bitter about it, though - after all, it was the last time we were close before Mom passed away. And now I’m left with nothing but memories, especially those painful ones. It’s like I can’t move forward until I face the truth. I really wish people wouldn’t treat me like this when I’m already so vulnerable. Just thinking about it is making me more emotional than usual. This whole situation feels like a big mistake, even if I don’t know exactly why. Maybe it’s because I saw that old perfume again, reminding me of the fight that led to our final disagreement. But honestly, I think it’s probably just some people being insensitive again."

Even though we're both artists, there's no way I can compare to what he does. His paintings are so full of life, so vibrant, unlike anything I could ever create. Everyone else seems to see it too, laughing and chatting about his latest work, while I feel like an outsider, even when I'm right next to them. I guess it doesn't matter anyway; I'll never be able to match his talent. Just looking at him makes me feel inadequate. I wish I had some of his confidence, but it's clear I don't deserve to be noticed, let alone admired."

I've always known I could scare people off with my age and stuff, but now it's so obvious. I guess I really am just an old, scary guy who can't even light up his own apartment anymore. And honestly, maybe it's for the best. I mean, I'm probably better off staying home alone anyway. This whole situation has been a warning sign for me. If I don't get out there more often, how will anyone ever know what kind of person I truly am? Maybe if I went out, people would see my good side and forget all about my age. But deep down, I know that won’t change anything. I’m still just going to be seen as that scary old man. So yeah, I might as well stay here and let everyone believe that about me. At least then I can avoid any disappointment when they find out the truth later. Who needs friends anyway? It’s funny, isn’t it? All these years, I thought I was being considerate by letting them think I’m just a little eccentric. But no, it turns out they were right all along. They must have sensed that I was a bit strange from the start."
