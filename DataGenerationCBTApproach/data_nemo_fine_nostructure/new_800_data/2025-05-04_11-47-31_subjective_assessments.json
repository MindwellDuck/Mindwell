It had been months since we last spoke, and I knew she'd be upset if she heard about this, but what if she's not here? What if...? What if she never wanted us to see each other again? What if she changed her mind about leaving? Why does the silence feel like a slap in the face? Maybe she's just busy. No, that can't be it. She always answers my calls, unless... Unless she's dead. My heart skipped a beat as I wondered how long it would take for someone to notice. Is she okay? Does she have someone new now? Do they care about me anymore? How could she just disappear like that? Wasn't there something about her behavior that made me think something was off? That look when she got the letter... Did she ever plan to tell me anything? Maybe she didn't mean it; maybe she just needed space. Could she have taken her own life? Would she even want me to know? Should I try calling her number one more time, hoping against hope that she'll answer? Or am I just trying to convince myself that everything is fine? If I don't hear back right"

I wonder what she will do next. She doesn't seem like someone who would be able to cope with something like this. It's probably going to take months for her to get over this. It's hard enough for people who have gone through trauma, but she didn't even live in the same city as him. What does she plan on doing now? It's likely that she'll just sit around the house, feeling sorry for herself. She probably thinks about him every day and wishes he was still here. I don't think she'll ever fully recover from this. It's impossible to imagine how painful this must be for her. I wish she had more support. She needs help, but she's always been independent.

Maybe they were too busy elsewhere. Or perhaps the emergency call had been handled by someone else. That would explain why the police car hadn't shown up yet. He felt a surge of resentment toward the system, thinking, \"It's always something. Nobody cares about people like us anymore.\" John couldn't help but feel a bit angry at the world, especially those in charge who didn't seem to care about their own neighbors. His thoughts drifted back to his wife, who had reminded him that he wasn't as strong as he once was. She'd said, \"Remember when we used to walk to the store together? Now, you need to rely on your oxygen tank, and I worry about you every day.\" Those words still stung, but John tried to push them aside. What did she know? She wasn't the one struggling to breathe.

It seemed like every step forward was followed by two steps back. Every new finding led to more questions, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldnâ€™t shake off the feeling that she was running out of time. She started to wonder if she was fighting a losing battle against forces beyond human control. Maybe the universe itself didnâ€™t want her to succeed. As she sat amidst the chaos of papers and broken dreams, she realized that perhaps she was just too blinded by her own expectations to see what really mattered. Maybe it wasnâ€™t about finding some magical solution, but about accepting the complexity of life for what it truly was â€“ messy, unpredictable, and sometimes cruel. And yet, she still held onto the glimmer of hope, clinging to the idea that one day, everything would fall into place. But deep down, she knew it might never happen."
