I hope you're okay somewhere else. I wish things had worked out between us. You deserve better than me, anyway. I'm such a loser. Maybe if I wasn't so weak and pathetic, you wouldn't have left me. I feel awful for feeling this way. But what about our memories? They mean nothing to me now. Our love doesn't matter anymore. Life isn't fair; sometimes bad things happen to good people. My life would've been better if you were still with me. There must be some mistake. Maybe if I try harder, I can make you stay. But deep down, I know it's futile. Why did you choose to leave? I'm going to die alone now. No one will ever love me like you did. I'm a failure and a disappointment. I"

She probably didn't even read that letter, did she?\" His gaze shifts to the teacher, who had initially offered support, but now appears defensive. \"So, why did you hand him that letter if you knew it would be hard for him?\" His words seem laced with accusation, implying that she intentionally caused distress. # Blame Shift - \"He wasn't ready\" His tone turns critical as he adds, \"And what about when you said he could submit the assignment later?

Besides, I know her singing is far better than some people's cooking. When I was growing up, everyone thought they could be a great singer until they saw me perform. Now, I have to work hard to keep up with the other seniors here, but I'm still learning and improving. My neighbor might have been there longer, but I don't think it's fair to judge me based solely on one incident. After all, she might have had more opportunities to practice, like when she lived in the city. Anyway, I'll try to improve my skills, and maybe someday I'll surprise everyone with a beautiful rendition of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\". Until then, let's focus on having fun and enjoying each other's company."
