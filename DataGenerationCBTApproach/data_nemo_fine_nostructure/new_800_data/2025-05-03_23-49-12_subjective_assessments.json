He wished she could understand how much this hurt him. Every little thing reminded him of what he’d lost - her smile, her laughter, even the way she used to talk about life. Now everything felt dull and grey, like a distant memory fading away. His mind kept replaying all those moments when she would say things like, “I’m glad you’re here,” or “You always know how to make me laugh.” Those words now cut deeper than ever, making him feel even more alone.

The way she'd hold it so gently, the way the bristles would spring back when she used it. It wasn't just an object anymore—it was a reminder of everything he'd missed after she left. He couldn't help but think about how much she'd loved it, how she'd always talk about it in the most endearing ways. The memory of her voice lingered, like the scent of old paint on a canvas—both nostalgic and painful. Every time he picked up the brush, he felt like he was reaching out to something more than just a tool—a connection to the life they once shared.
