She's not really worried; I wouldn't worry if I were her. It's probably just a mouse. Probably just a weird reflection off the shelves. She'll see what it is soon enough, and everything will be okay. She'll go about her day, restock the shelves, make some small talk with customers, and we'll all forget this ever happened. That sounds normal, right? It's probably nothing.

I think he's just trying to get back at me for leaving him. It makes sense; why else would he come back now? He's probably going to ask me to marry him again, and I'll have no choice but to say yes. If I don't, he'll break off contact and leave forever. I need to prepare myself mentally for this next phase of our relationship. I'll just wait patiently for his return and hope things work out."

If she wasn't imagining things, then it's possible that she left the container open and it got contaminated somehow. But if she did, wouldn't she have seen anything? It looks like nothing but a tiny white chunk, almost invisible against the wood grain. She felt like she was going crazy, but at the same time, it seemed completely plausible that this was some kind of fungus or parasite that had been growing in the dark corners of her room for months. If she didn't wipe it down immediately, would it spread and infect everything else? Or was it just a harmless bit of mold? Maybe she'd accidentally ingested it through touching the surface. The more she thought about it, the crazier it sounded—like something out of a horror movie. But what if it really was a sign of some unknown infestation? Wouldn't she know if there were actual bugs or creatures hiding in the walls? Was she just overreacting or was this actually something sinister? She tried to push the thoughts away, but they lingered in the back of her mind. What if she's not even alone in the house? What if"

It feels selfish, but she doesn't let guilt stop her. Tonight, she lets go of the need to keep up appearances, to fit into someone else's mold. Maybe she deserves more than just \"good enough\" or a paycheck. Maybe she can have a life worth living, even if it means leaving some things behind. This time, she says no to the shift, knowing it might mean losing a friend, but also gaining something new. It's hard to explain, but being here, away from the constant stress and pressure, makes her realize she's still got so much to explore within herself. She feels a sense of peace wash over her, something she hasn’t felt in months.

I'm trapped in this cycle of guilt and shame, wondering how I let things get so out of control. I guess I just feel like I don’t deserve respect anymore. Maybe I’m not worth it, considering everything I’ve done. I feel like I’m just pretending to be someone I’m not—a perfect doctor, hiding all these flaws inside. But deep down, I know the truth—I’m failing myself, and everyone around me. That word keeps haunting me: “unhealthy.” It’s like a shadow following me everywhere, reminding me of all my shortcomings. I’m stuck in this rut, unable to break free. Even thinking about changing doesn’t seem realistic. I feel like I’d have to start over from scratch, and that thought is overwhelming.

Every little thing seemed more difficult today, especially since he was late getting home. It didn’t help that the wind blew a paper receipt onto his face, making him feel annoyed and frustrated.

And now, with this letter, everything feels so personal. It's as if she's been living in a bubble, oblivious to what's going on around her, until this moment. In reality, maybe I am reading too much into it, but it feels like the world is closing in, and I'm right in the middle of it. It’s hard not to feel like I’m being pulled back in, even though logically I know it doesn’t make sense. Maybe it’s just my imagination running wild again, but hearing the sound of footsteps outside makes me wonder if anyone else has received similar letters? Does everyone think about the past the same way I do? Why does it feel so... personal? It started with small things - the strange noises at night, the feeling of being watched, and then the letter.
