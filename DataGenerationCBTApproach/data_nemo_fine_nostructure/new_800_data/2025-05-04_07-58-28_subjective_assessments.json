She'll probably think about how great our wedding day turned out despite some issues with the photographer. That reminds me - I wonder if they still have the negative film from that session. Maybe we could ask them to print it again, even though we already have copies. If they did, I bet the photo would show us both looking better than this one. Oh well, at least I can tell people now that I don't have a clear picture of our first dance. What if someone saw this photo? They'd definitely think I didn't look good. And what about my parents? They might criticize me for having such poor quality photos. Why did we keep that camera anyway? We should have gotten professional photos instead of taking our own.

He thinks about all the times she posted about her adventures, the fun she had exploring the city, while he was stuck at home, working late nights. Her posts are full of joy and excitement, making him feel inadequate by comparison. Even though he knows that everyone has their own stories, it’s hard for him to see beyond the surface level of her life. It feels like every time she shares something happy, he gets pulled into the feeling that he doesn’t belong. He starts to wonder if there’s even a chance for them to connect now, considering the distance between them.

This isn't a big deal. She's just checking in with friends or family. It's probably nothing serious. What if it is, though? The worst-case scenario is that it's something important but she's too embarrassed to tell me because she thinks I'll think less of her. But I wouldn't care either way. It's not my business anyway.

This isn't just about a single incident; it's about everything that has happened between us. Every time I try to make things work, every effort I make is met with disappointment. She's always pushing me away, and it hurts more than anything else. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, trying to keep up appearances, but deep down, I know there's no point. It's not about what I can do or say; it's just about her perception of me. Even when I think about our past, all I see are moments of sadness and regret. It's hard to find joy in the memories when every new experience feels like a step backward. I want to believe that things could change, that maybe someday she'll see me again, but until then, I'm left here, feeling empty, like I'm just waiting for something that will never happen. It's not just about being \"good enough.\" It's about being worthy of her love, which feels increasingly distant. When I look back, I realize that every attempt"

It was then that I realized - I'm not alone here. There is someone else who knows what it feels like to lose everything. Someone who understands that this moment isn't just about painting; it's about holding onto something that's gone. And I know exactly how they'll react when they see me, because I've seen it before.

Maybe she was just imagining things. But what if someone did try to sabotage her work? She didn't want to think about it, so she pushed the thought away. This could be nothing; she was probably just stressed from work. Besides, she was used to people making fun of her art anyway. So, who cares what one person thinks? She turned to leave, feeling a bit better. Everything else in the gallery seemed normal. Just her imagination playing tricks on her again. She knew she’d feel more at ease when she got home and could relax without being here. And honestly, she needed to get back to work anyway. She wouldn't let some minor anxiety hold her back.
