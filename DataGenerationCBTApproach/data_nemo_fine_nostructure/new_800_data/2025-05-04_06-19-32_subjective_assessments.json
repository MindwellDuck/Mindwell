She had always been so supportive during his studies; now, she seemed to be shunning him entirely. When he brought it up, she just shrugged, saying she'd grown apart from him over time. But why would she do that? Hadn't they worked together to build a life together? He remembered how she used to read his papers and offer insightful comments. Now, her responses felt distant, even dismissive. Did she really expect him to move forward without trying to reconnect? As he thought back to their last conversation, Dr. H. recalled how hurt he’d felt when she mentioned moving on. Didn’t she understand how much this meant to him? All those late nights spent studying, all the sacrifices he made for her and their future… didn't she care anymore? She claimed she was just busy with work, but what about our plans? Did she think he could just forget everything we’d shared? Didn’t she see how hard I was working to make our marriage strong? When Dr. H. confronted her again, she seemed defensive, almost angry. “You’re just upset because you can’t handle your own emotions,” she said. “It’s not fair to blame me for your feelings.” But wasn’t it fair to blame her for making him feel like he wasn’t important? At first, Dr. H. tried to let go of his anger, to focus"

She'll never change; she's too invested in her own needs. Our relationship was doomed from the start. Now, she thinks she can just move on with her life? It won’t work out that easily. She doesn’t understand what love means, especially after everything she put me through. I deserve better than someone who would treat me like this.

It wasn’t just one missed message; it seemed like there were multiple times when he didn’t respond right away, leaving her with more questions than answers. Even before checking the phone again, she started thinking about how she could have misinterpreted everything. Maybe he didn’t see the message because his phone was dead, or perhaps he was too busy to notice it. But these rationalizations did little to calm her racing thoughts. The inability to reach him, coupled with the fact that he hadn’t responded to anything else from her—calls, texts, emails—the longer the wait, the more she became convinced that something serious was happening. Each passing minute felt like an eternity, and she found herself getting increasingly agitated, as if trying to control the situation through her actions was all that mattered."

It's like all those happy moments have been buried under the weight of life. I can't help but think that if we were still together, this wouldn't be happening - there would be no dust. Dust is just a reminder of how fast everything changes, and how things fall apart. Life is so fleeting; nothing stays the same forever. I guess what bothers me most is that even though I've moved on, this photo remains here, untouched, with its beauty slowly being obscured by dust. It's heartbreaking to see something so precious like that fade away. If only we could hold onto the past a bit longer, maybe we could preserve some of that love. But even that’s impossible now. All I'm left with is the feeling of loss and the realization that dust accumulates over time, much like memories and feelings. Now, I feel like dusting isn’t enough - I need to wash away the pain that comes with every passing day. Maybe one day, when I find someone new, they'll understand why I'm holding on to the past. Until then, I’ll keep dusting, hoping that someday, somehow, I'll get to relive those moments again. But for now, I just want to let go of the dust, not just physically, but emotionally too. It feels like it's suffocating me"

But no, it's definitely a ploy, and I know it. She's just playing games again, pretending to be nice while secretly manipulating everyone around her. And what's with that book? Is she studying something in there that she doesn't want me to see? She knows how much I value those notes, how they're helping me understand the subject better. So why would she look at it?
