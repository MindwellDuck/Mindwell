You're not going to face your feelings?\" He shook his head, looking frustrated. \"I'm just tired. Let's get some rest.\" I felt guilty for saying what I did, but deep down, I knew I was right. We shouldn't have talked about it after such a traumatic event. He needed time to process his emotions, and I couldn't bear the thought of him reliving the pain again. But as I stood there, watching him walk out of the room, I realized that maybe I had misjudged him. Maybe he needed me more than he seemed to let on. My heart went out to him, and I wanted to hold him tight and tell him that everything would be okay. I wanted to comfort him and support him through this difficult time, but instead, I pushed him away. Now, I feel terrible about what I said."

Her partner, once her sous chef and constant companion, was now confined to a hospital bed, leaving her with an emptiness she couldn't fill with even the busiest dinner rush. As she tasted the sauce, she found herself longing for his critical eye, his gruff approval at just the right moment. But tonight, like every other night since he'd been gone, there was no one to share in her creation but the silent walls and the creeping loneliness that filled them.",

Every day felt like a step closer to losing him, and yet, she still couldn’t help but feel guilty about how much she enjoyed the freedom of running the restaurant alone. It wasn’t fair to the staff, but what if she needed more than just her own strength to carry on? As she stirred, memories flooded back – the first time they cooked together, the countless nights spent testing recipes until they were perfect, and the early mornings when they would sneak out to taste whatever they created. She remembered the way he smiled when she finally perfected a sauce he’d requested, and how he always seemed to know exactly when to offer a word of encouragement. Now, as she waited for the sauce to thicken, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she might never experience those moments again. Maybe, if he was still here, he wouldn’t have left, and they wouldn’t be facing this difficult time together. She began to wonder if there were things she could’ve done differently—ways to make their relationship stronger before it ended.

It felt like a small part of me was dying with each passing day, as if the years were slowly unraveling within her, leaving nothing but a tapestry of memories and sorrow. In that moment, I couldn't help but feel the weight of her grief, and how much pain lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered. The way she looked up, her eyes locking onto mine for just a fraction of a second before rushing off to tend to another patient, seemed almost... urgent. As if she needed to remind herself that even now, she still held power over something—a life, no matter how fleeting. And yet, there was so much pain in her eyes, it felt like she was mourning what could have been, rather than simply celebrating what already was. That quiet strength, that resilience born of hardship, seemed to hold her together, but at what cost? With each passing year, she carried more burdens, more losses, and more memories, each one etched deeper into her soul. I couldn't help but wonder if she ever truly felt free, or if the weight of her responsibilities continued to haunt her, binding her to the very thing that took everything from her"
