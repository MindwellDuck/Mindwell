He paused by a locked supply closet, remembering how his ex-wife, also a nurse, had stolen supplies to sell on the black market. He heard footsteps approaching and quickly hid as his replacement, a young, eager nurse, opened the door with a keycard, revealing shelves stocked with untouched supplies. The old man's grip tightened on his cane, knuckles turning white with suppressed spite.",

The way he leaned into his chair, elbows on knees, grinning, seemed so genuine—like it wasn’t about him, either. But then someone said something like, “It’s funny because we all know what happens next,” and she realized those words were meant for her. It was like being hit with a wave of embarrassment, knowing exactly how ridiculous it sounded, yet unable to stop herself from feeling exposed. It was hard not to wonder if everyone else found her humor cringe-worthy too, especially after the way she’d reacted to similar jokes in the past—laughing along, pretending it was just another thing, until she left the room and no one was looking. Now, sitting alone at her desk, she felt like she was drowning in her own awkwardness, even though deep down, she knew it was probably just the usual office gossip. Still, every time she heard someone say, “Oh, you’re going to have to write about that,” she could feel the tension building inside her, like she was waiting for the punchline that would make her look like a fool once more. She tried to shake off the feeling, telling herself it was just nerves, but the voice in her head kept whispering, “They think I’m a joke.”"

Instead, look for clear explanations or ask questions to clarify things. * If you notice yourself making assumptions, take a step back and try to understand why you're doing so. Are you trying to fill a gap in information? Are you worried about being hurt? * Remember, just because you think someone might be lying or hiding something doesn't mean they are. Try to approach situations with an open mind and give people the benefit of the doubt until you have solid evidence to the contrary. * Sometimes, we jump to conclusions because we're scared or anxious. Take a deep breath, calm down, and re-evaluate the situation when you feel more centered. You can't change the past, but you can learn from your mistakes and grow as a person. - [Feedback from AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Self/comments/1k2zg5a/cognitive_distortion_feeling_fear_or_anxiety/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ios"
