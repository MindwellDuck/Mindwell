It's from him, the ex-boyfriend she'd ghosted after their heated argument months ago. She hesitates, thumb hovering over the play button, regret gnawing at her insides like a relentless tide. The unopened message is a stark reminder of words left unsaid and bridges burned. Her current partner's soft snores from the other room serve as a cruel contrast to the lonely echo of that forgotten conversation.",

The fact that he didn’t even bother telling me directly is exactly like how he treats everyone else who doesn’t meet his expectations. I bet the other cooks are already dreading tomorrow because they know what will happen if they don’t get everything perfect.

She doesn't understand how hard it is to manage everything on her own after his passing. We've lost our home, our savings, and now...now this. Every day is a struggle, and somehow, she thinks I'm the problem? Maybe it's because I remind her of what we had, of what she'll never have again. Maybe it's because I know exactly how much pain this dish could bring back.
