She opens an envelope containing a bloodstained letter meant for her, written by the convicted killer she'd helped put away years ago. The ink is smudged as if tears had fallen on it. Her heart sinks as she reads, \"I know you were just doing your job, but I can't forgive you. Not yet.\" She feels a familiar pang of guilt, followed by a creeping dread.",

It all made sense now - she realized why I couldn't focus on anything else. Why I kept making mistakes at work. She knew it wasn't just because of my lack of experience; it was because of something deeper. Something rooted in my past. And now she had proof. ## Step 1: Understand the Triggering Event Identify the event that triggered your negative thoughts and emotions. This could be a specific situation, memory, or feeling that led to your conclusion. In this case, it's the conversation between the two characters where your boss tells you that you're useless. ## Step 2: Reflect on Your Thoughts Consider what you thought during the triggering event. What ideas did you come up with? How did these thoughts make you feel? Take note of whether you jumped to conclusions based on limited information. ## Step 3: Analyze Your Cognition Think about how you arrived at your conclusion. Were there any biases or assumptions you made? Did you overlook important details or consider alternative explanations? ## Step 4: Evaluate Your Emotions Reflect on how you felt during and after the event. Were your emotions"

I see them posting pictures of happy moments with their loved ones, while I'm just stuck here by myself. Why does everyone else get to experience love and happiness when I’m still waiting for something that might never come? It feels like no matter what I do, everything is always one step behind. I can't help but think that maybe they're not even seeing the good things in my life; all they notice are the things that make me different from them. But honestly, being alone isn’t so bad… Is it? I know I shouldn’t be comparing myself to others, but it’s hard not to when everyone else has someone to share their days with. Even the friends I’ve lost contact with seem happier now than they were back then. I keep telling myself that I’ll eventually find someone too, but deep down, I wonder if I'll ever really fit in somewhere. Maybe I’m just not meant to have a family of my own. Maybe this is my fate – to watch others move forward while I stay behind. Sometimes I wish I could turn back time and erase all the memories that remind me of what I don’t have. But"
