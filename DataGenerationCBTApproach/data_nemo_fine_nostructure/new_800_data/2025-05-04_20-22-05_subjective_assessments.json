It was what I felt when he came home from work after a long day. He'd walk through the door, exhausted, but with his arms open. And I'd feel...this. This sense of longing that seemed to fill me up. Not sadness exactly, but a deep yearning. A desire to be close, to hold him tight, to hear his voice. It wasn't just loneliness; it was...appreciation. For the love we share, for the memories we make, for the life we built together. Tonight, as I cooked dinner, my mind wandered back to our time off, our adventures, our laughter. I remembered how he'd surprise me with little gestures - bringing home coffee because I had a bad day, or surprising me with his favorite food when I was feeling down. Those moments were always special, and now, they felt precious. I couldn't help but wonder if he missed me too, if he thought about us, if he wondered why I hadn't called yet.

After all, no one takes him seriously when they meet him—his lack of confidence is so obvious, it makes me want to tell him he’s just not cut out for this industry. Why did we even hire him? I swear, if he wasn’t already struggling, I wouldn’t have to deal with his constant tears and tantrums now. It really doesn’t help that I have to work alongside someone who can’t keep up with the pace of the kitchen. At least I don’t cry every five minutes like some kind of emotional mess. **---** --- I think the response starts off by using phrases that seem to imply that the person is unhappy with the other person's behavior (e.g., \"such a bad chef,\" \"not cut out for this industry\"). The tone suggests disappointment and possibly frustration, which might be interpreted as a sign of self-control rather than the actual emotion. This interpretation could lead the reader to believe that the person is simply pointing out facts without taking personal responsibility for their emotions. Next, the phrase \"why didn't he just leave?\" introduces an idea that the person feels the other individual has the power to make decisions about their life, implying a sense of control and potentially making them feel like they are being unfairly blamed. This sentiment could be seen as a reflection of the 'Blaming' distortion, where the person shifts the focus away from their"

Her hand trembled slightly as she reached for her phone, scrolling through old messages until she found it - a text from her daughter, sent six months ago: \"I wish you'd been there, Mom.\" The words struck her like a punch to the gut, a reminder of every missed birthday, forgotten promise, and fractured relationship left in the wake of her divorce.

She remembered the countless times he'd said he needed space, but deep down, she felt it was more than that - he'd chosen his own life over their daughter's needs, leaving her to pick up the pieces. Even now, as she sat alone, a wave of resentment washed over her. Why hadn't he tried harder? Why had he walked out on them all? Her gaze drifted back to the photo, and she felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes. Her mind replayed moments long past, reliving the memories of happier times, when they'd been a team, working together to create a perfect home. But those days were just memories now, replaced by the harsh reality of her failure. If only she could go back, if only she could make it right, maybe things wouldn’t have fallen apart so badly. As she sat there, lost in thought, she realized something important: she wasn't alone. There was her sister, who had been there for her through thick and thin, offering support whenever she needed it. And then there was her best friend, who had stood by her side during the darkest moments. They both understood the pain of losing someone you loved"
