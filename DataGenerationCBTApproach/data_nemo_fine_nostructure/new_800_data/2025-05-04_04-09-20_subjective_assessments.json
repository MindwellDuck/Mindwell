Maybe if he'd been more understanding, it wouldn't have happened again. But no, he shouldn't have gotten upset when someone forgot his name. That's what makes him stand out - his perfectionism. If he relaxed, maybe he could avoid these feelings. It's just part of who he is, but he wishes people would stop taking advantage of him because of it. And yeah, he knows it sounds ridiculous, but he really feels like nobody cares about him anymore. He keeps telling himself it's fine, that everyone gets forgotten sometimes, especially during rush hour. So why does it still hurt so much? He told himself he was overreacting, that he needed to calm down and move on. But deep down, he knew it wasn't true."

He'd never care enough to fight for anything meaningful. Her life became a series of small disappointments, each one piling onto the last. Even now, years after the divorce, she couldn’t help but feel like she’d wasted her whole life waiting for someone who never wanted to be with her. It was pointless, just like everything else. Every moment spent alone was a reminder of his absence, a painful echo of all that she would never have. Her friends tried to tell her otherwise, to remind her of happier times, but nothing worked. They didn’t understand; they weren’t married, they didn’t know what it meant to lose something so precious, so irreplaceable. I’m not over him yet. I’ll wait forever until he comes back. But deep down, we both know he’s gone for good. We’re just holding on for the sake of appearances, pretending everything is fine when it’s far from it. Still, he doesn’t matter anymore. I’ve moved on. He’s just a memory—a fleeting thought, something I can push away and focus on the future. Yet,"

They're not genuine; they're just using people like pawns in a game they know how to play. If I had a dollar for every time one of these fake smiles made my blood boil, I'd be rich by now.

No, we're working hard over there, and if you don't like it, maybe you shouldn't be here. This place is full of people like that - young, naive, and blinded by their own ambitions.

There’s always a hint of sadness there, a reminder that they’re not immune to pain either. Maybe I’m just too blind to notice, or maybe we all carry our own versions of sorrow. Either way, it feels unfair to compare ourselves when everyone has their own story.
