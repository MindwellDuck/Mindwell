Today, as she reaches for a particularly delicate glass ornament, her phone rings unexpectedly, making her jump. It's her husband, calling to say he'll be late for their anniversary dinner due to an unexpected meeting. Her heart begins to race, hands trembling as she places the ornament back on the shelf, suddenly afraid it might break.

When she tried to explain her issues, people would often respond with \"It's just so easy for me\" or \"You're really overreacting,\" leaving her feeling frustrated and inadequate. It's like no matter how hard she tries, she always ends up falling behind."

They saw me as nothing more than an inconvenience, a reminder of their own lack of empathy. Every time I tried to explain how much it hurt to be forgotten like this, I was met with condescending smiles and snickers. The only thing they seemed to care about was how their workload would be affected by my departure. No matter how many times I pointed out that we were more than just a number, they treated me like a disposable cog. It was infuriating to see them celebrate their own success while ignoring my pain. The way they brushed off my suffering with flippant remarks made me feel worthless, like I was nothing more than a burden.

First, they raise the rent; next, the pipes burst, flooding the basement again, and now... now, I'm stuck in the dark with nothing but my imagination running wild. I swear, this guy is trying to make me lose it. But what does he expect? I don't get paid enough to deal with this shit. This isn't my fault, but I'm still being blamed anyway. I guess the owner thinks I'm some kind of idiot because I didn't check if the back door was locked before closing up. Well, let him know that I'll never forget this night and won't hesitate to tell everyone what a terrible business he runs. He's going down. I hope someone finds this post and reads it, because honestly, I don’t think anyone else will see it. What’s the point? I’m just so tired of dealing with people like this, who think they can treat us poorly and get away with it. This place needs new management, and I wish them both luck in finding someone else to cover the shift. We certainly need more than what we got tonight."
