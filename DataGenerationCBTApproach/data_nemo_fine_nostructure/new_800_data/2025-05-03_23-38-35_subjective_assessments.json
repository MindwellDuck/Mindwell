She hadn't laughed like that in months, not since he retired and they were together all day. He felt a pang in his chest, a familiar warmth spreading through him, but this time it was bitter, accompanied by a tightness in his throat. Jealousy gnawed at him as he watched their easy conversation, the intimacy of their shared laughter. He turned away, hiding his face from them, and busied himself with watering the plants, the green leaves trembling slightly under his shaking hands.",

Maybe they‚Äôre not just random symbols; maybe they hold some deeper meaning‚Äîperhaps even a warning? This whole situation makes me think about how much of a mystery life really is. Sometimes you see things out of the corner of your eye, and before you know it, you're convinced that someone is watching you. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre all just pawns in a game we don‚Äôt fully understand. Even the smallest actions can have big consequences. Just because the mailbox is empty doesn‚Äôt mean everything is okay.
