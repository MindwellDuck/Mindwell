The pressure readings were off by such a large margin that I wonder if I should question whether they're actually reliable. But I'm sure it's just my anxiety playing tricks on me again—maybe I should focus on the bigger picture and stop worrying so much about this one mistake. My colleagues would surely agree with me if they saw how upset I am over this. I really shouldn't let my emotions get in the way of my work. I guess I just need to take a step back, breathe, and try to approach things more objectively. Maybe then I can truly understand what happened."

His favorite mug sits here, untouched, reminding me of happy times. I wish I could turn back time and be there for him when he needed me most. This must have been so hard for him, leaving us all behind. I can’t help but think about what could’ve been if he was still with us. Maybe things wouldn’t feel so empty now. I miss him so much. I wish I had more time with him, but life has a way of surprising you. I hope he found peace wherever he went. I’ll always remember him smiling as he poured himself a cup from that very same mug. It brings tears to my eyes just looking at it. I want to hold onto these memories forever, but I also know that holding on too tightly won’t change anything. I just wish I could go back and make him proud one last time. He deserved that, and I deserve to honor his memory by living our dreams. But now, I’m left with this mug, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m losing myself along with him. I guess I just need some time to heal and find my own path again"

It feels like everything is falling apart – the marriage, the career, even the dreams he once held dear. Each day, each missed opportunity, each unfulfilled promise chills him to the bone. This isn't how he envisioned his life. Now, all he wants is to curl up and hide, but the reality is that there's nothing left to hide from. He knows he has to face it head-on, but the weight of those rejections, of being ignored, makes every step feel heavier. Even the darkness outside seems oppressive, as if the city itself is closing in on him. He tries to shake off the feeling of despair, but it clings to him like a shadow, refusing to let go. With a sigh, he lays back and closes his eyes, trying to drown out the doubts that swirl in his mind."
