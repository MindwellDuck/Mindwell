The clock ticked louder than usual, each second echoing like a gunshot in his mind. His breath hitched as he noticed the empty space beside him where her picture used to be. It was gone now, tucked away after last night's panic attack. His heart pounded, his palms grew sweaty. He felt it again, that familiar tightness in his chest. The room began to spin. He grabbed for the chair but missed, crumpling onto the floor. His radio crackled with life, mocking him as he fought to breathe around the ghost of her memory.",

We didn't say anything more. I'm worried. Her car is still here. I don't know what happened to her. Maybe she changed her mind. I'll call her phone again. If she doesn't answer, maybe she went somewhere else. I'll try calling her friends. What if someone found her? What if they're trying to hide something from me? I need to get out there. I can't stay here. I have to check on her. But what if I find something I'd rather not see? I should probably call the police. They might be looking for her. I'll start by checking the park near our place. I feel a little better knowing I'm doing something. I'll keep going until I find her."

Her husband should have been here to pick her up by now. She checks her phone; no messages. A familiar knot tightens in her chest as she imagines scenarios where he might be stuck in traffic, his car broken down, or worse—an accident. She starts pacing, fingers tapping nervously on the counter, eyes darting towards the door every few seconds. The store is empty and quiet, save for the hum of the neon lights flickering above.

Her hands, once so capable and sure, now trembled slightly as she held a familiar recipe card yellowed with age. The words swam before her eyes, tears threatening to spill over. She'd made this beef bourguignon a thousand times, but today, the measurements seemed like hieroglyphics. The cutting board, usually her battlefield of choice, lay untouched while she clung to the countertop, feeling more lost than when they'd first moved into this house as newlyweds. Every sizzle from the stove echoed mockingly, each aroma a reminder of what was no longer there to share it with. Her body ached with fatigue, not just from years of service, but from the relentless weight of her own helplessness.",

What if we miss the deadline? This isn’t helping at all! Why did I let her forget again?! We were supposed to practice our presentation today, and now it feels pointless.

She had worked tirelessly for years, trying to get this story to air because she knew it would have a significant impact on people's lives. She had been assured by multiple sources that the allegations were unfounded, but still, the hurtful words stung. It wasn't until days later, when another source came forward confirming her good faith, that she began to breathe again. The other journalist told her how much he admired her dedication to telling the truth, even if it meant going against the tide. He said he'd never seen anyone so passionate about exposing corruption, and that his own career was inspired by hers. For the first time since receiving the email, she smiled. This was proof that some people truly cared about what she did, and that there were still those who believed in the power of journalism as a force for change. In the end, the story aired, and she received widespread praise for her work. Her colleagues rallied around her, and the media outlet praised her commitment to ethics. But deep down, she knew she'd already lost something precious—a piece of herself—that could never be regained. This is just one example.
