This isn't the first time something like this has happened, and I worry that these days, being polite just doesn’t pay off. Maybe I’m just too old-fashioned, but it seems like no one appreciates what we used to respect each other for. I feel like I'm losing my patience because of it, and I wonder if there’s anything I could do to change their minds. But honestly, some people just seem to hate us now, and it hurts to see. Sometimes I wish I could go back when things were simpler, but deep down, I know that won't happen. This world keeps getting tougher, and it's hard not to feel frustrated. At least I still get discounts, right? At least I still get discounts, right? Maybe I need to take up gardening again; that always brought me peace, but even then, I'm worried I'll come across as annoying.

He'd been noticing changes in himself lately, feeling older than he wanted to admit. Maybe he was projecting those feelings onto others, seeing them as a reflection of his own declining energy. I wondered if he even realized how much he was filtering out, focusing only on the surface level of things, like the way the kids were moving too fast for their age or the way the woman was laughing too loudly. It all felt so... simple, almost childish, compared to the complexity of life he once knew. As I continued to observe, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy for this man who seemed lost in his own thoughts. His mind was full of memories, some happy, some painful, each one layered over the next, creating a rich tapestry of experiences. Yet, when it came to the young couple, he was only seeing fragments—their laughter, the way they carried their boxes.

We had big plans together, and she always put me first. When she died, it felt like she took away more than just herself; she ripped apart our future.
