I should've been more organized if I'd only taken a few minutes to check the schedule. Now look at me—running around like a chicken with its head cut off, worrying about something so insignificant. And to make matters worse, I really need to get that recipe book. My mother would kill me if she knew I lost it. The thought alone makes me want to cry.

The radio squawked softly from its clip, but she silenced it, not wanting to disturb the peaceful scene. Her husband stood at the kitchen counter, his shoulders hunched as he rubbed at a stubborn stain on his hands. He didn't turn around when she entered, and that's when she noticed the faded bloodstains on his shirt, the one she'd bought him for their anniversary last year.\n\nHer heart sank like a stone in her chest. She'd seen enough blood to know it was old, dried. She stepped closer, her boots echoing softly on the tiled floor. He finally turned around, his eyes hollow and haunted, a stark contrast to his usually warm smile. In his hands, he held the shirt like an accusation, a silent testament to the life they'd taken yesterday.\n\n\"I couldn't bring myself to throw it out,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It's not your fault, you know that. We were just doing our job.\"\n\nBut she didn't feel like it was their job. Not today. Today, it felt personal, and the remorse sat heavy in her stomach, threatening to spill over. She took the shirt from him, folding it carefully before placing it in a bag meant for evidence. But this wasn't evidence. This was her reminder, her penance.\n\nShe looked at him then, really looked. The lines around his eyes were deeper than she remembered, and there was a weariness in his posture that spoke of more than just the physical labor of their jobs. She reached out, taking his hand in hers, offering what little comfort she could. But even as she did, she felt the weight of her own remorse, a silent companion that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day.",

And yet, he still wore that look of innocence, as if he were merely doing his job. His wife, on the other hand, seemed shaken. She kept glancing at the body, her eyes wide with fear, as if she feared being next. It made her wonder if she truly loved him, if she knew him at all. Did she really think he wouldn't kill her too? That he wouldn't see her as nothing more than a disposable piece of equipment? As she watched her husband work, she realized that she might have misjudged him. Maybe he wasn't the good man everyone thought he was. Maybe he was just another killer, driven by whatever demons possessed him. A chill ran down her spine as she gazed at the bloodstains on his shirt, wondering if those stains told a different story—of guilt, perhaps, of a conscience torn apart by the actions he'd committed. Now, she felt like she'd lost herself in the process of getting to know him. Was she ready to accept that he wasn't the man she thought he was? That he might be more monster than"
