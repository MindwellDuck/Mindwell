I wonder if she regrets making those decisions that led to their breakup. Maybe she wishes things had turned out differently. She might be feeling trapped by the past. I think she must have been overwhelmed by all the emotions associated with that trip. It could be that she felt suffocated by the experience and couldn’t bear to see it again. Perhaps she fears that the memory will haunt her forever. It’s possible she believes she’ll never find happiness like we did. She may feel that she lost something special, and it’s hard for her to move on. This is why she needs to get rid of everything reminding her of our time together."

It seemed so easy for them; they were here for reasons other than him. They weren't under scrutiny, and yet they spoke freely about everything except what had brought them there. He felt like an oddity, a misplaced puzzle piece in a world where everyone else fit together seamlessly. Even the officers, who had once been kind to him, now looked at him differently, their expressions neutral or critical. Their voices, usually warm and encouraging, were laced with a subtle disapproval that made him feel invisible. His mind raced with thoughts of his past mistakes, the times he'd failed to meet expectations, the disappointments that lingered in every corner of his life. As he sat there, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being judged harsher because he wasn't one of them - not part of this group, not worthy of their empathy. Everyone else seemed to have found a purpose here, while he felt lost and out of place, like a ghost hovering on the periphery of their lives.

And now, after hearing what happened with our project last week, I can’t shake off the feeling that things are really falling apart here. What if we can’t recover from this? It's as if everything has become personal – my own problems are intertwined with everyone else's mistakes. I'm starting to feel like there’s no escape. This isn’t just about me anymore; it affects everyone around me. The thought of losing credibility, not being able to deliver, and facing the consequences makes me want to scream. All I can think about is how much pressure is building up inside me. Every time I try to calm down, these thoughts come flooding back, making it impossible for me to relax. How can I ever trust anyone when everything feels so unstable? It feels like nothing matters except for these constant worries. Even the smallest setbacks seem monumental right now. I wish I could just turn everything off, but I know deep down that I’m the one who needs to find a way to manage this.
