She'd bought it for herself yesterday, a small act of kindness she allowed herself each week. Today, it seemed like a mockery, a reminder of what she didn't have. She felt a familiar lump rise in her throat as she threw the daisy into the trash, her eyes welling up with tears that refused to fall.",

Maybe if we had more money, things would be better between us. I don't know why she has to be so cruel. Why did she even get such a cheap flower? It looks pathetic. Does she really think I'd appreciate something like this? This is all her fault anyway. If she wasn't so stingy with our allowance, I wouldn't need to feel this way.

The speaker may genuinely believe they should feel relieved about their wife's passing but doesn't acknowledge the disconnect between their expected emotional state and actual feeling.

It seemed like an afterthought, something tossed together with a shrug. The fact that it wasn't typed suggested she was having another one of her days, but he knew better. She never did anything like that; besides, where was the point? If she wanted him to know, wouldn't she have just called instead? His mind started racing as he picked up his fork, each bite feeling like a punch to the gut. Maybe she's busy with work again, or perhaps there's some other woman involved. Why would she choose to spend another night away from him? The thought made him feel hollow inside, as if his stomach had deflated. He pushed the food around his plate, the taste bitter now. This isn't how it usually goes. They always talk about plans before they leave, so what's different this time? Does she even care enough to make an effort? Wasn't our last argument over this very thing? I gave her space, but now...now she's gone again. He felt a surge of anger, mixed with sadness, and wondered if things could ever go back to normal."

It wasn't until later, when she thought about it, that she realized what was really bothering her. It wasn't just the fact that he died—she hated how long that prescription stayed out there. It made her feel like she was still grieving, like all these memories were flooding back. And who else would have left it out like that? Someone trying to make me remember what I lost? She started thinking about everyone who might have seen it—her colleagues, her patients. But none of them would ever understand why that little piece of paper meant so much to her. They wouldn’t know how much it hurt to see that name again, especially after everything we’d gone through. It’s probably just because she’s being sensitive, she told herself. It doesn’t mean anything more than that. But deep down, she knew it was more than that. That prescription was a constant reminder of her failure, of how she couldn’t save him even when she had all the time in the world. Now, she wants to take revenge on anyone who might be keeping secrets from her. She can’t bear the thought that she’s not doing enough to honor his memory. She feels so alone in this, like no one"
