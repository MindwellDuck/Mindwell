His eyes looked directly at me, and I could sense his gaze even though he wasn't looking at me. He smiled, and for a moment, we locked eyes, but then he looked away.

It's clear he doesn't care about our marriage anymore. I'm just an accessory, a reminder of what he has lost, not the woman he once promised to love forever. When I think back to their conversation, I realize he wasn't even listening to me. He kept glancing at her, his attention divided between us. Every word I spoke fell flat, and when he finally looked at me, his eyes seemed distant, as if he'd forgotten why he was there.
