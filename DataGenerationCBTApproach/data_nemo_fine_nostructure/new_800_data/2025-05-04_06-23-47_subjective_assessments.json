Now, everything seemed so pointless, like a waste of energy. It wasn't even worth going through the motions again; why bother when no one would notice? The thought made her feel a little better, like she could finally let go of the guilt and disappointment that had been building inside her. It didn't mean she was happy about missing out on the celebration, but at least she could say she hadn't tried to pretend things were okay when they weren’t. Maybe next year wouldn't be any different, but she couldn't care less now. After all, what's the point in trying anymore?"

Every time I see her, I'm reminded of my own loneliness. I hate her carefree attitude. She doesn't understand the depth of my pain. We're all just pretending to be okay. No one truly knows what we're dealing with. But this woman... she just laughs. Always laughing. She has no idea what I've been through. I'll never get to experience joy again. She's just another reminder that I'll never find happiness. Every laugh from her feels like a slap in the face. I wonder if she even understands the gravity of my situation. She probably thinks everything is fine for her, but she has no idea how much it hurts to live like me. Her laughter is a cruel joke, making me realize how far behind I am. I wish I could disappear into nothingness, but she keeps laughing. Always laughing. It's enough to make me want to end it all. I wish she would stop laughing. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Stop laughing."

It feels like everything we built together was just a facade, and now it's all crumbling before my eyes. Every moment we shared, every memory, every promise—everything is starting to unravel. This experience has shattered my trust in him, and I'm left questioning whether our relationship was ever genuine. The thought of him spending time with her, laughing with her, and moving on with his life while I'm stuck here feels like a punch to the gut. Even though she's no longer part of his life, it still hurts to see her name on paper. The pain of watching her move on without me is almost too much to bear. This situation makes me wonder if there's more going on behind closed doors than what I know, and if his past really does come back to haunt us in ways I can't imagine yet. Every little detail about their relationship keeps coming back to haunt me. The way they used to spend time together, sharing meals and memories, all those inside jokes they developed over years—it's hard not to feel like I’m missing something essential to understanding why he’s choosing her over me. She must have a side of herself that I never saw, one that made him fall deeply in love with her again. Maybe there’s more to her story than I know, and I need to learn more about her before I start to rebuild myself"
