But now that I've started worrying about them, I feel anxious. Maybe if I didn't have those thoughts, I'd feel okay.

But now, all those things felt like they belonged to someone else's life. He couldn't shake off the feeling that he'd been living a lie, pretending to be a part of something he no longer belonged to. Every memory he thought he had was tainted by guilt. He remembered the countless times he'd left early from work to surprise her, only to find out she had plans. He recalled the promises he made to spend more time with them, only to let excuses get in the way. And now, he was faced with the harsh reality that none of it mattered anymore. His mind replayed every missed opportunity, every argument, every silent agreement that had slipped away. He felt like he'd been playing a role, pretending to be a loving husband, but deep down, he knew he didn’t belong. The photo was a constant reminder of what he’d lost, and he couldn’t help but wonder if it was even worth trying to go back. Everything seemed too late, and he felt trapped in a never-ending cycle of regret. It wasn’t just the past that haunted him; he worried about the future as well. Would he ever be able to make amends?"

He sat alone at the kitchen table, her favorite chair mockingly vacant across from him. The clock ticked loudly, each second a reminder of time moving on without her. He picked up his phone to call someone, anyone, but put it down again. No one understood. Not really. He poured himself a drink instead, the clink of glass against counter echoing in the silence. As he took his first sip, he heard it - her laughter, soft and familiar, drifting from the hallway. His heart leapt, only to plummet as reality set in.
