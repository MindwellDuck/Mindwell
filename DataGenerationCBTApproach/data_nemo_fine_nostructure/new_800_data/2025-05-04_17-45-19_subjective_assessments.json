When I try to talk to him, he's too engrossed in his paper to listen, completely ignoring me. Sometimes it feels like he'd rather read than spend time with me. The thought that he might not appreciate everything I do for him fills me with anger and frustration. Why does he always have so much time to himself? Doesn't he know that I'm tired from all my responsibilities? Sometimes I feel like I'm just an afterthought to him, someone who exists solely to support his interests. Even though we agreed to share responsibilities, I never see him lifting a finger to help. He doesn't acknowledge my struggles or show appreciation for what I do. If anything, he seems more interested in his own pursuits than in spending quality time with us. It’s as if he believes his hobbies are more important than my needs. That must be why he can’t spare a moment for me, why he reads all evening instead of joining me. The truth is, I feel forgotten in his life, left behind in favor of his books.

This time, though, it was personal. The patient, an elderly woman with dementia, had wandered off during his watch, ending up in the morgue by mistake. He'd blamed her, as he always did, but this time he'd gone too far. She felt her cheeks flush, her grip tightening around the chart until her knuckles turned white.

After all, she’s been doing this job for over 15 years and has seen countless examples of people like him. They're always quick to judge, quick to blame, and quick to leave. She’ll get through this, no matter what he says. She needs to keep her cool, focus on the task at hand, and make sure those patients are taken care of. Nothing else matters right now except for the well-being of her patients. She can’t let him get under her skin; it would only give him power. She needs to show him that she doesn’t react to his insults. But deep down, she feels frustrated, angry, and hurt. How can someone say such things about her, after all she’s done for them?

She hadn't even tried. The thought made him want to scream into the void, but he held back, knowing that would only make things worse. She had given up before even starting, and now she was going to get an F for missing class. Meanwhile, he was still working hard, pouring every ounce of energy into this project. But was it enough? He remembered how frustrated he'd gotten when his grades weren't improving despite his efforts, how desperate he'd become to see some sign of progress. And then there were the days spent crying over failed assignments, wondering if he was cut out for this course. Every time he looked at his grades, he felt like he was staring into the abyss - a reminder that he might never be good enough. But what really hurt was seeing her posts on social media. She didn't care enough to keep up with her schoolwork, let alone try for a higher grade. Yet, here she was, bragging about something entirely unrelated to academics. What was more frustrating was that she seemed happy, content with herself, like nothing could bring her down. It was infuriating.

But if we break down this sentence, we see that the actual distorted thought behind it is actually \"she has always disrespected me\". This is an example of Overgeneralization. We have taken a single negative experience (the email) and generalized it into our general belief about her character (\"she has always disrespected me\"). It makes sense to us that she will continue to disrespect us based on past instances, even though there may be many other times when she has treated us with kindness. By doing so, we overlook all the positive interactions between us and focus solely on these few incidents, leading to an inaccurate picture of her true nature. This type of thinking prevents us from seeing the bigger picture and understanding that people can behave differently depending on the situation."
