I wonder what it would be like if she was my age and had a job just like hers—she probably wouldn’t be so nice to everyone else then. This situation makes me think about how unfair it is to judge someone based solely on their age. If we did that for all ages, society would fall apart. People should get treated equally regardless of age. That’s not fair. I mean, there are plenty of young people acting unkindly, but they don’t get called out because they’re young and can talk back. Everyone has bad days sometimes. This whole thing just seems so unfair and makes me want to shake my head in disgust. The world really needs some young energy right now."

She had taken something that rightfully belonged to me, and now she was basking in the glory of her achievement. It wasn't just about the accolade; it was about the recognition that she didn't deserve, especially not over someone like me who has spent decades honing their craft. What really got under my skin was when she mentioned that she wanted to carry forward my legacy. Carrying forward? It feels like she’s trying to erase everything I’ve worked for, all the sacrifices I made, all the years of dedication. And what does she have to show for it? A few clicks on her computer and suddenly she's being celebrated? It makes me angry, because I know that I'm the one who paved the way for her. I put in the hard work, the late nights, the endless research, and this is how it ends? By having some young upstart come along and steal the spotlight? She doesn’t even understand the value of my writing. She probably thinks she can replicate what I did with ease, but she’ll never grasp the depth of understanding I brought to the table. My words weren’t just about conveying information; they were about painting vivid pictures that resonated with people. I knew exactly which notes to hit to keep readers engaged, to make them think differently, to challenge their perspectives. But now, no one cares about those nuances anymore."

Maybe he wasn't really surprised, maybe he just didn't want to talk about it. But why did he feel like he'd failed? His article on homelessness last year had gotten a lot of attention online, but somehow it hadn't made a difference here. It was frustrating because he knew he'd done everything right—writing about real-life stories, highlighting local organizations, offering solutions. But still, nothing. And now it was too late; the decision was already made. He couldn't change the past, but what could he do moving forward? Maybe if he'd focused more on popular topics, on things that readers cared about. Like sports, or entertainment. He'd seen how well other writers were doing in those areas. Maybe he should have tried that too. But he had always believed that by focusing on important issues, he was making a meaningful contribution. Now it seemed like he was just out of touch. Why did he keep getting these assignments anyway? Wasn't there someone else who could write about social issues? Someone younger, someone more relatable?
