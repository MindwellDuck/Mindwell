It was her husband's laughter, mixed with someone else's—a young woman's voice. She paused, listening. They were watching a movie together on the couch, the one they used to share every Friday night before work consumed their lives. She felt an ache in her chest as she turned back to her computer, loneliness washing over her like a cold wave.",

Her mind began to wander, replaying moments when she'd shared that laughter with him—late-night conversations about everything under the sun, cozy nights curled up by the fireplace, or lazy mornings after a long walk through the park. Each memory felt bittersweet, filled with a mix of joy and longing. The realization hit her like a ton of bricks: it wasn't just the laughter that hurt; it was the fact that those moments were gone, lost forever. Now, even the echoes of happiness made her heart ache."

Why did she just ignore him? Didn’t she remember how much we hung out back then? It made no sense. They were just sitting there, chatting like old friends, while he sat alone at his table. That woman always had this aura around her, like she owned the place. But today, she seemed so casual, almost oblivious to his presence. It felt like he was invisible. He wanted to go over and join the conversation, but what would he say? He could never compete with the ease she had with strangers. She was one of those people who naturally drew everyone in. And now, here she was, completely disregarding him like he meant nothing. Why did it have to happen like this? Hadn’t he given enough? All these years, he’d been trying to make amends, hoping she'd see things differently. But it didn't seem to matter. Her indifference was crushing him, making him feel useless. What more could he possibly do to change her mind? She must've forgotten about me. No wonder she looked so happy. She probably doesn’t even realize how much it hurts to watch her live this carefree life. It's just not fair. She has everything, and I'm left here feeling worthless. Even if he tried to talk to her"

But no, they have to come home now, in the middle of the night, like they always do. They're so selfish. Why does everyone have to ruin everything? Why did my mom even send him? We agreed we'd handle things ourselves. Now look where that got us! This is exactly why we shouldn't have gotten involved. She doesn't care about our family; she only thinks about herself. And now my baby is going to die because of her careless decisions. It's all her fault! This isn't fair. I had a good day today, too. I was able to get some shopping done, and the kids were being helpful. I thought everything was going well until this stupid phone call came. Can't anything ever go right for once? They never listen when I try to talk. The paramedics will probably show up late anyway. Maybe I'll just wait a few minutes longer before calling 911. That way, they won't think less of me, and I won't have to deal with the hassle of answering to dispatch. I'm sick of this situation. I've been trying to stay calm, but it's getting harder by the minute."

They're cruel, and she's proof of that. Every single day, I wake up feeling like shit because of her. And it’s not just one day; it’s every day. Even when we were kids, she made me feel small, like I wasn’t important. She never gave me attention, and she’d just leave us hanging when we needed help. I remember asking for a hug, but she told me to stop being stupid. Stupid! Can you believe that? She said I was stupid, just because I wanted a hug. What kind of mother does that? It gets worse when she goes out with other men. I’m not even surprised anymore. I know what happens when she leaves the house—she’ll come back drunk, maybe with some other guy clinging onto her. It’s disgusting, and it makes me sick. But no matter what happens, I stay here, waiting for her to get home. I don’t deserve better, anyway. I’ve learned that from her.

This time, he'd mentioned how much he missed working with her at the clinic. It made her smile slightly, remembering how they used to collaborate on cases. But then she saw the date - three months ago. A wave of sadness washed over her, and she quickly refocused on the task at hand. Her mind kept drifting back to the past, though, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she had lost something important. She felt a pang of guilt for moving on too soon, but pushed those thoughts aside. She had plenty of work to catch up on, and her own well-being needed to be prioritized. The voicemails were just reminders of what could have been, but she didn't dwell on it anymore. Instead, she went back to focusing on her charts, determined to stay present. ---"

Her thoughts swirled like the paint on her palette, swirling together images of missed moments and unspoken words. Each time she looked at her canvas, she saw the emptiness within it, mirroring the void growing inside her. It wasn't just about the art; it was about the love she'd failed to show her child. She couldn't shake off the feeling that her paintings now represented everything she'd refused to acknowledge - her own brokenness and her inability to be there for those who needed her most. As she stared at the blank space, she felt the color draining out of it, leaving behind an endless expanse of nothingness that echoed the emptiness in her heart. Every stroke became a reminder of what she'd left undone, each color a reflection of the pain she'd avoided rather than faced. And yet, despite this, she found herself drawn back to her canvas, the act of painting becoming both a source of solace and a cruel mockery. In this state of turmoil, she couldn't help but wonder how long it would take for the colors to fade completely, for the shadows to consume everything"
