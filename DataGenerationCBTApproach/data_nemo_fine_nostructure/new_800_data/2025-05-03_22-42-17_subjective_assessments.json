The house was quiet except for the soft hum of the refrigerator, a stark contrast to the bustling newsroom she'd left behind hours ago. A stray curl of hair fell into her eyes as she stirred her cooling cup of tea, the once-vibrant red now faded like an old photograph. Absently, she reached for his favorite mug, but her hand only grasped empty air. A melancholic sigh escaped her lips, echoing in the silent room.",

Now, he just ignores me whenever I try to talk to him. I feel like I’m losing him all over again. It hurts because I know he needs me right now. But maybe if I could find another job faster, I wouldn’t have to deal with these feelings. I wish there was a way for us to go back to how things used to be. Instead of focusing on what went wrong, I keep thinking about what could’ve been if we hadn’t moved. Every little reminder makes me more angry and sad. I don’t understand why he doesn’t want to hang out anymore. Maybe if I spent more time talking to him when he was younger, he wouldn’t turn out like this. I keep thinking about what I did wrong and how I can fix it. I wish things could go back to the way they were before we moved. I feel like I’m failing him, and I don’t know how to make it right. I see how happy he was with our old routine, and now it feels like everything is falling apart. I remember how proud he was when he told me he got into college. That meant so much to me,"

He felt a pang of misery as he recognized the street name; it was where he'd lived with his ex-wife before the divorce.

I glanced over at my partner, wondering if they sensed the chill that had settled over me, but their expression remained neutral. They were focused on the job, not my emotions. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling that tonight would bring more than just justice for the situation unfolding before us. Tonight might bring memories I’d rather forget. The streets were empty, the only sound being the soft hum of the cruiser’s engine. As we stepped out, the cool night air hit me like a slap in the face, a stark contrast to the warmth of my car. I took a deep breath, letting the chill settle in, but it didn’t ease the ache within. We walked toward the house, our footsteps echoing off the walls, a silence that felt almost deafening. I thought about how many times I’d stood outside this very door, wondering what lay beyond, now I was here again, facing something different, yet the uncertainty lingered. I could see the faint glow of lights in the windows, but there was no sign of life, just a sense of emptiness. It was as if time had stopped, leaving only the echoes of the"

What if addiction consumed him completely, leaving him a shadow of his former self? What if he became a statistic, a nameless face among countless others, a reminder of the lives lost in the city's endless maze?"
