She clutched his old scarf, now hers, against her cheek. It still held his scent, but it was fading, like him. The park was quieter than usual, children's laughter replaced by the soft rustling of autumn leaves. She missed their chatter, his stories about them growing up. Her eyes welled up as she realized this would be her first holiday season without him.",

Every smile seemed to mock me, every laugh echoing through my empty soul. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was trying to tell me something, but all I heard were whispers of what could’ve been if only we’d met sooner. He always said he wanted to show me how beautiful the world was when you had someone to share it with, but now I realize it wasn’t just a cliché. It was a promise he never got to keep."

It was like the world had narrowed down to just two options - be fully present and loving or be completely absent and lonely."

She hung up her jacket, noticing the dust gathering on the photo frames. Her eyes lingered on the one with him, smiling in his old uniform. His absence was a physical ache, another wound to add to the ones she saw every day at work. She slumped onto the couch, rubbing her temples as she listened to the ticking clock. It was too quiet, too empty. Too much like her life now.",

The fact that she didn't tell me about it before leaving for work today is really bothering me. I keep thinking about how I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had just asked her more questions during our lunch break, we wouldn't be in this situation. I wish I could go back and relive those moments over and over again. Now everything feels so disjointed – I can't focus on cooking or even talking to her right now. I keep getting distracted by little things, like the way the sunlight filters through the window or the sound of the sink running. Even the smell of garlic isn't helping much; it feels like a cruel reminder that life will never be the same. I'm trying to stay calm, but my heart keeps racing. I guess I'll just try to get dinner ready and hope she comes around soon."

You think the principal is going to drop everything when someone “suddenly” remembers they have a meeting? Or that the teachers will just magically put in extra hours because one kid forgot his homework? Please. They know exactly what’s going on here, and yet they act like no one told them yesterday. And another thing - why does everyone seem to assume that the new security guard is the reason for all these problems? Is he really that incompetent? I’ve seen him in action, and he knows what he’s doing. Maybe if he wasn’t constantly getting dragged down by these people who are more concerned with covering their own backs than actually helping, he wouldn’t be under so much pressure. But do we ever hear about the good stuff he does? No, instead we’re left to deal with the fallout whenever someone decides to make a scene or play the victim. I mean, come on! Can’t they see that this isn’t really about him? Just saying."
