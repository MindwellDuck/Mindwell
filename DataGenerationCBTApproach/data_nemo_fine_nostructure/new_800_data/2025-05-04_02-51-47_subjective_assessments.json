We never told her about the way we broke up, but I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t understand the depth of my feelings unless she lived through it herself.” “I just wish he wasn’t doing this anymore.

Now, with modern technology, she could have easily reached out for help from anywhere in the world. But even though she might have lived, he couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt. What if he had found her sooner? Would she be alive today? This line is the most telling because it says \"back then\" instead of saying what specifically happened back then. It makes the reader assume that the speaker did something wrong in the past, which isn't necessarily true. The speaker simply mentions that things were different then. --- Here's an alternative response: As he sat through the lecture again, he couldn’t help but feel overshadowed by the new student who seemed to grasp everything effortlessly. She was so confident, and her notes looked neat and organized. Meanwhile, he felt like he was drowning in his own mess. Every glance at her made him feel like he was being judged. Why couldn’t he learn like this? He started to wonder if he was just too old, too slow, or maybe too much of a burden. --- Another one: When he met the new team leader, he couldn't help but notice how different she was from him. Her enthusiasm was contagious, and her ideas seemed fresh and innovative. She didn’t seem to worry about making mistakes, unlike him"

The distance between them grew wider with each passing day, and she couldn't help but feel like an outsider in their own life. He was never really there anyway. They hadn't been together long enough for him to commit fully. Maybe he was just waiting for someone else, someone who could give him the stability he craved.

Her dishes were always full of love, each bite infused with stories and memories of our childhoods together. My own cooking could never match the warmth she brought to every meal, even when we were struggling financially. Those times have faded with age, but the memory of her kindness remains strong.
