The clock in the hallway ticked loudly, each second echoing like a mockery of time moving on while his world remained stagnant.

Every day, every moment, every breath seemed pointless because nothing could ever replace her. Life didn’t have the same meaning anymore; it was all just waiting for death, which would eventually come to claim him too. Why bother trying to make things better when everything is already lost? If anything good happens, it’s just cruel fate playing tricks on us. There’s no use in continuing—nothing matters anyway. He looked at the picture of her, remembering how happy they were together, but even that memory felt hollow now. The smile seemed forced, a reminder of happier times that could never be recaptured. He wondered if she’d even wanted this life, if she’d ever imagined living without me, or if she'd ever seen herself ending up here alone. Did she ever think about the future, about the emptiness that awaited her? Had she known the pain I’m feeling right now? Or did she understand that we’re both trapped in this endless cycle of suffering, forever bound to this earth, unable to escape? It was almost as if she'd planned our lives together, leaving me with this burden, and then vanished."

Every day, I wonder what would have been if we were still together. If I could turn back the clock, I'd relive every laugh, every quiet moment, and every argument that made us stronger. But now, sitting here alone, surrounded by our forgotten life, it feels like I'm drowning in what-ifs. What if she was still here, holding my hand on those chilly nights? What if we had grown old together, watching our children grow into adults? What if I had never left? As I look around, I see the ghost of her smile, frozen on the mirror. Her laughter echoes in the hallway, where she used to sing along with me. Our favorite songs, played softly on the radio, seem to whisper secrets only we knew. Even the way the sunlight streams through the windows is different now, casting shadows that remind me of her presence. But the more I sit here, the more I realize that maybe I’m just clinging to the past. Maybe it’s time to let go, to accept that some things are meant to be memories, not moments we can change.

I'm just glad I could finally put something together that would make him proud. Now I feel like I'll never be good enough for her because she won't even give me a chance to explain myself. What if she thought I was doing this as some kind of passive-aggressive gesture? Maybe she thinks I'm not taking responsibility for anything anymore and am just acting out because things aren't going well between us. It makes sense, right? We have been fighting nonstop, and maybe I am just trying to prove a point. But no matter what, I know deep down she believes I'm just being selfish. I wish we could talk about this, but I don't want to upset her more. Maybe I should let her find another artist to date instead of myself. At least then she wouldn't have to deal with my anger issues. It's really hard to keep working on our relationship when I feel like I'm losing control over everything.
