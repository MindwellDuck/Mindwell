A young woman, barely out of her teens, approaches her with a smile, holding up a charm bracelet. \"This was my grandmother's,\" she says, her eyes sparkling. \"I want to give it to my mom for Mother's Day.\" The old woman smiles back, but feels a pang in her chest as she remembers the bracelet her own mother wore, now gathering dust in a drawer at home. She helps the girl wrap the bracelet carefully, fighting back tears as she hands it over, saying softly, \"I'm sure your mom will love it.\"",

I've been so stressed lately, and I haven't had time to think about things like this. Maybe if I took some deep breaths, I'd be able to feel better. That usually works for me when I'm feeling overwhelmed. But honestly, I'm still upset about what happened earlier today. The manager told me he couldn't give me the day off, no matter how hard I worked. He said I needed to take care of myself too, but I know he doesn't understand. I need to get my priorities straight. I'll probably go talk to him again later, see if there's anything we can work out. But for now, let's focus on something else. Like how nice it is outside today."

Doesn’t matter how good he looks, or how confident he seems. It's all just an illusion. I wonder if she even notices me. Is she seeing me, or just pretending to? I guess I'm just being paranoid. What am I really worried about? Just that he might think I look stupid because I can't keep up with them? But then again... maybe I shouldn’t be surprised. I mean, I wouldn’t want to sit next to him either. Even though we're supposed to be friends, I still get this feeling of resentment every time he comes over. Like there’s something holding him back from actually being part of our group. Maybe it’s because he doesn’t understand us, or maybe it’s because he thinks he deserves someone way better than us. Whatever it is, it makes me feel like he’s always one step ahead, and I'm stuck behind. And now, here we are, trying to make small talk while he sits across from us, looking like he owns the room.

The irony was that everyone else in the office seemed to have no issues with these appliances. Even the new intern didn't complain when her printer started malfunctioning. But whenever our team leader asked him to fix things, he felt like the whole world was against him. It wasn't fair. Maybe if he'd take care of himself better, none of this would happen. If only he were more responsible, we wouldn't be suffering because of his lack of discipline. But he knew deep down that wasn’t true. Still, he couldn't shake off the feeling that everything was somehow personal. Maybe if he made an effort to get healthier and start taking care of himself, then maybe things would start going right. Just one good day of exercise and eating well would make everything fall back into place. If only he could focus on being healthy instead of constantly worrying about what went wrong. Then, who knows, maybe tomorrow would be different. But today, the thought of facing another long night at work felt overwhelming. Why did everything have to break down at such inconvenient times? First, it's the coffee machine, and now the printer is acting up."

What if he was just as tired of working together as she was? It didn't really matter anyway. They were done with the project, and he was probably off somewhere else. Maybe even dating someone else already. She wouldn't blame him; after all, she hadn't exactly been easy to live with during the long hours spent in the lab. \"Maybe I'm just jealous,\" she mused aloud, though no one was around to hear. After all, who would ever know? It seemed like everyone else had moved on, leaving her behind. Even the memory of their last meeting felt distant, as if it belonged to someone else entirely. But then again, maybe it was just her imagination playing tricks on her. She wasn't sure anymore. All she knew was that things could never be the same again.

She had left us behind, leaving me to carry the weight of our home, our children, and our dreams alone. Every step I took through this empty house felt like a betrayal – as if I was walking away from the love we once shared. It's hard to imagine how she could have walked out on me when I was here, holding her hand, looking into her eyes. We were meant to build a future together, but now everything feels hollow. Even the things she loved—her books, her garden—seem to mock me. It's almost as if she wanted to leave something behind, something to remind me of what we had lost. Her smile, which used to light up even the darkest days, now taunts me with its absence. But why does it all feel so bitter? I remember the laughter, the late-night conversations about our hopes, the way she would curl up beside me after a long day. Those moments were our own little world, where nothing else mattered except the two of us. Yet now, they seem distant, relics of a time I can never get back. Each time I open the door,"
