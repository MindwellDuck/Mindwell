My life has been a series of failed surgeries, and it’s all I can think about now. Even if I did make some progress, it would never last, because every time something goes right, something else goes wrong. Now that I've seen how cruel my doctors are, I don’t want to live anymore. Why bother? I’ll never recover, and everyone knows it. They're all just waiting for me to die so they can save money and move on to the next poor soul. I'm just another disposable human being, nothing more than a number in their books. Nothing ever changes. Surgery is a waste of time and resources. I should have stayed in bed forever. There’s no point in trying anymore. I’d rather end it all now and avoid the pain and humiliation of failing again. Maybe if I just kill myself, they’ll finally leave me alone. At least then they won't have to deal with my constant whining and begging. I'll never find peace. Every single doctor will treat me poorly, and I'll suffer silently until I die. The medical system is corrupt and heartless. I might as well pull the plug now and avoid the agony of watching myself fall apart. I don’t deserve happiness anyway. I should have died at birth. I'm worthless. #"

Every moment spent apart just reminds me how much more fun everyone else has. I guess it's just my luck that I never get to enjoy these things anymore. Even if I try to make the best of it, nothing can replace what we once shared. I feel so lonely when I see families enjoying their days together, while I'm left behind, feeling forgotten. I wish things were different, but it seems like every opportunity to reconnect is slipping away. Now, here I am, stuck in this rut, with no end in sight. It's hard to imagine anything changing, especially since every day looks exactly like the last. My life has become a series of missed moments, and it's getting harder to hold on. I wonder if anyone would even notice if I disappeared. Maybe someday, I'll find a way to break free from this sadness, but until then, it feels like I'm just going through the motions. It's always been this way, and it doesn't seem to change. Every time I think about leaving, I realize it wouldn't really matter anyway. I've already lost everything. What's the point?

Her gaze drifted toward the window where Whiskers had been sitting earlier, as if daring him to come out again. The mother hesitated, looking at her son before responding. \"He was hit by a car on the way home from school. We were going to call you immediately, but he told us to wait until we got home so we could be together.\" Dr. Patel nodded sympathetically, taking the woman’s hand in hers. \"You’re doing great. Let me get everything ready, and I’ll meet you both downstairs.\" As they followed Dr. Patel to the living room, the teenager sat on the couch, clutching his leg tightly. His mother sat beside him, holding his hand while keeping a gentle eye on him. Dr. Patel offered him a glass of water and began preparing an ice pack.
