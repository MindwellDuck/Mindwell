A familiar customer, a woman around his late wife's age, handed him her loyalty card with a smile. He froze, staring at the card adorned with tiny hearts. His chest tightened as he remembered the Valentine's Day they'd spent together, her laughter echoing through their apartment. He couldn't bring himself to scan it, instead placing it on the counter and walking away, leaving the queue of customers in silence.",

The way she smiles, the way she laughs... it just makes me want to scream. I tried to keep my cool today, but seeing that little heart on her card was too much. It's like she's rubbing it in our faces, making us feel worse than ever. She thinks nothing of it, probably doesn't even realize how painful it is for me. But why does she have to come back? Why can't she just leave me alone? I know it sounds crazy, but every time I see her, it feels like I'm reliving the worst days of my life. The pain from losing her still feels fresh, and now it's all triggered again by something as simple as a loyalty card. I hate myself for being so weak. Maybe if I just avoided her, I could get over it faster. But no, I'm stuck here, constantly reminded of what I've lost. I wish I could just disappear forever, but I'm trapped in this hell of memories and longing. This whole place feels like a nightmare, and I don't know how long I can take it. I just want to break down and cry, but I'm afraid of losing control. I guess it's better to bottle up my emotions inside, where they won't hurt anyone else.

She probably doesn't even notice me anymore, anyway. I'm not that interesting to her. That smile is so overrated, and honestly, it feels fake. It’s just another one of those things people say to make others feel better, like a cheap attempt to be polite. But let’s be real, it means nothing. If she really cared, she wouldn’t have laughed along with everyone else like she did tonight. This whole thing feels staged, like some kind of performance. She must think I’m boring or something. Or maybe she never actually liked me. Maybe we’re just too different, and this was all just a friendly gesture, not meant to be taken seriously. I shouldn’t expect her to smile at my jokes, after all, I’m not funny enough. Even if I am funny, she’d probably just laugh politely, pretending to enjoy herself. That smile from earlier? Just a hollow gesture. It’s clear she doesn’t really care about what I say. It’s probably just her way of being nice, but still... I can’t shake off the feeling that I’ve lost her attention.
