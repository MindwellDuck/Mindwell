You need to take responsibility for your actions.\" He shifted uncomfortably in his wheelchair, avoiding eye contact. \"I'm sorry... I didn't think...\" \"I see a lot of damage in here, both physically and emotionally,\" she continued, her tone firm but compassionate. \"You have two choices: either you can let this experience change you, or you'll continue down the path you're already on. It's up to you.\" He sighed, rubbing his temples. \"I don't know if I can fix anything right now.\" \"You've been given a second chance,\" she reminded him gently. \"How will you choose to use it?\" He looked up, his gaze hesitant. \"I'll try my best.\" \"Good,\" she said firmly. \"Now, let's focus on healing.

If they hadn't been so busy with their own projects, they wouldn't have left her alone with that stupid machine.

But she still felt frustrated because she had wasted all that time. Now she'll never get those data back, and her project will fail. The whole point of this experiment was to test something important, and now everyone is going to think she's incompetent. If I hadn't been so careless, none of this would've happened. I probably could've fixed it myself if I hadn't been so distracted by everything else going on at once. And besides, I don't need these people to tell me what I'm supposed to be doing. I know exactly what I'm doing—just don't expect me to make things easy for you. But then again, maybe I shouldn't have asked them to help me with the new equipment.

The words seemed to hold a secret, one that only became clear when read together. But how did she know that reading them together would reveal anything new? As she sat there, lost in thought, she realized that every memory held a piece of herself within its lines. Each word told a story of where she had been, what she had done, and what she had left behind. And yet, amidst these stories, she found herself longing for something more. Something that wasn’t there. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was living someone else’s life, one that didn’t belong to her. Every step she took, every choice she made, seemed to lead her further away from her true self. In the end, it was just another letter, but it felt like so much more. It was a reminder that time keeps moving, even when we’re frozen in our thoughts. That no matter how hard we try, some things will always be beyond reach.

It’s almost as if she’s trying to prove herself by belittling others. When we have discussions about how she speaks, it feels forced; it doesn’t feel natural, even though I try my best to keep an open mind. I think she might need some training on how to communicate better, especially since she tends to dominate conversations and talks over others. I'm worried she'll never change her ways, and it could lead to burnout for both of us. I've seen other doctors struggle with her, and now I’m starting to wonder if there’s something wrong with me for feeling frustrated. Maybe I’m too sensitive? Should I just accept it and focus on finding ways to work around her? I guess I just wish she wouldn't treat everyone like idiots who aren't worthy of respect.
