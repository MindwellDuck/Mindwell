It's such a big deal that she snapped her fingers, and I'm going to be so nice to everyone else, but not to her because she didn't deserve my kindness. ## Step 1: Read the Prompt The first step was to read through the given prompt carefully. We were asked to write a response based on a specific triggering event. In this case, we had to imagine a situation where someone felt irritated by a customer’s behavior. ## Step 2: Identify the Cognitive Distortion Next, we needed to identify which cognitive distortion was relevant here. The trigger provided was \"All or Nothing Thinking,\" which means viewing situations as either entirely positive or negative, with no room for nuance. This type of thinking leads people to see things in absolute terms rather than seeing them as part of a spectrum. ## Step 3: Analyze the Triggering Event We then analyzed the event itself. A middle-aged woman working at a store is feeling irritation when a customer snaps their fingers impatiently while she works. She wants to say something but chooses not to, instead keeping a polite smile. Our task was to express how she might be experiencing these events through her perspective, capturing the essence of \"All or Nothing Thinking.\" ## Step 4: Generate Subjective Reaction Finally, we generated a subjective reaction from the woman’s point of view.

He sits down at his old desk, his hands trembling slightly as they trace the faint lipstick stain she'd left on the corner. He picks up her favorite pen, the one she always used to edit his manuscripts, and begins to write their latest research findings. But each word feels heavier than the last, each line a stark reminder of her absence.

I need to see this paper finished before I can even think about how much I miss her. It's been months since we broke up; maybe he's changed. Maybe he still cares. If I finish this paper, maybe I'll finally have enough courage to tell him I love him again. I won't be there when he finishes it; maybe he'll try to contact me then. If he doesn't, maybe he really has moved on. But what if he's just pretending? What if he's waiting for me to die so he can take advantage of my vulnerability? We've broken up twice already; surely this is the final blow. If I wait too long, he might start dating someone else. I need to hurry up and finish writing this paper. If I don't, he'll never forgive me. If he forgives me, maybe he'll come visit me soon. I wonder if he thinks about me every day at exactly 3 PM. Is he writing a letter to me now, telling me how sorry he is for leaving? Does he wish he could turn back time? Does he know I'm watching him from afar, wondering why he's still holding onto our memories? Should I send him an email asking if he wants to meet up? Or will that just make things worse"

It's not about cleaning; it's about forgetting. He folds the note again, tucking it into his pocket where it sits quietly, a reminder he can't shake.

Maybe she's just waiting for some spark to ignite her creativity again. But deep down, I think there might be more than that. Perhaps she's feeling trapped, stuck in a rut, and unsure how to break free. Or maybe she's simply tired of trying to recreate something beautiful when it always falls short.

It seemed like she enjoyed teasing him about his cooking more than anything else in their relationship. She always did this, acting like nothing mattered until he found out what she was really thinking. Now he wondered if all the times she said she loved him were just lies. He felt like he could no longer trust her, especially since she was still there, smiling at him like nothing was wrong. What was he supposed to do? Just smile back and pretend everything was fine? No, he needed answers, and fast. Maybe if he confronted her right then, she’d finally realize how hurtful her actions were. But what if she just kept lying?
