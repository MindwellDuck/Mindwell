I expect more consideration from regular customers like him, especially since he knows me well enough to greet me warmly every time he visits. It's disappointing when someone who's supposed to be one of our best customers acts so disrespectfully, especially given how much I've helped him in the past. I wish he'd take more pride in his purchases and show more appreciation for the effort we put into helping him find what he needs. It feels unfair when someone I've worked hard to help treats our products poorly, considering how much support I've provided him over time. If he truly valued our business, I'd think he'd handle his belongings better; unfortunately, his actions suggest otherwise."

This isn't about me—it's about them trying to make themselves feel better by pointing out something I already know. I glance around the room, feeling lost. My partner is at work, and I'm left here with nothing but these thoughts. Maybe if I try harder, things will change. But what's the point? I'll never be good enough. No one wants someone like me. I think about how I'll spend the day alone, wondering if anyone will notice when I'm gone. This performance review has become a cruel joke, a constant reminder that I'm just another forgotten piece in the puzzle of life."

I feel like we could avoid all this if everyone just helped out more. I guess I’m just too tired to deal with it now. I wonder why he doesn’t care about cleaning up; maybe he's too stressed himself?

She appeared so out of control that it almost felt like she wasn't capable of taking care of things properly, which reinforced my perception that I'm more competent than her. It’s clear that she needs some guidance on how to handle these kinds of events gracefully.

Maybe I shouldn't have invited her in the first place, considering how much we disagree on politics. That would explain her sudden interest in visiting me, especially since we haven't spoken in months. Now that I think about it, her casserole tastes off. Could she be poisoning me?
