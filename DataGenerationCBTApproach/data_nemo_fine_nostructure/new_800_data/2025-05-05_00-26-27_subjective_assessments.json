She tore it open, heart fluttering like a bird in her chest. Inside was a note: \"I've been offered a job in Timbuktu. I've accepted.\" No mention of whether she would join him or be left behind. She felt the disappointment settle heavy in her stomach, a familiar old friend. Another move, another disruption to their quiet life together. She had hoped for different news this time.",

The house was quiet except for the ticking, a sound that once comforted but now felt like mocking emptiness. She shuffled downstairs, her footsteps echoing in the silent kitchen. The sun streamed in through the window, highlighting the dust particles dancing in the air she disturbed. As she reached for her usual mug, her gaze fell on his favorite coffee cup, still sitting on the draining board where he'd left it weeks ago. The sight of it, untouched and gathering stains, was a physical blow. She sank into a chair, tears welling up as she felt the weight of another day dawning without him.",

She wondered if this was some kind of test, if maybe by leaving, he’d prove that he didn’t love her anymore. That he wasn’t really the man she thought he was. Maybe he wanted to see if she could handle being alone, if she had the strength to move forward without him. If she was strong enough to face life on her own. But deep down, she knew that wasn't true. He did love her. He loved her more than anything, and he was just trying to protect himself from getting hurt again. He couldn't bear the thought of losing her, so he stayed, even when it meant going back to his old ways. She sighed, feeling a mix of sadness and anger. Why did he have to leave now, after everything they’d worked for? They were supposed to start a new life together, build something beautiful. But instead, he chose to go back to who he used to be, the same man who had broken her heart before. She stood up, grabbed her bag, and walked out of the apartment. The city seemed different today, the sounds louder, the streets busier. But she felt empty, like nothing could fill the void he left behind. She wandered aimlessly, unsure where she was going or what she’d find there. All"

She thought back to the last conversation they had—how he had laughed at her jokes, how he had listened when she needed someone to hear her out. How could this be? The news spread so quickly, everyone was talking about it, but somehow it felt off. Like something was missing. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story than what the headlines were letting on. There had to be something she missed, some clue that would change everything. Why hadn't anyone mentioned anything before? Hadn't they seen him around town? And what about the other journalists who worked with him? Didn't they know anything? She felt like she was drowning in questions, each one leading her further into the unknown. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, except the haystack was filled with secrets and lies. She couldn't help but wonder if she had stumbled upon something she wasn’t meant to see. The more she thought, the more confused she became. What if there was more to this story than just a tragic accident? What if people were hiding something? She couldn't let go of the feeling that something was off,"

Of course, he thinks she's cheating - it wouldn't surprise me if he felt that way anyway. She probably did have some kind of relationship with this guy before they met. There's no reason to think otherwise. After all, people usually start looking for new connections before settling down. It makes sense that she might have been flirting with someone else back then. It doesn't necessarily mean anything, but it adds weight to his suspicion. The fact that she keeps that photo hidden must mean she has something to hide. I'm surprised he didn't notice it sooner; maybe he was too caught up in his own feelings about the marriage. This whole situation feels like a mess waiting to happen."
