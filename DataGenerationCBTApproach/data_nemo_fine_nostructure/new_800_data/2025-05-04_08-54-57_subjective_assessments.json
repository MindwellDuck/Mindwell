She was smiling at someone else now, holding hands with another man who wasn't me. But why did this bother him? It didn't seem like much; just a casual interaction between two people. I've been out of the picture for so long, maybe my mind was just creating scenarios where I was still part of it all. After all, he was just a coworker she'd met through mutual friends, right? It's ridiculous how much I'm feeling this way. Maybe I’m just bored and overthinking things again. That's all. No need to get worked up about something so insignificant. Yet, the image of her with another guy keeps popping up, making me wonder if I really am better off this time. But what does it even mean? Just because we're not together anymore doesn’t mean anything has changed between us. We were just growing apart anyway. This is all just my mind playing tricks on me again. There’s nothing here but empty space and dust. Nothing but memories. Still, every time I think about it, my heart beats faster, and I can’t shake the feeling that there's more to this than I understand. I guess I’ll never"

They were meant for each other, but now he's just going to walk away? She can’t understand why he’d say such a thing. He was always so supportive, offering words of encouragement whenever she struggled with something at work. And he listened when she needed someone to talk to. He never gave her the cold shoulder or told her she wasn’t good enough. Why would he want to end things now? It doesn’t fit into her narrative of what they shared. Maybe there was some misunderstanding or miscommunication. But if that’s the case, wouldn’t he have addressed it earlier? Would he really just drop everything for no reason? This isn’t how relationships work. If you’re interested, you should act on your feelings. Not just ignore them and move on. What does he think he’s doing by leaving me like this? Is he afraid of commitment or something? Did he realize too late that he didn’t feel the same way? That realization must hurt so much. What did he expect from our friendship? Was it all just a game? Toying with her emotions, then dumping her like trash? It doesn’t add up. If he truly cared about me, he wouldn’t"
