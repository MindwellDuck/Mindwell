The scent of their shared perfume wafts towards her, a bitter taste in her mouth. She'd left them alone for five minutes, to pick up an order at the supply door. Five minutes too long, it seems. She feels the heat rise in her cheeks, not from the stove this time, but from the spiteful sting of betrayal.",

His eyes crinkled at the corners as he laughed, and his hand instinctively reached out to brush against hers, sending shivers down her spine. It wasn't just the touch that made her feel uneasy; it was the look in his eyes, the way they seemed to hold a secret she couldn't quite decipher. She tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling herself she was being paranoid, but the image lingered in her mind like a ghost. Even after leaving, she found herself wondering if there was more to the story than what she knew. The memory of his smile haunted her, making her question everything she thought she knew about him. She had once seen him as someone who embodied warmth and kindness, but now she wondered if she had misjudged him entirely. Every moment spent near him seemed tainted by the possibility of deception. Her heart raced faster than the blenders in the kitchen, each beat echoing the turmoil within her. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was missing something crucial, something that could change her perception forever."

But now, I'm alone again, and it hurts even more. It doesn't matter how many times he said he needed space. That doesn't mean anything anymore. We never got our chance. Even though I saw the way he looked at other women, I thought it was just jealousy. It wasn't until I found another woman in the garden that I realized my mistake. Maybe he did cheat on me. I don't know why he's gone now, but I think it's because of me. If only I'd done something differently, we might still be together. But instead, I let him go, and now I'm paying the price. I wish I could turn back time, but it's too late now. All I can do is hold onto the past and hope for better days ahead. But those days feel farther away than ever."

I kept thinking there must be some mistake, that it would all come together eventually. I tried to hold on to that feeling, but it slipped through my fingers like sand in the wind. Now I'm left wondering if I was ever really ready for this. Maybe I was just fooling myself, thinking I could handle it. The more I think about it, the more I feel like I've lost control. I keep replaying what went wrong, trying to find a way out, but it's like chasing shadows. I’m left with nothing but questions—what if? What could have been? And then there’s the question of how I can move forward from here. Is it even possible? I guess you could say I’ve been hit by reality, forced to confront the limits of my abilities. Sometimes, I wonder if I ever truly knew what I was getting into. Maybe I was just trying to convince myself of something that wasn’t true. Now, I feel like I need to start over, rebuild from scratch, and hope for better luck next time. If anything, though, it’s made me realize how much is at stake.

How could someone who had been so excited for this adventure suddenly be okay with giving up their dream? Didn't he remember all the times they spent planning it together, dreaming about the experiences they would share? It wasn't just about the trip itself; it was about what they wanted to achieve. Studying abroad would've given them a chance to broaden their horizons, learn new skills, and grow as individuals. But now, those opportunities were lost, and she couldn’t help but feel that she had missed out on something significant. This wasn't just about him forgetting; it was about how his indifference made her realize that maybe she wasn't worth investing in either. Her eyes drifted back to the photo, and she wondered if things would have changed if they had left together. Would she still be happy, or would she have ended up disappointed anyway?
