She looks at the framed photo of her late husband on her desk, his smile once bright now faded with time. A pager beeps, interrupting the silence; she glances down to see the urgent tone flashing across the screen - a code blue in Pediatrics. As she rushes out, she can't help but feel that familiar helplessness, wondering if today will be another day when she arrives too late to save another family from her own recurring nightmare.",

The last thing she wanted was to relive those memories of losing her first patient, but now it feels like fate is repeating itself. Every time she goes to work, she worries about making mistakes and being too slow, just as she did before. It’s as if the same fears are haunting her again. She tries to push them aside, telling herself she has years left, but deep down, she knows this isn’t just a coincidence. She keeps thinking about how much easier life would be if she had never moved back home, if she hadn’t become a nurse because of him. If he were still here, wouldn’t he have gotten sick instead? Wouldn’t he have died earlier? Would she have lost him if she stayed longer? She wonders what would have happened if she had taken that job offer in California, if she had stayed in the city where they all lived together. Would things have worked out differently then? Would she still be married? Every moment feels like a reminder of what could have been, and every decision leads her further away from a future free from pain. She keeps replaying the scenarios in her head, imagining different paths that might have led to happier endings. What if he had been healthier? What if she had stayed longer in the city"

The way they're asking me to work double shifts and cover all the patients who are on their break is really annoying. It's like they don't even care about my well-being or what it takes to be effective at my job. They're just using me as a personal servant because I'm such a great team player. That's why they never give me any feedback on how I can improve; they know I'll just take it and do whatever they ask. And when we have our breaks together, they assume I'll be there to listen to their problems. It feels like they expect me to be available 24/7, but they don't want to put in the effort themselves to make things easier. The fact that they're doing this yet again is proof that they don't respect me as a professional. They probably don't realize that I've been working overtime since last week and am already exhausted. Maybe if they treated me with more respect, I wouldn't feel so drained. But now, I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it to keep working here."

Her eyes darted between the ticking clock and the half-finished grant proposal before her. The deadline loomed like a storm cloud, but every time she tried to focus, her thoughts scattered like leaves in a gale. She heard her partner, retired and carefree, humming softly in the kitchen below, his footsteps punctuating the silence with an infuriating casualness. The kettle whistled, piercing through her mental fog, and she felt the familiar tightness in her chest, the urge to scream against the injustice of it all - him, retired and relaxed, while she, at 70, was still shackled to this endless grind.

How could she truly create when everything around her screamed that life had already been decided for her? This isn't just about deadlines or work; it's about the deeper ache that's always there, a reminder that some things are beyond her control. Every time she starts to write, she feels the weight of years spent holding back, of missed opportunities, of dreams that never took flight. It's hard to push aside the knowledge that her mind is slowing, that the clock is running out for her too. Maybe it's time to stop pretending, to accept that the world moves faster than she does now. But what if she really did put down the pen and walk away? Would she be giving up more than just writing, or would she finally be giving herself permission to rest? This isn't just about her writing; it's about who she is becoming. Is she letting her age define her, or can she find a way to redefine herself? She knows she has so much to say, so many stories to tell. Yet, the words feel stuck, frozen by fear and doubt. Perhaps it's time to start small, to take one step towards"
