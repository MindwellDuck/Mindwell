This reminds me of how long it took for her to adjust to living apart. It feels like forever since we moved here. I hope she‚Äôs doing okay, taking care of herself.

It wasn't just the empty chairs around the table that made her feel uneasy; it was the way her husband seemed oblivious to her return, his eyes fixed on the TV screen as if he'd never noticed her. He didn't offer a smile or even a hello. Instead, he kept watching the sports game, his brow furrowed in concentration. When I finally called out to him, there was no pause in his attention, no sign that he heard me. It was as if I might be imagining things, but deep down, I knew what I saw - his face turned away, his shoulders stiffening slightly when I approached. Even the dishes were a reminder of his neglect.
