It's no wonder he can't stand being around me; I'm a waste of space, a dead weight holding us back. Her inability to create art aligns perfectly with her character. She's always been lazy, unmotivated, and lacks the drive needed to succeed. She's a disappointment, and her partner deserves better. I'll probably get fired soon too; I don't deserve to work there anyway. My incompetence will continue to harm everyone around me, making it clear that I have no place in this world.

He’s supposed to support me, but instead, he’s acting like he never cared about our relationship. If he truly loved me, would he treat me like this? Am I missing something? Shouldn’t he be apologizing for moving out suddenly and cleaning up his room? Why does he have to behave like this? Can’t he see how much pain he’s causing? I’m trying to process everything, but I keep feeling overwhelmed. Maybe if we had talked sooner, he’d realize how much I need him, and he wouldn’t have acted like this. I wonder"

Why couldn't she be like him? Why did I have to wake up every morning to an unfulfilling life? Her mind wandered to all those days when he stayed home, cooking dinner together, just the two of them laughing and sharing stories. Those moments were cherished, but they also reminded her of what she lacked. Now, even those memories seemed tainted by loneliness. It wasn't fair; she could see other couples enjoying their evenings together, while she was stuck in this rut. A bitter resentment crept in, fueled by the realization that she might never experience such closeness. Every day, she felt more isolated, while he continued to live a fulfilling life. Even his simple act of waking up early to go jogging left her feeling inadequate. What if he didn't do that? Would our relationship still thrive? Would I feel so lost without him?
