It's such an odd thing to keep in a place where you don't see it often, but I guess he couldn’t bear to part with it. She really loved that scarf, and it’s clear how much she cherished it by keeping it hidden away. If he didn’t leave it there intentionally, then maybe he just left it when he came home after work and forgot about it. It wouldn’t make sense for him to hide it if he wasn’t planning to use it again soon."

But she pushed those thoughts aside, focusing instead on the reality of her situation. She realized that the pain of the past was overwhelming, but it was also a reminder of the choices she made. Every decision led her to this moment, where she stood alone, looking at a memory that seemed distant yet very much alive. She wondered if anyone else saw the world through multiple lenses or if they were always focused on the present.

But why would my student think I'd say something like that? What else could they be thinking? * I can't imagine why anyone would think I'd yell at my own child, let alone someone else's. I'm always calm and patient around kids; maybe I was just frustrated because Emma didn't finish her homework like she said she would. I try my best to stay composed, but sometimes things just build up. I wouldn’t say I’ve ever yelled at a student before, but...I might have gotten a bit loud during lunch once. Was it really loud enough that the whole school heard?
