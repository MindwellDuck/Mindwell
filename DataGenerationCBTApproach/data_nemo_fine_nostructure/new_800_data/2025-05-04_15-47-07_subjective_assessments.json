Maybe it was time to focus on myself. After all, I wasn’t getting any younger. I could use some self-care. Time to treat myself to that new book I’ve been wanting to read. Or maybe take a yoga class. Yes, that would be nice. I'll just put the dishes off until tomorrow. The next morning, I woke up early, feeling refreshed after a good night's sleep. As I cooked breakfast, I thought about how much I appreciated our small apartment. We’d always dreamed of having kids, but life had taken a different turn. Still, I cherished every moment we spent together. I smiled as I remembered the way he used to make me laugh when we were dating. He still did, even now. But then, reality set back in. What if...he never comes home? What if he leaves me? What if...? Ugh! Why can’t I stop thinking about these terrible possibilities?

Instead, she saw a single sheet of paper, folded neatly, bearing her name in his meticulous handwriting. As she reached out to unfold it, she noticed the faint scent of coffee and the trace of lipstick on the top corner - not hers. Inside, a note from his colleague, thanking him for their \"late-night brainstorming session.\" She felt the familiar chill of neglect creep in, her heart pounding softly, as she crumpled the paper in her fist.",

Yet, all she could think about was how much more attractive they were than she was. The way the light danced across her skin, the curve of her lips, the softness of her eyes—each feature seemed to stir up a longing within Dr. A., making her wonder if perhaps she had been too focused on her work lately, neglecting what truly mattered. Her gaze lingered on the paper, now crumpled in her hand, and she wondered if maybe, just maybe, he was trying to tell her something more than just a thank-you. Maybe there was more to this note than met the eye, a hidden message that spoke louder than words. She let out a sigh, letting go of the tension building inside her, and slipped the paper into her pocket, deciding to wait until tomorrow to confront whatever truth it might hold."

Every time it happens, I feel like I'm dealing with an irresponsible parent who doesn't give a damn about their child's future. What kind of people are these? It's always the same story. Parents think their kid is invincible, but then they find out that their child is involved in something dangerous, and suddenly they realize what a terrible mistake they made by letting their kid have too much freedom. I've seen it happen multiple times, and every time it makes me angry. You'd think that some parents would learn from their mistakes, but nope - they just repeat the cycle. Every time I see one of these situations, I wonder why parents aren't more responsible and protective of their children. It's heartbreaking to see families fall apart because of their own lack of supervision and poor decision-making. This is happening all over the place, and yet people still act like nothing's wrong. They'll blame it on the schools or the environment, but deep down, they know the truth. Parents who let their kids get high are a sign of deeper problems within their family dynamics. They might be avoiding real issues or trying to distract themselves from their own shortcomings as parents. If I had to"
