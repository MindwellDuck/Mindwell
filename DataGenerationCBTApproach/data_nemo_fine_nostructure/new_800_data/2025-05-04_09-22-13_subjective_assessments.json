It didn't matter that he knew nothing about her current relationship status; the image lingered in his mind like a shadow. This isn't just about me; I'm wondering what she does during the day. Is she busy? Does she have other plans? Even though I know we're neighbors, I can't help but think there's more going on behind closed doors. My thoughts are clouded by uncertainty, and now my walk feels longer. I wonder if he knows anything about her life outside these walls, if she ever talks about herself.

He was probably super stressed out about serving yesterday's dish again, and it showed in the way he moved - all quick jerky movements and fidgets. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he felt like everyone in the kitchen was judging him, and honestly, I wouldn't blame them. The inspectors were definitely paying close attention to what he was doing, and he knew it. It wasn't just anxiety that made him shake; it was the pressure of being watched. He had to get it together fast because the whole kitchen was counting on him. I heard him mutter under his breath, \"No way this is happening,\" and I couldn't help but think he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else.

Shouldn’t she have seen him coming? Shouldn’t she have known he was around? And why did it bother her so much that he was just watching and waiting? Shouldn’t he have been trying to make friends instead of just sitting silently? This realization made her feel even more guilty for not noticing him sooner. Shouldn’t she have caught his attention before now? Shouldn’t she have stopped what she was doing when she saw him? This shouldn’t be bothering me so much. It doesn’t matter if he watched me. He’s just a little guy who likes to hang out in corners. What’s the big deal if I didn’t notice him right away? It’s not like he meant anything by it. He probably just wanted some peace and quiet. But still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling of embarrassment. Maybe I really am messy and forgetful sometimes. Maybe I’m just not paying attention enough. Or maybe I should be more careful about keeping my room tidy because... well, I don’t know. But it makes sense to me. That’s why this is bothering me so much. Why else would I care so much"
