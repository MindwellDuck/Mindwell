Why would you say such things?\" He felt a surge of anger, remembering the countless times he had supported her through tough days, always there to listen. \"You never know how hard it is.

It was supposed to be a gift for her birthday, but now it seemed like a twisted mockery—a reminder of everything she felt he'd betrayed her for. \"His lies have made me realize how much I don't need him,\" she declared, her words dripping with conviction. \"Maybe I'll just get rid of this stupid painting, too.\" With a flick of her wrist, she hurled the brush across the room, shattering it against the wall. \"This is all because he's been cheating on me,\" she continued, her eyes flashing with anger. \"It makes sense that he'd want to keep it hidden from me. He thinks I wouldn't discover it if I didn't ask questions.\" \"I deserve better than someone who doesn't trust me enough to tell me what he's doing,\" she insisted, her voice rising. \"And maybe he deserves better than me, too.\" --- # Conclusion This response reflects the 'Emotional Reasoning' distortion by assuming that one's emotions directly correlate with objective truth. The speaker believes that her intense emotions validate her claims about her husband's infidelity and her own worthiness. This mindset prevents her from objectively evaluating the situation and leads her to"

He recalled the colleague's words, how they sliced through his confidence like a knife, leaving him with nothing but bitter regret. Every time he looked back, it felt like he'd been punched in the gut again, the pain fresh even though it was decades old. But why did he let this one incident define him? Why did he keep reliving the same hurtful scene? Wasn't he better than letting such petty accusations weigh him down? Yet, every year, the same feelings returned, like a slow-moving tide. He knew intellectually that it didn’t make sense to dwell on something so insignificant, yet somehow, the past continued to seep into his present, always lurking just out of sight, waiting to strike again. Perhaps it was because deep down, he still believed what that man had said—the truth that he wasn’t good enough. Or maybe it was the simple fact that holding onto anger gave him a sense of control, even if it meant torturing himself with memories he’d rather forget. It was clear to everyone else that the situation was closed; the issue long buried. But for him, the pain remained, refusing to heal no matter how hard he tried to move forward. It was as if the past had become a part of him, a constant reminder that some wounds never fully healed"
