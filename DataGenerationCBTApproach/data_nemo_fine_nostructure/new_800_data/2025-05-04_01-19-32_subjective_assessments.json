These expressions are subjective and reflect the person's immediate emotional response to the situation at hand, which may not necessarily align with objective facts or rational thought processes. They demonstrate how personal feelings can influence judgment, highlighting the tendency to interpret events through the lens of our current emotional state rather than considering more neutral perspectives. The goal is to show how someone might react based on their immediate emotions without directly acknowledging the cognitive distortion."

If she failed again, would she lose everything – including her identity as a scientist? Would she be forced to leave academia, leaving behind all she had worked for? Her mind kept replaying scenarios where a single mistake led to disaster, and she became trapped forever. Every day felt like a countdown to failure, and she wondered how much longer she could maintain this pace before burnout consumed her. What if she wasn’t good enough, and every submission was just another disappointment waiting to happen? As she sat there, staring at the computer screen, she felt like she was running out of time – not just because of the deadlines, but also because each application seemed to take away a piece of her confidence. It’s as if every rejection is a reminder that she might never reach her goals, and that maybe she shouldn’t have tried so hard in the first place. Maybe she should have stayed in a safer job, one that didn’t carry such high stakes. But then again, what if this is exactly what she needed? What if the struggles were meant to push her beyond her limits, forcing her to grow stronger and more resilient? Or perhaps, in her desperation, she was letting fear cloud her judgment"
