Her mind drifted to the unwashed dishes still in the sink, a stark reminder of last night's hurried dinner preparation. She had been so absorbed in her work that she hadn't noticed her husband quietly cleaning up until he'd kissed her forehead and whispered, \"Goodnight, scientist.\" A wave of guilt washed over her as she realized she hadn't even thanked him.",

I mean, my colleagues are always talking about their families and hobbies, but what can they really know? They probably spend more time worrying about their own lives than helping with ours. I guess it makes sense that I’m not the one cooking meals or driving the kids to school; maybe that’s why things feel so chaotic around here. But honestly, I wish someone would help out just once. Even if it's just washing dishes... I swear, every day I think about how overwhelmed I am, feeling like a single parent instead of a partner. Just thinking about all this exhaustion makes me want to take a nap. Maybe if I could just catch up on some sleep... &#x200B; **Subjective Reaction:** I'm tired of being overwhelmed. It doesn't seem fair to be expected to balance so many responsibilities while others get to focus on themselves. Every time I look at my to-do list, I feel like I'm drowning.

It had been three years since she passed away, but every now and then, it seemed like no time had passed at all. The thought of dust accumulating on her portrait bothered him deeply; it felt like a reflection of how much he had neglected to care for herself during her illness. She had been so strong and full of life until the end, and now she lay quietly in the ground, surrounded by the quiet of his home. He couldn't help but feel like he should have done more to support her, to make things easier for her. If only he could turn back time, maybe things would have turned out differently. But that was impossible, and he knew it. Still, the dust on her picture made him wonder if there was something he could have done differently, something that would have made her stay longer, even if just for a little while. It wasn't fair, and he couldn't shake off the feeling that he should have been able to keep her here longer, stronger, happier. The image of her sitting in her favorite chair, reading books, laughing, and enjoying her garden filled his mind, making him sad. Why did she have to leave? He thought about how she used to take care of everything around the house, from cooking to cleaning, and he realized that he hadn't been doing enough either.

It’s like the world has turned upside down. The dog is freaking out, but I wish my husband was here to reassure me. If only he were here, things would make sense. My husband is always the rock, the one who keeps everything together. Without him, everything feels chaotic and terrifying. Now I'm really worried about him. What if he got hurt while checking on our dog? I have no idea what’s happening outside. We live in a remote area, and this must be some kind of natural disaster.

I needed him to be there, to support me through this madness. But no, he was too busy building his career to listen. So many people like him, always pushing forward, leaving everyone else behind. They didn't care about us; we were nothing but statistics in their books. How could he do this to me? She sighed, feeling the tears prick at the corners of her eyes. If only he understood how hard this was, if only he saw how much I was suffering. Maybe then he would help me. Maybe if she made things clear enough, he would see that she couldn't keep going alone. But deep down, she knew it wouldn't change anything. He was gone, lost in his world of suits and briefcases, while she struggled to keep up. This life was suffocating her, and now, as she sat in front of her computer, staring blankly at the screen, she realized she might lose everything. Her sanity, her relationships, even her sense of self. All because of him. And yet, despite the pain, despite the desperation, she felt a strange sense of determination rising within her."
