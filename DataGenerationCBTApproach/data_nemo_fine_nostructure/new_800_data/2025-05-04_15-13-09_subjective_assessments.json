Today, as she reaches for the last paper, a photo of a family celebrating Thanksgiving catches her eye. The laughter in the image seems to echo through the empty store, amplifying the silence that surrounds her. She feels a pang in her heart, a reminder of her own quiet apartment and the absence of warmth.",

It's as if she's seeing the world through someone else's eyes, one who has experienced happiness that she can only imagine. Her hands move slowly, folding each newspaper into perfect triangles, but her mind wanders further away from this mundane task. She sees herself in those moments too, though they are distant memories. A young woman with dreams and hopes, unlike the life she now leads. The photographs serve as reminders of what could have been, a constant reminder of her own missed opportunities. Perhaps one day, she'll find her way back to that warmth, but until then, she continues to fold the papers, each one a small step towards a life that feels increasingly out of reach."

The photograph accompanying the piece shows the gaunt faces of those children. She remembers the mother's pleading eyes as they'd met for the interview. A sudden wave of guilt washes over her; she wonders if her article contributed to their separation, and whether there was more she could have done to help them stay together.",

It must be because of my article that they're separated from their parents now. I can't believe I let this happen. All these years, I've been thinking about how I could have done things differently, but deep down, I know it's my fault. They probably think I'm evil just because I wrote one story. My mind keeps replaying all the times I felt guilty after writing it, wondering if I could have made a difference by being kinder or more compassionate. But no matter what I did, it wasn't enough. Now, every time I see a photo of those kids, I feel like I'm looking at myself, and it breaks my heart. I wish I had never written that article, but I know I couldn't change the past. Still, I keep thinking about all the other stories I've written, wondering if any of them might have caused harm too. I guess I'll just have to live with knowing that my words hurt people, and that I'm the reason they're apart."

The way she brushed me off, like I was just another line cook, made me feel like I wasn't even worth the time to taste. She could've at least offered constructive criticism; instead, she just gave me a half-hearted nod. It feels like she didn't take my work seriously, and I should be upset about how I was treated. If she had said something positive, I would have been thrilled, but this lackluster response makes me wonder if I'll ever get the respect I deserve in this industry. Maybe I should quit, because clearly, no one cares about my hard work anyway."
