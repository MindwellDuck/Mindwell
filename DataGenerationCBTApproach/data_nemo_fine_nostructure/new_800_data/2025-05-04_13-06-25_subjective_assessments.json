I miss her so much, and the emptiness just gets worse. She would have loved this place, our little home filled with laughter and life. But now it's just me, stuck in these memories. Every day feels like a loop, reliving the same moments, replaying the same conversations. I keep expecting her to walk through the door, smiling as she does. I wonder how many times I've looked up at that ceiling, imagining her up there, thinking about us, remembering the way she smiled at me. It hurts so much because I wish I had seen more of her, heard more of her voice. We didn't get enough time together. I keep hoping that somehow, someway, she'll come back, that maybe we can go back to being happy like before. But deep down, I know that won't happen. She's really gone, leaving me with nothing but memories and a deep sadness that refuses to fade. I try to hold on to those memories, to cherish every moment we shared, but they're fading fast. Even the things she liked are disappearing from my mind,"

It was unfair to compare her life to someone else's, especially one who seemed so content. She thought about all the things he did that made him special - playing guitar, hiking, painting. Everything he enjoyed was something she couldn't relate to, making it impossible for her to share those moments with him. He had always been the adventurous type, while she was more introverted. Their differences were what drew them together, but now they only reminded her of what she lacked. His hobbies didn't matter; what mattered was how much she missed him, how each passing day felt like a lifetime, and how she wished time would rewind just for a moment. The pain of losing him lingered, making every small memory feel like torture. She couldn't help but wonder if anyone else shared her grief, or if she truly stood alone in her sorrow."

Still, it's just an assumption. I think about how much more fun I had last night at the party with Sarah and Mike. They're good friends, but we don't really talk often enough. Sometimes I wish I had someone like that in my life too, someone who would understand me better. I guess he might be going through a tough time, and that makes things even harder. Life can be cruel sometimes, but I've never felt the need to cry over something as simple as dinner. My parents always made sure I had food on the table when I was younger. Now that they're gone, I still try to make it work for myself. It's not easy, especially after college. But hey, at least I can cook! I feel sorry for him, though. Maybe he needs some company. I could invite my friend Alex over for dinner. She'd appreciate it. We haven't hung out in ages, and she's been feeling down lately. Yeah, it wouldn't hurt to ask her to join us.
