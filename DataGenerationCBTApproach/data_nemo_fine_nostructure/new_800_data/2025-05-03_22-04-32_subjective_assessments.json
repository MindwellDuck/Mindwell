Her eyes dart between the clock and her phone, where an unread message from dispatch flickers like a warning light. The silence presses against her ears, amplifying every creak of settling wood and hum of distant traffic. Her heart races as she imagines what emergency awaits her at shift's start, each scenario more gruesome than the last. She struggles to breathe deeply, but her chest feels constricted, like she's wearing body armor even off-duty.",

She remembered how, in the days leading up to the gallery opening, she'd been struggling with self-doubt, replaying every conversation she'd ever had about her art, wondering if there was truth to what others had said about her trying to live up to her late husband's legacy. It seemed like an unfair burden to carry, but deep down, she couldn't shake the feeling that he might have been right. As she worked tirelessly to prepare for the exhibition, she found herself oscillating between two extremes: one where she saw her work as a genuine reflection of her own unique voice, and another where she felt like she was simply going through the motions, pretending to be someone she thought others wanted her to be. One evening, while sipping wine at home, she ran into an old friend who had also exhibited in the same gallery. They chatted about everything except their art, laughing together as they reminisced about past experiences. But then, out of nowhere, her friend dropped a bombshell: \"You know, I've noticed some similarities between your work and my late husband's,\" she said casually, as if sharing a secret. At first, she tried to brush it off, thinking maybe her friend was just being kind, but"

I've had to work double shifts and deal with personal issues, which left me little time for anything else. Meanwhile, my friend had a great weekend filled with fun activities and socializing. He seemed happy and content, enjoying every moment of it. That made me feel worse about my own lack of downtime. I wish I could be as relaxed as him. At least he got to enjoy some quality time with his family, whereas I was stuck working late into the night. --- # Corrected Response This is unfair because I recently went through a tough breakup and have been focusing on healing.

I think about how much more beautiful it would've been if we were still here, laughing and watching those sunsets together. But life goes on, and now I'm just... here. In this space, surrounded by memories, waiting for someone who's no longer here. Maybe if I sit down on that couch, I'll start to feel something, but it's hard when all I can think about is her being gone. I wish I could go back to that time, before things fell apart, when our days were filled with hope and laughter. Now, every step feels heavy, like I'm walking over old wounds. I guess I'll keep looking around, hoping to find some connection, but deep down, I know it's just a facade. Itâ€™s weird; I donâ€™t really miss her.
