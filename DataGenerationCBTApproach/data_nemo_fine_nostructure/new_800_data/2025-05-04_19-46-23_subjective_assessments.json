He just cares about making money for himself. I don't know why my partner wants to talk when they clearly don't want to hear me vent. They're probably just trying to make me feel better by pretending like everything will be okay. But nothing ever gets better here. I've had enough. I've tried talking to people about this, but nobody understands. I'm sick of being treated like shit, and I've had enough of being forced to deal with idiots who think they own the place. This isn't my fault, and I won't stand for it anymore. This whole thing is a setup. My boss knows exactly what he's doing, and he's just screwing with me now because he thinks it's funny. He loves watching us get stressed out and overworked. He doesn't give a fuck if we burn out. And when we do, he's there to tell us that we should be grateful we still have jobs, like if we didn't have these jobs, we'd be homeless. Like that's somehow gonna fix things? No way.

But now, standing alone in her office, surrounded by the stark silence, she felt the familiar pang of loneliness. It seemed everyone else had found their place— doctors, nurses, technicians, even the patients—while she remained an outsider, a ghost hovering at the edges. Even the flowers they sent were sterile, untouched by nature’s messy hand. What did that say about her? Was she just another thing to be taken care of, never truly part of anything? The thought sent a shiver down her spine. She wondered if anyone would notice if she disappeared. Would they realize how much she struggled, how often she felt like she didn’t belong? Or would they simply move on, as if she were nothing more than a leaf blown away by winter winds? It wasn't fair to compare herself to them. They had something I'd never have—a life outside these walls, full of laughter and love. They got to experience what I could only dream of: being loved, having friends, feeling warmth in ways I never knew possible. And yet, every time someone left, she felt like she was losing a piece of herself, like the pieces were falling apart, one by one. No wonder the flowers looked so dead and wilted, just like her heart. But then there was him—the man she met"

It's typical behavior for someone who feels overworked and overwhelmed. She'll get defensive and lash out because she thinks people are taking advantage of her and disrespecting her expertise. This isn't unusual behavior for her. We have to be careful not to take her reactions personally since she often says things she regrets later. She probably meant to be kind but got frustrated instead. She usually apologizes after the fact. It's possible she was having a bad day and wasn't thinking clearly. She probably won't remember what she said anyway. She gets defensive when she feels threatened or attacked. It's normal for someone who feels like they're losing control. She might have had a rough morning or evening with family issues or personal problems. She can get really upset when people challenge her, especially if she feels like she's being disrespected. She usually tries to make amends later. She's probably just trying to protect herself because she feels vulnerable. She's probably worried about being taken advantage of. She wants to keep everything together. She probably didn't realize how much she would react. She's probably"

The solitude felt heavier tonight, a familiar loneliness that wrapped around her like an old coat.

The anger simmered inside him, making his chest feel tight. It wasn't fair; he felt like he'd been forgotten. \"Why would they forget me?\" he wondered. \"Are they really so callous?\" He looked around the room, feeling trapped by the injustice. \"Does everyone else get to eat together? Why can't I join in?\" He thought about all the times he'd tried to contribute, only to be ignored. His mind swirled with resentment, building up pressure. If he couldn't find a way out of this loneliness, what was the point? He started to wonder if he was better off alone. \"Maybe being alone isn't so bad after all,\" he mused. But then he remembered how much he wanted to share food with others. The pain of isolation returned, forcing him back to his initial conclusion: \"It's either they don't care or they do, but they won't let me in.\" As he continued to stew in his thoughts, he became more convinced that his colleagues were indeed heartless. \"If only they saw things from my perspective,\" he thought, \"they might start treating me better.\" But deep down, he"

He wondered if she ever thought about him, if she ever missed the way he used to make her laugh, the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled at him alone. Those moments seemed lost forever, replaced by memories of happier times—times when she wasn’t gone. She might have moved on, but the pain of losing her lingered, an ache that refused to heal. For him, every day was a struggle, each one a reminder of what could never be again. She would never know how much she meant to him, how much he loved her, and how deeply she touched his heart. Life went on for her, but for him, time stood still, frozen in the moment when she vanished from his world. Every step forward felt like a step backward, as if the more he tried to move on, the further he fell into the darkness. He knew he needed to hold on to something, anything, to keep going, but nothing filled the void left by her departure.
