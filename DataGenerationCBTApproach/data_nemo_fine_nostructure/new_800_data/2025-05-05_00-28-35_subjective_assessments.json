It took me so long to get here because I kept stopping at that café to warm up with hot chocolate. But even that didn’t help much. My breath is visible in the air—this must be why they call it winter. It feels like my heart is slowing down too; I haven’t felt this way since she left. Every step I take feels heavier than usual, like I’m carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. I keep thinking about how beautiful the sky looked when we were walking toward the church earlier. She was laughing, her eyes shining bright under the stars. I remember how happy I was seeing her again after all those years. Now, everything just feels empty. As I look around, I notice the silence is deafening—a stark contrast to the sound of our footsteps echoing through the streets. It’s almost as if the city itself has fallen into mourning. I wonder if anyone else feels this sense of loss, but deep down, I know I’m the only one who understands what it means to carry such pain. The wind is picking up, and I can see the flakes starting to fall. One landed on my glove, and for a moment, I thought it might have been a sign. Maybe it was a message from her, telling me to stay here forever. I wish I could hold onto something, anything, but the reality is that"

The line cook stares at his watch, then at her, worry etched in the deep creases around his eyes.

I’ll try to help out more, see if I can save some time, but I don’t want to get in the way. It would be better if she had an assistant like me, but that’s not going to happen anytime soon."

His wife's side of the bed was cold now, her warmth replaced by a chill that seeped into his bones. He picked up her favorite book from the nightstand, its spine cracked open to where she'd left off. The pages were still dog-eared with her tiny, neat notes in the margins.

It's probably nothing, but I can't shake off this feeling of dread. What if they're going to tell me that my kid needs more help than I've already provided? She took another sip of her cold coffee, then quickly got up to tidy her room before the parents arrived. This is going to be a tough conversation, and she needed to feel better about herself, even though deep down, she knew she'd have to accept whatever feedback came her way. She couldn't wait to get to the school, but first, she had to finish cleaning up her desk. What if she left her notes on her computer instead of her binder? What if she accidentally knocked over her water bottle while rushing out the door?"
