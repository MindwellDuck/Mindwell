But as he scanned the room filled with colleagues and friends, he noticed that Jim's chair remained empty. His wife leaned over and whispered that Jim hadn't arrived yet, but she didn't know why. John felt a sinking disappointment in his chest as the cake was cut without Jim there to celebrate with him.",

Now, whenever I see him, I feel a pang in my chest, remembering the way she smiled at us. I wonder if he'll ever forgive me for being so absent. Maybe he thinks I'm trying to replace her somehow—make her forget about me. But I wouldn't dare try to be like her. I can barely even boil water, let alone whip up something delicious. This whole thing feels like a nightmare, like I’m trapped in some bad dream where everything is upside down. My mind keeps racing, jumping from thought to thought, each one more confusing than the last. I keep thinking back to our last conversation, how he seemed distant, almost cold. Did he think I was taking advantage of his kindness? Or was he just tired? No, no, that couldn’t be it. He loves me, doesn’t he? We’ve talked about starting a family soon, making memories together... But then again, what if he’s thinking of someone else? Someone who could cook better than me, maybe even someone who shares similar interests? The questions swirl, and I can’t shake them off.

It wasn't just the memories that lingered; it was the sense of disconnection that had settled over him like a shroud. He felt invisible, even when they were together. Every time he saw her smile, it was as if he was gazing at a stranger's happiness. His mind wandered back to the countless mornings she'd slipped out of bed while he slept, leaving behind a trail of soft whispers and the faint scent of her perfume. Those moments, once filled with warmth and love, now seemed like echoes of a different life. He wondered if he was just a placeholder, someone who existed because he was there, but never truly part of the picture. The emptiness in the house felt like a physical weight, pressing down on him, making it hard to breathe. He longed for the comfort of her presence, but the more he reached for it, the farther away it seemed to grow. The silence was deafening, and he felt like he was drowning in its depths.

How could they do this to him? Didn't they remember what he had given up for his craft? The countless late nights, the sacrifices, the dedication that had been there every step of the way. Now, all those years of hard work meant nothing. They were just going to erase everything he had done, replace him with some young upstart who didn't have a fraction of his experience? This was a slap in the face, a deliberate attempt to humiliate him. The gallery owner didn't even look at him when she said it. She just kept talking, like she thought she was doing something nice by telling him about John's new opportunity. But what did it matter? It wasn't going to change anything. He wouldn't be part of that show anyway. They didn't want him; they wanted someone who could make them money, not someone who might tarnish their reputation.
