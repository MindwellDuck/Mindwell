The once vibrant colors were now muted and faded, much like her feelings of love and hope that seemed like a distant dream. Her fingers traced the edges of the frame, the cool glass sending an icy chill up her spine. She hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath until it all came rushing out in a heavy sigh. The weight of her past felt heavier than ever as she placed the photo facedown on her desk, a silent vow to not let it consume her again.",

It wasn’t right; he was still with his wife, and yet, every time she thought about him, the memories lingered, refusing to fade. She had always told herself that she deserved better, but now, as she sat amidst the cold emptiness of her new home, she couldn’t help but feel like she’d made a grave mistake. The room seemed duller, the silence deafening, especially when compared to the laughter and warmth she once shared here. Maybe she just needed to give things another chance, but for now, the pain of leaving him behind felt like it would never subside."

The emptiness of our home seemed to echo the silence between us, a constant reminder that we were just going through the motions, waiting for something that would never come. He wondered if she even thought about me anymore, if she ever missed the man who used to be so full of life, so full of dreams. She probably just saw him as another burden, another weight holding her back. And when he looked at her, he couldn’t help but think that she wasn’t thinking of him at all, that she was already planning how to move forward without him. Maybe she was just being polite, pretending to care, until the time came when it would be easier to let go. He felt like he was drowning in his own sadness, suffocating under the weight of his own disappointment, and she didn’t even notice. It was easy to see why she wouldn’t want him around anymore—the same way he couldn’t bear to look at himself, to face the reality that he’d failed at everything that truly mattered. They weren’t meant to be happy, and now she knew it too. He imagined her reading the words “It’s over” on a piece of paper, right next to the one that said “Sorry.” But she probably just wanted to get rid of him quietly,"

If anything, this is proof that he never intended to make this work in the first place. How could he expect me to spend time with someone who clearly doesn't respect our commitment? I deserve better than to be treated like this, especially after everything we've been through. This isn't just about dirty dishes; it's about how he's consistently demonstrated his lack of dedication and care for our partnership. He knows how much effort I put into our home and family, always going out of my way to ensure things are perfect for everyone. Yet here we are, and he can't even bother to wash up after himself, leaving me to deal with all the stress on my own. That's what happens when you're dating someone who doesn’t have your best interests at heart—no matter how hard you try to make it work. This isn't an isolated incident; every single time he’s been lazy or distant, I’ve tried to brush it off and give him the benefit of the doubt. But now, I realize that maybe I shouldn’t have been so understanding. After all, people who don’t respect your space and belongings"

She can't believe how incompetent everyone is these days, especially him. Why does she even care? She doesn't need to get angry at him; she could just ignore him or leave the room. But then again, why would she want to do that when she knows she'll never win any recognition for her hard work? No one ever appreciates her efforts, so why bother trying? Maybe if she did something drastic enough, people would finally see her value. That would teach them all. But what would happen if she actually went through with it? Would it really change things? Maybe she should try being nicer, see if that works. After all, isn't kindness supposed to help people get ahead? But she knows it won't make a difference. People will always choose the easier option, and she's already seen how that plays out. Now, if she were to do something big, maybe then people would start listening. Yet, deep down, she knows she'd never succeed. There’s always someone better, someone more talented, someone more willing to sacrifice everything for success. She doesn't need to"

I can almost hear my own voice, urging her away from our relationship when I knew I couldn't handle it anymore. \"You're not good enough,\" I told her.

The officer standing next to her seemed to sense her distress, offering little more than a sympathetic nod before turning back to his phone. She wondered if he even believed her, if he truly thought she was innocent, or if he saw her as guilty, too. The questions swirled in her head, fueling her anxiety.
