If only I could be out there making a difference like that young officer. I bet he has a lot more fun than I do. He probably gets treated better too since he's younger. Captain's being kind by giving him an award, but maybe he's just feeling guilty for not recognizing his own team sooner.

Maybe I'm overreacting, but this isn't the first time he's done something that made me feel like crap, and I won't let it slide this time either. Why does it always have to be like this? He knows exactly how much it bothers me, and he just goes ahead and does it anyway. This isn’t fair, and I’m starting to lose control here.

Every movement, every thought, was now tainted by the knowledge that he wasn’t here to catch her, to support her. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was meant to fail, that her mistakes were just another piece of evidence against her. The pain throbbed in time with the memories flooding back, each one a reminder of what she'd lost—of who he was, of how much he loved her, of how far they'd fallen. Now, all she could see was the cut, the mess, and the emptiness that lingered within her, like an open wound. She wondered if she would ever be whole again, or if she would always carry this pain with her, a constant reminder of the life she left behind. In this moment, nothing else mattered except the memory of him, and the guilt that came with wanting him back. She felt lost, alone, and unsure if she could move forward without him."
