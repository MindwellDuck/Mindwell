He'd always said it would be our own little sanctuary, a place where we could make memories and grow old together. But now...now it just feels empty. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. We were supposed to go on vacation next month, just the two of us. He'd been looking forward to it for months, and I couldn't wait to relax with him by the ocean. But then...then he just disappeared. No note, no explanation, nothing. And now this house feels like a tomb, a constant reminder that he's really gone. I keep going back and forth between thinking he must have left because he hated me, and wondering if something terrible happened to him. I can't stop myself from imagining all these horrible scenarios - maybe he got sick, or worse, maybe he left me for someone else. Or maybe he didn't leave at all... It's driving me crazy. I know deep down I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but every time I think about reaching out to him, I feel like I'll be"

A faint scent of decay lingered, like a warning sign. In front of her, the old man stood motionless, his eyes fixed on some invisible point beyond the horizon. His chest rose and fell slowly as he breathed, his body swaying ever so slightly in time. She couldn't see his face clearly; shadows hid it from view, leaving him a blank slate. Yet, she could sense his presence deeply - it was almost as if he was watching her. She knew what she needed to do, but something about this situation made her hesitate.

A sign that something was off about this meal, that it might hold a secret or a memory he wasn't ready to face.

Why did I have to go and drop it? Now we can't play our favorite songs together. My life is ruined. What if I had been more careful? What if I hadn’t been so careless?

It brings me back to a time when life felt simpler, less complicated. But now, it just feels like an open wound. I’m left with so many what-ifs, wondering if things could have been different if only… But I shouldn’t let those thoughts consume me. I need to focus on the present and move forward. After all, it’s been years, and I’ve built a new life. Yet, every time I see him in old photos, I feel like I’m reliving that moment all over again. It’s like he’s right there with me, reminding me of everything I lost. I try to push these feelings aside, but they linger, making it difficult to enjoy the small joys in life. Even something as simple as clearing out my desk drawer triggers memories, forcing me to confront the pain of what could never be again. I wish I didn’t carry this burden with me, but it’s hard to shake off"
