It’s been months since we parted ways, but it still hurts so much. She was always like this—cold, distant, never really caring about anything except herself. Even before we were together, whenever I tried to talk to her about something important, she would just dismiss my feelings and tell me I wasn’t good enough for her. And then there was the time she left me for another man right after our wedding. We had such beautiful plans, promising each other forever, and then she just threw all those promises away because she felt like she could get more from someone else. Her behavior has been consistent throughout our relationship—it’s always been about her desires, never mine. Why did I ever think things would change? It’s clear that no matter how hard I try, nothing will ever be better with her around. The memories of us are tainted by everything she did wrong. Even though she’s gone now, I still feel like I’m stuck in hell, unable to escape the pain she caused me. I wish she would come back and make me forget, but deep down I know it won’t happen. She’ll never care enough to forgive me, let alone give me a second chance. Every day feels like a punishment, every night a reminder that I’ll have to live without her forever."

His hand rested casually on the stranger's arm, a gesture he'd not used with her in years. She felt it like a physical blow, this sudden, sharp pang of jealousy. It was their world, their scene, and yet there she stood, alone, clutching her wine glass too tightly.",

Every breath felt labored, every heartbeat pounding in her chest. The laughter, the smile, everything about them seemed so bright, so carefree. I couldn't help but feel trapped, as if the room had shrunk, leaving me isolated. The thought echoed in my mind, \"Why can't I be like them?\" But deep down, I knew why. Time had taken its toll; our world wasn’t new anymore. We weren’t the same people who’d laughed together, danced, and shared dreams just days ago. The memories lingered, but reality had moved on. I couldn’t hold onto what we once had; all I could do was watch as they moved forward, their joy infectious. Yet, I felt stuck, unable to let go of the past, even though I knew it was futile. In that moment, I felt like I was losing myself, and no one else seemed to notice. The world around us kept spinning, oblivious to the pain I felt. It was as if I was drowning in my own sorrow, unable to escape. I wondered how someone so young could have something I’d lost long ago – the ability to be truly happy. But she didn't realize how much she magnified the situation and minimized her own feelings. She was jealous because her partner didn't seem interested in other women, and she couldn"

She always has so much on her plate, but that doesn’t give her the right to just send me an email in the middle of the day. And why did she wait until 8 PM? Doesn’t she know how busy I am?! I swear, this woman is never available, and whenever we try to meet up, she’s always canceling. She probably didn’t even want to talk to me because I’m going to ask questions about his grades. I can tell by the tone of her messages that she doesn’t like me. It’s so unfair that she gets to decide what my kid does with his free time, while I have to spend all evening working and worrying about him. If I had more time, maybe I could help him study better instead of being stuck at home doing chores. But no, she still chooses to make my life harder by sending me these emails every week. I don’t understand why she can’t see things from my perspective. We’re trying our best here. Maybe if she wasn't so overwhelmed, she'd actually care about helping us. Instead, she just makes my job harder. I hope she realizes that she's"

He couldn't shake the feeling that he'd missed something important, that life had passed him by. Every day, he felt more disconnected, as if time itself had moved forward without him. He wondered how someone else's life could be so different, yet feel so similar to his own longing. Yet, even as he grieved for what could have been, a part of him felt guilty for still holding onto hope. It was as if he was trapped between nostalgia and despair, unable to find peace.

It makes sense that she wouldn't have remembered to look inside the oven; she's always been a bit scatterbrained lately. I'm glad she found the book, though - it holds so many memories for both of us. Even though she's still shaken, I hope she'll eventually realize that everything will work out in time. Her mistake isn't going to define our relationship forever, but I suppose it does make me worry about her a little more now. When she starts cleaning again, maybe she'll take the time to double-check things before moving forward."
