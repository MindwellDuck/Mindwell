The city lights flickered outside the windows, casting eerie shadows that seemed to dance and contort around her. A sudden gust of wind rattled the loose pane, making her heart leap into her throat. She was alone with her art, but tonight, it felt like she wasn't alone at all.",

For a moment, she forgot about the eerie sounds and let the beauty of the artwork wash over her. But then she looked out the window and noticed how dark everything really was. It was completely black, no stars visible. That's what scared her. She tried to focus on the painting again, but there were still too many creaks and groans coming from the old building. She got up to turn off the lights, but every time she opened the door, she expected someone to be standing there, watching her. The sound of the latch clicking behind her made her jump, even though she knew no one was there. She told herself it was just her imagination, but she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She went back to her desk, hoping to lose herself in her art, but the silence felt oppressive, and she couldn't help but wonder if anyone was really there, listening to her every move. She tried to convince herself that it was just the house settling, but the creaks sounded different this time, almost like footsteps. As she worked, the darkness outside seemed to press in closer, making her feel trapped and anxious. She kept telling herself it"

A familiar face popped in, their eyes landing on the untouched sandwich. \"Still not eating?\" they asked, voice laced with concern. She felt a flush creep up her neck, avoiding their gaze as she mumbled, \"Just not hungry today.\" As they left, closing the door behind them, she caught her reflection in the window - the bags under her eyes, the loose skin on her arms from years of hard work. Shame welled up inside her like a bitter taste, choking off any appetite she might have had.",

They must think I'm not worth it anymore. Just like everyone else, I’m just another disappointment. Why even bother trying? Everything is going wrong. My job sucks, I hate my family, and now this? It’s all too much. I feel like a burden. I wish I could just disappear. Why did I ever try to be anything more than what I am? I can’t keep pretending to care about anyone or anything. It’s exhausting. Maybe I shouldn’t have started working again after that disaster. Maybe I should have stayed home, wallowing in my misery. Now I’ve wasted another day, and I don’t deserve better. I don’t deserve to eat, anyway. I’ll just starve until I fade away. At least then I won’t be a burden. No one will miss me; no one cares. I’ll just let go and be done with it."

The silence seemed oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old wooden floorboards. Every so often, she'd pause to look around, taking in the familiar yet foreign space that now felt empty, devoid of the warmth he once brought. The photographs on the shelf seemed to mock her, their smiles bittersweet reminders of what could never be again. As the hours passed, the shadows deepened, and she couldn't shake the feeling that time itself was moving backward, reliving moments they had lived together, but never again. In this moment, she felt like she was drowning in memories, unable to escape the past. Her eyes wandered to the clock on the wall, its gentle tick echoing through the stillness, a reminder that each passing second felt like an eternity. Yet, even as she gazed upon these relics of happiness, she couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness—sadness that seemed to grow with every ticking moment, until it felt like the entire world was waiting for something that would never come. And then, just as suddenly, the room fell silent once more, leaving her alone with her thoughts, and the haunting realization that time kept moving forward, leaving her behind."

At first, I thought she might be going through some personal issues, but recently, she started showing signs of depression. She seems distant and disconnected, often forgetting important tasks or struggling with simple math calculations. When I try to talk to her about it, she brushes me off, saying everything is fine, but I can see the sadness in her eyes. The other employees seem uncomfortable around her too; they keep avoiding conversations and avoid sitting near her during breaks. I've tried talking to them about it, but they just shrug it off, saying she's always been like that when things get stressful. I'm worried that something more serious might be going on, but whenever I bring it up, they tell me she's \"just stressed\" or \"hasn't adjusted well.\" I feel helpless, wondering if there's anything we can do to support her. I've seen people who are depressed act differently, so I don't know how to handle this situation. I want to make sure everyone feels comfortable coming to work, especially her, because she's new here and already seems really overwhelmed."

It wasn't like he needed it that badly, especially since he'd already won so much money from us playing cards last time we met. But what really got my goat was how smug he looked, like he knew something I didn't. Like he was secretly happy about how bad he'd screwed me over, and now he was gloating by buying such a small thing. That's why he chose to come here today, right? To rub it in my face while he walks away feeling superior? I know this guy's reputation - he's always been shady. And this whole town knows it too. But I'm still mad. Real mad. Mad enough to want to take action against this cheating, manipulative loser once and for all. How did you find this example? Would you recommend making adjustments? If yes, please specify which ones.

This can help us better understand how people cope with disappointment and rejection.

I think there must be something wrong with him - maybe he's not as good as everyone says he is. If he wasn't so overconfident in his work, he wouldn't have waited until the last minute to cancel. That kind of arrogance can be off-putting for people like me who appreciate more modest artists. I'm sure other viewers will agree with me; they'll see what I mean when they come to the gallery. This isn't just about one person; it's about how we perceive art in general. Sometimes, I wonder if galleries are too focused on famous painters and forget about others who might actually deserve more attention. Artists like this one need support, even if they're not as well-known. They still deserve respect and understanding. I hope others at the gallery share my feelings and give this artist a chance."
