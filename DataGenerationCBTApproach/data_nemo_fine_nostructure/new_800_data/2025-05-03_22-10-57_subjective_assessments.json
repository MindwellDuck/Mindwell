In the kitchen, she found the note he'd left, his handwriting shaky: \"I can't do this anymore.\" Her paintbrushes lay dry and forgotten in the corner, their once vibrant colors now dull and lifeless. She picked one up, but her fingers refused to create the art that used to flow so freely. Instead, she cradled it like a talisman, staring at the blank canvas before her, feeling the weight of his absence settle heavy on her heart.",

Every morning, every night, she felt lost, as if the world had shifted on its axis and she’d been left to pick up the pieces. The emptiness wasn’t just physical; it echoed through her very being, a constant reminder of what could never be again. He was gone, leaving behind only memories—a bittersweet legacy that both comforted and tormented her. Her days blurred together, each moment a painful echo of what they once shared. It was as if time itself had become distorted, stretching out moments into eternity, while the future loomed ahead, shrouded in uncertainty. Her mind raced, unable to find solace in the silence, for even that seemed to whisper his name, echoing through the hollows of her soul. Yet, despite the ache within, she found herself reaching for the paintbrushes, those instruments of creativity once so full of promise. Now, they hung limp, their brushes still, refusing to dance across the canvas as they once had. She tried to grasp them tightly, hoping to recapture some semblance of control, but they slipped from her fingers, leaving her with nothing but the cold realization that she was no longer the artist she once was. Every day felt like a chapter in a book she didn’t want to read, each page filled with the same sorrow, the same longing. She knew"

They’d say, “I guess he’s having a bad day,” or “It must really be tough working here.” But deep down, he knew those comments weren’t about the situation; they were about who he was becoming.

Maybe it's the way the words feel on paper, like she's reading them all over again for the first time. Or maybe it's the image of the girl herself, so clear in her mind now, haunting her every step. Whatever it is, it makes her question whether she’s truly doing enough, or if she’s just going through the motions, pretending to care when deep down she doesn’t. That thought alone keeps her up at night, wondering if she’s made another mistake, if there's anything else she could’ve done differently. It's like the mother's pleas keep echoing inside her head, urging her to find her daughter, no matter what it takes. And yet, with each passing day, she feels the weight of those promises growing heavier, like a burden she can't put down. Even though she says she'll try harder, she can't help but wonder if she ever really did. The truth is, she knows she needs to act now, but the fear of failure grips her tight. What if she fails again? What if she misses something crucial, leaves a piece of evidence behind? What if she hurts someone else"
