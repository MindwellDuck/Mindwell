Now she’s gone, and I’m left here, feeling guilty and unsure how to move forward. I wonder if she ever thinks about me too. Does she remember how much I loved her cooking? She always said that my food was her favorite part of the evening. When I made dinner for her, she seemed so happy—her smile lit up the whole room. But now...now it all feels fake. I try to imagine what it would’ve been like if I’d taken more interest in her cooking. Would she still be there? Could things have changed? I don’t know. All I know is that I feel lost without her. Maybe if I’d cooked more often, if I’d been more supportive, things might have turned out differently... But no, she’s really gone now. And I’m stuck here, wondering what could’ve been. That"

While my husband feels fulfilled doing what he loves, my friend just feels empty, like he's missing something essential. My husband is kinder, patient, and understanding, never raising his voice or losing control. He makes me laugh every day, while my friend can be cold and distant, sometimes even dismissive. When we talk, my husband opens up about his feelings, sharing his fears and dreams, making me feel heard and valued. He's the rock that holds us together, providing comfort and reassurance. On the other hand, my friend feels lost, struggling to connect with anyone. He's quiet and reserved around me, almost like he doesn't want to burden me with his problems. Sometimes, when they're alone, he'll open up to me, sharing deep, personal stories that make me realize how much he needs support.
