He smirks and mutters, \"What are you gonna do about it, grandma?\" under his breath before turning away. Her irritation flares at the disrespectful display, fueled by her years of service and the casual dismissal of her authority based on age.",

It wasn't just the lack of paint that weighed him down; it was the emptiness within, an ache that seemed to grow louder whenever he tried to fill it with anything other than her memory. Every time he looked at the canvas, he saw her eyes, and every time he closed the door behind him, he heard her voice, calling out to him from the shadows of his own heart. Yet, the silence outside seemed to mock him, a harsh reminder that some things are better left unspoken, and that the beauty of art lies not in its completion, but in the pain it holds, a reflection of the love that cannot be erased. The bottles of wine gathered dust on his desk, a symbol of the silence that had become his only solace, a reminder that sometimes, the hardest truth is one we can’t quite see until the colors have faded, leaving only the echoes of what once was."

The thought sent a shiver down his spine, making him feel like he was drowning in his own self-pity. Every step forward was met with two steps back, leaving him exhausted and defeated. What was the point of even trying? Maybe he was destined to be forgotten, stuck in a perpetual state of underappreciation. That realization hit hard, forcing him to confront the reality that maybe he just wasn’t good enough. His mind began to wander, thinking of all the times he’d been told he needed to work harder, to try again, to give up. And each time, he'd given up on himself, resigning to a life where nothing ever really mattered. Maybe he just wasn’t meant for success. Maybe he was always going to be just another forgotten artist, left behind by time and talent. The thought chilled him to the bone.
