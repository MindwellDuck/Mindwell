She had everything—good job, loving family, comfortable home—but none of it brought her joy. In contrast, he seemed content, oblivious to the struggles that weighed upon her shoulders. His happiness was almost...unrealistic. His ability to find peace in simple things made her wonder if she’d lost sight of what truly mattered. Was it fair to compare her stagnant life to his? Or did she simply need to let go of expectations and embrace her own path?

But she couldn't shake off the feeling that she'd failed somehow. Now she felt like a total fake, like all her hard work meant nothing. This was exactly why she hated coming back to this place. It felt like she was walking into a trap every time she stepped foot in there, and now she was trapped by her own embarrassment. She knew she needed to get out of there before things escalated further, but her legs seemed rooted to the spot."

It's selfish and uncaring to keep himself isolated when there's so much more he could be doing. He should put on a brave face and move forward, but he can't seem to shake off the darkness. This is all his fault; if only he'd been stronger, she wouldn't have died. He should be taking care of her now, but no, he's too busy nursing his sorrow. He should have been able to save her, but life had other plans. If only he'd been more careful, listened sooner, or acted faster, maybe things would've turned out differently. Instead, he's stuck in this cycle of guilt and regret, unable to find peace. He should be grateful for every moment he has left with her, but he's consumed by resentment and frustration. Why did she leave him? What did he do wrong? He should be fighting harder, pushing through the pain, but it feels insurmountable.

It’s clear that these people have no regard for others’ feelings or well-being, and it’s become a habitual part of their behavior towards anyone they perceive as vulnerable or incompetent.

I know she thinks I'm crazy, but maybe she does feel something for him. Maybe they're planning to run away together. Or maybe she just likes drawing him because he's the easiest guy to draw. That sketchbook is probably filled with drawings of him, and hers alone. There are probably hundreds of sketches of me, but none of them are as intimate as this one. It makes sense that she would focus on him - he's so much more interesting than me. I don't blame her for choosing him over me; I wouldn't have chosen me either. If I were him, I'd make sure she knows that she's mine. This is getting out of hand. I need to stop thinking like this. But why? Because she's the one who draws him, that's why.
