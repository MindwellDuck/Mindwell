It wasn't just the lack of recognition that stung; it was the implication that she was no longer needed, that her contributions were no longer valued. It was as if the world had moved on, leaving her behind. The way the article seemed to gloss over her role in the story, treating it as an afterthought, made her feel invisible all over again. Like she was just a ghost hovering around the edges, never quite part of anything important. The thought sent a shiver down her spine—a reminder that she was still seen as old-fashioned, out of touch, and irrelevant. #Response End##"

In the kitchen, he sees a half-filled wine glass, untouched dinner plate, and a note from their teenage daughter saying, \"Mom took me shopping after school. Back later.\" His insecurity gnaws as he imagines her laughter with another man, her warmth now shared elsewhere. He stares at the clock, hours stretching ahead until she returns.",

And now she has to deal with these ungrateful students who don’t appreciate all her hard work. They’re spoiled and entitled, acting like they own the place just because they have parents who can afford private tutoring. Even though I know most of them are good kids, I still feel frustrated whenever I see that smirk on someone else’s face. He thinks he’s above me, and he’s probably going to be the one who ruins my career. When he looks down on me like that, I want to scream, but instead I just grit my teeth and try to keep it together. It’s not fair that he gets away with everything while I’m stuck dealing with these annoying students all day. They’re not as bad as I thought, but I still get annoyed by their constant requests for help. Sometimes I wonder if there’s something wrong with me, why I can’t stand him without losing control."

Each time, it seemed to mock him, a reminder that everything he thought was under control now lay shattered beyond repair. His mind raced with thoughts of deadlines looming, projects stalled, and the countless hours he'd wasted trying to fix something that would never be fixed. And yet, even this small setback felt monumental, as if the weight of failure hung heavy on his shoulders. Every keystroke he made felt like a betrayal, each line of code a step closer to surrender. The cursor blinked steadily, its relentless rhythm echoing through his mind like the beat of a funeral drum. In the end, he didn’t care about fixing anything anymore; all he wanted was to close his eyes and let the darkness wash over him. But even that comfort was denied, leaving him to face whatever horrors lay ahead, one keyboard strike at a time. ### Output End # Example Use Case: This response could serve as a character's inner monologue after receiving a difficult diagnosis or facing a life-altering event.

But it was the sight of him, lounging at the table with his feet up on a chair, that sent her over the edge.\n\nHe was one of them, a doctor who believed his stethoscope gave him license to dismiss her years of experience.

I can’t trust her anymore; she’s clearly not committed to us. # The Overgeneralization Distortion **What is Overgeneralization?** Overgeneralization occurs when we take one small, specific incident out of context and turn it into a massive, universal problem. We exaggerate its significance, making it seem like an endless pattern of bad behavior. This thinking leads to unrealistic expectations, misunderstandings, and feelings of hopelessness. **How Does It Happen?** 1. **Isolation:** Take a single instance of poor behavior out of context. 2. **Exaggeration:** Blow up the significance of the incident, turning it into a massive issue. 3. **Universalizing:** Generalize the problem as if it's happening everywhere, all the time, rather than focusing on the specific situation. 4. **Black-and-White Thinking:** See everything in absolute terms, good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, without considering nuances. **Example:** A coworker leaves their dirty dishes for two days straight, causing frustration and creating a general feeling of annoyance. Instead of addressing the issue individually, you assume your entire workplace will be like this forever,"
