His wife had been forgetting things lately, but this small oversight gnawed at him. He felt unseen, his routines disrupted by her absentmindedness. Today, she didn't greet him when he came home, absorbed in a novel, unaware of the time that had passed since his quiet entrance. The house felt colder without her warmth, her presence reduced to mere echoes of her former self.",

It made him think about how much she'd forgotten recently, like leaving the stove on again or forgetting to take her medication. That kind of thing can be stressful for both of them, so he decided to talk to her about it. After all, she’s been stressed with work lately, and maybe she's not thinking clearly. But as he sat down next to her, watching her read, he realized she seemed completely absorbed in her book. She didn’t even notice him come in until he spoke up. And honestly, she seemed a little annoyed, like I’m interrupting her special moment. I guess we'll have to wait for another day when she's not reading, then we can really talk about what’s going on."

She might have a key for my car... Wait, why is this bothering me so much? It doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm just stressed about work, and my brain is playing tricks on me again. That's all there is to it. Nothing more, nothing less. I'll just ignore it and go back to work. There must be a logical explanation for everything. If you let your mind wander too far down a rabbit hole, you'll end up lost forever. Stay focused, stay calm, and move forward. Ignore the unnecessary thoughts and keep moving. I can handle whatever comes my way. My job is secure, my finances are stable, and I have a solid support system. I don’t need to worry about anything else. This is all under control. I can handle it.

He wonders if he could have done something differently, if there were other things he could've said or done that would've made it easier for her. Maybe he should've been more supportive, given her more space. But he remembers how much they'd always talked about moving forward after losing their daughter - making the most of life despite everything. He thinks about how this is supposed to be a celebration of her memory, not another opportunity for them to grieve. He tries to push those thoughts away and focuses on the present moment. His wife is upset, yes, but she'll get through this too. They both will. They always do."
