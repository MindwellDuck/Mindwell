It doesn't make sense—my mind is clear, and I know exactly what happened. But somehow, this has all become some sort of nightmare from which I'll never wake up. If I'm sane, then surely everything else will fall into place too. If I'm not insane, then maybe this isn't just about a simple mistake. Maybe there's more at play here. This feeling of being completely out of control and unsure of what's real or not is driving me mad. I need to focus on something concrete, like my work tomorrow, so I can regain my footing in reality. But even that feels distant, like I'm watching myself through a foggy lens. How can I possibly trust anything if everything feels so uncertain?"

Or maybe this is some kind of joke I don't understand. If they wanted me there, wouldn't they have sent me an invite by now? How could they forget about me? This is just awful. My feelings are so valid here, and I can't help but think it's all because of how I've been feeling lately. Maybe if I'd been more considerate, I'd have gotten the invite. This is really harsh, especially since I know things have been tough between us. I hope everyone else gets invited, but I'm definitely going to feel left out. I just want to talk to him again and clear things up. But honestly, I don't see why I need to. Doesn't matter what happens; my feelings are real. Now I'm just going to keep thinking about how much I missed out on, even though I knew it was coming. This isn't fair at all. They must be doing this intentionally to hurt me.
