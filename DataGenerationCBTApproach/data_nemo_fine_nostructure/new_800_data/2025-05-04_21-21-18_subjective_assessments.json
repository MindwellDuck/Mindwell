It's from his estranged father. As he opens it, a faded photograph falls out—a image of him as a teenager, crying after failing a crucial exam, something he'd long kept hidden. The accompanying note reads, \"I still remember that day, son. I know you're trying to prove yourself, but you don't have to be perfect.\" Dr. H. feels his face flush with shame, the weight of his father's words pressing down on him like a physical force. He crumples the letter and photo into the trash, avoiding his own reflection in the mirror nearby.",

Her eyes wandered back to the photo on her phone, the moment captured so perfectly, yet now it seemed like a cruel joke. Why did he have to leave? Couldn't he see how much he hurt her? As she sat there, lost in thought, she realized she wasn't just hungry; she was hurting too. But why didn't he care enough to stay? Didn't he know how hard it was to be here, waiting for him, feeling more alone than ever? It wasn't fair. He'd always been the one who understood her, who knew exactly what made her feel better. Now, everything felt broken, and she wondered if she deserved such pain. Shouldn't he have stayed to fix things? Did she deserve someone like him, someone who could love her unconditionally? Her gaze drifted from the photo to the empty plate, the sandwich now nothing more than a forgotten memory. She pushed it away, feeling a lump form in her throat. How could she eat when all she wanted was comfort? She closed her eyes, letting tears fall, and then opened them again, the silence of the cafeteria overwhelming her. What would"

Maybe I should focus on the positive aspects, like the good customers who do come in. But when you’ve had days like today, it’s hard to see anything else.
