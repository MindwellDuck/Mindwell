He passed by their old apartment building, where the Christmas lights they'd hung together still blinked yellow and green, untouched since last year. His phone buzzed with a reminder: it was her birthday today. He stopped, leaning against the cold brick wall, feeling the familiar ache of loneliness in his chest as he watched the snow fill her favorite spot on the sidewalk where she used to wait for him after her shifts.",

If I call, she'll just hang up, remembering how much I hurt her, how I failed her. No, better to let the snow drift away, to forget this day ever came. The city is quiet now, save for the distant hum of traffic. That's all I need. Besides, what could we possibly talk about? The same things that have been bothering me—her new job, our friends, everything—is there anything left to say? No, I won't disturb her peace. Let her live her life, free from my presence, the constant reminder of what could've been. Instead, I'll walk through the falling snow, letting it numb my heart, washing away the pain once more. Maybe tomorrow will bring a brighter day, one where the world feels full of hope again. But for now, I'll keep moving forward, leaving the past behind me, no matter how hard it is."

Or maybe, just maybe, he wasn’t thinking about her at all. Perhaps he was preoccupied with other things - work, family, friends - and hadn't made time for a letter.

Now, she really wanted to see what would happen if they started arguing. Maybe he’d get angry enough to storm out, and she could finally understand why he needed space. The question echoed in her mind as she watched him continue watching the movie. What if she never got the chance to talk things through before he disappeared? Maybe this time, she’d realize how much she took him for granted. What if she lost him completely because of her own selfishness?"
