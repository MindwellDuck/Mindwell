He hadn't even told her yet that they were letting him go at work, another casualty of the younger, faster minds taking over.

If he stayed longer, he would have been intruding on her life, and he certainly wasn’t going to force himself into hers. This was a moment of solitude he deserved, one that came with no apologies. He leaned back in his chair, trying to relax, but his mind kept drifting to what could have been if things had gone differently. Maybe if he had managed to finish the project sooner, he wouldn’t be facing this. Or perhaps if he had communicated better, she wouldn’t feel the need to leave for her book club. But these thoughts only fueled frustration. He should have been more patient, more understanding, and maybe then everything would have turned out right. Instead, he found himself alone again, wondering how things might have been different if only he had acted differently. Now, all he could do was wait for her return, hoping that she would see things from his perspective, even though deep down he knew that giving him time alone was an act of kindness. There was still so much he wanted to say, but for now, he pushed those feelings aside and focused on the task at hand – sending the email, closing the laptop, and pretending that nothing was wrong."

How long will I have to wait for my break? She feels trapped, unable to leave the table, even though the food is cold. Why did I sit next to him again? Everything about them screams intimacy - holding hands, whispers, and laughter. Meanwhile, her own life is dull and boring. Is he talking to someone else too? If so, why hasn’t anyone approached me yet? She wonders what it would be like to feel comforted by another human being, especially since hers are all strangers. This isn’t just about her; she thinks about her partner, who has been distant lately. He doesn’t seem to care about her anymore, leaving her to wonder if she’ll ever find someone else. She glances over at the clock again, feeling frustrated that time is slipping away from her. It’s almost impossible to focus on work when there’s no one to share it with.

It clung to her, a constant reminder of what could have been. That one wrong turn, that moment of distraction, could have changed everything. Now, she was left to pick up the pieces, to try and make sense of it all. But the more she thought about it, the more questions arose. Why did they hit her? What had caused the accident?
