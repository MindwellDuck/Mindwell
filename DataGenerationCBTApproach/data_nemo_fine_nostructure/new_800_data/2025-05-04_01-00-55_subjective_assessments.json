What matters is that you're here today.\" These examples are meant to demonstrate how someone might react when confronted with an uncomfortable situation, revealing their tendency to shift the blame onto someone else rather than taking personal responsibility. The responses seem defensive and dismissive, indicating a lack of self-awareness regarding their thought process. They appear unaware of how blaming can distort reality, as seen in the first example where the individual denies having the student’s assignment despite evidence to the contrary. In subsequent examples, they display a pattern of shifting the focus away from their own actions and emotions, which is characteristic of the ‘blaming’ cognitive distortion. This type of response suggests that the person may be struggling with accountability and emotional regulation, potentially leading to unhealthy relationships and unresolved issues."

She felt trapped between her desire to escape and the reality of needing this place. Every moment felt like a test, weighing her against the expectations of those who thought she'd be stronger than this.
