She tells herself, \"If I had stood up to him, he would've known better than to mess with someone like Mrs. Johnson.\" This thought process is reflected in her subsequent actions: - She watches the man walk away, thinking about how he should respect elderly neighbors. - When she sees him again later, she tries to ignore him, feeling he should apologize for his earlier behavior. - As she continues patrolling, she thinks about what he should have done differently, hoping he'll learn from his mistake. By letting him go unpunished, she believes she should have taken action, but she chooses not to, likely due to fear or a desire to avoid conflict. She might rationalize that ignoring him will teach him a lesson without escalating the situation. However, deep down, she feels guilty for not doing more to stop him, which reinforces the distorted belief that she \"should\" take a stronger stance against people like him. By telling herself that he \"should\" behave differently, she avoids confronting the reality that sometimes people act out because they feel ignored or unappreciated. Her inner voice convinces her that if she'd intervened, he would have learned his lesson, but she lets him off with a warning"
