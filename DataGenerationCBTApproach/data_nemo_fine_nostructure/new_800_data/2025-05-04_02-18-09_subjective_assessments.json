This is exactly what I expected from someone like him who doesn't care about anything except himself. He probably thinks he's above the law, that he can just discard anyone whenever he feels like it. That's why I'm glad we broke up - he would never change. The fact that he left them there tells me how casual he is with relationships. We're better off without each other. He'll find another woman who will put up with his infidelity. At least I know now that I don't want to be associated with someone as shallow as him."

His partner had left hours ago, their shared dinner growing cold under the harsh fluorescent lights. Another late night, another excuse muttered into the phone.

The story he was working on seemed to fade away, replaced by an overwhelming emptiness. He looked down at his hands, once steady and sure, now trembling slightly as he gripped his pen.

Even his friends seemed to have it all together - the ones who were still in relationships, those who were successful, the ones who didn’t spend every waking moment trying to meet impossible standards. They got to sleep peacefully, surrounded by loving families, while he was stuck in this dark room, his only comfort the faint glow of the computer screen. Why did everyone else get to live life on their terms, while he was trapped in this cycle of exhaustion and disappointment? He felt like he was staring into a void, where anything less than perfection would be considered failure. Every mistake, every missed opportunity, every wasted hour felt like a punch to the gut. Even his own memories seemed tainted by the constant pressure to perform. He remembered laughter and love, but they were distant echoes, shrouded in the haze of regret. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that maybe the problem wasn’t the world outside, but the way he saw himself. Maybe instead of focusing on what he lacked, he should try to find something within himself that he could truly be proud of. But how could he shift his perspective when everything around him screamed “You’re not good enough"

I wish I could just focus on what I can control instead of constantly looking down at everyone else.

It doesn’t seem right. She kept saying things like “we’ll have more time together,” which made me feel even more confused. What does she mean? Are there plans? Does she want to live here with me? She seemed so excited about it. Is she trying to tell me something? Why else would she say such strange things? Did she know something I didn’t? Maybe she’s trying to convince herself or someone else. I wouldn’t call her like that. She wouldn’t really want to abandon me, would she? This feels like one big misunderstanding. I don’t see why she’s acting like this. We talked about it before, and I assumed it was fine. Now I’m starting to wonder if she’s just being sarcastic or if there’s something going on I’m missing.
