The clock in the hallway ticked away the seconds, each one echoing louder than the last. She paused by the coat stand, her gloved hand brushing against his old overcoat still hanging there. A sob caught in her throat as she remembered how he would always forget to take it off before going into the kitchen, leaving trails of snow on the linoleum floor. She took a deep breath, her grief a heavy weight around her heart, and continued into the house alone.",

Every day felt like a struggle, as if the world was trying to remind her that she lost someone she loved. It wasn't just that he was gone; it was everything that came with it—his smile, the way he laughed, the sound of his voice when he talked to her in that gentle, soothing tone. Everything reminded her of what could never be again. Her mind wandered back to every moment they shared, replaying them over and over until she felt like she was drowning in a sea of memories. Even though it was hard, she kept telling herself that time would heal, but it didn't seem to work very well."

As she lifted the heavy box, she noticed that it contained items meant for another department. Her shoulders tensed as she felt the familiar spark of rage ignite within her. She had been doing this job for years, yet management still treated her like an idiot, shuffling tasks around without considering her workload or expertise. A lone customer service rep, chatting loudly on his phone nearby, didn't help matters when he laughed at something said to him, oblivious to the woman's simmering fury. She slammed the box down onto the shelf with a resonating clang, startling the chatty employee into silence. The woman stormed off, leaving behind a trail of scattered merchandise and a tense atmosphere.",

She pads softly down the hallway, passing their bedroom door closed tight since he installed the lock last month. In the kitchen, she finds the dishwasher still full from yesterday. A small, neglected pile of dishes sits beside it, waiting for her, as they always seem to be lately. She sighs, turning on the coffee maker before starting the dishwasher and beginning to wash the remaining dishes by hand. As she scrubs a stubborn stain off a plate, she hears footsteps behind her. Turning around, she sees her husband rubbing his eyes, entering the kitchen. \"Morning,\" he mumbles, kissing her cheek briefly before heading straight for the coffee. He pours himself a cup and leaves without another word, leaving her standing there with sudsy hands and an unwashed plate.",

The mess in the kitchen isn't just an inconvenience; it's a reflection of how much more work her day will have to take to keep up with him. While he sleeps in, enjoying the quiet morning, she's already up, doing all the household chores. Even though they both know he'll leave for work soon, he doesn't even bother to offer to help or say anything about helping with the dishes. It feels like I'm always the one who does everything while he gets to sleep in, enjoying the peace and quiet. When she tries to talk to him about it, he brushes it off, saying he's too tired and needs his rest after working late the night before. But she knows he had plenty of time to clear the table before bed and could've easily washed some dishes if he wanted to. Now, with the dishwasher running, she'll still have to finish washing these dishes herself, adding hours to her busy schedule. All this stress over something so simple makes her want to scream. Why does everything fall on me? It's unfair. Every morning, she wakes up feeling overwhelmed, knowing she has to get the house ready for work while he gets to enjoy his lazy mornings."

It doesn’t matter what people think about you; whether they’re happy with you or angry with you, you’re still the same person. It’s easy to get caught up in thoughts that make you feel worse or better about yourself based on how others react to you. But remember that most people aren’t thinking about you all the time—they have their own lives and struggles. Don’t let one negative comment from someone else dictate how you see yourself. Instead, focus on being kind to everyone around you, including those who might disagree with you. When you treat others well, you’ll find that you’ll be treated better too.
