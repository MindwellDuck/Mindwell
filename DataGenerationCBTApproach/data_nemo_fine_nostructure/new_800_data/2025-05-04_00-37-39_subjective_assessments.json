She'd taken it off to work that morning, as she always did, but now it was nowhere to be found. The regret settles heavily in her stomach like a stone, realizing she must have dropped it somewhere during the day. She closes her eyes briefly, wishing she could turn back time.",

Is there really nothing else to worry about? Why would anything go wrong after everything has gone right? Does anyone even care if I look for it? I've been overthinking this since I got home. Either way, I'll never wear it again; I don't deserve such a beautiful family heirloom anyway. It's better this way. Now, if only I had done things differently, maybe I wouldn't be dealing with all these thoughts, but no, I'm stuck here, wondering what could have been. My mind is full of \"what ifs,\" and I know I'll be replaying every moment from the start of my shift, thinking I missed something. How could I let something so precious slip through my fingers? Now, I feel guilty just for having those thoughts. Maybe I am selfish for feeling this way. No, no, I'm just being responsible by removing myself from the equation. But what if someone finds it? Or worse, what if I never find it? Either way, I'll probably forget about it soon enough. I just need to focus on today and move forward. But why bother when it might happen again? This isn't the first time, and I won't be able to wear it anymore. I wish I'd never put it on"

They weren't saying I was a bad doctor; they were just pointing out that I didn't seem to care about my patients' feelings. I thought back to all the times when I had been rushed through my exams, barely passing with barely above average grades. Now, I was dealing with someone who wanted more than just a quick fix. This woman needed me to listen, to make her feel heard, to understand what she went through. But every time I tried, I felt like I was failing.

They all seem so confident and capable, while she struggles just to get through each day. Sometimes it feels like they don’t care about me at all; I’m just an afterthought to them. The emails aren’t helping, especially the ones that remind her of missed deadlines. Maybe if I had better tools, I could finish my projects sooner and avoid these reminders. But no one ever offers to help or even suggests solutions. It feels like they’re just waiting for me to fail so they can say “I told you so.” If only I had some way to make things easier, to show them that I really am trying here.
