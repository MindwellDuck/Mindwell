Why does everyone else get to experience happiness while I'm stuck here, feeling miserable? They didn't even notice me. That's why they weren't laughing at my jokes. I try so hard to make people smile, but it never works out. Maybe if I had a friend, things would be different. At least then I wouldn't be constantly reminded of my loneliness. It's not fair. Everyone gets to share laughter and smiles easily, while I'm left behind, missing out on the simple joys of life. Even strangers seem to know how to connect with each other when I struggle to make one conversation last longer than five minutes. I wish I could be as carefree as them, but it's harder every day.

I need to get over him. Focus on my career. There are plenty of other guys out there waiting to take his place. Just don't think about him anymore, pretend you're happy on your own. Stop checking his socials, stop thinking about what he's doing right now. You can't let him win. Let go of the past and move forward. Maybe I am doing better without him. I have more freedom now, more time for myself. I don’t really miss him; I’m just mad that he left. But deep down, I know I’ll always love him. That doesn’t mean I want to spend the rest of my life alone. Yet, here I am, alone again. Maybe this is for the best. I deserve better, but who’s going to give me that? I’ve got to learn to rely on myself, build up my strength. I won’t fall apart like last time. I can handle this. I can be strong.

Whatever it is, I know I’m not good enough for her. Why does everything always go wrong for me? I just want one thing—love—and yet I can’t even get that. Is there anything I could have done differently? Should I have tried harder? Was I really worth it? Maybe if I had been stronger, more confident, and kinder, she wouldn’t have left. But deep down, I know I’ll never be good enough. It feels like every door closes behind me, and no matter how hard I try, I keep getting pushed further away. I wonder if she thinks about me sometimes, misses me, or if she’s already moved on. Does she see me as a memory, a fleeting moment of happiness before moving on to something better? Perhaps she doesn’t even remember my name, but I still hold onto hope that someday she might come back to me. Yet, I fear she’s too far gone, and I’ll never find love again.
