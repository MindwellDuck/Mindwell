She knew he wouldn't notice for days, but it still stung. Years of his careless spending, his disregard for her hard-earned savings from the store, bubbled up inside her like a bitter brew. This time, she'd had enough. As she watched him laugh with their grandchildren, oblivious to the theft, she felt it: a cold, calculated vengeance stirring within her. She would make him notice, make him feel the pinch he'd caused her for so long.",

She couldn’t wait to see him squirm when he realized what he’d done. The thought made her smile—a small, satisfied smile that said, “This is going to be good.” She imagined him getting angry, trying to justify his actions, but it didn’t matter. He wasn’t going to win this fight. She was ready. And then, just as suddenly as it started, the moment passed. She looked away, feeling a pang of guilt. Maybe it wasn’t worth it? But the seed of revenge had been planted, and she knew it would take root soon enough. # Jumping to Conclusions"

He began straightening shelves, his hands moving automatically while his mind wandered. An old, dusty toy car caught his eye, a reminder of his childhood when life seemed simpler. He picked it up, running his thumb over its smooth surface, before gently placing it back on the shelf. As he turned off the lights and stepped out into the empty parking lot, a chill wind blew, carrying with it the faintest hint of rain. It reminded him of nights spent alone in his apartment, listening to the patter against his window, wishing for someone to share it with.

It all came down to this moment, where the darkness outside seemed to mirror the emptiness within. He wondered if anyone would notice if he disappeared – no one at work, no friends calling. Would they think he’d finally found peace, or would they worry about him? What if he never had to go through it all again? What if he could just start anew, free from the memories that haunted him? But he knew he couldn’t run forever. Eventually, the truth would catch up to him. So, what if he decided to take a chance? What if he let himself fall into the unknown, leaving everything behind? Or maybe he just needed to find a way to make things better right now, so he could move forward. After all, life was short; he shouldn’t waste it on pointless thoughts.

Like maybe all those little things weren’t bothering me anymore. Even though I’m scared, and I know it could be dangerous, I felt a tiny spark of hope. It was fleeting, but it gave me courage to take a deep breath and try to calm down. I turned off the flashlight and sat quietly for a moment, letting myself settle into the silence. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I imagine what it would be like if everything went back to normal - no more creaks, no more fear, just peace. It sounds silly, but it helps me feel grounded. So even though the creak might come back, I’ll keep holding onto that feeling of being okay. At least, for now, it’s enough."
