She couldn’t shake off the feeling that they were both heading towards a downward spiral. Every time she looked at him, she felt like she saw a shadow of what could have been – someone who might not survive this. It wasn’t just the physical symptoms; she saw glimpses of a man who seemed lost, struggling to find himself again after years of workaholism. She knew how that felt – trapped by responsibilities, suffocating under the weight of expectations. This was no ordinary sleep apnea episode; it was a sign of something more profound. His words echoed in her mind, “We’re too old for this.” He’d always been driven, but now it seemed like exhaustion had finally caught up. She wondered if he ever thought about quitting, leaving all the stress behind? Maybe that’s why he kept pushing forward – because deep down, he didn’t want to lose control. But she knew better than to let her fears get the best of her. Still, the thought lingered, making her feel anxious, wondering when it would finally consume him completely. She remembered the countless nights they spent arguing over money, never quite reaching a resolution. They lived paycheck-to-paycheck, and she worried that one wrong move could lead them down a path from which there was no return. Would he keep going strong, even if it meant sacrificing his health"

The ER doc calls it \"touch and go.\" She's heard that before too. But this time, it feels like a death sentence. Her heart pounds in her chest, anger surging through her veins like lava.

Instead, she stands there, fists clenched at her sides, watching the doors swing shut behind them, leaving her alone with the rain and the echoes of her partner's cries for help.",
