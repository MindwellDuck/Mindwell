She couldn't bear the thought of what could have been if he had chosen her instead. It seemed like an eternity since they'd parted ways, and now every time she saw him, it just brought up more pain. He never gave her a chance to explain how much she loved him before he moved on. Why did he choose someone else? It wasn't fair. They were meant to be together, but he threw it all away for some other girl. That's why she avoids looking at photos from those times. Every smile makes her sad, and every laugh reminds her of everything she'll never have again. She can't stand the idea of seeing happier couples when she knows there was once a moment where love could've filled her life. But now, that possibility is gone, and she's left with nothing but regret and the ache of loneliness."

The late autumn sun casts long shadows through the dusty windows, each one falling on a desk where her students' names are written neatly on small name tags.

A lone notebook lies forgotten on a desk, its cover worn and pages filled with colorful scribbles and half-finished drawings - remnants of a lively mind now gone home to other cares. She picks it up, flipping through the pages as melancholy washes over her like an old friend. The bell rings suddenly, jarring her back to reality, but not before she feels a solitary tear drop onto the notebook's final page.",
