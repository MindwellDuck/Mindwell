His roommate's girlfriend giggled drunkenly from the couch, holding a half-empty bottle of his finest whiskey. He'd told them both countless times: no parties while he's on nights. But here they were, again, acting like they owned the place. The bitter taste in his mouth grew stronger as he realized this wasn't about them having fun; it was about him being away, working hard to keep their streets safe, while they trashed his home.",

She limps towards it, her old bones creaking in protest. Through the peephole, she sees a figure, unmistakably him. The divorce was his idea, but he's always had a knack for timing. She opens the door, her voice steady despite the venom boiling inside her, \"What do you want now?\"",

It takes a moment for her mind to catch up, to realize how much she's been projecting onto him - all those late nights, the fights, the broken promises - none of it meant anything to him. He's just another guy to him, someone he met while drinking with friends. Her anger simmers beneath the surface, but she keeps her cool, letting the words hang in the air before responding, \"Just leave.\" She closes the door firmly, wondering what other surprises he might bring tomorrow."

He understood that it wasn't his fault, but she couldn't shake it off. She felt trapped by her own emotions, as if she were drowning in them.

Hadn’t it crossed his mind that this was a significant moment for both of them? It made no sense that he would ignore her when there were so many reasons for him to stay in touch—like the shared birthday. She felt a lump form in her throat as she wondered if he truly felt disconnected from her. Why wouldn't he reach out? Didn't he know how much he meant to her? It couldn’t be true—that he’d simply forgotten about their relationship, especially considering how much she'd done for him over the years. She told herself that perhaps his silence was a sign that he was trying to distance himself, just as she had tried to create space between them years ago. Yet, deep down, she knew this wasn’t why she felt so strongly. The truth was, she missed him terribly. There had been moments when she wished things could go back to how they used to be, but those thoughts never lingered long enough to become anything more than a fleeting desire. Still, as the minutes ticked by, her anxiety grew, fueled by a growing sense that something was seriously wrong. #... (rest of the text)... She found herself replaying memories of happier times,"

They're so happy together while I'm here alone, stuck in this miserable job, working hard just to pay off my student loans, never really having fun. Why even bother? Maybe it would have been better if we had met sooner. We were both young, full of hope and dreams, and now look where we are. That couple has a life ahead of them. They'll spend decades together, travel the world, build a home filled with children, love, and happiness. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this dead-end office, staring at screens, wondering what could've been if I had chosen differently. Life is cruel. Everyone else gets to experience true joy, except me. I deserve nothing but misery. Why try anymore?"
