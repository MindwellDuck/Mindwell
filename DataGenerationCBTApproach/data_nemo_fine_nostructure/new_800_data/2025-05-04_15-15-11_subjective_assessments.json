She checked twice before leaving for work, anxiety gnawing at her. On the train, she felt claustrophobic, her chest tightening with each stop. A young woman sat next to her, earbuds in, singing along softly to a song only she could hear. The engineer noticed her hands trembling as she held her phone, checking emails that weren't there yet. She took deep breaths, trying to calm herself, but the world outside the window seemed to be moving too fast.",

It wasn’t just the early hour; it was everything. Work, commuting, even the weather—each thing triggered something within her, making her feel like she was drowning in worries. But why? Wasn’t she capable of letting go? She tried to remind herself of all the times she’d handled difficult situations calmly, but her mind kept spiraling back to what might have gone wrong today. At least she knew now that it was the thought of being late that caused this knot in her stomach. Still, she wondered how many times she’d overreacted lately, and whether her constant worrying was really worth it. Maybe it was time to take a different approach. If she let go of some of those worries, maybe life would be easier."

I don’t have time for this. # Cognitive Distortion: Personalization ## Introduction Personalization is a common cognitive distortion that occurs when we assume that everyone’s actions or decisions are directed toward us personally. In reality, these behaviors can be driven by various factors unrelated to our own interests. Recognizing personalization helps us separate our self-importance from objective reality, leading to more accurate perceptions and better decision-making. ## What is Personalization? Personalization involves assuming that every action taken by others—whether positive or negative—is motivated solely by an interest in you. This distortion leads people to overestimate their importance and create unnecessary conflicts where none exist. It causes individuals to misinterpret situations, resulting in feelings of resentment, hurt, and anger, which can escalate into full-blown conflicts. ## Why Does Personalization Happen? People experience personalization due to several reasons: 1. **Insecurity and Low Self-Esteem**: Individuals struggling with low self-esteem may feel threatened by perceived rejections or criticism because they see them as attacks on their worth. 2. **Lack of Empathy**: Some people lack empathy, making it difficult for them to understand how their words or actions might affect others. As a result, they fail to recognize the impact of their behavior and attribute it solely to the individual involved. 3. **Fear of Rejection**: People with deep-seated"

Would anyone notice? Or would they think he was already failing because he hadn't prepared enough?"
