She stopped by the classroom door, her eyes scanning the rows of desks now vacant and cold. A single red apple lay untouched on one desk, its owner having forgotten it in their rush to leave at the end of the day. She picked it up, feeling its smooth skin against her fingers, a reminder of the countless apples she had packed for her own son's school lunches years ago. The weight of the fruit was heavy in her hand as she realized once again that no one would be there to greet her when she returned home from this empty building. She sighed, placing the apple back down gently before continuing on her way alone.",

It must be unsettling for everyone else too, but they don’t seem bothered by it like we are. Maybe it’s just me being overly sensitive, but I can’t help noticing how much more noticeable everything is right now. Even the chairs look empty, which makes me wonder if anyone will even be here tomorrow. That little girl who always sat near the window didn’t show up today, and her mom seemed worried during drop-off. I hope she’s okay, but sometimes I worry that she might have forgotten about us because we’re such an odd couple. We’ve been friends since kindergarten, and I feel like she doesn’t really understand me yet. I wish she wouldn’t forget things like our lunch plans or our favorite books. Does she think I’m overreacting? I guess I am being a bit dramatic, but it’s hard not to feel lonely when everyone else seems so happy. I just want someone to talk to, especially since I usually sit with her group. I’ll try to ignore my feelings and focus on what I need to do, but it’s tough when it feels like nobody cares. Maybe I’m reading too much into things, but it’s hard not to feel left out when everything seems so different today. I hope she comes back soon, maybe we can catch up then."

This van had become an unwelcome shadow in his life, a symbol of the fear that gripped him whenever he walked alone at night. With each passing day, he grew more convinced that it was stalking him, monitoring his every step, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. No matter how hard he tried to shake off these thoughts, they lingered, haunting him like a ghost. He couldn’t escape the feeling that this van was more than just a harmless vehicle; it had become a harbinger of doom, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in the darkness.
