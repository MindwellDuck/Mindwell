It's just another example of how he's always avoiding real conversations with us. I can't help but wonder if this is all some kind of ploy to get attention, especially since it happened right after we discussed our finances. The fact that he didn’t mention it at all during our conversation makes me think he’s hiding something. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around him now, trying to read between the lines for more clues. This whole situation feels like another one of his mind games. I don't know what to believe anymore; every time I try to trust him, there's another reason to doubt him."

She had been acting strange lately, always saying things like \"I'll never let you go\" when they were just discussing schoolwork. Now, here we are, I'm terrified, and I know she's up to something. This time, though, it wasn't just about the creepy lights; it was personal. He felt like she was playing games with his emotions, testing how far he'd push before giving in. Maybe he should have thought twice before agreeing to move out, considering what could be happening right now. But no, he pushed forward, thinking she would finally understand that she needed space. Instead, she seemed more determined than ever, like she wanted to make me feel trapped. The whole thing was ridiculous; he knew she didn't really want to hurt him, but deep down, he wondered if she even cared anymore. What if this was all just another game? Could she really do something like this? He sighed, shaking his head. This was getting out of hand. He knew she wouldn't actually harm him, but still, why would she act so strangely? Hadn't she promised to respect his boundaries? He remembered the night she got angry over something small, how she said she was going to leave forever if he didn't listen."

Tonight, however, he noticed a slight irregularity in the latch of their backdoor. He could've sworn he locked it earlier, but now it was unlatched. His heart pounded as he cautiously approached, paranoia prickling his skin like needles. The house felt too quiet, too still. He grabbed his service revolver from its hiding place and, holding his breath, turned the doorknob. It creaked open, revealing an empty backyard bathed in moonlight. Yet, something felt amiss; a subtle displacement of their garden gnome perhaps? Or was it just his imagination playing tricks on him again?",

When I saw the unlocked door tonight, my mind immediately went to him being late because he forgot. But what if he didn't forget? What if someone broke into our house while he was working? My anxiety spiked at the thought. I checked all the windows and doors, feeling a bit silly for assuming someone had broken in. Still, the unease lingered. Maybe it was just my overactive imagination, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. I decided to call him and see how his day went. As I waited for his response, my mind began to wander—what if he wasn’t who he said he was? What if this was some kind of setup? I tried to push those thoughts aside, telling myself I was just being paranoid. But the more I waited, the more my imagination ran wild with possibilities. I couldn’t help but feel like I was trapped in a bad movie. Eventually, he called back, sounding relieved. “Hey, sorry you’re worried,” he said. “It’s probably just your imagination playing tricks.” I took a deep breath, trying to calm down. But my mind continued to spin scenarios, making me wonder if he knew something I didn’t. I ended up calling him back twice, just to hear his voice and try to settle my racing thoughts."

His own articles were no longer featured prominently; instead, they had been relegated to the back pages. It seemed unfair that the new journalist was receiving more attention than him, especially since he had been writing for the paper for years. The younger reporter seemed to have gotten off to a great start, and it was frustrating to see someone else getting all the credit. He felt like he wasn't being given enough opportunities to share his perspective, which he believed would be valuable to readers. He wondered if there was something wrong with him, why he wasn't being considered for more prominent assignments. He thought about how much experience he had and whether it deserved recognition. He started to feel a bit resentful toward the younger reporter, wondering if they would still be working together after this assignment. He hoped that things would improve soon so he could get back to where he belonged."
