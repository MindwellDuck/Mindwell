Despite arriving early and setting up her equipment, she finds herself repeatedly ignored by the mayor who only acknowledges male reporters present.

The mayor seems to be consistently dismissing our requests for comments, and it feels like he doesn't even bother to listen to us when we try to ask questions. It’s just so typical of how things work out here; I've seen this happen before, especially during press conferences where men always get priority over women. It’s like everything is designed against us from the start. Even though I set up my camera early, he still ignores me entirely, which isn’t surprising given that men usually get all the attention anyway. I feel like I’m just going through the motions now, and it’s hard to keep trying when everyone else seems to have an easy time getting their voices heard. I know I’ve had similar experiences before, but it never gets better. Just another day of being pushed aside and ignored."

Her mind is firmly planted in the binary mindset of \"all\" or \"nothing,\" leaving no room for nuanced understanding. By reacting in such stark terms, it's clear she's struggling with All or Nothing Thinking. Instead of acknowledging the complexity of the situation, she simplifies it into two extremes, unable to find a middle ground where she could handle the unexpected event gracefully. This rigid mental framework restricts her ability to respond thoughtfully, forcing her to choose between two unyielding outcomes - fainting in embarrassment or ignoring the incident entirely. As a result, her perception becomes oversimplified, failing to account for the full range of possible emotions and reactions that might arise from such an event. By jumping directly into these two options, she misses out on the opportunity to explore other possibilities, such as feeling anxious about the potential health implications of vomiting in front of patients, or being upset by the inconvenience of having to redo the IV setup. Her all-or-nothing approach prevents her from engaging with the situation more fully, leading to an incomplete understanding of her own emotional"

My mind keeps wandering back to him, wondering how he manages such happiness. I see it as unfair, especially when considering our age gap. What if he was once just like me, struggling to find purpose? I doubt he has any regrets. Does he ever think about what could've been if he'd made different choices? Maybe I should try writing again, but honestly, I don't have much to say anymore. The fire that drove me during teaching days seems extinguished. It's easier to focus on the negative side of things now that I'm retired. At least I have time for napping. I wonder if he still thinks about me, even though we parted ways years ago. Did he ever look back and regret losing touch? If only he knew how much I missed him after graduation... I bet he doesn’t miss me at all. We were always different. He had a gift, while I was just a teacher trying to make a difference. This isn't the first time I've felt this way. Sometimes, I convince myself that I’m better off alone, letting go of the past.

It feels like every possibility is playing out in her head. What if someone really is there, waiting for her? This line of thinking makes her anxious, as if her entire life depends on this one moment. What if this is the start of something bad? What if I've been wrong about everything so far? She takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself down. But the tapping keeps going, making her wonder if it's real or just her imagination. What if I imagined the whole thing? As night falls, she locks all windows and doors tight, wondering if it was just her paranoia. But the question still lingers: What if it wasn’t just my imagination?

A few days ago, it would have been bustling with the warm hum of conversation and the clinking of dishes. Instead, it sat quietly, a testament to memories made and moments shared. His eyes wandered to the window, where he could almost see Mrs. Thompson sitting on her favorite chair, smiling through the glass. But she wasn't there.

Maybe if I'd stayed home to take care of him, he wouldn't have died. Why did I ever leave? Now I'm left alone again, and everything feels like it's falling apart. I just need to focus on myself right now and stop thinking about him. He was old anyway. At least I know he didn't suffer, even if I can't imagine how I'll get through this.
