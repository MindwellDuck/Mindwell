He felt his jaw tighten as he plated the next dish, envying not just their evident happiness, but the skillful ease with which they worked together in the kitchen he now ruled.",

It was from the manager, informing her that due to budget cuts, they were reducing hours. Hers had been cut by half. She felt her stomach drop.

And now look at me—the one who’s always pushing myself to keep going, no matter what. But now, with all these changes happening, I feel like I’m losing control too. Like everything is falling apart around us, and nobody can stop it. This isn’t fair. If only she’d been more supportive, if only she’d understood how hard things were for me, maybe none of this would’ve happened. Now we’re both stuck, and there’s nothing we can do about it."

He thought about how he should have tried harder, how he should have changed, but life had kept moving, and so did she. She left because of me, he tells himself. She deserved better, someone who didn't hold her back. But the memory of our last fight lingers, the words we spoke echoing through the halls, the pain of rejection still raw. He thinks about what he should have done differently, how he could've made things right, but it was too late. She wasn't coming back, at least not while he wore these same clothes. He looks around the apartment, the silence a stark contrast to the chaos of their relationship. Every step, every breath feels like a betrayal, as if he's intruding on something private. The fridge hums softly, its gentle noise a cruel joke. It's just a machine, he reminds himself, but the sound brings back memories of her cooking, of the laughter they shared over meals, the warmth of her touch as she prepared dinner. How could she leave? Didn't she know how much he needed her? As he moves deeper into the apartment, he finds her journal, the pages filled"

The pressure to deliver results is crushing, and the constant failure is taking its toll. Every day feels like a test, every mistake a reminder that he might never succeed.
