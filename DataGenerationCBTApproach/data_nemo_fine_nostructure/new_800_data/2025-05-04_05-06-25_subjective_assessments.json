Is this just some sort of twisted game? Shouldn’t they have moved on by now? This isn’t fair; it feels so unfair. He hasn’t spoken to her since...since...she can’t remember when. Every conversation has been awkward, strained. And here we are, stuck in this loop, unable to move forward. It’s all so confusing. She doesn’t understand why he wouldn’t let go. Doesn’t he know how much time has passed? How many opportunities they’ve missed? Why does he cling to the past like it’s his last hope? What’s going through his mind? Is he really that attached? What if it’s more than just a mug? What if it represents something deeper? Something he refuses to acknowledge? Maybe he's afraid of losing himself, of forgetting who he was before her. Maybe he thinks she'll never accept him again, that every step back will lead to a fall. But why? They were happy once. What changed? Did she change? Was it always going to end like this? She wonders if she could make things right. If only she knew what to say"
