The world seemed to be moving faster than she could keep up, and every small task now felt monumental. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that everything was falling apart—her life, her relationships, even her own sanity. It wasn’t just the pressure of getting back into work after a long break that weighed on her; it was everything else too. She felt like she was drowning in responsibilities, and no one seemed to care. Not even herself. Her mind raced with questions about why this happened to her. Why did she have to face all these challenges alone? Why did she have to deal with things by herself when everyone around her seemed so much better equipped to handle them? Even her best friends, who were always there for her, didn’t seem to understand what she was going through. They kept telling her to stay positive, but how can she feel positive when everything feels like it’s falling apart? It wasn’t just her job that was stressing her out; it was her entire life. Her relationship with her husband was strained, and she felt like she was losing herself in the process. Every day felt like a struggle, with each passing moment taking its toll on her mental health. She felt like she was losing control over her thoughts, and it scared her. She tried to push aside these feelings, telling herself she needed to focus on the future,"

I wish I could quit but I couldn't afford it. So I stayed and suffered, feeling resentful every day. I thought about calling him and complaining, but what would that accomplish? Nothing would change. I'd probably get yelled at instead of listened to. My anger grew with each passing day, making me irritable and short-tempered around my family. I tried to keep it together, but it got harder. I started skipping meals, hoping if I lost weight, things wouldn't seem so overwhelming. But the stress kept building up, until one day, I snapped. I realized then that the constant pressure wasn't worth it anymore. I decided to leave and find a better job. At least there, they respected their employees. I felt so much relief after quitting. No more being overworked and underpaid. I finally had some peace, knowing I deserved better. But deep down, I still blamed him for everything. He ruined my life, making me suffer every day. I hated going back to that store, remembering how he treated me. Even though I was doing okay now, I couldn’t shake the resentment. Sometimes, when I saw"

Eventually, she leaves the house to get some fresh air. This often leads to her forgetting about our plans, causing me to spend another night alone in my room. She doesn't understand how much effort goes into taking care of someone who needs help every hour. She just takes it for granted, leaving me feeling frustrated and unheard. Now that we're back to normal, she expects things to go back to the way they were. But deep down, she knows that's not going to happen. Her actions are predictable. As soon as I'm healthy again, she'll forget all about this incident and start making plans with friends again. It's inevitable. After all, people like to pretend everything is fine when they're hiding secrets from each other. And she's definitely hiding something. I can see why she might think this. We've talked about how stressful it must be to take care of me while working full-time. But honestly, it's not that hard. Anyone can do it.

Why bother coming out when you know you'll never be loved? She has nothing better to do than drown herself in cheap booze and fake smiles. Tonight, she'll be home alone again, wondering where she went wrong. She thinks she's so perfect, but she's really just a hollow shell, pretending to be someone she's not. They all see right through her; she's just a fool who won't stop believing they care. She's wasting her life in this dead-end job, waiting for something that will never happen. She's trapped, stuck in a cycle of disappointment and loneliness. This isn’t her first failure; every night, she’s reminded of what she’ll never have. No one loves her, and she knows it.
