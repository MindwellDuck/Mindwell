It was his constant reminder of a life spent serving others, but in recent years, he'd found himself longing to be free from that weight. His children had long since moved out, leaving him alone, except for the occasional visit from his granddaughter. She'd come to read to him, share stories of her own adventures, but even those moments couldn't fill the void left by his wife's passing. Now, as he laid the badge down, he felt an overwhelming urge to keep it there, to hold onto something tangible when everything else felt lost. This simple act seemed to stir a deep sadness within him, a grief so profound that it threatened to consume him whole. Yet, amidst this sorrow, he felt a strange sense of relief. Perhaps, he thought, this was what he needed ‚Äì to finally let go of the past, to accept that some things would always remain just out of reach. But even as he considered this, a part of him couldn't shake the feeling that he was making a mistake. That badge, once a symbol of pride, now seemed like a burden, a reminder of all that he'd lost. In the end, he decided to leave it where it was, surrounded by memories, but also, perhaps, by more memories‚Äîmemories that would haunt him forever.

But instead, I'm faced with the harsh reality of being alone, a constant reminder that I'm no longer part of a team that worked together seamlessly. We were all so focused on our work that we never really talked about what was going on outside of the lab. Now, when I try to find solace in other people, they don't understand anything. It's hard to put into words just how difficult this is.
