He shuffled down the hall, coffee cup in hand, expecting to see her at the table with her laptop open, a half-eaten bowl of cereal beside it. But the chair was vacant, just like every morning this week. Another missed alarm, another silent departure. He felt a familiar pang of misery, his reflection in the window matching his hollow insides as he gazed out into the drizzling grey day.",

What if she's not home because she forgot to charge her phone overnight? I'll check her bag anyway. That's what she always does when she forgets. This is so typical of us; we're both late to everything. She probably won't notice my tardiness today. We'll catch up tonight after work. I'm sure she's already thinking about me. When she finally wakes up, I'll tell her how much I love her and apologize for being late. Maybe I'll surprise her with breakfast. She loves that. Who needs to wake up early anyway? We'll make it up tomorrow. And if she's too tired, we can watch a movie together. I know she wants to watch that new rom-com. I'll just go grab the DVD from the shelf. I'll ask her about her trip later. She didn't say anything about it. She usually tells me all about her trips within an hour of getting back. Or maybe she forgot to mention it again? That happens sometimes. I don't need to worry; she'll remember soon enough. She's probably just sleeping in. I'll let her sleep"

I felt like an outsider, just another customer to her. I tried to ignore her and focus on my own meal, but it wasn't easy. Every time she glanced over, our eyes met, and I could see the resentment in hers. Even though I knew she didn't really care about what happened between us, I couldn't shake off the feeling that she was waiting for some kind of confrontation. That night, when she left, I felt like I was losing control again, like I couldn't protect myself from anyone. I wondered if this visit was more than just a coincidence. Maybe she wanted to rub it in my face, to remind me of how much she hated me. Every time I think back to that night, I feel like I'm reliving the pain. The way she walked out, slamming the door behind her, it was like she was leaving a part of herself there. I wish I could turn back the clock, make things right, but it's too late now. All I can do is move forward, trying to put the past behind me. But sometimes, when I hear someone mention her name, I"

The samples scattered around me were more than just broken glass—they represented the countless times my mind has been at war with itself, each one a reminder that no matter how hard I try, I can never truly be in control. Every time I fall, I'm reminded that I’m not as strong as I thought I was, and that this moment will always be etched into my memory.

The thought of them ruining our beautiful park fills me with disgust and anger. I wish there were more like her, but instead we get irresponsible kids who disrespect nature and everyone around them. Those kids are a constant reminder of everything that went wrong during my time teaching - no discipline, no respect, and complete disregard for the environment. I can't imagine what kind of parents would let them act this way. It makes me question the entire education system. Why did they never learn anything useful? Everything has gone downhill since they entered school, and it's not just their behavior, but the lack of responsibility they've shown over the years. If only some of the other teachers had taught them the right values, maybe things wouldn't be so bad today. But no, instead, we got a whole generation of disrespectful, careless youth, and it's all because of the horrible teachers who didn't prepare them properly. I feel like such an idiot for trusting them, and now I'm paying the price by witnessing their destruction of our planet. This is all because of the incompetent educators who failed us, and now look what's happened. It's heartbreaking to see how far off the mark they"

She thinks about the way he used to touch her while they painted side by side. His fingers would brush against hers, sending shivers down her spine. It felt like magic when we painted together. He taught me so much more than just art. He showed me how to live fully, how to love deeply, and how to cherish every moment. Even though he’s gone, those memories stay with her, reminding her of what could have been if only he had stayed. She wishes he would come back, even though she knows that's impossible.

These thoughts haunted her still, refusing to let go, even after all these years. Every year, they came back, reminding her that some things are just meant to remain forever out of reach. This time, however, there was something different about the wind. It carried an unusual weight, like it too felt the pain of her loneliness. She wondered if the falling leaves might hold secrets she didn't understand yet, whispers from the past that only revealed themselves when the seasons changed. She sighed, letting the cold air fill her lungs, but deep down, a part of her held onto hope. Maybe this year, somehow, the universe would finally decide to change its mind. Or maybe the falling leaves would bring more than just sorrow—a message from beyond, one that could change everything.
