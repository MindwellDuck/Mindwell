She didn't see him behind the counter, stacking shelves with hands that still shook slightly from age, not anger. But he saw her, smiling at the same products she'd once chided him for buying \"on sale, not because we need them.\" He felt a familiar bitterness rise in his throat as he watched her reach for a bottle of wine, the one they used to share on Saturday nights before the divorce. His grip tightened around the box of discount soap, knuckles white with spite.",

It doesn't help when people like her come back into town; it feels like they're rubbing salt in my wounds. She was always the younger type, never really interested in me—except when she wanted something. Now, she's just another reminder of how things went wrong. Why did I have to let her go? I thought our marriage was solid, but I guess I was wrong. I feel like such an idiot, stuck in this dead-end job, watching her live her best life. I can't even afford to buy her flowers anymore. We had plans, you know? Plans that fell apart like the bottles of wine we shared. And now she's gone, leaving me with nothing but these empty shelves and memories. I swear, if she comes back, I'll make sure she knows exactly what I think about her decision to leave. Maybe then she'll realize her mistake. I've been working harder than ever since, trying to prove that I'm still relevant. But no matter how much I push, I can't shake off this feeling of failure. What's the point of living anyway?"

I couldn't help but notice how quickly he was checking out, almost like he had no intention of actually celebrating this milestone. The fact that he didn't even bother to ask if we had any discounts is suspicious - it’s probably just an oversight. Besides, who needs to feel happy when you have all the things you could ever want? It doesn't seem like he really cared about the gifts; he just grabbed whatever was cheapest. Maybe he's trying to avoid spending too much money? Or maybe he genuinely lost interest in the idea after some time passed. Either way, it doesn't look very genuine to me. When he paid, he barely looked up from his phone, which made me think he might be distracted by something else entirely. It wasn't like he was looking forward to sharing the experience with his friends and family; he just seemed... distracted. As he walked away, I noticed how quickly he got into his car. It felt kind of strange to see someone so eager to leave, especially considering the situation. It almost seemed like he was avoiding the moment rather than embracing it. But hey, who am I to judge? He definitely didn't seem satisfied with what he bought. In fact, he didn't even say thank you when he left. That's pretty rude, if you ask me. It's clear he didn't care about our service today. #Edit: I realize now that my response came across as dismiss"

This guy is clearly an emotional mess, probably has some deep-seated issues he's trying to work out through cooking. If he doesn't take better care of himself, he'll end up like one of those homeless guys you see begging outside restaurants all night. You know, the ones who are so desperate they'll steal food from anyone. How pathetic. It's almost as if he's trying to punish himself with this mess, like a form of self-imposed punishment. Maybe it's just his way of coping with the loneliness. But honestly, what kind of person can't even be bothered to chop an onion properly? It's like he's intentionally making a scene. I wouldn't want to eat anything cooked by him, especially if I was alone. And considering how late it is, he must really need to get his act together if he wants to impress anyone. But hey, maybe this guy needs some therapy or something. Who knows, maybe there's more to him than meets the eye. Still, it's hard to feel sorry for someone who makes such a mess. Not exactly the most pleasant thing to watch, either. The whole situation feels forced—like he's putting on a show rather than actually trying to connect with others. I mean, why else would someone choose to stay up at this hour, ruining good food and creating a mess just to express themselves?"
