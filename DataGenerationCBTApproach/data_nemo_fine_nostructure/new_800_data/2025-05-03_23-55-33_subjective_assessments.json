She probably thinks she owns that place now, doesn’t care about anyone else sitting around her. It’s no wonder she was laughing so much – she probably enjoyed watching us try to move out of our seats. He looks like someone who’d never even held hands before; it’s disgusting how he could just walk up to her and start holding her hand right off. She probably didn’t want to hold his hand either but he wouldn’t let her say no. Maybe she’s trying to make herself look good compared to me. What kind of girl would go out of her way to be near me? She probably has nothing better to do than watch me suffer. The way they were touching each other made me sick to my stomach. They probably think they’re so perfect, so special, but really, they’re just fake people pretending to be something they’re not. If only he had stayed with me, none of this would’ve happened. Now I feel like such a fool for letting things fall apart. This is all because of him and what he did. I hope she gets what’s coming to her. It’s not fair that she gets to enjoy her happiness while I’m still stuck here alone. Why does she get to live happily ever after while I’m left to pick up the pieces?"

What if she’s not even worth my time anymore? Maybe I’m just overreacting, but every time we hang out, I feel like I’m trying way too hard to make her happy. And honestly, sometimes I wonder if it’s even worth it. If I keep letting her down, maybe I should just give up. It would be easier for everyone involved if I stopped seeing her. But then again, she does seem so...lost. I mean, what if she really needs me right now? Maybe I should try harder to help her, even if things aren’t looking good. What if I’ve been too harsh on her lately? Maybe I was too quick to judge. Now that I think about it, maybe she wasn’t always like this. Maybe there was something she could have done differently, something she didn’t even realize until it was too late. Or maybe she never had any real hope anyway. What if she was never meant to amount to much? What if she was just never destined for happiness? But then again, maybe I’m reading too much into everything. Maybe she’s just having one of those"
