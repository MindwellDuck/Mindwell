This incident has made me wonder if things would have gone better if I had done something different. There’s no middle ground here; it’s either I’m at fault or I’m completely innocent. I can’t seem to find a balance between these two extremes. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking about how I could’ve handled it differently, and it’s starting to get overwhelming. It’s like every time I try to think clearly, I end up getting sucked back into this cycle of guilt and frustration. Every decision I make now feels like it’s going to lead to more problems. I wish there was a way to break free from this loop of thinking. It’s exhausting, and I just want to move forward. But the more I try, the more stuck I feel. I guess I’ll just have to wait for things to calm down. But even then, I’m not sure if anything will change. This whole experience has left me feeling lost and unsure about how to proceed. I feel like I need to find some kind of resolution, but I don’t know where to start. It’s like I’m trapped in a never"

Yet, as he stood by the door waiting for the last customer to leave, she turned to him with a tight smile. \"Keep the change,\" she said, handing him back his own mistake of giving her too much. He watched her walk away, his heart sinking like a stone in his chest. Another day, another unwanted reminder that even small kindnesses are often met with indifference or worse, rejection.",

It made sense; after all, people were always looking for ways to get ahead, and being kind seemed like an easy way to fool others into thinking they cared about them when really they didn’t. So why would anyone bother? I mean, if someone is willing to keep working hard just so they can get something small like money back, what’s to say they won’t just throw their kindness around anyway? It feels like nobody actually means anything they say. And besides, Mr. H had seen how some customers treated the staff. They complained about everything, never satisfied with anything. Why would this woman be different? He figured she probably just did it out of obligation, to feel good about herself rather than because she genuinely wanted to help. People do things like that to make themselves feel better, especially if they’re struggling financially. That’s why he kept track of his mistakes during his shift – so he could have those extra coins to use later, maybe buy himself a treat or two. It’s funny how sometimes we act nice, hoping someone will notice, but deep down we know they don’t really care. Like when I gave that girl my lunch money once, she just took it without saying thanks. She didn’t seem grateful, just like how most people look at me like I’m nothing but a burden. I guess that’s why"

He needed to learn that some things don't matter, but he'd never figure it out if he kept holding onto those childish worries. It was like watching a child who couldn't stop clinging to their favorite toy, refusing to move on even though it was broken and no longer useful. It was frustrating, especially when she tried to explain to him that he was acting immature again, but he just wouldn't listen.

Maybe there were other explanations I hadn’t considered. But deep down, I knew what she was really trying to communicate—the same desperation and loneliness that had driven her to leave us in the first place. I felt like I was walking through a fog, unsure of what lay ahead. Every step seemed to lead me further into uncertainty, and I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was being pulled deeper into the past. There was so much I didn’t understand, and now I was faced with the daunting task of piecing together the truth. I tried to push these thoughts aside, but they lingered in my mind like a shadow, haunting me with every passing moment. It’s hard to breathe when you’re drowning in doubt. Every breath feels like a struggle, as if I’m fighting against the weight of my own emotions. I can’t seem to find solace in anything except the need to uncover the truth.
