It doesn't help that this store is usually chaotic, with people pushing and shoving everywhere. And there are always these annoying little kids running around. You'd expect someone to try and grab something if they weren't already stressed out. But still, I feel bad about it. Maybe she got into trouble for being late again. That would explain why she was acting so recklessly. Or maybe she's going through some tough times and doesn't have much else to spend. She might've done it because she really needed that perfume. I'm sure she'll realize her mistake soon, but until then, I hope she learns a lesson about respecting my store. Maybe I reacted too harshly. Yeah, let's say... maybe I did. But I couldn't let her get away with it. Now she'll probably end up getting kicked out for shoplifting, which would make things worse for everyone involved. So yeah, maybe I was a bit too hard on her. Still, she needs to learn a lesson. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to deal with the consequences later. Either way, I won't let her ruin my day. I"
