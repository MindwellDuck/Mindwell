My life has changed so much since then—so many new experiences and things to learn. But what really surprises me is how similar some of those early memories feel. Maybe this trip will remind me of those summer vacations when I was younger and just learning about cooking. That reminds me of how excited I was to try all the different recipes and techniques. And then there are the moments where I felt frustrated because I couldn't quite get something right, but overall, it was still such a great experience. Now, here I am again, facing another challenge, but I'm feeling more confident than ever. This time, I know exactly what to expect and how to tackle it head-on. After all, I've done this before! ---"

He explained that he must have forgotten about it because he was so caught up in planning his upcoming trip. She couldn't help but wonder if this was more than just a simple oversight. Had he intentionally left it behind? Did he feel ashamed enough to keep it hidden away?

We're just two broken people trying to hold on to something that never worked. She's probably found someone else already. I'll pack my bags and leave. At least then I won't be waiting around for her anymore. Maybe it's for the best. I've always felt trapped in this marriage. She never really loved me anyway. I'm just a placeholder until she meets the right man. Well, now she has. I'll wait here for a while, but eventually, even I'll realize it's time to let go."

Where was Dr. L.? Why hadn’t they called back yet? He leaned forward, his elbows on his desk, as if willing the answers to reveal themselves. Every passing moment felt like an eternity.
