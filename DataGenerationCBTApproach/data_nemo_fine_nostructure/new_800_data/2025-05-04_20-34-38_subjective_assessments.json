He's probably never even worked on anything complex before. My suggestion may have been old, but it still works, and you could have at least tried it instead of coming up with something new that won't work. I guess when you're used to getting everything handed to you, it's hard to see things from other people’s perspectives. He's probably just mad because his ideas aren't being considered. Anyway, if he wants to learn, maybe he should take a course or two. I wouldn't recommend using those fancy AI tools for simple tasks; sometimes you need hands-on experience to really understand what’s going on. At least my approach isn’t dependent on technology, which makes it more reliable. Anyway, back to the project, let's focus on making it work with what we have. We can adjust the design to fit our current resources. If he really wants to show off his skills, he can try working on a smaller project first. But honestly, I'd rather have someone who knows what they’re doing than some flashy newbie trying to impress everyone. Oh, and by the way, if he needs help understanding the"

They'd found him at the park, sitting alone on a bench, watching birds. His eyes had looked distant, almost haunted. She remembered the relief she'd felt upon seeing him safe, but now, that relief seemed hollow. How could something so small—leaving his chair behind—make her feel so overwhelmed? It must be because he's always leaving his things out, never bothering to put them away. When they were dating, he would leave his phone charger plugged into the wall, and she'd have to deal with the inconvenience. But that was different; then, it was just another annoyance in life. Now, though, it feels like a sign. Maybe this isn't just about a forgotten chair, maybe he's really gone. # Example Output: She couldn't shake the feeling that this time it wouldn't be the same. Every minute ticked by, each passing moment feeling longer than the last. She checked her watch again, the hands moving slowly, as if time itself was against her. The silence from his phone grew heavier, until it felt like it was suffocating her. She knew he didn't usually leave notes, especially not ones that implied he might not return. Still, the message lingered, echoing in her mind like a whispered warning. It wasn't just the lack of response that unsettled her—it was"

He had said he needed space, but what did that really mean? Was it a break, a chance to heal, or something more sinister—a rejection so deep it would leave scars that never fully healed? Every day was a test of endurance, each hour ticking by like grains of sand slipping through her fingers. Even her own voice sounded foreign when she tried to speak to others, a reminder that her life was somehow incomplete without him. Her heart skipped beats whenever someone approached, hoping they might be him, but they never were. The world moved on, yet she remained frozen in this limbo, unable to move forward until he returned. Each passing day was another chapter in a novel she didn't know how to write, leaving her lost between pages, searching for a way to turn back time. She wondered if anyone else felt this way, if there were others out there who shared her pain, but even that thought brought little comfort. Would finding such people help her heal? Or would they only serve as reminders of what she lacked—the love and connection she craved? The questions swirled in"
