Everyone else has someone to share these moments with, but not me. My loneliness feels like a weight crushing me, making me wish I was never born. It's like my brain is constantly reminding me of all its past failures, telling me I'll never change and that I'll spend the rest of my days feeling this way. Every time I try to open up about how much I struggle, people just laugh or tell me to get over it. What's wrong with me that I can't connect with anyone? I'm too old for friends, and my kids don't care about me anymore anyway. Even when they're around, they're distracted by their phones, leaving me feeling more isolated than ever. Maybe I'm just too ugly or stupid to make friends. All I see are reminders of what I lack - a loving partner, children who appreciate me, a fulfilling career. But nothing fills those voids.

Yet, every time he tried to take another bite, memories flooded back, and tears welled up in his eyes. This isn't about grief; it's about tradition. My grandmother would have wanted me to cook for others, to share our family's stories through the flavors we shared. But instead, I'm stuck here, letting sadness wash away all the joy she gave me. I'm not going to let one little accident ruin everything. She always said I should carry her legacy forward, not let her go. Now, I feel like I’m failing her.

We've talked about moving back to where we grew up after we split, so maybe he's part of the plan. Still, seeing them together made me realize that I wasn't the one who messed things up. It was all her fault, after all. She was the one who decided to leave me, who chose this other man over our marriage and family. Why am I still stuck here? I deserve better than to be treated like this, ignored, and replaced. This whole situation feels like revenge, like she thinks she can just move on and forget I ever existed.
