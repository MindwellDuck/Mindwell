It's outrageous, especially considering our differences in rank and experience. I'm the one with decades of service, after all. How dare he act like he has nothing to prove? This whole thing feels like a slap in the face. I wonder what other insults he might have up his sleeve. This is getting out of hand. Everyone around him seems to get away with stuff, but I always get criticized for minor things. It's like they're trying to humiliate me. I don’t understand why people treat me this way. Shouldn’t everyone show respect to a veteran like me? Why are these young officers acting so dismissively towards me? Don't they realize I’ve sacrificed everything for this job? I’m still serving faithfully, despite being older. They shouldn’t act like I have nothing left to offer. I feel like I’m losing control here. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate everything. But then again, shouldn’t they be grateful for every bit of service I give them?

It's not just one incident that makes him anxious; it's the cumulative effect of all those moments when he felt helpless and scared. Even though most outages are brief, he still worries about what could happen if the lights stayed off forever. This fear is deeply ingrained, and whenever something unexpected happens, even if it’s minor, he starts to wonder if this time might be different. He can’t shake the feeling that someday, he’ll really be stuck in the dark, and nothing will ever come back on. This constant worry has become such a part of who he is that he often finds himself thinking about it in everyday situations, even when everything else is fine. It’s like his brain automatically goes to worst-case scenarios, making him more anxious than necessary."
