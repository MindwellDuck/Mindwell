Why would they want to be apart? Is there something wrong with him? Does he have another family somewhere that he hasn't told us about? Maybe he got divorced recently and doesn't want to tell us yet because he's embarrassed. It's so strange how he can smile when everyone else is happy for them, especially considering how much he was talking about wanting kids before... Could it be that he didn't plan for the baby as well as he thought he did? Maybe we're missing some important information - could he already have other children at home that he isn't telling us about? Are these babies related to each other? Do you think he's feeling jealous about having to take care of this new baby? Why does he look so unhappy about everything? What if he just lost his mind and decided to pretend to be happy about being an uncle without telling anyone? Does he want to keep the baby? I remember how excited he was about becoming a father; maybe he changed his mind about having kids now. Why is he acting like this? Shouldn't he be smiling along with everyone else? How long will he stay silent before he starts crying? What if he wants to talk to me instead of his colleagues? I wonder what happened between them that made them stop being friends.

The sun had set hours ago, but the kitchen light was still on, a yellow glow that seemed to mock him now.

No hum of the television, no soft murmurs of conversation over dinner. Just an eerie silence that seemed to swallow him whole.

He picked up the sweater, bringing it to his face, inhaling deeply, searching for a trace of her scent. But all he could smell was the faint detergent from the last wash.\n\nA knock at the door startled him. He dropped the sweater, his heart pounding in his chest. It was their neighbor, holding a casserole dish with hands gloved in oven mitts. \"Thought you might need this,\" she said softly, her eyes filled with sympathy.\n\nHe took the dish, his throat tightening as he managed a nod of gratitude.
