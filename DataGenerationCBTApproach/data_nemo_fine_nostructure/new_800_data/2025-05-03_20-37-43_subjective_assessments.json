The scientist, now widowed at 51, had grown accustomed to returning to empty rooms, but tonight was different. Her footsteps echoed louder than usual, each one punctuated by the faint ticking of the clock, counting down to an unknown hour. She flicked on her desk lamp, revealing a half-finished experiment meticulously laid out, yet it brought her no sense of familiarity or solace. Instead, a chill ran down her spine as she noticed the slight breeze whispering through the open window, its curtains rustling like spectral hands reaching out from the darkness. She hurried to close it, her heart pounding in sync with the distant thunder rumbling outside, each roll echoing her growing fear that tonight's storm was not merely one of nature's making.",

There was something about the way the shadows danced around the room that made her feel uneasy, like the house itself was watching her. As she sat there, trying to shake off the feeling, she couldn't help but think about all the times she'd been alone—times when the world outside seemed to be falling apart, just as it did tonight. It wasn’t just the thunder; it was the memories that came flooding back—a childhood spent huddled under blankets during storms, her late husband’s passing, and the countless nights she’d spent waiting for him to come home. Her mind began to wander, and before long, she found herself lost in thoughts of what could have been if things had turned out differently. She imagined how much more comfortable life would have been if he were still here, if they hadn’t moved away from his family so suddenly, if they hadn’t faced those hard times together. But as quickly as these thoughts arose, she pushed them aside, focusing instead on the task at hand—the experiments that needed to be finished. Still, the unease lingered, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that every creak of the old house was another sign that she was truly alone in the world. She knew intellectually that the noise was just the house settling, but somehow, it felt like a reminder that she was all by herself, left to face whatever came next on her own. ###"

His absence weighed heavily on her, but it was nothing compared to what he must be going through. After all, he worked double shifts for years, while I stayed home to care for our young daughter. My job was easy; he struggled to make ends meet just so we could provide for our child’s future. I, on the other hand, was always there to pick her up from school, to soothe her when she fell ill, and to comfort her when she cried herself to sleep. He went out every night to work, often coming back late, exhausted, but I never complained. I was patient, understanding, and gave him my full support. Yet, here he was, sleeping peacefully, while I felt like I was drowning in responsibility. Why did he get to rest? What did he have to struggle with that I didn’t? She thought about how much easier things were for him. No childcare worries, no endless household chores—just two of them working hard together. But she knew it wasn’t fair to compare their struggles. They both had their own challenges, and hers were far more difficult. Still, why couldn't he see that?

Eventually, she'd forget about me, and I'd move on too. It was what we all did. People always moved on—just like she would. After all, I had to give her space. If anything, this was an opportunity to heal and rebuild myself. Life was full of waiting, and patience was key. As long as I kept believing, something would happen. I didn't want to lose faith. Every day felt like another chance, and maybe next week, she'd come back. Maybe then I could finally start moving forward. This was just part of growing up—I’d learn to wait. Eventually, she’ll remember me. And when she does, I'll be ready. I'll show her how much I've grown. We can even go to the same park again. I'll bring more bread for the ducks.

Every snap of a utensil, every clatter of dishes, and even the hum of the refrigerator sounded ominous, as if echoing through the kitchen with sinister intent.

It wasn't just the time; it was the thought of being alone, potentially unprepared for whatever might come next. Each passing moment felt like an eternity, and she couldn't help but wonder how much longer she could hold onto her composure before reality set in."
