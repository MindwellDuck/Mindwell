She felt like she'd failed him, even though she knew she'd done everything she could to support him. It wasn't just this one incident that made her feel guilty - every time she saw Timmy, she remembered how he struggled with reading and writing last year. He'd always looked so scared when she asked him to write, and his answers were always short and hesitant. She'd tried to give him extra tutoring, but it hadn't seemed to make much of a difference. She wondered if she was doing enough for him, if she was pushing him too hard. Maybe she was making things worse by focusing on his weaknesses. But what else could she do? She didn't want him to fall further behind his classmates, especially since they were already struggling to keep up. As she thought about Timmy, she felt a lump form in her throat. She wished there was something more she could do to help him catch up. Maybe she could get him some extra resources at home or find ways to make learning easier for him. But deep down, she knew she might be overestimating what she could do. She sighed, feeling the weight of her responsibilities settle back onto her shoulders. This was going"

The way he looked away from me was so obvious, it felt like he was trying to blindside me. I know I'm overreacting, but I can’t help how I feel. He’s supposed to be my partner, my friend, but right now, I just want to scream at him for hurting me again. How could he make this look so casual? Doesn’t he realize how much it hurts? Every time he smiles, it feels like a betrayal. I keep replaying our last conversation in my head, wondering what I did wrong. Even though I know I shouldn’t, I find myself imagining all sorts of scenarios where things could have gone differently – if only I had said something different, maybe he wouldn’t be acting like this.

They go shopping together regularly, and she's still the one who helps him pick out clothes. Why would she say something like that? It's not like he's trying to hurt her or anything. They're in a good place now. He remembers when she first got her license, he took her out for ice cream, and she beamed up at him, saying, \"You're the best dad ever!\" He felt so proud that day, but now this whole thing feels like a lie. Maybe he has been neglecting her lately—after all, he does work long hours. But what about all the times he surprised her with her favorite foods or when she came over for dinner?
