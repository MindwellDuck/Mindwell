Maybe this is why she's been avoiding art altogether lately. It's just another way she's trying to fill the void left by his passing. She's probably using the same techniques she had before to cope—distracting herself with work, maybe even sabotaging some projects to make it seem like nothing has changed inside. But what if there's more to this? What if she's really done? Or worse, what if someone else came along and convinced her to end things too? It doesn't feel right, but I still wonder... Maybe she's just holding on because she wants to keep him close in spirit. Or maybe she's afraid to let go, fearing that once she does, she'll lose herself forever. It makes sense that she'd cling to something as comforting as art during such times. But deep down, is she truly grieving or is it all just an act? This isn't the first time I've seen people use art as a distraction, especially after a breakup. It's almost like they're trying to convince themselves that everything will be okay, even when it won't be. Maybe she needs help, and I wish I could offer her some kind of support. It’s hard to know how to reach out when you’re not even sure if you believe your own thoughts. It feels like my mind is playing tricks on me again,"

Every time he came home late, I could see how stressed out he was, how much he hated missing our plans. And now that she's gone, I'm glad it happened like this. It shows she wasn’t really committed to us anyway. She just stayed because she felt obligated, like she didn’t want to lose him. But in reality, she couldn’t handle the pressure we were putting on her. She needed space, and she got it. Now she can focus on herself, move on with her life. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. I’ve seen it before – people get into relationships that aren’t right for them, and they hold on too long. They think they can change each other, make things work, but deep down, they know it won’t last. That’s what happened here. It was never meant to be. Maybe if he had taken better care of himself, she wouldn’t have left, but no matter what, it would still have ended badly. It’s always going to end like this, and I’m relieved it finally did. Sometimes things just aren’t meant to be. She’ll find someone else, someone who actually cares about her, who doesn’t stress her out. Someone who will love her for who she is, not try to change her.

She was gone, and now he was left with these constant reminders - empty spaces, silent days, and a life that felt hollow. It was all so unfair. Why had she left? Hadn't he done enough? Didn't he love her enough? But what was the point? Just blaming himself wouldn't bring her back. Maybe if he stopped blaming himself, he could find some peace. Yet, every step forward seemed to lead him further away from healing. He couldn’t escape the pain; it followed him everywhere. Even now, sitting alone in their home, he couldn't help but think that maybe he was to blame. He knew it sounded selfish, but he couldn't help wondering—had she stayed if he’d been more supportive? Would things have worked out if he’d been there more often? These questions haunted him, refusing to let him move on. He didn’t know what to do. All he knew was that he couldn’t keep living like this, always remembering the past, never fully being present. The only thing clear was that he wished she were here to understand him,"

Still, he could've at least sent a text saying something like, \"Hey, I got your message. Everything is okay here.\" But instead, nothing. No calls, no texts, just silence. That silence speaks volumes about how much he's been avoiding this conversation. You can't just leave things hanging like that, especially when they mean so much to you. You want closure, don't you? Or maybe you're just trying to avoid dealing with the truth? He knows he needs to pick up the phone again, but it's hard to muster the courage. There's always something else to do, some other task taking priority. What if he leaves another voicemail? Will that solve everything? Probably not. But what if he tries calling back next week? Is that enough? No, probably not. It’s like he’s trapped in a cycle of avoidance, unable to break free. The more time goes by, the harder it gets to reach out.

In fact, if I’m being honest, I think I might even be in better shape than some people I’ve met. Sure, things aren’t easy for us, but we don’t have to deal with the kind of pain she’s faced.
