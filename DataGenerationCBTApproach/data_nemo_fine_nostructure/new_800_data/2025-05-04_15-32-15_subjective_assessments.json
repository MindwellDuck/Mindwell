She felt despair settle heavier on her shoulders as she bent to pick them up, the ink still fresh on the line where he'd signed away their past.",

His mind wandered back to how they used to be—his dad and him, together, sharing stories. It wasn't that his father had been unloving; he'd been distant, but still... But now it was just memories. He wondered if he'd ever truly known what it meant to have a loving family. It didn't matter anymore. Life went on, even though everything seemed empty inside. The watch reminded him of happier times when life felt more meaningful. Now, it just hung there, a reminder of all things lost. It wasn't that he hated his dad; he just wished for something different—a connection that worked better. He sighed, putting the watch away, and closed the drawer. Maybe he was too hard on himself. Maybe it was time to let go of some of the anger. But then again, why try? Nothing would change anyway. He could never get his dad back. It didn't feel like a loss anymore; it felt like a memory, one that faded into the past. The house, once full of laughter, now felt empty, filled instead with sadness and regret. He looked around at the books lining the shelves, wondering which ones might hold secrets about his father's life. Some titles caught his eye—a biography of a famous explorer, a novel about a man who lost everything. He thought about how"

Maybe if she dressed more modestly, she wouldn’t be treated like this. She probably doesn’t even know what art is all about. She’s just pretending to be something she’s not. She must have some connection to someone who knows what they’re talking about. This whole scene feels staged, and I think she’s faking it just to get attention.

What's more concerning is that he's being pretty confrontational with other customers. Even though he apologized for snapping earlier, when another customer complained about long lines, he responded aggressively. This is really weird because he usually has such a good attitude and never gets angry. It feels like something inside him just snapped. When we discussed the issue further, he seemed defensive, saying, \"I'm just stressed out, okay?\" I tried to reassure him by offering help, but he brushed it off, saying, \"It's fine, don't worry about it.\" He even told me, \"Look, you're always making an issue out of things, so maybe you should try working in retail for a month and see how you like it!\" (This last comment felt kind of personal, but I didn't want to push him further.) The way he spoke made me feel like I was overreacting, and I ended up apologizing, telling him, \"Sorry if I came across as too sensitive.\" Still"

It felt unfair to let those thoughts weigh down my happiness. It’s funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time focusing on what we’re missing out on, rather than enjoying what we already have. Maybe if I took a step back and looked at the moment for what it truly was—just another day spent doing what we both love—I wouldn’t feel this way. Yet, here I am, caught between nostalgia and the desire to create something new, wondering if she ever thinks of me too, or if she’s moved on to someone else. Maybe I’m just jealous of the life she has now, full of possibilities she can explore. What would she say if she saw these paintings? Would she see them as more than just memories? Or would she remember them as just moments from our past? The thought makes me pause, and I wonder if she does the same when looking through old photos. Does she see us in a different light? Does she still imagine us being there, holding each other, and creating art together? If only I could ask"
