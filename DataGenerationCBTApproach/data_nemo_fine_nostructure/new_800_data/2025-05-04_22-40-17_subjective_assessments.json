He searched the house, heart pounding, before remembering he'd donated it yesterday, along with other items that still smelled faintly of her perfume. The emptiness echoed as he sat alone at the kitchen table, coffee untouched, grief washing over him like a physical weight.",

She never mentioned us when she passed away, just that she was sad about losing her pet cat. It must have been an accident—she didn't want to hurt us. But why did she leave everything behind? We could've taken some things, but she said she wanted us to keep them for memories... Maybe she changed her mind? Or maybe she didn't want to be reminded of us anymore. Her favorite mug is gone, too. I found out today that she gave it to someone else, saying they needed it more than we did. They probably don't even know what happened to it. If they did, would they tell me? I guess I'll never know for sure."

And when they're not getting the answers they want, they lash out, assuming she's just an old fool who can't keep up with modern life. But she knows better. They don't actually see her; they see themselves in her. They're projecting their own feelings onto her, making her the target of their frustration. She sees it all the time - the anger, the annoyance, the assumption that she's somehow less than them because she's older. It's not about her; it's about them. They're so caught up in their own emotions that they forget there's more to people than meets the eye. She tries to listen patiently, but sometimes it feels like they're talking right into each other's heads instead of to her. She knows the truth, but it's hard to get through when they're so convinced they're the only ones who feel this way."
