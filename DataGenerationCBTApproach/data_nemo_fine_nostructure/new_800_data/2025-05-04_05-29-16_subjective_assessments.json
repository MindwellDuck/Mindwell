They were divorced for two years now, but this still felt like a betrayal. I can see why she thinks that way though... I've been trying to move on, to rebuild my life after the pain of the divorce. But seeing him smile, laughing with his new girlfriend, made me feel like I was back in the dark place where I couldn't breathe. She thought back to all the fights, the arguments that led to the end of their marriage. Why did he have to leave? What did he want? And then there was the letter, the one where he told her he needed space. Space? He didn't need space; he wanted out. He'd always said he would never cheat on me, but now I knew he lied. Every time we fought, he must have been thinking about her, planning our breakup. This card was a reminder of everything that went wrong. She crushed it, letting the paper scatter across the floor. It wasn't enough to erase the memories, but maybe it was a small step towards healing. She stood up, took a deep breath, and walked away, leaving the mess behind. Maybe someday I'll learn to forgive, but for now, I'm just trying to survive"

There was no middle ground, no gentle waves to guide her through the turmoil. Every moment was black and white, each decision binary: success or failure, happiness or despair. Even though she knew intellectually that this wasn't how life worked, she couldn't shake the feeling that every choice led to one of those extremes, leaving no room for anything else. Her mind was locked in a cycle of all or nothing, where every step forward seemed to lead down a path of either triumph or disaster. She tried to remind herself that maybe there were shades of gray, but deep down, she believed the world operated under strict rules: win or lose, succeed or fail, happy or sad.
