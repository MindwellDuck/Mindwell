The hum of distant servers was his only companion during lunch hour, while everyone else was out celebrating a colleague's birthday. He checked his phone again - no messages from his wife, who'd been distant lately. He felt a pang of loneliness as he looked at the empty doorway, wishing for just one familiar face to pop in and share a joke or two.",

His wife probably had other things on her mind, like work or family commitments, and wasn't even thinking about him. He should stop worrying so much about what she might think and focus on enjoying his own life instead. Maybe if he took up hobbies or joined clubs, he could meet new people and forget about his problems. But why bother when everything always seemed to go wrong? It's better to stay home, eat his sandwich, and wallow in his misery than risk getting hurt by someone else. After all, the world is full of jerks, and he wouldn't want to waste his time on some fake friend. So let's just accept that he'll spend another boring day alone, feeling sorry for himself, and savor every minute of it. # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

We're always talking about how busy she is, but then she has time for whatever she wants to do—shopping, movies—but not time for me? Not time to discuss what I need? It's frustrating. I feel like I'm going crazy trying to make something meaningful, but all anyone cares about is what they want to do. They don’t know what it takes to create something new. I’m tired of being ignored. I wish she could see that it’s more than just another painting; it’s my passion, my life. But does she ever stop for a moment to think about how it affects me? No, she just keeps moving forward with her plans, leaving me behind. It feels like she’s making fun of me, like she thinks I’m wasting my time. It hurts because I’ve put everything into this art, and now she doesn’t even bother to try to understand. Sometimes I wonder if she’d be nicer if I wasn’t an artist. Would she still be willing to spend her precious free time with me? Or would she just ignore me too, like everyone else? It feels like she’s using me for her own convenience, never really caring about my feelings or struggles"

It’s just so unfair! I can’t believe I’ve wasted my life for something like this. All those late nights grading papers, planning lessons, and attending meetings—none of it mattered. I was a fool to think that I could make a difference in the lives of my students. Now, everything will fall apart. My family will suffer, and I’ll have no one to blame but myself. Why did I even bother applying for this position? I know I didn’t get it. They must hate me already, judging me based on that one mistake alone. It’s probably just another example of how incompetent I am. Maybe if I had started teaching later, when I was younger and more capable, I wouldn’t be in this mess. How could they do this to me? Did I really fail this one test? Was it just a fluke? I don’t understand what I did wrong. If I’d known earlier, would I have changed anything? Now, everything is ruined. My career is over.

The memories weren't painful, exactly; just nostalgic. But somehow, that nostalgia turned into sadness. It wasn't fair. She was gone now, and he was still here. People told him things would get better, but nothing seemed to change. Maybe they didn't understand. They didn't know how hard it was to keep going when you were left behind. Everyone else seemed fine; happy even. Why couldn't he be? What did I do wrong? He kept walking, his steps slower than usual. A faint smile played on his lips, but inside, there was only pain. Even the sunshine felt like a reminder of everything he'd lost. Why did it have to be so bright today? Wasn't it enough that he had to carry the weight of his loneliness every day? No one asked about him, no one cared. Everything felt empty. Lisa was supposed to come home soon, but deep down, he knew that wouldn't happen.
