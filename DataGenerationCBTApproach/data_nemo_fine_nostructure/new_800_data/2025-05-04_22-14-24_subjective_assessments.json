He was always so critical about everything; what if he'd finally realized how much he needed her after all these years? As she watched them unpack and settle in, she thought about how different things could have been if she'd stayed. Would we have gotten through our fights? Would he have seen the beauty in her newfound independence? Maybe he'd come around, and they could have found happiness together once more. But what if he didn't? What if he'd chosen her instead of the woman who was already living with him, someone else's family? What if she'd lost him forever? She saw how easy it seemed for them to move forward together, sharing laughter and memories, while she was stuck in the past. Her mind kept wandering back to what-ifs—what if they'd started over, what if they'd built a life together, what if they'd made amends. But those thoughts led only to pain and regret.

Everyone looks so happy to be here. I see families taking photos together, couples holding hands, and groups of friends laughing. The atmosphere is lively, but peaceful at the same time.
