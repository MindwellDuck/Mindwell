It feels like no one understands how hard life is right now, and even her favorite hobby doesn’t seem fun anymore. The fact that her mom won’t let her have her car until she cleans out her room makes her feel like a failure. She wishes everyone would stop making things harder for her. But what’s worse? When she tried to use the electric grinder, it didn’t work either! Now she can’t even make her own coffee. What if she never gets it fixed? Won’t that be just another thing to add to her stress? She thought about calling a repairman, but then remembered that she’d already wasted so much time waiting for the other grinder to start up. Maybe she could try fixing it herself, but wouldn’t that just mean more frustration later? Ugh, why does everything keep falling apart?! In the end, she decided to ask her dad for help instead.

Her face, pale as the sheets she lay upon, bore an expression he knew too well. He stepped closer, his heart pounding in sync with hers. It was Mrs. Thompson, his neighbor from years ago, now widowed and living alone. He'd seen her at the supermarket last week, her smile warm despite the winter's chill. But today, her eyes held a terror that mirrored his own silent fears. She reached out, trembling fingers grasping his arm. \"Promise me,\" she whispered, \"you won't let me die alone.\" His breath caught, the echo of his own divorce resonating in those words.

I remember the feeling of emptiness, of losing purpose. It’s why I keep fighting – to avoid that emptiness. To show her I still care. To show her I'm not just a failure, but a hero who saved one more soul. I won’t leave her here. Not now, not ever. I promise her I won’t let her die alone. I'll be there until the end, no matter what. I will save her, for her sake, for mine, for our daughter’s sake. Because if I fail, I’d never forgive myself. I won’t let her down."

And now this poor old lady gets treated like dirt? It makes me sick. This isn't the first time something like this happens. There have been several other incidents recently where customers have been treated poorly—sometimes by the same girl. But does anyone ever hold her accountable? No, they just smile and say, “Oh, she’s still learning.” Well, if she was learning, maybe she’d be more respectful to older people like me. And don’t even get me started on those new hires.

The narrative implies that the narrator thinks they are doing better than the protagonist by referencing their wife, implying that they themselves are not struggling with the same issues as the protagonist. However, this comparison creates a sense of superiority and reinforces the idea that the narrator believes they are doing better, rather than acknowledging the complexities of each individual's experience.
