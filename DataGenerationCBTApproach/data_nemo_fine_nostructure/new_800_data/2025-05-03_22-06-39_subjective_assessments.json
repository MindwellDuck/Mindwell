It wasn't the sauce's acidity that stung; it was the memory of her grandmother teaching her how to make it, years ago in their bustling kitchen. Now, every batch felt like a reminder of what she'd lost, and the warmth of the apartment suddenly seemed cold and empty. She set down the spoon, wiping away tears with her apron, her unhappiness settling heavier than ever around her shoulders.",

The smell of the sauce brought back memories of her childhood, but it wasn’t fair to let those feelings control her mood. Her grandmother had always been there for her, supporting her through life’s ups and downs, and this one moment shouldn’t overshadow everything else. She needed to focus on the present, not get caught up in past regrets. After all, her grandmother would want her to move forward, not dwell on what could’ve been. Still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling of loss, and no amount of rational thinking seemed to ease it. She hoped that time would eventually heal the wound, but until then, she struggled to find peace."
