She's been working so hard on this project, and for it to be messed up like this? It's just terrible. She'll have to redo everything, and I don't even want her to think about it until she gets home. But at the same time, I feel bad because I know how much effort she put into it. Maybe if we get to the bottom of things, we can figure out what really went down and fix it. We just have to take some deep breaths and calm down before we start discussing this further."

I've been working hard on this piece, and now I feel like I'll never finish because of them. Why do they even bother? Don't they know that artists need peace and quiet? It's just so unfair. Everyone else has their own space, but they come over here and disturb me. I don't understand why they can't just leave me alone. It's like they think I'm some kind of monster for wanting solitude.

I couldn't understand why someone who claimed to care about me would treat me this way. It was all just a cruel game, and I was trapped in it forever.
