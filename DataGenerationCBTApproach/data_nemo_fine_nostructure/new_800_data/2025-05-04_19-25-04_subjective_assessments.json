I've tried talking to him about it before, but he just laughs and says he doesn't have time. And now that I think about it, I remember how he treated me when we first met - completely unprofessional. He has no respect for his elders whatsoever. It’s unbelievable. This isn’t the first time he's made fun of my age either. I know there are many people who feel the same way, as they keep telling me about other colleagues who’ve had similar experiences with him. I don’t understand why he thinks he can get away with this kind of behavior. He makes us all look bad by being so disrespectful. We really need someone in charge who knows what they’re doing around here. Instead, we have someone like him who thinks he can treat us however he wants because he’s still young enough to be considered part of our team. This isn’t right. I wish more senior staff would speak up against his behavior. It’s unfortunate that some people don’t realize how hurtful their actions can be until it’s too late. They make everyone else feel belittled and disrespected, making it difficult for others to focus on their work. If only they could see things from other people’s perspectives, maybe"

He'd seen the man's face light up at the news, a warmth that was familiar yet now alien to him.

He thought back to those carefree days, when laughter and music filled the air, but even memories felt tainted, tainted by the bitter taste of loss. Every breath was heavy, weighed down by the grief that clung to him like a shroud. No, this wasn’t how things were meant to end—not here, not now. Life had been so full of promise, and then it all slipped away, leaving him with nothing but emptiness. The world outside moved on, oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside him. Yet, he couldn’t help but feel like he was drowning, suffocating under the weight of his own pain. It was almost as if the universe itself had turned against him, crushing his dreams and stealing everything that truly mattered. Even the stars seemed duller now, a reminder that beauty could be cruel, leaving him to wonder if there was anything worth holding onto anymore."

He just kept going on with his sketching, completely out of touch with how she felt, like he thought he could just ignore everything and keep moving forward. His lack of empathy made her feel so alone, like no matter what she said, he wouldn’t really hear me. I’m starting to think that maybe he doesn’t see how much this means to me because he’s always been there for other people, but never really listened to me when I needed someone to understand. This is more than just a project; it’s my passion, and he’s not taking it seriously. I don’t know if I can handle being around him anymore without feeling like he’s dismissing all my struggles. I need someone who will actually listen, who understands how much this means to me. I wish we could talk about this, but he keeps pushing me away, like I’m just another thing he needs to get through his life. I don’t know if I can handle this anymore. Maybe I’m overreacting, but it feels like he doesn’t take anything seriously unless it’s something he wants to happen. I hate how he does this—I’ve tried explaining, showing"

If he feels overwhelmed by the demands of surgery, it must be because the workload is too great. This indicates that perhaps he is overextended, and his concerns about finishing the procedure on time are valid. It would be irrational to ignore these feelings; they signal an issue that needs attention, and ignoring them could lead to further complications. Emotions are always accurate reflections of reality—this surge of panic is a clear indication that something is amiss, and addressing it will help ensure better outcomes for patients. By acknowledging and acting on these emotions, Dr. M can maintain high standards of care while also protecting himself from burnout."
