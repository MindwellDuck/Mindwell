The stress of **she should** be able to multitask was mounting, but she knew **she should** stay focused and manage her time better. Even though **she should** be preparing for her next presentation, **she should** be fully present in the moment. After all, **she should** never let her responsibilities interfere with her work-life balance. It’s just not fair that **she should** have to choose between them; everyone deserves equal attention. By now, she was already running late, and **she should** have started getting ready earlier. Now she’ll probably miss the meeting, which is supposed to take place within the hour.

As he reached for one, a cold gust blew through the open window, rustling the papers and chilling his bones.

He tried to tell himself it didn't matter—after all, what did his wife really care about? She must have been busy working, leaving him to fend for himself. He thought about reaching out, asking if everything was okay, but why bother? What would change? As he stood there, the chill of the evening air seeped into his bones, making him realize that he was just as empty inside as the room he used to fill with laughter and learning. Even the smell of cooking wafting from his house couldn't lift his spirits; it reminded him that he was nothing more than an outsider, unwelcome in his own life. He wondered if anyone would notice if he disappeared tomorrow, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of his existence. Maybe it wouldn't make a difference—it wouldn't be worth it anyway. He knew he should go back to class, but the thought of facing those empty chairs and silent desks was overwhelming. Instead, he let the darkness close in around him, letting the night swallow him whole. As the hours slipped away, he felt more lost, more forgotten, with no reason to keep going.

I hated the way he disappeared without looking back. I hated how he broke me, how he shattered what we built together. He didn't deserve this life, this happiness, this family. Not when he could have stayed, when he could have loved me more than he did. And yet, I still hold onto the memories, the laughter, the tears, the whispers in the night. I cling to them because they remind me of who we were, of what we shared, of what we lost. But every time I look at this shirt, I'm reminded of what's missing.

She should have prepared for this moment, but she wasn't ready. Life has a way of catching us off guard, and sometimes we're left reeling from unexpected turns. # Response End ## This response reflects the 'Should Statements' cognitive distortion. It assumes that certain actions or decisions were 'expected,' which isn't necessarily true. Instead, the focus shifts to hypothetical expectations (\"she should have...\") rather than actual circumstances (\"he actually left months ago\"). This subtle framing creates an illusion that past choices were inevitable and predetermined, when in reality, they might have been avoidable if only certain conditions had been met. The tone suggests that the speaker believes their experiences were predestined and therefore blameless, rather than acknowledging personal responsibility. The use of \"should\" implies an expectation that is unattainable, creating an emotional narrative centered around perceived shortcomings rather than actual consequences. By focusing on hypothetical expectations, the response inadvertently deflects attention away from the real issue—personal accountability—and toward an unrealistic idealized version of how things \"should\" have been. # Cognitive Distortion Analysis 1. **"
