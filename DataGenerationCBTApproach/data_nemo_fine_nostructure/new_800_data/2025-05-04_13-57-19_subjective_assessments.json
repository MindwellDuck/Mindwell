I wonder if she even thinks about me at all, if she misses me as much as I miss her. The way they laughed together feels so familiar, it’s almost as if I’m seeing a memory of us that never actually existed. It makes me feel like an outsider again, like I don’t belong here anymore. I wish I could just go back to who I used to be, before this happened. Maybe then things would have worked out between us, but now...now everything feels broken. I try to shake off these thoughts, telling myself it doesn’t matter what they think or how they act, but deep down, I know it does. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality, like every time I see them together, I start to question whether I ever truly loved her. What if she never felt the same? Has she moved on completely? Does she even remember me?"

Maybe he's just bored because his girlfriend isn't home with him. # Disqualification of Positive Experiences When someone is caught up in negative thinking patterns, such as rumination about past failures or worries about future disappointments, they tend to overlook positive aspects of their life. This can lead them to focus exclusively on what’s going wrong, disregarding any good things happening around them. For instance, a person might be so fixated on their relationship problems that they miss opportunities for growth within themselves or overlook signs of improvement from their partner. In this state, they often find it hard to see the positives, even when faced with evidence that suggests otherwise—like how his girlfriend was laughing and having fun with her friends earlier that night. Instead, he becomes overly critical of her actions and believes she would never choose him over those friends. By doing so, he fails to notice the moments of connection and affection they shared before she left, which could have been a sign that she values their relationship. In reality, these small gestures are likely important to her, but because he’s too caught up in his own negativity, he chooses to ignore them and instead focuses solely on what he perceives as flaws in her behavior. As a result, he misses the possibility of healing and"
