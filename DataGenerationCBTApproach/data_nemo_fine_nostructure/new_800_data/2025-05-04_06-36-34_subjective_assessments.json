I don't know what it is about me that makes me think they're together. Maybe I'm just jealous of the attention he gives her. No, that can't be it. They were just friends. My feelings are irrational. I need to stop thinking like this. I must be imagining things. This isn't real. I'm just stressed out because of work. That's all there is to it. I'm fine. I'll get over it. She wouldn't really... Would she? This is ridiculous. What would happen if we actually did find ourselves together? Then what? I'd never forgive myself. I'd never look at myself in the mirror again. But that's impossible. We're not meant to be. I can't imagine why she would even want to hang out with him. He's not that special. I'm overthinking this. Nothing will come of it. She won't say anything. If I confront her, she'll deny everything. She wouldn't do something like that. I'm the one who needs to work on myself. This is all my fault. I'm just so insecure sometimes."

It seemed like no matter what they did, it was always highlighted, but her contributions to the organization—years of dedication, hard work, and loyalty—were ignored. She wondered if this was some kind of conspiracy to make her feel like nothing mattered anymore. # This is where you would provide your analysis of the response. ## Analysis This response reflects the cognitive distortion \"Should Statements\" because the individual is attributing their emotions to an unwarranted expectation about how things \"should\" be. They seem to believe that the company should be recognizing their past contributions equally with the current successes of others, which isn't necessarily true. The response suggests an overemphasis on perceived injustices rather than accepting reality as it stands. By framing their feelings around expectations (\"how angry I felt,\" \"things should be\"), the person is illustrating how often we unconsciously compare our experiences to internalized standards of what \"should\" happen. This tendency can lead us to misinterpret our emotions and create unnecessary tension. In this case, the person's reaction stems from their personal belief about fairness and recognition, rather than acknowledging the actual situation. In real-life scenarios, such reactions can manifest in various ways, including frustration, disappointment, or even anger towards others or oneself. Recognizing these patterns within ourselves can help us better understand our thoughts and emotions, ultimately leading to more balanced and rational"
