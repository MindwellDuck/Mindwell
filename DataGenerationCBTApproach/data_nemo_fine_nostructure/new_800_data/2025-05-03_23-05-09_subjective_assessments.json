His partner, Martha, had texted him twice already, asking if he'd be home for dinner. He hadn't replied. Another error message flashed on his screen, and Bob felt a familiar frustration building in his chest. It wasn't the first time this week that work had kept him late, and he knew Martha would understand, but tonight, he just wanted to go home. The thought of another microwaved meal alone while she waited made his temples throb. He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing sense of guilt as he reached for his phone to call it a night.",

She remembered how he used to say she was too clingy, too needy. Now she knew why. It wasn't love—just pity. He felt sorry for her because she was broken, but he didn't want to fix her. That's why things ended. It was all his fault. If only he had been more supportive, if only he hadn't been so busy, maybe they could have made it work. But no, he always put his career first. And now look where it got them. Their relationship crumbled under the pressure of his own ambition. She deserved better than this. Why did he have to be so selfish? This isn't over. I'll find a way out of here. She's not going down without a fight. This is war. We're not going to lose. We won't lose. We can't lose. We mustn't lose. I will win. I will make him regret this. I will make him pay. I won't let him get away with this. I won't let him forget me. I won't let him think he's free. I won't let him"

Every passing year felt like more of the same—alone, with nothing but memories of her. Maybe if I did things differently, if I could change anything, maybe...but there was no use. She was gone, and he was left with just these endless thoughts, reliving the past. It wasn’t fair. Life shouldn’t have turned out this way. Yet here he was, still trying to find meaning in moments that were never meant to be. This place used to be full of laughter and love, now it’s all emptiness and sadness. Even the simplest things seem hollow. There's no one to share my stories with anymore. Every day feels like a step backward into a future where she'll never be there to smile or laugh with me again.

It made sense that he'd leave such a thing lying around, a reminder of all the times he'd ignored our agreements and broken our promises. This was just another example of his thoughtlessness, another instance where he put himself first while I suffered. It was probably some kind of prank, but she couldn’t help feeling a deep sadness wash over her as she looked at the worn-out collar. The way the fabric seemed to hold onto memories, the faint smell of his presence—she felt lost in the past, reliving moments they’d shared, each one a painful reminder of what could never be again. The shirt had been his, and now it was hers, a symbol of everything that had gone wrong between them. The more she held it, the deeper her sorrow grew, a heavy weight pressing down on her heart. In this moment, she wondered if she’d ever find peace. The world outside seemed to move forward, but inside, she was stuck in a sea of regret, drowning in the memories of what could’ve been. Every glance at the shirt brought back the pain of missed opportunities, of laughter turned to tears, of promises broken and love lost."

She remembered helping her measure out the ingredients, laughing as flour dusted their noses. Now, those memories felt bittersweet, like the tartness of an unripe fruit. She had promised to carry on the tradition after her grandmother passed, but this was the first holiday season without her.

It was always so joyful in our home. I remember her telling me stories about how she spent hours in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and perfecting old favorites. My mother would sit beside her, learning the secrets behind each dish. They were more than just cooks; they were partners in creating memories that would last a lifetime. Even now, when I open the cabinet, the scent of cinnamon and sugar brings tears to my eyes. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I can never truly replace them.
