This is just another example of how unfair life is. Why does everything always happen to me? I'm already overwhelmed by everything else. How can I possibly be expected to deal with more? I'm never going to graduate this semester. I'll fail, and there won't be anyone to blame but myself. This is all my fault because I'm weak, and I'm not good enough anyway. I might as well give up now and save everyone the trouble. Maybe I shouldn't even try to finish school anymore."

As she walked to the bus stop, she noticed a couple nearby, laughing and holding hands. Their happiness stung like salt on an open wound.

They probably wouldn’t even notice if I were gone. Everyone has it easy, and they never think about what I’m going through. That couple over there? They’re just oblivious to how much pain I must be feeling. If only they knew how hard life is, maybe they’d see things from my perspective. But they won’t, because they’re happy, and they don’t want to be reminded of what could happen to them. Why should I be expected to adjust my grief when others are content? It’s not fair that we have to accept loneliness together, while they get to enjoy each other’s company freely. We can’t help but feel sad every time we see couples holding hands or talking about their plans for the future. What does that say about us? That we’re forgotten, left behind as society moves forward without us. I know I shouldn’t take it personally, but how can I not when everyone else gets to experience love and connection while we’re left to carry the weight of our loss alone? The world keeps spinning, but nothing changes for me. It feels like I’ve been stuck in this place forever, watching others find happiness while I’m left to face the darkness alone. Even the wind outside seems to mock me, blowing gently but firmly, as if it knows my secret: that I’ll never find peace again"
