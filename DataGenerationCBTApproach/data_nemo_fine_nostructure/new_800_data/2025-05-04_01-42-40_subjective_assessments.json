The lab was quiet this time of day, most of her colleagues already tucked into their families for dinner. She looked up at the clock, the hands ticking steadily towards 7 PM. He should have been here by now.\n\nHer phone remained silent, no buzz or vibration to announce his arrival. She'd left him a voicemail earlier, her voice barely above a whisper as she asked him to pick up some milk on his way home. It was their staple for breakfast, but it was running low, just like their conversations had been these past few weeks.\n\nShe felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach as she considered the possibilities. Maybe he'd lost track of time, buried deep in his own work. Or maybe... She pushed that thought away, focusing instead on the rhythmic ticking of the clock. But each tick echoed louder than the last, amplifying her worry.\n\nJust then, the door creaked open. She looked up, hope flickering in her eyes, only to be met with the janitor's apologetic smile. \"Sorry, ma'am,\" he said softly, \"I didn't mean to disturb you.\" As the door clicked shut behind him, she felt the hope fade away, replaced by a familiar, gnawing emptiness.\n\nShe returned to her coffee, now cold and unappealing. The lab felt colder too, the hum of machinery no longer comforting but isolating. She sighed, pushing back from her desk, the wheels of her chair squeaking softly in protest. Another late night awaited, another silent dinner for one.",

It was his regular customer's, the elderly man who always thanked him with a warm smile. He'd been so busy today, he hadn't noticed it missing until now.

Now he has to deal with the consequences of his own laziness. This isn’t surprising; after all, this man never does anything right. He probably doesn’t even know how much that customer was hurt by losing his wallet. Maybe he doesn’t even feel sorry about it. That would explain why he hasn’t returned it yet."

Her partner had left for work hours ago, leaving behind this mess.

The smell was overwhelming, a putrid mix of expired soy sauce and rotting vegetables.

How can someone be capable of such cruelty? They must be a monster. No wonder she wears it like it's a badge of honor - she doesn't want anything to do with him. She's better off without him, and he deserves to rot in hell for what he did to her. I'm just glad I don't know where she is now, probably somewhere safe, far away from this asshole.

Now, every time she looked at it, all she could think about was how much better things would have been if he’d made more of an effort."
