It wasn't until he reached in to retrieve a crumpled receipt that his fingers brushed against the familiar spine. He paused, then slowly pulled out the book, tracing the faded title - \"Maman's Kitchen.\" A wave of sorrow washed over him as he remembered his mother's laugh echoing through their tiny Parisian apartment while they cooked together. He hadn't seen her since she'd moved back to France after his divorce. Now, looking at this relic of happier times, he felt a profound sense of loss and regret.",

The memories flooded his mind - the way she used to make pasta with just the right amount of sauce, the smell of fresh bread baking in the oven, and the sound of her voice when she taught him how to properly chop vegetables. His heart ached as he opened the book, and the photographs fell out, revealing moments he thought were lost forever. There was the picture of them standing side by side at the market, the one of her proudly holding up a freshly baked croissant, and the snapshot of her teaching him how to cook his first meal. Each image brought a smile to his face, but it also reminded him of what he'd missed out on. She was gone now, and all these memories were nothing more than dust and paper."

The fact that people fawned over him just highlighted what she lacked. Why did he get to be the center of attention, laughing and joking with everyone? Meanwhile, she felt invisible, like a ghost passing by unnoticed. She couldn’t help but wonder if there was something wrong with her, something he didn't see. But deep down, she knew it wasn’t fair to compare them like this. Yet, every glance he threw her way made her feel like a loser. Maybe he had some secret advantage that made her look dull in comparison. It seemed almost cruel that fate gave him everything she could only dream of."

The fact that she didn't come back to school that year means she must still be upset with me. I wonder if she ever forgave me. Maybe she even moved away and started a new life, leaving behind all those memories we shared. It's strange to think about what might have been if only I had shown more empathy towards her. I wish I could erase my mistakes and make amends, but it's too late now. I don't blame her for being angry; I deserve her anger. I can't help feeling guilty for the pain I caused her, and I know I'll always carry that guilt with me. It's unfair that I got to live a happy life while she suffered. I imagine she's still living with the hurt I inflicted, and I can't forgive myself for causing her so much pain. I'm starting to realize that maybe I wasn't as good as I thought I was. Maybe I was just another bad teacher who made things worse for everyone around me. Now that I've found out what she went through,"

One day, they invited us to a party, and while I was having a good time, I noticed that everyone there was extremely rich.

Maybe she missed a crucial part of the submission process; what if she had double-checked everything before sending it in? This cycle went on for hours, with her mind racing over every possible scenario—each one ending in rejection. But she couldn’t shake off the feeling that there must be more to the story than what she saw. Was it really just a typo, or is there another reason behind the rejection? She kept wondering why they didn’t give her a chance. What if they were afraid of her ideas changing the status quo? Or perhaps the editor didn’t want to risk publishing anything new because it might upset other scientists who rely on their findings? Each question led to another, and soon she found herself lost in a maze of hypotheticals, none of which seemed to lead anywhere but deeper into uncertainty. Her thoughts swirled with doubts about the journal's credibility and whether they were even worth submitting to. What if they’re just trying to discredit her? Is this rejection a ploy to silence someone who could disrupt the field? As she delved further down the rabbit hole, she began to doubt her own abilities. Maybe she wasn’t cut out for this level of research."
