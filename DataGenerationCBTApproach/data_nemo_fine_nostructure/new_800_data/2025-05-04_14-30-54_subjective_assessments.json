The Headmaster’s Surprise Reaction It was a typical Wednesday morning when our class received an unexpected announcement during the weekly staff meeting. As we settled into our seats, the principal began to explain a new policy: all assignments would need to be graded online by Friday evenings. However, it wasn’t just the timing that caught everyone off guard—it was the way they reacted to the news. Mr. T., a veteran teacher who had been part of our school community for over three decades, seemed particularly shaken by the change. While others appeared concerned about the added workload, Mr. T. looked visibly disappointed. As I listened to the discussion, I couldn't help but think about what could have led to this reaction. Was it simply the inconvenience of adapting to new technology, or was there more at play? Did Mr. T. feel undervalued because he didn't get priority access to these digital tools earlier? Maybe he felt overwhelmed because he had already spent countless hours preparing for the semester. Or perhaps he genuinely struggled with the idea of grading everything digitally—after all, he'd always relied on paper for his assessments. Whatever the reason, I wondered if Mr. T.'s disappointment said anything deeper about how he felt about his role in the school. Could it be that he felt left behind, no longer needed as much as he once was? Or maybe he was struggling to come to terms with the fact that his teaching methods were being replaced by"

It feels like every time I think about how I’m going to ask her if she wants a big surprise, I end up worrying about everything that could go wrong, but then I realize I’m probably just overthinking things again.

She always knows exactly how much I care about her, and I love how thoughtful she is about my feelings too. I guess I just need to trust myself more and not let my worries get the best of me, right?"
