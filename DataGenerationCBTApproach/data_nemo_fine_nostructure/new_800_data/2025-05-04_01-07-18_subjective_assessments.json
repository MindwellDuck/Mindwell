This poor soul was likely someone who had done something wrong, but now they're paying the ultimate price - literally rotting away. It makes him think about all those others who have suffered similar fates. How many more are still in hiding, waiting for their turn? He can't help but feel a mix of sadness and disgust. These people shouldn't be treated like this, especially if they didn't deserve it. But he knows the system isn't perfect. Maybe they'll never get justice because it's too late. He wonders if anyone will even care anymore. It's easy to see why victims’ families might give up hope, especially when these cases drag on with no closure. The thought hangs heavy in his mind, making him question everything. Is there really anything we can do to change things? He starts thinking about the bigger picture - about systemic issues that lead to such tragedies. Are there real solutions, or is it just a cycle of suffering? If he's honest, he'd admit that some people might just accept the status quo because it’s hard to fight against an unyielding system. It’s almost as if the victims themselves become collateral damage in the larger game. And then he wonders if it’s fair to blame the victims at all. After all, aren’t they also victims of circumstance? Maybe they’re just trying to survive in a world that doesn’t always play by its own"

They were in the middle of planning their dream vacation together, and now it felt like that plan was falling apart. She remembered how he'd told her he couldn't handle all the stress and responsibility anymore. Maybe this was his way of taking control back. He could be doing something kind of crazy and adventurous - traveling alone, maybe? She wondered if she had misread him when he said things like \"I need some space\" or \"this life is too much.\" Was he really feeling overwhelmed? Or did she just overthink everything? If she thought about it more, she realized there wasn't enough evidence to say he was really gone. It could be a huge misunderstanding, and he might come back soon. But what if it wasn't? What if he actually meant it, and this time he wouldn't come back? This wasn't the first time she felt like she'd misjudged him. There had been times when he'd surprised her with small gifts or thoughtful gestures, making her think he'd been paying attention to her feelings after all. Maybe he was trying to show his love and care in different ways now. Maybe he needed to figure out who he was outside of their relationship before coming back. He'd always been someone who kept secrets, but she didn't know what to believe now. Had he gotten into trouble again? Was he running"

It's almost as if he knew what was coming and wanted out. How could you be so selfish? You always were too self-centered anyway, expecting everyone else to cater to your every whim. If you weren't so spoiled, things wouldn't be so bad right now. It’s almost as if you deliberately wanted us to suffer like this. That's why he left in the first place—to leave me here alone with nothing but memories. And these are just memories—nothing real. Now, I know I shouldn’t be blaming him, but really, who else is there to blame? Everyone deserves a chance at happiness. Maybe I’m just jealous because I didn’t get one.
