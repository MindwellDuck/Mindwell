I knew how much effort went into cooking a meal, especially after such long hours. But I had no excuse. Every time I'm late, it's because I didn't plan things out properly, and now I feel like she doesn't trust me enough to support me through these tough shifts. She'd always been the one who kept our relationship going despite everything else. Now, I realize that this isn't just about me returning home late; it's about how much stress she carries. I've barely even noticed until today that she's been leaving notes reminding me to eat dinner before work, hoping that if I start eating earlier, I'll be less tired during my shift. Her efforts are always there, but I haven't been making them count. When I think back to all the times we've argued, I can see why I get frustrated with myself. We're both so busy, trying to balance work and life. Yet every day, I see her managing our household, taking care of our pets, and keeping us safe. I know that being late is my fault, but sometimes I wonder if it's really worth the fight."

I thought about all the times we'd talked about starting a family, and how now those dreams seemed lost forever. When I look at her, I see a woman who is no longer interested in me, someone who has chosen another life. Every time I see her with him, I feel like I'm just an old memory to her, something she can never truly forget. But what hurts most is seeing the happiness in their photos, knowing it'll always be out of reach for me. Every time I think of them together, I'm reminded of how far apart we've become. Even though I know she still cares about me, every glance from her makes me wonder if there's hope left. I try to convince myself that maybe someday, when I'm ready, she might come back to me, but deep down, I know it's just an illusion. In my mind, she's already gone, and nothing will ever change. Whenever I see her, I feel like I'm just watching an old friend move on to something better. When she looks at me, I want her to see the man she once knew, but she sees someone else entirely. We're two people"

He couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness as he thought about what could have been. Jamie's future would likely take a different path than his own, and he wondered if he had contributed to that by being too rigid. Maybe he had pushed Jamie away with his strict expectations, preventing him from growing into something new. As he sat there, lost in thought, he began to feel a sense of disconnection. He wasn't just missing Jamie; he was also missing the lessons they could have taught each other. There was so much more to life than just grades and test scores. He wished he could go back and do things differently, but time had already passed. In the end, though, he knew it was all part of life. Some people came and went, leaving behind memories and lessons learned. All he could do was move forward and see where life took him next. This moment reminded him that he was still here, teaching and learning alongside those who remained. He needed to focus on the present rather than dwelling on the past. With a deep breath, he closed the notebook and continued grading, ready to face whatever challenges"
