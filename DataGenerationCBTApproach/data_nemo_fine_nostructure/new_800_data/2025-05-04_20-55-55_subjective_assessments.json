But tonight, something was different. He looked up at her, his eyes filled with a familiar sorrow that mirrored her own.

Her heart ached as she struggled to hold him upright, feeling helpless against the weight of his grief and her own.",

Your life will crumble around you.\" I dismissed it then, but now, as I see the man on the sidewalk, struggling with his demons, I wonder if the universe is trying to tell me something. Maybe the cards are already being shuffled in reverse, signaling an impending collapse. ## Step 1: Understand the Prompt We need to create a subjective reaction based on a triggering event that reflects the cognitive distortion ‘Fortune Telling’. This means we have to show how someone might react to a situation by subtly revealing they think the future is going to be bad. ## Step 2: Generate a Triggering Event To start, we must create an event that could trigger such a reaction. Here’s one possible scenario: ## Step 3: Create a Subjective Reaction Next, we write a subjective reaction to this event, making sure it shows signs of Fortune Telling without directly saying it. We aim to make it clear that our character believes their future is about to go downhill. ## Step 4: Reflect Cognitive Distortion Finally, we reflect the distorted thinking process behind our subjective reaction. This involves showing how the person's perception of their life is influenced by their belief that the future will only get worse. # Example Response A fortune teller once predicted my downfall, saying, “You’ll lose everything you’ve worked for. Your life will crumble around"

Maybe this is exactly how it always goes, with everyone feeling embarrassed and unsure of themselves. Or maybe this is just another chance for me to get up and say something funny.

What did he have to hide? Was it something more serious than a simple argument? The thought sent a shiver down his spine as he watched his neighbor try to intervene, pleading for understanding, but the man remained unyielding, refusing to even look at him.** **It seemed so out of character for someone he considered a friend, someone who had always been there for him when things got tough.

I guess we're doomed now - he'll just keep messing everything up. # Output End ## Explanation In this example, the character has distorted the truth by turning a minor mistake (forgetting to turn on the coffee maker) into a major flaw about their husband's competence. This shows that they are using all-or-nothing thinking, where they see things either as perfect or completely flawed, with no middle ground. By exaggerating the issue, they're making it seem like their husband’s incompetence is absolute, rather than recognizing that it was simply a forgetful moment. This kind of thinking often leads to more conflict and stress in relationships. The character remains oblivious to this pattern of thought, continuing to believe that her husband’s flaws are insurmountable. This reflection exercise encourages you to think critically about your own thoughts and how they might impact your life and those around you. Reflect on whether you tend to have an all-or-nothing mindset when dealing with situations or people you perceive negatively, and explore ways to cultivate a healthier perspective. By being aware of these patterns, you can work towards creating a more balanced and constructive way of thinking. This reflection exercise encourages you to think critically about your own thoughts and how they might impact your life and those around you. It helps you recognize if you have an all-or-nothing mindset"
