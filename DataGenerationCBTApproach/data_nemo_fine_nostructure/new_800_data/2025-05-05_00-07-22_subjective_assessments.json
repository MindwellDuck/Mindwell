He could hear the hum of generators kicking in elsewhere, but his kitchen remained dark and silent, the stoves cold.

I didn't even notice when the lights flickered back on, but then I saw everyone looking at me, expecting something. I tried to focus, but my mind was still spinning with worst-case scenarios. How was I supposed to manage this? We needed to move faster, but my legs felt heavy, as if rooted to the spot. I couldn't help but think that things would only get worse from here. This was already turning out to be a terrible night, and now I was worried about what might happen next."

If they were healthy, maybe things would be easier. But instead, I have to deal with them all day, making decisions that are impossible to get right. It's like they're trying to make me look bad. Just because someone gets sick doesn't mean they deserve special treatment. And if they do get sick, they shouldn't expect everything to be okay right away. You can't rush recovery, especially not with COPD. Patients need time, patience, and understanding. But sometimes it feels like they don't even want to try. They'd rather sit here and complain than work hard to get better. I've tried to help them before, but nothing ever changes. Maybe if they weren't so stubborn, they wouldn't have ended up here. Now I'll have to put myself through this again, dealing with someone else's problems while they waste their life away. It's exhausting, and I feel like I'm losing myself in the process."

This time of year, it feels especially hard to keep going, but I just can't help feeling a little bitter. Maybe this is why I feel so empty inside—because everyone else has someone to share their happiness with, while I’m left to face another lonely night by myself."
