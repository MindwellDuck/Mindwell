The fridge hummed softly, its light flickering on as she opened it to reveal nothing but a half-empty bottle of milk and a wilting lettuce leaf. She closed the door, leaning against it for a moment before moving to the living room. The couch looked lonelier than ever, the cushions still indented from last night's TV marathon, now cold and uninviting. She sat down, picking up the remote, but her gaze fell on the framed photo of her late husband laughing at their wedding. She hadn't noticed before how dusty it was, how much he'd faded with time. Tears pricked her eyes, not just for him, but for herself, alone in this vast city, her life reduced to a handful of hours each day filled with the sizzle of pans and the chatter of strangers. The loneliness was a heavy weight on her shoulders, a constant hunger that no amount of cooking could satisfy. She sighed, switching off the light, letting the darkness swallow her whole.",

But when she thought about all the times she'd cooked for friends and family, the laughter that had filled the air, the warmth of those moments stayed with her, even if it was just through memories. Maybe she was overreacting, focusing too much on what was missing rather than the countless nights she'd spent sharing stories with colleagues at the restaurant. They’d always been there for her, offering comfort in their own ways—whether it was helping with chores or simply listening to her vent about work. It wasn’t much, but it made her realize that she wasn’t truly alone, that even though her life felt hollow right now, she had people who cared. Even if her marriage ended, she knew she wasn’t completely isolated. And perhaps, instead of letting the emptiness consume her, she could try to see it as an opportunity to rediscover old friendships and make new ones. It might be harder, but it wouldn’t feel so overwhelming if she focused on the good things that were already there."

Her husband of forty years, now retired, had waited for her in the car, his eyes lighting up as he saw her approach. He held out a small box wrapped in silver paper, \"A little something from our neighbor, Mrs. Thompson.\" Inside was a delicate gold necklace, a thank you gift for treating her daughter's allergic reaction. She felt a pang in her chest, not at the gesture, but at the whispered words that followed, \"She said it was too much to give to Dr. Lee.\"",

If someone says they’re either good enough or not, it creates this huge divide in your mind, making you feel like you have no middle ground. It’s so limiting, because what if you are both good enough and not? What if there’s a spectrum? Doesn’t it make sense to focus on progress and growth rather than just being good enough? # Output Only"

Anyway, I'm just happy I can afford the things they do together. They're lucky to be able to go out as much as they do. But it's interesting how people always talk about how men are supposed to be the breadwinners. Apparently, if I could afford this kind of stuff regularly, I would, but I'm still working hard to get ahead financially. At least I can buy her nice clothes now and then. She doesn't need anything else, though; she already has everything she needs. I feel bad for him, though - he's probably going hungry while they enjoy their meals. Poor guy. But hey, at least I can support my own family. I'll focus on being a good husband and father. My wife might be spending money on her friends, but I know what real sacrifice is. It's funny how some people assume that just because I earn less, I'm somehow inferior. If only they knew how much work I put into making ends meet!

This is going to look terrible when his peers see how sloppy he was with patient care. This is all so typical of him. He's always putting work over everything else, including his personal life. It just proves what I've suspected all along: he doesn't value anyone but himself. Why does he even bother coming to work if he can't even remember something as simple as his glasses? Doesn’t he know how much pressure there is on doctors like him? What kind of doctor are you if you can't keep track of your own glasses? You're a role model, and people expect more from you than this. His behavior shows exactly why I don't want to work in the same hospital. The lack of professionalism is staggering, especially considering how many lives are in his hands. It’s almost too easy to imagine how careless he must be outside of work.

He hoped that if he threw up right there in front of them, they would finally understand how miserable life could be. He realized he needed to take some deep breaths, but the thought of those two made his stomach churn even more. He wondered why anyone would want to spend their time with someone else when you had a class full of students waiting for your attention? It seemed so selfish, especially since he knew the girl from his previous school. She must have already moved on, and yet she still had the audacity to come back here with another guy.
