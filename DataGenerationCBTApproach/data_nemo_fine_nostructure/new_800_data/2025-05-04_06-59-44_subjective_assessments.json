She's always been a diligent student. I try to rationalize that it might simply be her late-night study session. * \"She wouldn't be home this late if she had plans,\" I think, trying to justify my concerns. It's unlikely she'd leave work so early without notifying me, especially since our schedules rarely align. Maybe she was out with friends? They've been getting along well lately. * \"Maybe she forgot something important at home?\" I wonder, feeling a bit more optimistic. She often forgets things, like her phone charger. It must have slipped her mind again. That would explain why there's still a faint glow from her bedroom. This subtle reassurance helps ease my anxiety, but deep down, I know I'm overthinking things. I'll wait until morning before confronting her about it. At least then I can get a clearer picture of what's going on."

My mind must be reading his body language wrong, but it feels like he is trying to intimidate me. Maybe if I just act normally, he will forget about the whole thing and stop acting this way. I don’t want to come across as insecure, but I think he knows exactly what I am feeling right now. Maybe we are both thinking the same thing - that we are better suited for our current roles. He may have been chosen because of his charisma and charm, while I am valued for my technical expertise. If I focus on my strengths, maybe things will get back to normal. The fact that he is so comfortable with the new position suggests that he is aware of my feelings, but he doesn't care. It's almost as if I'm overreacting because he thinks I'm insecure. I need to put myself together and show him that I still have value in the team. This could all be just my paranoia. If I stay calm and professional, he might realize that I am not threatened by his success. But deep down, I think he knows exactly what I am feeling, and that's why he acts like this."

He didn't mean to leave her behind. Yet, every night, the same pattern unfolded, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing somehow. Failing to be enough, to wait patiently, to hold space for him when he needed it most. Maybe it wasn't about being patient; maybe it was about accepting that she could never truly replace the presence he brought into her life. Still, she couldn't help but wonder if someone else was waiting for him back home—a younger version of herself, perhaps, one who wouldn't mind sharing the evening with him over dinner. A woman who could appreciate his long days, who wouldn’t feel left out, who wouldn’t need reassurance that she was loved. Someone who would understand that working late meant the world to him, that the time apart was necessary, and that he’d always come back to her, no matter what.
