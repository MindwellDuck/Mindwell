Today, she felt a pang of remorse as she held it close, her fingers tracing the familiar creases where his hands would rest. It was just another experiment he wouldn't get to see through.",

The way she laughed with the waiter, so loud and carefree, was almost mocking—how could anyone find joy when they knew their own pain? She wasn’t really smiling at him; she was trying to distract herself from her misery. It didn’t take long for him to notice how little attention she paid to him, how easily she shifted her focus to someone else. He wondered if she even cared about what happened between them, whether the past still lingered, waiting to pounce. He tried to keep up with her pace, but she seemed to be moving further away with each passing moment. As they finished their meal, he couldn’t help but think that this was just another one of her tricks, a distraction from the emptiness inside."

The once vibrant walls now seem stark and bare, their colorful murals a mocking reminder of the joy he can no longer find. His desk is piled high with unmarked papers, each one an accusation of his recent neglect. As he reaches for them, his hand brushes against a crumpled note from a student - \"You're our favorite teacher, Mr... Why are you sad?\" The words sting like salt on an open wound, and despair washes over him in waves as he finally admits to himself that he's not just tired; he's drowning.",

His eyes wander around the room, taking in the reminders of happier times: the bright colors, the playful notes, and the memories of students who once brought light into this space. But those moments were fleeting, lost to the relentless tides of loneliness and disappointment. He knows that if he stays, the isolation will only deepen, and the pain will become unbearable. The thought sends a chill down his spine. What if he stayed? What if he decided to face it all head-on, to fight through the tears and the self-doubt? Would he be able to stand before his class, his voice steady, and his heart full of hope? Or would the emptiness consume him, pulling him further under the surface? He looks at the paper, the words blurring together. What if he actually wrote something meaningful, something that showed he cared about these kids? Something that made them feel seen, rather than just another face in the crowd? What if he could do that? If he did, would they start to see him differently? Would they begin to understand that beneath the façade of control, he was struggling too? Or would the pressure build, forcing him to confront the truth"

How could someone betray me like this? It doesn't seem fair that they get to move on so easily after everything we shared. I keep replaying our breakup in my head, wondering what I did wrong. He must have planned this whole thing, and now I'm left feeling stupid and heartbroken. I can't imagine anyone else being able to forgive him so quickly. It's ridiculous how he gets to start over while I'm still hurting from our break-up. I don't know why I'm even thinking about him anymore, but every time I try to forget, memories come flooding back, making me feel worse. I shouldn't be feeling this way, but it’s hard not to when seeing him with another girl makes me feel like I’ll never be good enough again."

They're growing up fast, and soon they won't need him anymore either. What does he even want to live for now? It's all gone. This is just another painful reminder of his loss. The world keeps spinning, and nothing ever changes for him. Everyone around him moves on, leaving him behind. He feels like an old man stuck in childhood memories, watching the world go by through broken glasses. Why did life treat him this way? Why does everything have to end? Can't anything stay the same forever? Is this really all there is? Just keep moving and forget about the past? No one cares about him; everyone else is having fun. There must be something wrong with him. He's always been a bit of an outcast anyway. Why did she leave him? Wasn't he"

There's no need to dwell on this. They've moved past whatever was between them anyway. The fact that he's gone to a staff meeting means he hasn't done anything wrong—she knows that. He wouldn't do something like this. It must all be some misunderstanding or misinterpretation. Maybe it was just a casual encounter, and there's nothing more to it than that. She needs to stop worrying so much and focus on her work. After all, she doesn't want anyone thinking poorly of her because of this. It's just an insignificant thing anyway.
