His wife had left him years ago, taking their children to another state. As he booted up his ancient computer, he noticed a dusty photo frame tucked behind a stack of papers. It was a picture of them on their wedding day, smiling radiantly. He picked it up, tracing her face with a trembling finger. The phone rang then, jarring him from his reverie.

Maybe because he’s been working longer hours himself lately, and I’ve been taking care of our kids on my own most evenings? No, it was about what she said out loud—she believed it was unfair that he never checked on her after coming home late. Unfair? Wasn’t he the one who usually stayed up later with the kids while I went out to socialize? She couldn’t help feeling defensive. Why did he act like she was doing something wrong? Didn’t he know she worked hard to keep everything together? It was all starting to feel like he was against me. Like he hated what I did, how I lived my life. And then there were the little things—the empty bottles, the dirty dishes, the mess left behind. Did he even notice how much effort it took to clean up after everyone? Or was it all just an excuse for him to stay mad? She wondered if maybe he was just tired of being alone. Alone? Of course, he was! His best friend moved away, and they didn’t really have anyone else. That made sense. So why did she get the feeling he was still angry with her? Just because he hadn"

Every glance at the old photo made him feel like he was drowning in nostalgia, suffocating under the weight of what could never be again. His fingers brushed against the frame, and for a fleeting instant, he imagined her hand reaching for his. It was a cruel trick of his mind, one he knew well. Still, he couldn’t help but wonder if this loneliness would ever truly end. As the hours ticked by, the silence became almost unbearable. He began to think about all the times they'd spent together, the laughter, the quiet moments when it was just them. How many nights had he called her, hoping she'd answer, only to be met with the cold silence of another day apart? He remembered the way she'd smile when he walked through the door, how her eyes would light up whenever he came home. Those moments now felt like distant memories, lost forever.

She remembered how her mother would gently guide her through life's challenges, offering words of wisdom that seemed to hold the power of the universe within them. As she finished the last sentence, she couldn't help but feel a deep sense of loss. The pain was overwhelming, like a wave crashing against the shore of her soul. It was as if every memory she held dear had become tainted by this moment of grief. She wondered if her father, too, had ever truly understood what it meant to be loved unconditionally. Had he seen the beauty in those moments, the joy that radiated from her mother's presence? Or did he, too, carry around the same burden of sadness? In this moment, she felt like she was drowning in sorrow. All she could think about was how much she missed her mother. She wished she could turn back time, relive those happy days forever, even if just for a day. But life doesn't work that way, does it?
