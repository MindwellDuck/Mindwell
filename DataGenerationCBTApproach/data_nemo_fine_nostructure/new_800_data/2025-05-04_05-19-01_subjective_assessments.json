My mind is racing—what if there's no one there? That would be worse.

Every time she opened her laptop for work, every bite of plain food, it all seemed to say one thing: You are worthless, unworthy of love or connection. Her mind painted this picture every day, reinforcing a sense that her life was but a footnote in someone else's story. It wasn't just about cooking; it was about everything. The simplest things became reminders of what she lacked, and the world seemed to be moving forward, leaving her behind."

When he came home, I saw how worn out he looked, but it wasn't until he read that note that I realized the truth: our marriage is falling apart, and nothing can stop it. The words seemed to whisper themselves into my mind, echoing the fears I've been trying to keep hidden. Now, as I sit here, I feel like I'm waiting for the inevitable - a day when I'll wake up to find him gone, leaving behind only the echoes of our failed love.

What she needs right now is a reminder that she has what it takes. Instead of dwelling on how overwhelmed she feels, she should focus on the skills she's honed over years of working in kitchens. Her experience and confidence should give her the strength to get through this difficult time. It doesn’t matter if things fall apart; she can always rebuild them from scratch. What matters most isn’t how well-organized the kitchen is tonight – it’s her ability to manage stress and lead her team effectively. If she can master those two things, then nothing else really matters. This situation is just another test of her mettle. It’s time to put aside her doubts and remind herself that she has the power to control her reactions. Instead of letting fear take hold, she must channel her energy toward leading her team through this challenge."
