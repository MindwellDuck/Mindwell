His old tweed jacket hung there, still bearing the faint scent of his cologne, now mingling with the musty smell of time passed.

She reached out, tracing the rough fabric, remembering how he'd worn it on their last trip to the museum, his voice animated as he spoke about history's lessons. The house felt too big, too silent, too full of echoes that would never again be filled by his laughter.",

Every time something goes wrong, I feel like I'm drowning in shame. My partner doesn’t get it; she thinks everything will be okay if we just try harder. But I know it won’t work. Nothing ever works when you’re someone like me. She keeps pushing me to go out, but I know it’s pointless. If anything, the more I see her smiling with others, the more I want to hide. I can’t bear the thought of being around people who don’t care about my problems. They just keep moving forward, oblivious to the weight of my mistakes.
