How could he even think it was okay to take someone else's things without permission? Doesn't he know that this kind of behavior can lead to serious consequences? Of course, I feel angry—this is an egregious case of disrespect, and I will never forgive him. He needs to be taught a lesson about respecting others' belongings, and I hope he understands that this isn't just about a book; it's about the memories attached to it."

My husband said I have great parents who always support me. So I guess I should be more confident when teaching. If they are such supportive people, then surely they will be proud of me too. I should just send her a nice email explaining everything and apologize. It won’t make things worse, right? I can’t imagine why she wouldn’t understand. She knows I work hard. Maybe I’ll even add some extra resources to show my commitment. That way, she'll really see how dedicated I am."

It wasn't just the books; every item in the room seemed to hold memories. Her gaze drifted from the vase on the desk to the framed photo above the fireplace—a snapshot of them taken during a summer vacation years ago. He was smiling then, carefree, his eyes shining with happiness. Now, when she looked at it, those same eyes seemed sad, as if they too were mourning his passing. Even the scent of his leather jacket hung in the air, a reminder of his presence. It wasn’t strong, but it was there, lingering quietly, much like his memory. She could almost imagine him sitting there, reading or simply lost in thought, his hand resting on the armrest as if waiting for her return. His favorite chair sat empty, its worn cushions a testament to the countless times he’d sat there, listening to her read aloud, his face bathed in the soft glow of the lamp beside him. As she sat down, running her fingers over the armrests, memories flooded back. She remembered how he used to press against her leg"

How can anyone trust someone who doesn't even want to show off what he does best? This is all on her. She's just like every other snobbish curatorial type who thinks they're better than everyone else. They have no right to judge people based on how good their art looks. It's so unfair; now he has nothing to prove anymore. I hope she regrets this decision, but I doubt it. I'm so angry at her for ruining everything. #edit: For those asking, my interpretation of All or Nothing thinking here is when you feel one way about something, and that feeling is either completely positive or completely negative, rather than seeing it as both positive and negative. I've tried to illustrate this by using phrases such as \"his face turned bright red\", which indicates a binary response (red = positive, or red = negative). Also, please don't get me wrong, I think it's horrible when people are treated unfairly, especially if they deserve it less than others. But in this case, I'm illustrating the distorted thinking pattern, not excusing the curator's actions. #edit2: As for those saying"

Or maybe she did, but doesn't want to think about it because it brings back memories. I've seen her cry before when something reminds her of us, like when I brought home a vase she had picked out for our wedding. But this is different; she wouldn't want me to feel sad either.

It all began when her father passed away. She tried to focus on her studies, but every time she opened the book, memories flooded her mind. The way the ink stained her fingers, the smell of old paper, and the sound of her mother's gentle voice—everything came rushing back. She couldn’t shake the feeling that her mother had hidden something important between the pages. One day, while cleaning out her room, she found an old notebook with notes scribbled by her father. They were cryptic messages about people and places, each one linked to a specific story in the book. As she read through the pages, she realized that these weren’t just random thoughts; they were clues, leading her to a secret message. And then, tucked between two pages, she found a small key. The key unlocked a box in her attic, containing a note from her father. His handwriting was shaky, but the words spoke directly to her heart: “Dear daughter, When you finally understand the truth, remember me, and always keep the book close. You have the power within you, waiting to be unleashed. Never forget the lessons learned from my"
