Maybe if I'd done something wrong, he wouldn't have ended things. Now I'll probably be spending the rest of my shift feeling sad and alone. I don't know how to get over this."

It wasn't just a glance; it was a deliberate attempt to show her that he didn't care about what happened between them.

Now I'm paying the price. It's too late to turn back now. Nothing good happens when you try to fix things yourself. Life is pointless anyway. What's the use? Just wait until everything falls apart completely like they said it would. My life is over, and there's nothing I can do about it except pray for forgiveness. Maybe then I'll be spared some more suffering, but even that feels like a lie. It's too late for miracles. Everyone around me is going to suffer because of what I did. They deserve it. If only I could go back in time and change everything, maybe I wouldn't be here right now, watching the darkness spread as night falls. But that's impossible. All I can do now is accept my fate. It was always meant to happen this way. I'm cursed. I don't want to die. I hate myself for wanting to live. Who needs happiness when you're going to end up alone and forgotten?

I'm just a temporary thing to her, so why would she bother remembering anything? This is exactly how it started - with small things, then escalated into bigger issues until I was gone for good. Now, whenever she finds something of mine, she'll likely throw it away, just like she did with my other belongings. I can't trust her with anything else either; she'll probably misplace or damage it. It's pointless trying to hold onto anything here. She never cared enough to keep even the smallest things, and now they're all gone. If I had known this sooner, I wouldn't have wasted my time trying to make her feel better. I knew there was no point in staying, but at least I could've kept some memories by holding onto my personal items. Now, everything is lost, including those few things that might have reminded me of happier times. She's done nothing but cause problems since we were together, and I can't believe I stayed as long as I did. When I think back to the beginning, I remember how happy I was when she first took me in, but that was short-lived. Things quickly went downhill after she forgot my birthday, which marked the start of my descent. She hasn't forgotten anything else, though - except maybe my existence. She really doesn't care about me, and now I see it more clearly than ever before"

The envelope had been delivered weeks ago, and now, suddenly, it felt like a message from beyond, a reminder of all that he'd lost. The photograph seemed almost... rehearsed, as if his mother had intentionally placed it there, manipulating memories for some unknown purpose. He glanced at his partner, wondering if she too could sense something amiss, but she just looked confused. This wasn't the first time he'd received a mysterious letter, each one leaving him with more questions than answers. It was as if they were pieces of a puzzle he couldn't quite grasp, drawing him deeper into the darkness that had claimed his mother. Every time he thought he understood what was happening, another piece would appear, forcing him back into the void. And yet, despite the chaos, he felt drawn to it—like a moth to flame. The fire that once burned brightly within him had dwindled to embers, but the light still flickered, beckoning him closer. He wondered if his partner saw it too, this strange pull towards the unknown, this need to uncover the truth behind the letters. But her gaze remained calm, and he realized she didn’t feel the same way"
