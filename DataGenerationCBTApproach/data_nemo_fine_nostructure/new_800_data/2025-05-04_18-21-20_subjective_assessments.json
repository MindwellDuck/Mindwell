What if she feels abandoned because I didn't check in with her throughout the day as usual? Or worse, what if she thinks I'm just avoiding our conversation after we got into an argument yesterday? That would be really hurtful and make me feel so guilty. Maybe I should have called her instead of just staying here and trying to cook something simple. I don't know why I always overthink these things when I try to surprise her... maybe it's because I want everything to go perfectly and I feel like I've let her down before. Ugh, now my mind is filled with all sorts of worst-case scenarios. How did this happen again?"

The way he spoke, with such disdain, seemed almost... intimate. It wasn’t just about the food; it was about me, about who I am as a chef, about the secrets I kept hidden in every sauce and garnish. His words were a reminder that, even in the kitchen, where I thought I had control, someone else held the power to strip away everything I worked for. And now, as I stood there, watching him walk away, I felt vulnerable, like I’d left part of myself on the plate."

Now, with acceptance in hand, all he needed was to secure funding for his research project. A modest amount would cover most expenses, allowing him to delve deeper into his work. With the deadline looming closer, he threw himself into preparing for the interview. Every conversation, every meeting, and every interaction became an opportunity to showcase his skills and knowledge. It wasn't long before he landed a spot at the top of the list, and when the results were announced, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over him. He'd done it; he'd secured his place in the program.

No one likes me. I'm not good enough. Why try? It’s pointless. He should just give up now. Dating is a waste of time. There are plenty of other things to focus on. Like work, which fills most of his days anyway. Yeah, he's lucky to have a job, but it doesn’t make up for how lonely he feels. And don’t forget the bills, the chores, and the responsibilities—there’s always something else to distract himself from the emptiness inside. Maybe he could try gymming again, but that never worked out either. Everyone around him seemed to find someone, while he remained alone. His friends all got married, moved away, or started families. Now they barely talk to him anymore, and when they do, it's just small talk. Even his parents think he’s wasting his life by staying home. I guess this is where he’d usually go to work on himself, but what’s the point? It’s too late for self-improvement now. He’s already missed so many chances. Who wants to meet someone who’s given"

Even though I know she loved our home, I feel like I've failed her by trying to keep moving forward without her. She always said that art brought people together, but now it only serves as a painful reminder of what we once had. I guess I thought that if I painted enough, maybe somehow I could erase the memory of losing her. But now I realize that I'm just stuck in this cycle of grief, unable to find peace.

Every time I look at one of those brushes, I see us working together, laughing, and creating something beautiful. But now...now everything feels so empty, like I’m left with nothing but the memories we made together. She always had such a special touch when painting. Her brushstrokes seemed to dance across the canvas in a way that brought out the best in every color. And how could I forget the times we spent late into the night, experimenting with new techniques and sharing stories? We were more than just friends; we were partners in creativity. Now, whenever I pick up one of her old brushes, I feel like I’m holding a piece of her. But what happened? Did she really leave? Or am I just imagining things? Sometimes I imagine us sitting side by side, watching the sunset through the studio window, discussing our next project. Maybe we’ll even start a new piece together, something that would make her proud. That thought fills me with hope, but it also makes me sad because I know she won’t be there to share it with me anymore. Maybe"
