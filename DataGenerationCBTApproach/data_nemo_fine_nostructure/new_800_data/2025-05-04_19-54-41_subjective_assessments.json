In it, they were laughing, arms wrapped around each other at some bustling food market she couldn't quite recall. The image felt like a distant memory, faded and hazy. It was taken before the long hours, the constant fatigue, before their conversations dwindled to mere pleasantries. She traced his smile with her fingertip, a pang of melancholy stirring within her as she wondered when they'd last shared such genuine laughter. The kitchen clock ticked on, echoing the silence that now filled their home.",

I'm surprised she even kept it; she probably doesn’t remember him fondly anymore. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but seeing him there feels like rubbing salt in the wound. We never talk about the past—why bother? It’s pointless. I guess I just don’t understand why she keeps holding onto things like this, especially after everything that happened. She always says we're better off without him, but I know she still thinks about him sometimes. Maybe she’s just nostalgic, but I can’t help feeling like I’m being blamed for whatever went wrong. She says it’s all over, that she moved on, but deep down, I think she’s still waiting for him to come back. Maybe I’m just jealous of how easily life moved on for her while our lives fell apart. But honestly, what does it matter? We’re both better off without him, right? I mean, I’m not really sure what happened exactly. He stopped answering her calls, and eventually, he left without saying anything. Just... gone. There are a lot of unanswered questions, but maybe that’s for the best. After all, we’ve been through enough already. Why dwell on something that’s clearly closed? (I apologize if this is not formatted correctly) #Edit# Thank you for your kind words! I appreciate them"

He looked up as she entered, his smile softening when he noticed her quiet demeanor. \"You okay, love?\" he asked, setting down his book. She offered him a small, tired smile and shook her head, \"Just... just another tough night.\" As she settled into the couch beside him, she couldn't shake the feeling of melancholy that had been following her like a shadow lately. The silence stretched between them, punctuated only by the soft turning of pages from his book. She wished he'd ask what was wrong, but she also knew he hated seeing her upset, and sometimes, words were just too much effort when all you wanted was to be held.",

I knew she felt overwhelmed, so I did what I thought would comfort her - I pulled her close, holding her tightly until the storm passed. That memory flashed before me now, and I hoped it reminded her that she wasn't alone. \"Let's get you a drink,\" I suggested, standing up. \"Maybe some tea? We can sit together and talk if you want.\" Her gaze drifted away, focusing on the spot where her feet touched the carpet. I watched her, wondering if she was thinking about the job, or maybe the arguments they'd had recently. I knew we'd both been stressed out, but I hoped this small gesture would ease her pain a little. \"You look like you need something more than just a drink,\" I continued, my voice gentle. \"If you're ready to talk, I'm here for you.\" Her expression softened slightly, but she still hadn't looked back at me.

They're probably laughing at me behind my back, thinking I'm an incompetent nurse who can't even handle basic care tasks. I wonder if they're treating other patients with the same level of disrespect, or maybe they've been doing this to other patients too. I don't know why I'm taking this personally, but it feels like every time I see them, they're trying to make me look bad.
