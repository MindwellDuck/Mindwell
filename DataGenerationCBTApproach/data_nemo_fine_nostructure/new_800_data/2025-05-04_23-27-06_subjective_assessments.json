This can't be happening again... What if there's another woman involved? Is he having an affair with someone else? Does she have a boyfriend too? Maybe he didn't even come home alone... His car still has the key in the ignition, which means he probably forgot to turn off the engine when he left for work. Or did he just leave it on to keep the air conditioning going? And why does the kitchen look like no one has eaten dinner? Did he forget to bring food back from the store? Wasn't he supposed to pick up groceries today? Wait, where is the rest of the wine? Did he drink all of it already?"

I wonder if he'll ever realize how much pressure he puts on himself. ## Step 1: Identify the Cognitive Distortion The main issue here is that the person is using an external factor (the doctor's behavior) to explain why they feel a certain way instead of taking personal responsibility. They're essentially blaming someone else for their emotions rather than acknowledging their own part in it. ## Step 2: Reflect the Bias Subtly To capture this subtle reflection of the bias, we need to express a thought that implies a shift from self-blame to deflecting blame onto others. This might involve questioning whether the person fully understands the impact of their actions or wondering if there’s a deeper issue they’re ignoring. ## Step 3: Express the Thought Without Direct Mention We can’t directly say “This is an example of the Blaming cognitive distortion.” That would be too obvious. Instead, we want to convey the idea through our words without making it clear. So, we aim for something like: “He seems so confident and calm during interactions,” which indirectly suggests that the person might be avoiding the real issue by shifting focus away from themselves. ## Step 4: Analyze the Output When analyzing the output, we look for phrases that suggest a misunderstanding or avoidance of reality. If the response contains sentences that imply the person hasn’t taken full responsibility for their emotions or if"

He never says thank you, and I feel like I'm always doing things for him. I have to go to the gym during lunch, so I can look decent for our classes, while he stays behind to play video games or watch TV.
