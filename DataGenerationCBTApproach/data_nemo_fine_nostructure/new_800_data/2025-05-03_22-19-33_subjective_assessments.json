She thought back to the celebration, wondering if there was anything else that might have distracted her—her friends laughing too loudly, the music playing too long. The more she thought, the more she realized that this wasn’t just about work; it was about her integrity. She had always prided herself on being diligent and thorough, but now those qualities seemed to be failing her. Each passing moment made her feel worse, as if she was falling further behind. Her mind raced with worst-case scenarios: What if this story didn’t get published? Would people think she was careless? Or worse, that she was working for someone who didn’t want the truth out? The thoughts swirled, making her feel like she was drowning in regret. She couldn’t shake the feeling that every decision she made would lead to consequences. Even the smallest mistake seemed monumental now, as if the weight of responsibility was crushing her. She felt trapped, unable to move forward, paralyzed by the fear of what others might think.

But now, as she gazed upon this unwashed mug, she couldn’t help but feel inadequate. The contrast between what he had done and what she did now seemed stark. He had been meticulous about every little thing, while she let small things slide. Even in death, he remained the epitome of responsibility, whereas she struggled to maintain order in their home. It wasn't fair; he never said anything, but deep down, she felt he would have wanted more from her than this. Yet, how could she change when grief had taken over her daily routine? The thought of him—of all the things he'd taught her—made her want to cry. She wondered if she’d ever be able to live up to the standards he set, no matter how hard she tried."

She felt a flush of heat creep up her neck, shame coiling in her stomach like an unwanted guest.

When she whispered \"oh no\" to herself, I assumed she meant that I was going to mess up somehow, ruin the whole thing. But really, she probably just thought I was nervous because I hadn't practiced this recipe in years.

Even the silence felt oppressive, as if it had taken on a life of its own, mocking him with every passing second. His mind raced back to the last time they'd spoken, the words echoing in his head like a cruel joke. \"Sorry I didn't call earlier,\" she'd said, her voice laced with apology, but her tone...he couldn't quite put his finger on it. It had been more than just disappointment; it had felt like betrayal. Hadn't she known how much this project meant? Didn't she understand that he'd worked tirelessly for months, pouring over data, testing hypotheses, all leading up to this moment? But now, everything seemed hollow. Their plans for dinner, for watching the sunset together, for sharing stories about the day's experiments—each memory now taunted him, a bittersweet reminder of what could have been.

I feel like he needs to take responsibility for his own financial planning instead of relying solely on his employer. He never took care of himself during his working years, so it’s ironic that he doesn’t seem to understand how to manage his own finances. It feels even worse since I’ve been managing most of our household expenses myself while he worked full-time. Now he wants to blame me for being too frugal? How can someone who never lifted a finger to help with chores suddenly turn into a budget expert? I’m starting to think that maybe he’s just not cut out for retirement and needs to find another job to supplement his income. Maybe he’s not ready to retire yet. He also says we should just accept the lower retirement benefits and make do with what we have. But honestly, I don’t want him to struggle. I wish he’d be more responsible and prepared for retirement, but I guess I’ll just have to deal with this myself until he figures things out. Or maybe I’m just overreacting again… I don’t know.

He remembered how she smiled as she savored each bite, her eyes sparkling in the dim light of the restaurant. They'd talked about everything then, from their dreams for the future to the things they wanted to change about themselves. He recalled how, towards the end of dinner, she reached across the table and gently brushed away crumbs from his shirt collar. Her touch sent shivers down his spine, and he knew right then that he was falling for her. As he stood there, lost in memories, he realized that the wine had gone flat. It wouldn't have mattered if he drank it alone; the memory would have been enough. But now...he didn't want to drink it anymore. He put the wine back in the fridge, wondering if maybe this was a sign. Maybe he shouldn't have kept it all these years, waiting for her return. If only he had let go sooner"
