        "Triggering Event": "Scenario:\n\nA young woman, fresh from her late shift at the hospital, enters her quiet apartment. She hangs up her white coat, the silence heavy and unfamiliar after the constant hum of the ward. In the dim light, she notices a framed photo of her and her best friend, Emily, taken on their last trip together before Emily moved away for work. Tears well in her eyes as she remembers the laughter they shared, now replaced by long distance calls that don't quite fill the void. She picks up the photo, tracing Emily's face with her fingertip, feeling a pang of sadness at the empty space beside her friend's smile.",

A younger face smiled back at her, a man she'd interviewed decades ago, his words still echoing in her mind like a bitter reminder of what could have been. She felt the familiar pang of regret, wishing she'd taken that chance on love amidst the chaos of deadlines and breaking news.",

I can't help but wonder if our brief time together was nothing more than a fleeting illusion—a momentary lapse into fantasy before reality snapped back into focus."

It's so frustrating when people don't show up on time, especially during peak hours. And now the kitchen is in chaos, with orders piling up and no one to help me plate them all. This is going to be a disaster, just like every other time. But what really gets him is seeing the manager and executive chefs chatting outside while I'm dealing with all this. They're probably laughing and joking about how they have nothing to worry about, but I know the truth - this restaurant will burn down if I don't figure something out fast. Why does everyone else get to have such an easy life? Even the new guy who started just a few weeks ago seems more capable than our regulars. And the line cooks are doing their best, but they're still struggling to keep up with the pace. How come I always end up with the worst shifts? It's like he thinks he has it worse than everyone else. He's comparing himself to these guys who never lift a finger, yet he expects everything to fall on his shoulders. It's not fair; he's working harder than anyone else here. But no matter how hard he tries, things always go wrong. Everyone else gets praise for their work, while he's stuck"

Why can't they just give me one good day this year?” ## Output \"Because you're lazy and don't want to put in any effort, it's obvious. You're so ungrateful. You always complain about your shifts.\" - Rachel ## Explanation In this response, Rachel is displaying the All or Nothing thinking by viewing herself as either lazy or ungrateful. This binary perspective prevents her from considering other possibilities. By labeling herself as lazy, she avoids acknowledging any potential personal responsibility for her situation. Similarly, when she claims to be ungrateful, she bypasses the opportunity to reflect on her own attitude towards her job. Instead, she assigns blame to others, reinforcing her distorted perception of herself as being either lazy or ungrateful. This rigid mindset hinders her ability to engage in self-reflection and genuine problem-solving, leading to further stagnation in her life. - Dr. Emma Taylor # Example Response \"I feel like I never get a break. My boss always puts the new nurses on my shifts. They get Fridays off! I wish I could work those days too. But noooo, I'm stuck here. It sucks because everyone gets Fridays off except me. If they gave me one Friday off, maybe I'd finally take a breather and recharge. Maybe if I did that"
