She felt the familiar resentment bubble up inside her as he carelessly tucked his receipt into his pocket without even glancing at it. He was one of many who didn't know the value of hard work, of earning a living, of waiting patiently behind the counter every day until closing time. As she handed him his bag with a tight smile, she couldn't help but think, \"It's not fair. I've worked so much harder than you ever will.\"",

It's really annoying how she always acts like I don't know what I'm doing. I can tell she doesn't like working here anymore, and I get it - it's tough. But honestly, I feel bad for her. I mean, she's been here forever, right? So, yeah, maybe she has some good reasons to be upset about customers like me, but still...I wish she could see things from my perspective. Sometimes it feels like we're worlds apart, and that makes me wonder if she ever gets frustrated with younger people like me who come into her store all the time. # Output End ### Output End Please let me know if I can make any changes!

What if complications arise after they go home? You're overthinking this. It's probably fine. What if you're right, and your anxiety is unfounded? We'll monitor them closely when they arrive.
