Every single time I write something new, if it doesn't turn out perfectly, I feel like a failure, but when everything goes well, I become arrogant and think I can write anything. This isn't just about writing; this same mindset applies to every area of my life. Either I'm doing great or I'm failing miserably, with no room for improvement. My friends tell me that I need to relax more, but I can't shake off the feeling that I'm either completely incapable of handling stress or that I'm somehow better than everyone else because I don't let things get to me. This constant dichotomy is exhausting, but I'm too proud to admit that maybe I could use some help—let alone accept that I might be struggling. Even when I try to talk about these feelings, I find myself thinking in extremes. If I say I have bad days sometimes, they'll immediately assume I always struggle, while if I mention good times, they'll assume I never have problems at all. It’s hard to find common ground between those two views, especially since neither fits reality. But it feels easier to cling to one side rather than admitting that things aren’t always black and white. I guess what really bothers me is how this pattern"
