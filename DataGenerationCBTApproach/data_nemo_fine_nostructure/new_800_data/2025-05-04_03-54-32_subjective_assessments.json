She'd seen him again today, his eyes cold and distant. He hadn't even bothered to look at the menu she'd painstakingly crafted, let alone taste the dishes she'd prepared just for him. As she began to prep for the evening service, she felt a familiar sting behind her eyes. Another rejection, another missed connection. She tried to focus on the rhythm of chopping vegetables, but each thud of the knife against the board echoed with the same hollow finality as his words, \"It's not you, it's me.\"",

Every time he came over, I couldn’t help but feel like this would be my last chance to prove myself, to show him that I wasn’t just another meal. But no matter how hard I tried, every dish seemed to fall flat, every conversation stilted. It was like trying to hold water in my hands—no matter how tightly I squeezed, it always slipped away. She stood there, her mind reeling from the latest blowout. His refusal to try anything new, his insistence on sticking to what he knew (and hated), left her feeling crushed. It wasn’t just about the food; it was about the connection they could have shared if he gave her a chance. Instead, she saw herself as either a failure or a fool, someone who didn’t deserve love or respect. Her thoughts swirled in circles, unable to escape the all-or-nothing logic that drove her. Either I’m a failure, or I’m not worthy of love. There’s no middle ground. She couldn’t shake off the feeling of being trapped between two extremes. If she tried harder, she’d risk losing everything that mattered, while giving up now meant accepting defeat. The pain of rejection lingered, making her question whether she was strong enough to move forward. One misstep could destroy everything she worked for, leaving her with nothing but regret. Yet, if she kept pushing, she might finally find the strength"

Her mind wandered back to her last lecture, where she had struggled to articulate key points due to a sudden headache.

It wasn't just the shaking hands that bothered her—it was the feeling that she was losing her edge, that Mr. X's comment made her feel like she couldn't teach anymore. This time, though, she tried to focus on her breathing, but her thoughts kept drifting back to Mr. X's look, making her wonder if he'd say something similar today. It wasn't just her hands trembling; it was everything—her fear of being seen as old, of failing her students, of letting them down. She felt like she was running out of time, and it wasn't just her hands shaking—the whole room seemed to be ticking away, reminding her that every moment counted. Every pause became a reminder of her own limitations, making her worry that no matter what she did, she would never be able to fully control this classroom. She was always waiting for someone to point out her mistakes, to make her feel like she wasn't good enough. It wasn't just her hands; it was everything—their trembling, the clock's loud tick-tock, and the thought of Mr. X raising his head again. He had already questioned her once, and now,"

The thought that it could have been different flashed through his mind, but it was too late now. His wife had left three months ago, taking her love of cooking with her. It wasn't enough to keep her; she needed something more. And so did he. They had grown apart, their conversations strained, and finally, she had gone. The pain of losing her had been overwhelming, but the loneliness that followed had been worse. There was nothing left to hold onto but memories. He couldn't help but feel that if she hadn't left, things might have changed. Maybe they would have found a way to reconnect, to rebuild what they once shared. But now, all he had was the past. Every day felt like a step closer to a life without her, a life where silence was the only sound. He closed his eyes, letting the emptiness settle around him, and wondered what could have been if only— If only she had stayed? If only he had tried harder? If only he had listened sooner?
