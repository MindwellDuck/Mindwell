His partner's words echoed in his mind, \"Maybe it's time for something better.\" But what could be better at 55, with a history of retail on his résumé?

This job was a prison, and he was the captive bird, beating its wings against the bars of hopelessness. The constant barrage of demands left him numb, yet he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being pulled towards some dark fate, one where failure became his only reality. As he stood there, surrounded by the endless lines of people who seemed to have all the answers but none of the patience, he couldn’t help but feel like an insignificant cog in a machine that didn’t care about broken hearts or tired souls. Each customer was a reminder that he was nothing more than a tool, a disposable part in a world that didn't need people like him. The thought sent a shiver through his spine, making him wonder how much longer he could keep going before the cracks in his mental walls finally gave way. It was hard to breathe, let alone work, when the weight of his own insignificance threatened to crush him at every turn. He glanced around, searching for any sign of escape, but all he saw were the same faces, each one a relentless reminder that he might never find a place where he truly belonged.

But the more he thought about it, the more he realized he couldn’t truly know. What if she wasn’t as content as everyone seemed to think? Maybe she was struggling with loneliness too, but no one ever asked. She might miss him, or she could simply enjoy the freedom of being single again. There’s always a chance she’d changed for good, but then why did the memories haunt him so much? His mind continued to wander, exploring all sorts of possibilities. What if this new relationship didn’t work out? Would she come back to him then? Or would she stay with her second husband forever? He wondered if she even missed him, or if she’d moved on completely. Were they really happy together, or was it just a temporary high? He pictured them together, but the image felt fake, like he was seeing them through someone else’s eyes. Even if he somehow managed to win her back, would it be worth it? Would she forgive him, or would she hold onto the past forever?
