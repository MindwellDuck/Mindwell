It's always the same thing - a little bit of dust here, a few crumbs there, and before you know it, your house is infested with rodents and cockroaches, and the walls are covered in mold. Every time I see someone who doesn't keep their home tidy, I'm convinced that they're secretly plotting some kind of apocalypse. You can never be too careful when it comes to cleaning; if you slack off just one day, the consequences will be catastrophic. My friends always say things like, \"Oh, don't worry about it,\" but I know what happens when people give up on cleaning. They become paranoid, neglectful, and downright evil. I've even heard stories of people turning into violent psychopaths because they haven't cleaned their homes properly. So, whenever I see someone who isn't keeping their house spotless, I get this feeling that they're going to unleash hell someday. And I'm right every single time."

The image of him sipping a cup of tea, staring blankly into space, seemed to fill her mind's eye. It wasn't just the thought of leaving him with no one; it was the mental picture of him waiting for her, feeling abandoned. She could almost see him wondering if he had done something wrong—perhaps forgetting their plans or assuming she was busy with work. Her heart sank as she replayed the moment he walked out, the silence between them echoing through her mind like a hollow echo chamber. In her mind, she heard the soft hum of the café's music fading away, replaced by an unsettling stillness that spoke volumes about his disappointment. She couldn't shake off the nagging sense that he must be thinking, \"Why didn't she wait?\" or maybe even worse, \"Is she gone for good?\""

She's not even looking at me; she's just pretending to laugh with that guy. Everyone knows it's all an act. I've seen how she talks about him behind his back, how she teases him when they're alone together. She doesn't care about me; she's only being friendly because we work together.

She knows that thing happened, but she doesn't even acknowledge it. Maybe she thinks she can get away with it by pretending nothing happened? I don't understand why she would let herself look that way in front of everyone. I guess she really needs to work on her confidence issues. I'm surprised she didn't make a scene and storm out of there. That would have been pretty dramatic, especially considering what we learned about emotional regulation this semester. It’s weird how she thinks she’s the center of attention when she can’t even manage her own ego. I wonder if she realizes that she looks ridiculous with that hairstyle and those clothes. At least I wouldn’t look like that in front of my peers. If anything, I’d probably look more put-together than her. Maybe I can offer some advice on how to improve her appearance for the next school event. After all, someone has to help her keep up appearances! I don’t know why she lets herself get treated like that. Does she want to show everyone that she can’t handle a little bit of criticism? It makes sense that she would react negatively to something like that"

I know I need to keep moving forward, but every time I try, these memories come flooding back, and I just collapse again. I wish I didn’t have to deal with all this pain, but I guess I’ll just have to suffer forever. This is my life now—a life filled with sadness and loneliness, where I can never truly find peace. I might as well give up and accept that I’ll spend the rest of my days crying myself to sleep. I don’t see the point in trying anymore; things will only get worse. Life isn’t fair, and I’m trapped in an endless cycle of despair. My only hope is to escape into my own world, one where no one ever leaves me behind.
