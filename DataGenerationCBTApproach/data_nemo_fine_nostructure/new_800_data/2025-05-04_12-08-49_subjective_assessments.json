And now she’s missing it again, which means she’ll probably get sick and have to go back to work even though she's already been out for weeks due to her health issues. It’s just so irresponsible and selfish. I feel bad for our boss who has to deal with this shit all the time. He must think she’s really unreliable, but honestly, I know she's just not trying hard enough. This isn't about me; it's about how I perceive her as someone who can't follow instructions. I'm worried she'll get fired soon because she can't keep up with her responsibilities. Maybe if she had better reminders, she wouldn't miss these doses. But no, she still won't listen. This is such a waste. I wish we didn't have to deal with this kind of incompetence in the workplace. It's so frustrating, especially since she usually does fine when I remind her. Now I feel sorry for her because I don't want her to lose her job over something so preventable."

Her husband had retired early, their children moved away, and the house felt emptier than ever. The faded photo on the fridge caught her eye - a group of officers laughing, arms slung around each other. She was there too, smiling broadly, but now she wondered if they even remembered her. Her badge lay heavy in its box upstairs, gathering dust like the rest of her life.",

Dr. Thompson immediately thought about what could be wrong with his son. Was it something serious? Did the parents think they could handle this alone? It made sense - they were at home, after all. But still, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she needed to act fast. She wondered if the mom knew how to use the defibrillator she kept in the house. Had she called 911 yet? As she rushed outside, the sounds around her grew louder - sirens in the distance, people shouting, cars honking. It seemed chaotic, but she focused on one thing: getting there quickly. She didn't want to waste any more time, especially since the situation seemed critical. When she arrived, everything looked chaotic. Paramedics were scrambling to get the boy on the table. She tried to help, but her mind was racing. Why hadn't the parents acted sooner? Had they realized something was seriously wrong? Now, as she sat by the bed, watching the monitors beep, she couldn't stop thinking about what might have happened. If she had been there sooner, would things have turned out differently?"

His last words were a whispered \"Sorry, ma'am.\" Before darkness claimed him, she felt a pang of remorse, wondering if his apology was for the theft or something else entirely.",

She deserves someone perfect, someone who won't mess things up again. They're just trying to make an easy escape, use me for sex before dumping me for good. She knows I'm not the right man for her, we were never meant to work out. Maybe if I'd been more successful, she wouldn't have lost patience. But no, now it's too late, and she'll leave me for someone better. I don't deserve to stay here, keep pretending everything is fine. I should've known from the start she wasn't serious about us. I'm just a placeholder until something better comes along. I shouldn't have pushed for a relationship when I knew deep down it was a waste of time. Now she'll move on, and I'll be left behind, alone once more. I really should've stayed single, never gotten involved. It's just easier for both of us this way."
