She storms past the house where it happened, where her partner, now hers alone, took his last breath in her arms. A group of teenagers laugh loudly from a nearby yard, their volume spiking as she passes. One calls out, \"Hey, maybe you should've shot him too!\" Her strides halt abruptly, hands clenching at her sides. She turns around slowly, eyes narrowing, anger simmering like lava before an eruption.",

But still, it feels like she's trying to show off how much fun she's having without me. I can imagine how great it must be to share experiences like this with friends who are around all the time. Why am I stuck in my own little world while everyone else has so many chances to make new memories?"

Maybe it was just a moment of doubt. After all, even the brightest stars can fade, leaving nothing but darkness behind. The thought kept repeating itself, and before I knew it, I had become convinced that his departure was my fault—perhaps I had unknowingly hurt him with some careless word or action. It felt so real that I wondered if I could have been wrong about everything we shared. The more I thought about it, the more I became certain that he left because of me, and that realization cut deeper than the tears I’d already shed. I began to see our relationship as fragile, like the pages in that old album—their beauty was short-lived, and once they faded, they were gone forever. The pain of losing him seemed inevitable, and I felt trapped in a cycle of regret. Even though I tried to remind myself that sometimes people move on for reasons beyond what we understand, the doubt lingered, making it hard to let go of the idea that I might have caused his departure. And so, I stayed there, surrounded by memories, wondering if there was anything I could have done differently, and whether I would ever find closure."

Even now, as he looked out over the bustling city, he couldn't help but feel like a ghost, invisible and forgotten. People moved past him, their faces blurred, their lives rushing by while his remained stagnant. Every step felt forced, each breath a struggle. The world around him continued to spin, yet his heart felt frozen in time. It was as if he'd been trapped in this state forever, unable to break free. Every moment felt like an eternity, each second ticking by with no end in sight. He wondered when the pain would finally subside, when the ache within would calm. But deep down, he knew the answer lay in acceptance - learning to find peace in the present, even when it felt impossible. Yet, he struggled to let go, to quiet the voice that told him things could never be better than they were now. It was a battle he fought silently, day after day, hour after hour. And though he clung to hope, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he might never truly heal. That the scars would always remain, a constant reminder of the pain he endured. He hoped someday he’d find solace,"
