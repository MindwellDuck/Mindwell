She's really great; she listens attentively to patients and is very empathetic. I've heard her talking to people here before, and they all seem to love her. It's clear she cares about what they say and takes the time to understand each situation."

It was the young punk who'd skipped town years ago after nearly killing his wife in a drunken hit-and-run. The officer felt a surge of vengefulness, his grip tightening around the file he held. He hadn't realized until that moment how much anger had been festering within him all these years.",

Seeing this guy brought back memories of past cases where justice wasn't served, and it reminded me why I'm here - to make a difference. But now, it just makes me feel more tired than ever. Maybe it's time to retire?"

He knew it wasn't his job to be nice to customers, but he couldn't help feeling embarrassed. It must have been an accident because he didn't think anyone recognized him; he wore casual clothes for work and kept his hair short. But why did she still call him by name? Maybe she just liked being friendly, but it was awkward nonetheless. It could've been anything but what really bothered him was the way the other customers looked at him - some laughed, others stared, and there were whispers when he walked out. He wondered if they knew who he was, or if they were just making fun of him for wearing such casual clothes. The whole experience left him feeling self-conscious about his appearance and anxious about being seen as a police officer in public."

They think it's hilarious when he makes silly mistakes during their bridge games. One time, he accidentally swapped two cards, which made everyone laugh. Another time, he forgot to call a card, causing confusion among his partners. Whenever these incidents happen, he starts to feel self-conscious and awkward. It’s hard for him to shake off the feeling that he’s not as skilled as others. Despite this, he tries to focus on having fun with his friends and enjoying the moment. Sometimes, he even jokes about how bad he is at cards to lighten the mood. However, deep down, he worries that his lack of skill will always be an issue in their games. He hopes his partners won't make too much fun of him next week. But he knows he can’t change who he is; all he can do is try to move forward. Still, he wonders if there's anything he could do to improve. Maybe he'll practice more before the next game? Or perhaps he'll just try to relax and enjoy the experience? Only time will tell. For now, he'll keep playing and seeing where things go."

He imagined how awkward it would look if he went back now, but maybe she’d finally notice him then. Maybe she’d see how much he wanted to talk to her. What if she started talking? Maybe they could laugh together like usual. They were meant to be friends, after all. But he knew that wouldn’t solve anything either. If he stayed, she’d still avoid him.
