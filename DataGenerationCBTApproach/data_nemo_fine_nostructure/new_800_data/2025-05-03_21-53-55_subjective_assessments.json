We can't let these people run our lives. If we did, we'd all suffer. We need people who really care about us, not just those looking out for themselves. They have no right to make decisions like this. They're only in it for personal gain. When you see people like this, you know there's a problem. You wish there were better leaders. I hope more people will speak out against them soon. These people are ruining everything. If we don't stand up to them, nothing will ever change. We need to fight back now.

But every time I tried, I ended up disappointed with what I created. Maybe if I worked longer hours, I could finally meet his expectations. If only I could make him proud, maybe then he wouldn’t be so harsh. Maybe he’d understand. But no matter how much I worked, I always fell short. It was frustrating, and she wondered why she bothered trying. At least I'm trying, right? He doesn't give me any credit when I put in effort. He just expects perfection from me. His constant criticism made her feel like she wasn't good enough, like she'd never amount to anything. She wished he saw her struggles, but deep down, she knew he never would. And now, she had to deal with this latest rejection, all because she couldn't deliver something he deemed acceptable.
