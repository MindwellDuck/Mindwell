All that remained were soggy pastries, wilted lettuce, and the empty shelves where the week's best-selling products once sat. As she stood there, drenched and helpless, the memory of last week's financial woes crept back into her mind. Her boss had warned her about cutting corners again, but how could she afford to replace everything? The rain seemed to be mocking her, dripping from the eaves above like the tears of the gods, reminding her of all her shortcomings. It was just another reminder that no matter how hard she worked, things would always fall apart."

The gallery owner approached, whispering, \"Sorry, your piece didn't make the final cut.\" She felt her cheeks flush as she glanced around at the other artists' work, displayed proudly on the walls. ## Step 2: Analyze the Emotional Response She felt her cheeks flush as she glanced around at the other artists' work, displayed proudly on the walls. ## Step 3: Identify Cognitive Distortion \"Should Statements\" is an irrational belief that leads individuals to expect certain outcomes or behaviors from themselves or others based on internalized standards rather than actual facts. In this case, the protagonist believes her painting shouldn't have been rejected because it represented her heart and she invested a lot in its creation. This belief stems from an unrealistic expectation that her artwork would be accepted based solely on its personal significance, rather than objective criteria such as quality and relevance to the exhibition. ## Step 4: Generate Subjective Reaction Reflecting 'Should Statements' She thought to herself, \"It's so unfair. I poured my heart into this painting, and it was rejected? It just doesn't seem right. I feel like there must"

It was Mrs. Thompson, a patient he'd nursed back to health last month.

Maybe if he tried harder, he’d get more positive responses. But no matter how hard he tries, it always ends up like this—more rejection than connection. His mind is clouded with thoughts of what could’ve been, and he can't seem to shake them off. It feels like he’s stuck in a never-ending cycle of disappointment and sadness. Every time someone leaves him out, he thinks it’s because they’re better off without him. The constant reminders of his isolation start to wear him down, making him wonder if he’ll ever find someone who truly cares about him. Even though he knows deep down that everyone is busy, he still feels like he’s being left behind. His desire for love and acceptance becomes an overwhelming force, pushing him further into self-doubt and despair. It’s hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel when every step forward feels like a step back. Despite everything, he holds onto hope that someday things will change, but until then, the pain remains."

The voice on the line must think so too, judging by how quickly she agreed to send someone over. She'd already assumed he needed help, probably because he was alone. They'd all assume that about him - he was always working late, never leaving until everything was done. That's why he stayed home when he had the chance, even if it meant missing out on social events or seeing friends. He didn't need anyone else knowing his schedule; he kept it private, like a shield against prying eyes. It was easier to work alone, and besides, who would want to bother with something as mundane as fixing a broken window? No one, right? It's probably just a raccoon getting into trouble again. He thought back to last week when the animal had gotten stuck in the attic. He'd called the local animal shelter, and they sent someone over. Maybe it'll be them again. But what if it isn't? What if... Wait, no. Don't go there. Just focus on the present. He tried to calm down, telling himself it was probably nothing, but deep down, he couldn't shake the feeling that this time, it was different. He glanced around the room, half-expecting to see someone standing there, watching him. But he was alone."

Now, when everyone is talking about it, it feels like my contributions are being ignored.
