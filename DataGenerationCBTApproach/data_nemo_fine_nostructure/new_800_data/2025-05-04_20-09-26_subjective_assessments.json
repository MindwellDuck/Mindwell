It seemed suspicious, especially since his wife had been working late those evenings. Now, as he stood at the kitchen sink washing dishes, he felt a growing sense of unease. The air seemed thicker, and he found himself glancing nervously toward the street, wondering if anyone was listening to their conversation. He tried to focus on the task at hand, but his imagination ran wild with possibilities—could this be a stalker? Was he overreacting? His wife, who'd just finished cooking dinner, walked into the kitchen, looking calm and collected. \"What's wrong?\" she asked, eyeing him curiously. He hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. Maybe he was just tired and stressed about work. But the image of that sedan lingered, refusing to let go. She seemed oblivious to his anxiety, asking about her day instead of noticing his tension. I don't know why, but my husband is really worried today. He keeps looking at the same black car parked by our house, and he’s convinced it has people inside.

So basically, he made me miss my mom's special day because he couldn't be bothered with proper staffing. What kind of manager does that?

I still have to deal with this situation. I'm going to lose my cool and yell at them, but I can't let them see how upset I am. Instead, I'll just sit here and stew about it. Maybe if I wait long enough, they'll magically disappear, and I'll be able to get home on time. This is all their fault, and I'm not going to let anyone else down today, especially not my mom.

After all, if anyone knows how much love and dedication goes into caring for a dog, it's me. I've spent years perfecting my parenting skills, and I know I'd be an excellent dog parent. Who wouldn't want a child who loves dogs as much as I do? This little girl reminds me so much of Max, and I hope her life turns out as smoothly as ours did.
