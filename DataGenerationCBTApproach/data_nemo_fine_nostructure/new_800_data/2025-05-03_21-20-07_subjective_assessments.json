He pulled out an old photo album from the shelf, its spine worn and pages yellowed with age. As he flipped through images of their children growing up, he found himself in each one - a constant, reliable presence until now. The house felt too big, too quiet. His reflection in the dark window stared back at him, lines etched deeper around his eyes than before. He was still here, but everything else seemed to have moved on without him.",

Or, he is just being dramatic, focusing too much on what's missing, rather than what remains. There can be no other way. I am either all alone, forever separated from my family by distance, or I am nothing more than a burden, holding everyone back. It has to be one or the other; there are no shades of gray. If he is alone, it means he has failed as a husband and father. But if he feels like a burden, then he must be weak, unworthy of love. There is no middle ground; emotions cannot be complex. I am either fully alive, or I am dead inside. The truth lies in these extremes, leaving no room for anything in between. Only all or nothing."

He knew we were all going through a tough time, and maybe he wanted us to laugh and forget about our struggles for a moment. But why would he go ahead and share something like that in front of everyone? He's such a good teacher because he understands how much we're struggling lately. And I know he didn't mean to cause any discomfort, but I still can't help feeling embarrassed. Maybe he wasn't thinking clearly, and it just slipped out of his mind. It's not like he usually does things like this, especially not in class. Even if it was an accident, shouldn't he have been more careful before sharing it? Now I'm just worried that he'll bring up other embarrassing moments from the past. What if he brings up the time he accidentally walked into the wrong classroom and showed up wearing his pajamas?"

He can't shake off the feeling of being watched. Every sound, every movement, becomes ominous. He tries to reassure himself, but the voice in his head won't let go, labeling him as a coward for even thinking about such possibilities. \"You're just a scared old man,\" it says. \"Too old to handle reality.\" He starts to feel like he's losing control. What if he really does have dementia? Is he going crazy? This realization leads to another thought, \"Am I doing this to myself? Am I just making it happen because I'm too afraid to face reality?\" He becomes more agitated, imagining scenarios where he's trapped in a never-ending nightmare. \"Maybe I'm the one who did it. Maybe I'm the one haunting my own house.\" His mind races, jumping between different conclusions, each one more terrifying than the last. He's convinced that something sinister is at play, and he's just a victim. He starts to wonder if he'll ever be able to escape this cycle of paranoia.
