It's as if she's drowning in the sea of broken dreams, each drop representing another forgotten meal, another missed opportunity. Her gaze falls upon the nearly full trash can beside the counter. How could anyone expect her to clean up after them? They don't have to worry about feeding their family tomorrow. Those people, with their perfect meals, their happy children, and their loving partners, all while leaving their dirty work for someone else, are the ones truly blessed. Meanwhile, here she is, alone in her chaos, forced to carry the weight of everyone's expectations. In her heart, she wonders if there's anything wrong with her. Is it possible that she's the problem? Maybe if she was more organized, more patient, more willing to sacrifice some of her time, then things would be different. But what does it say about her when even her family doesn't bother to help?

It wouldn't happen to anyone else, would it? I hope she didn't go out with him, but I know that wouldn't be possible.

His wife seemed happy enough when they were alone, but now, seeing her with someone else, he realized how much he had taken for granted. This wasn't the first time he'd caught glimpses of her past life—photos from her high school days, college albums, even the Facebook profiles of former classmates. It all hinted at stories untold, adventures never shared, and relationships long forgotten. Her smile seemed to hold secrets, whispers of memories hidden behind her eyes, as if each glance held a world beyond what they knew. And yet, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of losing something precious—a connection forged over years of quiet moments, late-night talks, and laughter-filled days. Every time he looked at her, he wondered if she ever thought about him too, if she ever missed the comfort of his presence. He began to see the lines around her eyes, the grey hair creeping into her scalp, as signs of aging, reminders that time was slipping away from both of them. She stood so tall then, strong and confident, but now...now, he saw only the frailty of age, the weight of years, and the emptiness of a life once full of promise. In those photos, she was young again, vibrant, and full"
