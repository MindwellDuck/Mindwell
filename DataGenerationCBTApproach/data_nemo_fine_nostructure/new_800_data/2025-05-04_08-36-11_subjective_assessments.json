The rain outside must have been heavy because one drop hit the glass so hard. I wish there was someone here with me, like Jamie. I miss him so much. It feels like the world is moving on without him, but we're still stuck in this moment. He'd always say things like \"you're not alone\" during tough times, but it's hard to remember that right now. My heart still hurts thinking about what could've been—how our lives would be different if he were still here. Every time I look at that picture, it just makes me cry harder. I don't know how to go on without him, and no matter how many times I tell myself \"it'll get better,\" I can't shake off these feelings. They keep haunting me, especially since I'm all alone again. I wish I could turn back time, make everything okay, and bring him back to life. But deep down, I know that's impossible. Still, I hold onto hope, clinging to memories of happier times, even though they seem distant now. I wonder if she ever stops grieving, or if it's something she'll carry forever."

His car, an old blue sedan, groans as it struggles to life, the engine's coughs mirroring his own weariness.\n\nAs he pulls out of the lot, the rain begins to fall, not heavily but steadily, each drop a reminder of another day gone by in this endless routine. He turns on the radio, but the cheerful song only amplifies his sense of emptiness. His eyes flick to the passenger seat, where a few weeks ago there was still a half-empty bottle of wine, now replaced by an empty void.\n\nHe drives home through familiar streets, each turn bringing him closer to another night alone in his small apartment. The traffic lights seem to mock him tonight, turning red just as he approaches, prolonging his journey like life itself seems to be doing. He thinks about the promotion that went to someone else, the relationships that faded into nothingness, and the dreams that have turned to dust.\n\nAs he finally reaches his building, he looks up at the window of his apartment on the third floor. It's dark, no light welcoming him home. He turns off the engine, takes a deep breath, and steps out into the rain, feeling the hopelessness wash over him like the cold water on his skin.
