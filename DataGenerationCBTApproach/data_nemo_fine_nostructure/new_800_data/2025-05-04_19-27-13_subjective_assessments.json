He hadn't heard from her since their argument last night. The house felt emptier than usual when he left for work this morning, her side of the bed still untouched. He tried to focus on his work, but every time he blinked, he saw her face, her eyes filled with anger and disappointment. His inbox pinged, a new message from their project manager. He opened it, scanning the content quickly before noticing the subject line: \"Project Timeline Revised - New Deadline Tomorrow.\" He felt a pang of misery, his stomach churning as he realized this meant another late night at work, another empty bed at home.",

Last night's fight had been a wake-up call, but nothing had changed. She'd called him lazy, and he couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was right. Every task he did seemed like a chore, every deadline looming like a sword of Damocles waiting to fall upon his head. His inbox was a mess, emails piling up, all reminders of how much he’d messed up. And now, this email from their project manager? A final nail in his coffin. They wanted more work done by tomorrow, and he knew he wouldn’t be able to deliver. This was just another day of living in the shadows of his failures, never truly making progress. The thought sent him spiraling into despair, and he wondered if there was even a point anymore."

I'm just a one-trick pony, stuck in the same rut, failing every time. It's no wonder everyone wants out of this school - they're all better off than me. Why bother trying when you know you'll fail? I've seen so many other teachers leave, each one saying the same thing about how they couldn't handle the workload or the kids being too much. So why would anyone stay? I guess some people are just meant for more. Maybe there's something wrong with me that makes me incapable of doing anything else but teaching. It doesn't help that I'm already struggling to keep up with my own classes. But hey, at least I tried. Now I get to go home, pack up my things, and start looking for a new job. Or maybe I won't even try. Who knows? Some people say that once you hit rock bottom, you either climb back up or fall further. Either way, it looks like my journey is over."

As she was cleaning up, she stumbled upon an old newspaper clipping from years ago. Her name was there, right next to his, with a headline that read, \"Local Detective Solves Mysterious Case.\" But what really caught her attention was the date - it was the same day they had met, the day he'd walked into her life and told her he'd cracked the case. The news story mentioned nothing about him helping her; it was as if he'd done it all by himself. He seemed so confident when he talked about solving the case, but now she realized how much she'd been led to believe. The article didn't even mention her at all. When she asked him about it later, he brushed it off, saying it must have gotten lost in the archives. But she couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn’t just a one-time mistake, that every time she worked with him, things were somehow rigged against her. He always seemed to know exactly where to look for clues, never seeming to need help. And now, she wondered if she’d ever actually contributed anything meaningful to the investigation. Maybe she was just along for the ride all along. She tried to keep it together, but it was hard not to feel like she was being pushed aside again. He said it was just an oversight, but deep down, she felt like she was starting to see a pattern."

As he goes about his work, he catches glimpses of people who seem to have it all together – happy couples, children laughing and playing, friends chatting and smiling. But for him, life feels like a series of disappointments, each one leading him further down a path from which there's no return. Even the smallest things take on a darker tone – the sound of a child crying, a sudden rainstorm, or even the smell of something pleasant becomes tainted by his mood. What was supposed to be a simple trip to the grocery store turned into a nightmare when he saw her. She walked in, looking beautiful, her eyes sparkling with a radiance that seemed almost otherworldly. In that moment, he felt like he'd been punched in the gut, everything inside him screaming that this was a sign – a warning that he couldn’t ignore. But deep down, he knew better. This wasn't some sort of cosmic message; it was just a coincidence. Yet, somehow, it felt like more than that. It felt like the universe was trying to tell me something – that my luck was running out,"
