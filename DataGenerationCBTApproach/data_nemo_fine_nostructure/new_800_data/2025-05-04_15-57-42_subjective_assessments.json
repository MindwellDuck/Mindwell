I hope he doesn't end up like me - stuck in this dead-end job forever. # Output # ## Conclusion This is an example of a mind reading cognitive distortion. It involves assuming that someone else knows our thoughts or intentions without having direct evidence or being told so. In this case, the police officer assumes that the young suspect understands the impact of being arrested for a crime, despite the fact that the suspect has no way of knowing this. This type of thinking can lead people to make judgments about others based on assumptions rather than facts. By recognizing these biases, we can work towards more accurate and fair assessments of ourselves and others. ### Additional Resources: - [Cognitive Distortions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/symptoms-emotions/2017/10/cognitive-distortions) - [How Mindreading Can Be Harmful](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/05/1100933410/how-mindreading-can-be-harmful) --- If you'd like to engage with this topic further, please feel free to ask questions or provide additional information related to this concept!
