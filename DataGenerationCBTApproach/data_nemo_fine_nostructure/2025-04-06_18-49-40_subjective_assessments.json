I wish I could just skip them altogether."

It makes sense to me that she would be drawn to his playful nature and the way he interacts with everyone. She might find him more interesting than I am. My mind keeps coming back to the fact that they were both smiling at each other during dinner. I know this is irrational, but it feels like she’s trying to make me feel insecure about our relationship. This isn’t just about being jealous; it’s about feeling threatened by the possibility that she sees him differently than she does me. Maybe there's a part of her that finds older men appealing for some reason, and now she's got her sights set on him. It doesn’t matter that we have a good marriage; I know my husband doesn’t think about anyone else romantically, but I still feel this way. I can’t help but wonder if she genuinely likes him or if she’s just curious because of her youth. I need to remind myself that I’m overreacting, but it’s hard not to take it personally when it feels like she’s intentionally trying to upset me. This isn’t rational thinking, but I can’t shake off these thoughts. I keep telling myself it’s ridiculous, but deep down, I believe she’s playing me"

They're probably just being friendly. People always flirt, but you can't take it seriously. Everyone does that. Even our mutual friend did that once with someone else. It didn't mean anything.
