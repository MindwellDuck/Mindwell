They probably think you're mortified by what just came out of your mouth, but deep down, they’re secretly entertained by the whole situation. You might want to try apologizing to them; I bet they wouldn’t mind hearing that. It would really help ease the tension. I hope you can handle it better next time, but I’m pretty sure these people won't stop laughing anytime soon."

She was alone in the bullpen, updating case files, when she heard it - a faint, rhythmic tapping from outside her office window. Her heart pounded as she slowly reached for her flashlight, fingers trembling slightly. The tapping grew louder, more insistent. She couldn't see anything through the blinds, but she felt it, a cold dread washing over her. She gripped her radio, ready to call for backup, when suddenly, the station's lights flickered off.

Why did they get to enjoy each other's company, while he was stuck alone again? It wasn't fair. He couldn't help but wonder if there was more to life than what he saw—perhaps these people were meant for greatness, while he remained stuck in mediocrity. But no matter how hard he tried, the truth refused to settle. All he could see was himself, left behind by the world. What did they have that he didn't? Maybe it wasn't just chance; maybe they had something he couldn't even imagine yet. Or perhaps he was simply destined to miss out, to remain forever on the outside looking in. Either way, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was meant for nothing. It all seemed so unfair, and he wondered if anything good ever came his way anyway."

He hadn't realized he'd kept this note, hadn't remembered discussing the birthday plan with Sarah.

Guilt crept into every moment, making each passing day feel like an eternity. He felt lost, unable to focus on anything else except these painful reminders. Each time he thought about celebrating these events, memories of Sarah flooded back, leaving him heartbroken all over again. Every day seemed to stretch into weeks, filled with regret and sorrow. His life felt frozen in time, stuck between the present and a past that could never be recaptured. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was running out of time, that every day brought him closer to forgetting everything she meant to him. Even the simple act of cleaning up became overwhelming, as if he needed to erase every memory, including those of happy times. In the end, it wasn’t just the birthday that made him sad—it was the entire life they had planned together, now forever lost."
