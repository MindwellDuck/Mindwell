Every morning, every week, every month—she'd get up late, rush through breakfast, and be gone before I could even finish my coffee. It's always the same, never changing, a constant cycle of disappointment. This isn't about me; it's about her. She doesn't care enough to adjust her schedule, leaving me to clean up after her inattention. And now, with the notebook still intact, it feels like she's playing some twisted game of cat-and-mouse, daring me to try and fix things when I know it won't work. She'll just keep doing what she's always done, and I'll be stuck here, watching the world go by through the window while she's off living her life. Why bother trying? It's not about us anymore; it's about her, her path, and her choices. If she wants to waste time sleeping in and then rushing around, she can. I'm tired of being the one who always has to adjust, always has to cover for her lack of responsibility. What's the point? Maybe we're just meant to be this way, forever stuck in our routine, waiting for her to wake up, wondering if today will be different. But deep down, I know it won't. This is just how it is now."

He hadn't realized it was so late; the hospital's fluorescent lights had tricked him into believing it was still early afternoon. His pager remained silent for once, no emergencies to attend to, just the quiet reminder that he was alone again tonight.\n\nHe hung his white coat on the hook by the door, noticing the faint stain of iodine that had somehow evaded his notice earlier. He sighed, feeling a familiar heaviness in his chest. Another long day, another lonely night. The emptiness of his apartment seemed to echo the emptiness inside him.\n\nIn the bathroom, he splashed cold water on his face, staring at his reflection in the mirror. The dark circles under his eyes seemed deeper than usual, the lines around his mouth more pronounced. He thought about calling someone - anyone - but who would understand? His colleagues were always too busy, and his friends... well, they had their own lives now.\n\nHe turned away from the mirror, unable to bear the sight of himself any longer. As he reached for a towel, his hand brushed against something tucked into the corner of the counter. It was a small, framed photograph of him and his sister, taken on her wedding day. They were both smiling, their arms wrapped around each other's waists.\n\nTears welled up in his eyes as he traced the edge of the frame. She had been his rock, his confidante, his cheerleader. But she was gone now, taken by a disease that even his medical expertise couldn't combat. He missed her laughter, her warmth, her unwavering belief in him.\n\nHe carried the photograph to his bed, clutching it tightly as he lay down. The room felt colder without her here, quieter. He closed his eyes, letting the tears slide down his cheeks unchecked. Another night alone with nothing but memories and sorrow for company.",

His thoughts drifted to her final days, how she'd fought so hard, holding on to life until the very end. He remembered the pain in her eyes when she told him she couldn't fight anymore, the desperation in her voice as she begged him to stay. He felt guilty for staying, for not being there enough, for not doing everything he could to help. Her last words haunted him: \"You're my only hope, please don’t let me go.\" He opened his eyes, the dim light of the bedside lamp casting shadows on the walls. The photograph on his nightstand seemed to stare back at him, its smile frozen in time. He reached out, touching the glass, and for a fleeting moment, he felt close to her again. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he whispered, “Please come back,” but deep down, he knew it was futile. She wasn’t coming back, and he was left to face another night alone."

Even the smallest tasks became an art form with him. When he cooked, everything was a dance – chopping, stirring, tasting, and adjusting all blended into one harmonious motion. It was as if every ingredient was waiting for him, eager to be transformed by his skilled touch. Now, sitting alone in her kitchen, she couldn't help but feel inadequate. The tears fell harder, blurring the lines between the onion's sharp edges and her own heartache. How could someone else make food so beautiful, while she struggled to keep herself nourished? What would happen if she weren't here anymore? Would he still remember the way she used to stir the pot, her fingers dancing across the surface like a conductor leading an orchestra?
