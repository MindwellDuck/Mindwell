But no, they're probably with someone else already. It makes sense that they chose him over me - he's got everything I don't. Maybe if I tried harder, I could catch their attention too, but I know it won't happen. He's already taken, and now I'm stuck here alone, wasting away into nothingness."

The decision was made, and he knew he'd be lucky if he got another column. His mind kept wandering back to the young intern who had been assigned to replace him, how she must feel knowing her work would be published under his name. She probably didn't know how much effort went into every word, how hard he worked to make each piece perfect. But she wouldn't care about any of that. She'd just see it as another notch on her belt, another story to add to her portfolio. And he'd be nothing more than a footnote in her future career. He wondered if he could even get a job after this. Would anyone hire someone who had lost his edge?"

He took something that belonged to her, and now everyone sees him as the genius behind it, while she feels like a fool. She can't shake off this sense of injustice, which makes her feel powerless and angry at the same time. Even deleting the email doesn't help; it just reminds her of what could've been hers. This isn't over yet; she'll keep fighting until things are right. Maybe then she'll finally feel closure and be able to move forward.

Still, she won't give up. There has to be some way out of this mess, and she's determined to find it."
