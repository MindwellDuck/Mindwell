The pressure to meet deadlines is already high, so when I saw that roach, it was like a punch to the gut. It's just another reminder that things are falling apart here. I wish I could get out of here and focus on something else, but I can't afford to take time off right now. This whole thing feels unfair. First, there's the stress of working long hours, then the constant worry about making mistakes, and finally, dealing with pests like this. I feel like everything is piling up against me, and no matter what I do, it never ends. I'm just trying to survive each day, but it doesn't seem fair. Why does this always happen to me? This isn’t the first time I’ve had to deal with problems like this. I've been struggling since starting, and every new issue adds to my frustration. I try to stay positive, but it’s hard when everything keeps going wrong. Just thinking about all these challenges makes me want to quit. I wish I could leave this job and find something easier, but I need the money. Still, I feel like I’m being pushed too far, and this roach incident just proves it. I deserve better than this stressful life, but I guess I'll keep fighting for now. Hopefully, tomorrow will be"

The smell of it immediately transported her to memories of him cooking for her, the way he would carefully chop vegetables so they were just the right size for his signature dishes. It wasn’t just the scent; every detail about that jacket seemed to hold a memory—like how the buttons had been worn smooth by years of use, or how the fabric felt slightly stiff from being washed too many times. It made me realize how much I’ve lost since we parted ways. Every little thing about my life feels dull compared to what I had then. Even now, I try to cook for myself, but nothing tastes as good as what he used to make. And these days, all I have is this old jacket as a reminder of what I once had, and how far I've fallen since we broke up."

It doesn't belong with all these other things. It's not like it's a happy memory or anything. Just...a picture. And yeah, I guess it's nice that my mom kept it, but what's the point of looking at it again? It's not like it'll bring us together or anything. I'm still upset about what happened.
