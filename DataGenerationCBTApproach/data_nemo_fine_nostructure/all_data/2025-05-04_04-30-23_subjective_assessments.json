But today feels different; the sunlight streaming through the window makes everything feel more real. It's as if he can't escape the memories even when he thinks he has. The way the fabric catches the light reminds him of how she used to move gracefully in front of the mirror before we—before things ended. She never left a note, just disappeared one day like a ghost. At first, he thought maybe she was running away from something, but then reality hit hard. He tried calling, texting, anything, but she stopped answering. And now, here he is, five years later, wondering why he didn’t see it coming. Wasn’t this supposed to be the best time of our lives? We were going to start a family, build a life together...but now... As he stands there, frozen, the past rushes back. Every moment they shared comes flooding back—the laughter, the tears, the promises we made, the dreams we had. He remembers how excited she was about starting a new job, how proud she was of herself for finally pursuing a career she loved. She always knew exactly what she wanted, and he admired her for it. But now, standing in the darkness of his apartment, surrounded by the remnants of a love that once felt so strong, he can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. Maybe someday, somehow, he’ll understand."

Those two have no idea what's coming. How can they be so happy? They'll find out soon enough. They're probably naive about life, blinded by youth and infatuation. I've lived through everything; I know how hard it is to keep going after losing your partner. They don't understand the depth of suffering they'll face. They think they're ready, but they won't be prepared for the future. I feel sorry for them, but they don’t deserve it. Their happiness will turn to despair, and they’ll regret every moment they spent with her. I wish they wouldn’t move there; they shouldn’t have found each other. They’re ruining everything for themselves and others. It’s unfair that they get to experience all the good while others suffer. Why does it always happen to someone else? Life isn’t fair at all. My wife deserved better than to die so early, and these people are lucky to have been given a chance at happiness. But I doubt it will last long.

His body language screamed defensiveness, as if preparing for a fight he hadn't even started. His silence said it all: he knew what he'd done, and he was scared. As we listened, the weight of his actions grew heavier. We could see the pain behind his eyes, the desperation to shift blame somewhere else. It was clear he couldn't accept responsibility for what had happened. The evidence against him mounted, but he refused to acknowledge it, clinging to the hope that somehow, someway, things would work out. In the end, justice was served, but the damage had already been"
