It’s just that this is another reminder that I’m never going to find someone who truly appreciates me. I don’t even want to try anymore.\" - Rachel # Output End ## Feedback This response demonstrates an overgeneralization because it assumes that every situation where someone else gets invited will lead to feelings of jealousy and isolation in the future. The speaker has likely experienced some positive interactions or friendships in the past, yet they continue to believe that being excluded from all social gatherings is inevitable. This thinking reinforces a pessimistic outlook on life, causing further distress and self-doubt. By making broad statements about their social life (\"I'm always left out\"), Rachel creates unrealistic expectations for herself, which can hinder her ability to form meaningful connections with others. Instead of focusing on building genuine relationships, she dwells on perceived failures, perpetuating a cycle of negativity. This mindset may discourage her from engaging in new activities or seeking help, ultimately worsening her mental health. By acknowledging and addressing these distorted thought patterns, individuals can work towards creating more realistic and positive expectations for themselves. - [Samantha](https://www.reddit.com/user/Samantha_Mental_Health) <img src=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ei8g9j/mh_baby/\" title=\"MH Baby\" alt=\"MH Baby\"> [ /u/MH_Baby"
