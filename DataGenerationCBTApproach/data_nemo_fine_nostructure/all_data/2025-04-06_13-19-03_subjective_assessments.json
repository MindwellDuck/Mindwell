I feel bad for him because he doesn’t deserve to be treated like this. But honestly, if she had a problem with him, why did she even serve him? Did she think she could handle being around someone like him? I bet she was scared. I can understand why she would want to avoid situations like that. He definitely has some kind of reputation.

The pain still lingered, refusing to fade away. It haunted him, reminding him of what he had left behind—a life full of possibilities, dreams yet to be realized. She was more than just a name; she represented everything he wanted to achieve, everything he hoped to give her. Her smile was the light that guided him through the darkest moments, the reason why he pushed forward even when the road ahead seemed impossible. Without her, nothing made sense anymore. Life felt empty, hollow, and cold, devoid of purpose. Every day was another reminder of what he had lost—the joy, the laughter, the love. Memories of our late nights at the beach, of the way the sunlight danced across her hair, of the way her voice sounded when she sang, of how she’d laugh at my jokes—everything reminded him that it was over. That there was no turning back. And yet, he held onto those moments, cherishing each one because they were all he had left. It wasn’t easy.

Yet, I knew that time had moved on, and I needed to find peace. So, I took a deep breath and let go of those feelings, acknowledging that they would always be a part of me."
