It’s all my fault; I’m the one who chose this career, who has to leave her and the kids behind, who is always tired, never fully present. My exhaustion must be wearing on her patience, making her pull away, and now she sees me as an absent father.

My life has been nothing but rejection after rejection, every opportunity slipping through my fingers. Each failure leaves a scar, a reminder that no matter how hard I try, I am destined to fall short. I feel lost, alone, and forgotten. Every moment feels like a step backward, and yet, I hold on to hope, clinging to the thought that someday things will get better, that somehow, someway, I’ll find my place in this world.

There are countless instances where they've crossed paths, but he never acknowledges her presence. The way he moves away quickly, his avoidance of eye contact, and his complete silence make it clear he doesn't want anything to do with her.
