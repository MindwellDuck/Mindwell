This is exactly why we can't have nice things. He never lifts a finger to help around here, just leaves everything for me to deal with. It's like he thinks he's some kind of scientist who doesn't need to worry about domestic duties. Newsflash: science isn't all it takes to live a happy life! If he really cared, he'd put more effort into helping out. But no, he's too busy playing God in that stupid lab of his, forgetting that there are real people living in this house who deserve better. The fact that he even has time for that is proof that he's not committed to our relationship - maybe he's just waiting for me to get tired of him and leave? I don't know how much longer I can take this. Maybe I'll just start cooking dinner before he gets back from work, so when he walks through the door, he'll see what he made instead of the mess he left behind. That way, he won't be able to deny it anymore. Time will tell if this plan works. We'll see if he finally decides to step up and show some responsibility around here."

They seemed friendly enough, but she still didn't trust them. As they began to set up cameras around her property, she started to feel anxious. One of the crew members asked if she would be okay with them filming inside, and she hesitated.

It's so unfair that she has to deal with this while he gets away scot-free. She recalls how many times he cheated on her, how many times he lied about his whereabouts, how many lies he told her until she discovered them all. Every time she thinks back, she feels like she's being pulled under by waves of resentment. The thought of having to write this ticket is just another reminder of everything that went wrong in their marriage. How can someone like him get away with it, while she's the one left to pick up the pieces? This isn't fair at all. He got off easy last time, and now he's doing it again. She shakes her head, trying to clear her thoughts, but the anger remains. She can't help but feel like she's losing control. This whole situation feels like a trap, designed to keep her trapped in the past. She knows she needs to stay focused, but it's hard when memories of their broken relationship keep flooding her mind. Every time she sees him, she feels like she's being pushed further down a path she doesn't want to be on. It's frustrating because she knows she shouldn't let him get inside her head, but it's hard to resist the urge to lash out when she feels like she's being treated unfairly. She takes a deep breath"

She wouldn't have left it lying around for so long; she must have put it away somewhere before she... before she died. He wondered if he could ever bring himself to get rid of it now. There were other sweaters in there, ones that she'd worn recently. But this one... This one felt different. Maybe he could try putting it on again, just to see what it looked like on him? Or maybe he should hang it up where she used to sit on the couch, where she'd always worn it. It seemed safer than touching it directly. He thought about how much he missed her, how much he wished things could go back to the way they were before. He realized that he couldn't change anything, that time kept moving forward regardless of his feelings. Yet, he still clung to the past, hoping against hope that somehow, someway, she might come back to him."

Is she just going through the motions because it feels like the right thing to do? If she was really waiting for me, wouldn't she be checking the phone for messages or looking out the window? No, no, this is all just a big mistake. She doesn't care about me; she's just doing this because she thinks it's the right thing to do. I'll never forgive myself for leaving her behind."

He can't possibly understand what it means for someone to pour their heart and soul into something only to have it co-opted without credit. It's an egregious breach of trust, especially since she had shared her ideas with him during brainstorming sessions, trusting his judgment—only to see him turn around and claim ownership. The fact that he didn’t acknowledge her input makes it worse—the sheer audacity of it all feels like a slap in the face. This isn't just about her own professional reputation; it’s about the integrity of our entire publication. She can’t help but wonder how many other times he might be doing the same thing behind her back. Every time she sees him, she feels a growing sense of unease, as if she’s constantly waiting for the next blow. The whole situation has left her feeling drained, anxious, and questioning her own abilities. It’s hard not to feel like she’s losing her grip on her sanity. She starts to question whether she can really keep going, wondering if the stress is taking its toll on her mental health.
