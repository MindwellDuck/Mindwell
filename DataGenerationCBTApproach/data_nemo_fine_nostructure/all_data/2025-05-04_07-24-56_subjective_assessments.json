His words are so condescending, it's almost as if he thinks he's better than me. The way he talks about my work is just ridiculous. I'm a respected artist, but I guess that doesn't matter when you're writing for publications where people don't care what they say. It feels like he's trying to make himself look good by tearing me down."

Later, she found an email from HR, cc'd to everyone, asking her to step into their office \"to discuss a sensitive matter.\" As she walked down the hall, she felt the weight of their stares, the heat rising in her cheeks. The HR rep handed her a printout - her latest project report, annotated with red ink, mocking her typos and factual errors. She'd spent hours on it, yet it looked like she'd barely skimmed it. A cold dread washed over her as she realized everyone had seen this. Her professional pride shattered into a thousand shards of shame.",

She knows how much I love her, so I know she wouldn't really go out behind my back like this. There has to be an explanation—she probably got lost on her walk home, or she had something important to take care of, but she promised to call me if anything came up. I hope she realizes how much I miss her already, and is getting ready to head back home now. This isn't the first time she's gone missing unexpectedly, but she always comes back with some kind of excuse. When she gets here, I'll ask her directly about the receipt, and she'll explain it all away. Maybe she's just tired today? She usually takes long walks at night, so maybe she ran into someone and forgot to text me right away. We can work this out; we're meant to be together. If she doesn't show up, I might start calling her phone again, hoping she hasn't forgotten about us. I need to give her space, though. She'll turn up eventually, and when she does, we'll move past this. This isn't a big deal after all—it's just one little slip-up. She's still"
