I feel like I need to call him right now to tell him about it, but what if he doesn’t care? Maybe he thinks it’s fine because he’s not here. But it’s not fine! This is insane. Every little thing is piling up on me, and I don’t know how much more I can handle before I lose it completely. If only I could go back to when things were simpler… When I didn’t have so many problems to deal with. Now, everything feels like it’s going downhill fast. I hate being married; it’s like I was wrong to think love would fix everything. Now, I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. I bet there are bugs in the carpet too. Or maybe the toilet? What if they’re already inside the walls? That would be perfect—living in a house infested with insects. At least then I wouldn’t have to worry about cleaning anymore.

Maybe I remember wrong because I haven’t been down here in years. This place feels so different at night. The shadows seem to move. Is that...is that the sound of footsteps? I can hear them up ahead. Or is that the wind? No, that’s too loud. I bet it’s just my imagination playing tricks on me. I need to go check out what’s going on. But which way? I don't even know where we are anymore.

I'm just going through the motions now, trying to find meaning in the emptiness. It's strange how something so simple can evoke such strong emotions. Yet, here I am, alone, with nothing but memories to keep me company. I miss him so much; it hurts every day. I wish I could turn back time, but life moves forward regardless. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still see him there, beside me. We were happy once, and I hold onto those moments tightly, cherishing them. They're all I have left now.

He wondered if anyone would notice it if he took it out, or if they'd just assume it was there from before she left. Maybe no one would care, but deep down, he wished someone would miss it as much as he did. Just thinking about it made him feel lonely again, like the world had moved on without him. He didn't want to disturb anything that belonged to her, but at the same time, he felt like crying over something as trivial as a shirt. It was all so surreal. Everything felt stuck in place, like life had paused right before death. Even now, when he looked around, he saw everything with new eyes—everything seemed different, as if reality itself had changed. He wasn't ready to accept this new normal yet; he wanted things back the way they were. But deep inside, he knew that things would never go back to how they were. There was nothing he could do but keep moving forward, even though every step felt heavy. He knew he needed to find ways to honor her memory, but it seemed impossible. He thought about going"
