A young employee behind him, chatting loudly on his phone about last night's party, stepped back suddenly, trampling the old man's foot. The man turned, teeth clenched, \"Watch where you're going, kid!\" The youth just laughed, turning away. The man felt a surge of rage boil up from his gut, fists trembling at his sides as he fought to maintain control until it was his turn at the counter.",

They'll trample anyone if they feel like it. It's always like that with arrogant jerks who think they're above everyone else. He has no respect for others whatsoever. I bet he's made fun of me before too, but I won't let him get under my skin. I've been in tough spots before and come out okay. If someone like him were to mess with me again, I'd be ready. I'm not going to let him win by getting all riled up over this. What really gets my blood boiling is that he doesn't even seem sorry. He's just laughing it off, like nothing happened. No remorse, no apology. He's probably a jerk who does this stuff all the time and thinks it's funny. This isn't the first time something like this has happened to me, and I know how he feels - he's probably used to being treated like dirt by people who don't give a shit about him. People like that shouldn't be allowed around kids because they'll teach them bad behavior. He needs to learn some manners. When I got older, I would have taken"

It made sense; she was always the bright one, and I could just imagine her smiling as she drew that picture for me. Maybe she'd even written something there that said \"Dad\" in tiny letters. That would explain why it looked so much like his own childhood drawings – she was trying to connect us somehow, show that we weren't so different after all. But what really hit him hard was how closely this little girl's life mirrored his own, full of hope and joy. She had no idea how lucky she was to have such wonderful parents, and yet here he was, sitting alone in his office, feeling lost and left behind. It was almost cruel that she'd draw something so beautiful, knowing exactly how much it meant to him, while he couldn't help but feel like a failure. But then again, maybe he was reading too much into it. Maybe Emma wasn't thinking anything at all. Maybe she just liked drawing happy families because she thought they were cute. After all, kids didn't think things through like adults did. They simply saw beauty in things and expressed themselves honestly. So perhaps, this wasn't about him at all – it was just a simple drawing, devoid of any real meaning beyond its aesthetic appeal."
