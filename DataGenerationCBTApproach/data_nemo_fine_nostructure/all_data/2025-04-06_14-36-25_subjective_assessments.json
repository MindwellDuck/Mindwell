This must be my own personal curse, always making mistakes at critical moments like these. Why else would I forget something so important? I can already imagine her disappointment when she sees the failed soufflés. She'll be disappointed in me, and I deserve it. Maybe I really am destined to fail at everything.

He hadn't seen it since... before. A wave of grief crashed over him as he held the clip tightly, inhaling deeply, searching for a hint of her scent.

He clutched the hair clip, trying to hold onto the past, to cling to anything that reminded him of her presence, even if it meant holding onto a single memory. The emptiness of their bedroom now felt oppressive, a constant reminder of what he'd lost. In that moment, everything seemed either incredibly tragic or completely meaningless—it was one or the other, with no middle ground."

She couldn’t shake the feeling that this was all her fault—the pain, the tears, and the endless questions of “what if?” What if she had been enough? What if she could have changed him? The thought sent a shiver through her, and for a moment, she wondered if the emptiness within her was truly as deep as it felt."

A waiter passed by, his tray laden with plates, and sniggered, \"Still struggling, huh, Chef?\" She froze, helplessness washing over her like the steam rising from the stove.

If anything, the tension between them was making her work harder. So, yeah, it didn't really matter if she messed up this one dish. And besides, I'm still getting used to cooking alone. It takes some time to get back into the swing of things. I can handle a little chaos in the kitchen. Besides, I've been doing better lately - my dishes are actually improving!

It seemed like more than just a random comment; it felt like they were targeting him personally. They were mocking his art, which is something his wife has always criticized. It's hard not to take it personally when you're already feeling sensitive about your work.

I’ve become a monster, and there’s no way out of this nightmare. I’m too far gone to turn back now. There’s no point in hoping for forgiveness; everyone will hate me forever.

I’m doomed to live with these thoughts for the rest of my days. I can’t imagine anything more"
