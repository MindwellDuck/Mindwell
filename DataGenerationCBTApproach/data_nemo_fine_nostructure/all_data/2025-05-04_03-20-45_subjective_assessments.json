After all, who hasn't been unfairly criticized by someone else at some point? Even if I've never had a situation where others have dismissed my ideas and made me feel inferior, shouldn't that just prove I'm too modest to stand up for myself? But what really bothers me is that this isn't even the first time something like this has happened recently. In fact, there was another incident last week when a colleague mentioned that they'd suggested a similar idea before our current project started. Now, I know she wasn't trying to say anything bad, but hearing her mention it still feels kind of like a slap in the face. It makes me wonder if anyone ever truly gets credit for their work these days."

She lay there, listening to her husband's steady breathing beside her, wishing she could match his tranquil rhythm.

The thought of him falling ill without her there to care for him sent a shiver down her spine. She sighed, adjusting her pillow, and decided to get up and make some warm milk.

She felt overwhelmed by these questions and the need to protect him. It wasn't just about caring for him; it was about ensuring he knew how much she loved him. Every step felt heavy, as if the floor beneath her feet was shifting under her weight. As she poured herself a glass of warm milk, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something terrible might happen while he slept. Even after finishing her drink, the anxiety lingered, refusing to let her relax. She sat back down on the couch, trying to focus on her breaths, but her mind continued to spiral, creating scenarios where everything went wrong. She closed her eyes, hoping to quiet her racing thoughts, but they wouldn’t stop. Eventually, exhaustion took over, and she fell asleep, lulled by the silence of the night. Her sleep was fitful, waking up several times throughout the night. When she finally did fall into a deep sleep, she dreamed of her husband getting very sick, which made her wake up in a panic. After another restless night, she left for work, worried about what the day might bring. At the hospital,"
