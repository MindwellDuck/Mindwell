It was as if the world had narrowed to just this moment, this group, and his own pain. The laughter seemed to mock him, each thrown can a deliberate jab, the words cutting deep. He thought about how many times he'd seen children laugh at her before she fell ill; now those same kids laughed at him. They were all against him, and he couldn't shake the feeling that this was personal. His eyes followed them, watching as one tossed an empty can into the pond, then looked up and saw him. He could see the boy’s gaze linger on him for a fraction of a second, and in that brief moment, he imagined what it would be like to have someone’s life flash before their eyes as easily as he did every day. He pictured himself lying in the hospital bed, unable to breathe, the last thing he heard the sound of children laughing outside. Then he was gone, leaving behind nothing but a memory of the time he cared for so many. The image haunted him, and now it haunted these boys too. Every glance made him feel like he was being held accountable for something he didn’t understand. He wondered if they knew that the laughter was not theirs alone, that there were countless others who’d suffered silently, their stories hidden from the world. But they didn’t need to know. All they needed to know is that nurses were for girls"

What was the point? The tree didn't mean anything. She quickly wiped away her tears, shook off the sadness, and continued walking."
