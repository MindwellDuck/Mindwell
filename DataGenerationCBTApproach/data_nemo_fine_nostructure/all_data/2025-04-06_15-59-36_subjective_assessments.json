It's cold out, and the old man doesn't look like he's been there long. He hesitates, then walks past, remembering the countless times he's chosen work over family, the regret washing over him like an icy wave.",

They never understood why he stayed so late, always choosing to be alone. This old man was probably someone just like him - forgotten by society for his selfish ways. His mind fills with memories of how it used to be, before everything fell apart. His parents were right – he would have been better off if he had focused on his career instead of being there for every family emergency. Now, he's alone, and no one cares. This isn’t the life he wanted; he’s just another forgotten soul, left behind by those who once cared. In the end, he'll realize that his decision to prioritize himself will always lead to loneliness. There won't be anyone left to mourn his passing, and he'll spend eternity in isolation, haunted by the ghosts of all the people he hurt along the way. # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output please # No output"

The weight of those mistakes feels crushing now, making every step forward seem like a leap into an unknown void. Every decision he makes feels like a gamble, as if the stakes are higher than ever before. The once-clear path ahead has become shrouded in doubt, leaving him questioning everything he holds dear."

He rolled out of bed, his muscles aching from the previous day's service at the restaurant. As he poured himself a glass of water in the dimly lit kitchen, he caught sight of two wine glasses drying on the rack - remnants of last night's failed attempt to recreate their shared tradition of unwinding after work.

Didn't she know how much he needed this moment of closeness? It was supposed to be our special time together, just us, sipping wine and watching the stars through the skylight above the bed. But now...now everything felt so different. Even the noise of the city outside seemed louder, mocking him with its indifference to his pain. She'd always been the one who made me feel safe, and now she was gone. Where could she have gone? And why did it matter? Maybe if she hadn't drunk so much, she wouldn't have fallen asleep so quickly. Maybe then we would still be here, holding each other tightly, the world outside fading into nothingness. But no, instead, we were alone again, the silence suffocating him. He thought about all the times she'd been distant lately, the days when she barely spoke to him. He tried to remember those moments, but they seemed so far away, lost in a haze of regret. How could he forget? They had been the best part of their relationship, the moments of quiet understanding between us. And yet, even those memories felt tainted now, like they belonged"

Why did he always have to be so lazy? And what about all those late nights spent drinking? Wasn't he supposed to be watching over his dad instead of enjoying every last drop of beer? As he rushed through the emergency room doors, he couldn't shake off the feeling that everything would've been okay if his father hadn't made such a big deal about needing help. If he'd just kept working like normal, none of this would've happened. Now he was going to have to miss a whole week of work, all because of his own lack of motivation and poor choices."
