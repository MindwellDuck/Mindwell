His hands trembled slightly while brewing his morning coffee, the way they had when they first fell in love sixty years ago. Today, it wasn't just her memory haunting him; a letter arrived from the university, informing him that his latest grant application had been rejected. Again. He felt shame creep up like a slow tide, drowning out the familiar sorrow. His peers were publishing groundbreaking research, while he was left behind, an old man clinging to faded glory.",

And those papers‚Äîeach one a subtle reminder of what I'll never have again. He's using them to make me feel guilty, to make me realize that I'm just an afterthought in his mind.
