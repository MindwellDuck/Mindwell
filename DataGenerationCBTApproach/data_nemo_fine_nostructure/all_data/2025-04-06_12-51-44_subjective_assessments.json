He picked it up, tracing the familiar lines, before placing it back exactly as it was. The silence felt heavier than usual today, her laughter echoing only in his memory. As he walked out, he noticed the sun setting over the parking lot, casting long shadows that seemed to reach for him, a reminder of the countless times they'd shared this view on their way home together.",

It was stupid of me to expect to find anything left, but I couldn’t help myself. Maybe I’m just a clingy loser who can’t move on. I guess it’s just another reminder that I’ll never be good enough for her, no matter how hard I try. Stupid, stupid me. Why did I have to come here? Now I’ve wasted my whole afternoon thinking about her. I should have just gone home, done some chores, and forgotten all about it. But no, I had to keep coming back, like some kind of morbid curiosity. Even now, I feel like an idiot for doing it. What am I going to tell her when I see her tomorrow? Nothing, because I'll just stand there, frozen like a fool, unable to speak. I'll probably make some silly comment, like \"Hey, nice day,\" and then run away before she notices. Yeah, that sounds perfect. Just great. Now I've ruined everything. Why did I ever think I could be happy with someone like her?"

But after some reflection, he started to feel like his life was just too chaotic for him to be able to make time for family. It wasn't that he had forgotten about them entirely, but it felt like they were always calling because something was wrong with them, which made him worry more than if he forgot to call them. This realization made him wonder how many times he'd been so caught up in work that he hadn't even bothered to check his voicemail or return their calls. The thought of being seen as unreliable hit him hard, making him wish he could just disappear into a hole somewhere. For the rest of the night, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of inadequacy. Every sound in his room seemed louder, every breath heavier. He felt like he was drowning in his own thoughts, unable to escape the weight of his mistakes. It took him hours to fall asleep, but when he finally did, he knew he would wake up to more regrets. In the end, he couldn't help but feel like he was living two different lives: one where he was there for his family and another where he was lost in his job, constantly running behind schedule. And no matter how hard he tried to ignore it, he couldn't help but see himself as someone who kept falling short, one missed call at a time. He wondered how long it would take before things got worse, until he"

Her love for literature was so palpable, and now it feels like an insurmountable barrier between us. Every time I look at her favorite book, I’m reminded of all the things we could never be – she had a life before me, one that shaped her into the woman I married, while mine is marked by emptiness. Even the way she kept that book—tucked away in a special spot—it’s almost as if she wanted to keep her past close, even after we became one. It makes me wonder what other parts of her life are hidden, like the pages of that book, waiting to be rediscovered. I feel like I’m just reading the surface level, missing out on everything beneath. I can't help but wonder what else she left behind, what stories those margins hold that I'll never understand. It's hard not to feel like I'm living in the shadow of her own story, one that she carefully curated long before we met."
