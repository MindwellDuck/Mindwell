        "Triggering Event": "Scenario:\n\nA 42-year-old female police officer, wearily removing her duty belt after an 18-hour shift, notices a crumpled note tucked into the doorframe of her apartment. It's from her ex-husband, asking if they can discuss selling their old house, now falling into disrepair. She feels a familiar pang of frustration; he'd been absent during their marriage, and now he expects her to drop everything to help him out. She throws the note onto the counter, muttering under her breath about his timing and lack of consideration for her exhausting schedule.",

He has no idea how hard it is for me to think about my life right now. I've already put in so much time at work—18 hours straight. If I let him sell this house, I'll be putting myself back into all those stressful situations again.\" She felt a surge of resentment toward him, wondering why he would even ask now. Didn't he know she was trying to rebuild her own life? The thought made her sigh heavily. She began to mentally replay their past arguments, thinking, \"If I had known he was going to ask this soon, maybe I could have prepared better.\" But deep down, she knew she wasn’t really preparing because she didn’t want to deal with him anymore. Still, the guilt lingered, making her feel trapped and stuck between her desire for independence and her need for financial security. She couldn't shake off the feeling that she was being pulled backward by these reminders, and she wondered if she was just letting her emotions control her decisions."

It was more than just a bad day; somehow, everything felt shifted, out of balance.

She thought back to the small incident from earlier—a brief misstep while preparing breakfast—and how it seemed to have triggered this strange unease. But even that didn’t quite feel right; memories felt distant, as if they belonged to someone else. This was more than just a simple mistake—it felt like a portent, a sign of things to come. In her mind, the words began to weave together in a dark tapestry: \"Disorientation,\" \"foggy,\" \"echoes,\" \"disorientation,\" \"distant.\" Each phrase repeated itself, weaving into a sinister pattern. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was building, growing inside her, waiting to spill over into chaos. And yet, despite the sense of foreboding, she stood there frozen, unable to move forward. Time seemed to stretch, stretching out moments into hours, until the air felt thick with anticipation. Something was coming, and she knew it would change everything."
