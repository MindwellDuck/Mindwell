Or maybe...he did, and he just forgot because he was too busy grieving and focusing on other things. I mean, I'm not saying he'd deliberately forget, but what if he had simply gotten distracted and forgotten about it? That would explain why it's been so long. And even if he did remember, he might not want me to see it right now, especially with everything else going on. I'm sure he didn't think about it when he went to pack up his stuff. He probably thought about more important things than dust-gathering mugs. Besides, I've been keeping his room tidy for months now, and I haven't seen anything else out of place.

It's hard to believe Clara would choose someone else when she still knows everything about you, even if she hasn't seen you in years. You remember how Tom used to share jokes with you back then, and Clara must be enjoying those same moments with him now. What if Clara doesn't know that you're watching her? Maybe she thinks you're invisible. It's easier to see her than you are right now, standing here alone. Clara's got everyone's attention, and I'm just a forgotten memory. Why bother talking to me when she's got the whole room laughing? It's probably just jealousy. There's no reason to think otherwise. Clara wouldn't actually want to hurt you.

It is as if the world has turned against him, leaving him to face the darkness alone. Every step he takes feels like a betrayal, every breath a reminder of what he has lost. The rain drums against his skin, echoing the beat of his heart, which pounds with the same rhythm as the raindrops. The loneliness is suffocating, crushing him beneath its weight, forcing him to confront the reality of his isolation. In this desolate landscape, he finds no comfort, only the haunting truth that he is no longer part of anything. The child’s shoe represents everything he has become—the forgotten, the left behind, and the broken. It is a constant reminder that he will never be whole again, that the pieces of his life are scattered across the streets, just like the fallen shoe, each one a painful memory, waiting to be rediscovered. And yet, even in the midst of such devastation, he continues to walk, driven by the futile hope that someday, somehow, things will change. But deep down, he knows the truth—that the emptiness within him will only grow stronger with each passing day, until he becomes nothing"

It feels like every conversation is somehow connected to her personal life, making her feel isolated and anxious. She wishes people would stop bringing it up and let her live a little.

It was all so fleeting, yet now, every moment felt like a final goodbye. He had always been there, holding her hand through life’s ups and downs, supporting her dreams, and being her rock. Now, he was gone, leaving behind a trail of unfinished conversations and unresolved emotions. Every day without him felt like an eternity, each passing moment stretching out like a heavy weight. She couldn’t shake off the feeling of losing herself along with him. They were two pieces of a puzzle, once complete, now broken into fragments. Even the simplest things brought back memories of him—sipping coffee together in the mornings, watching the sunset over the city skyline, sharing stories of our lives, laughing until our sides hurt, planning adventures for the future, and dreaming of a life free from pain. But those days are gone now. I miss everything about him, but most of all, I miss the idea of us. I miss the possibility of building a future together, of creating new memories, of learning how to live with this new reality. All I’m left with is a longing that feels impossible to overcome.
