They wouldn't understand; they were too young to remember what it was really like back then. This isn't over yet. She thinks she can take me down with her kid's help. Well, I'll show her. I'll make sure everyone knows what she did. She won't be able to hide it anymore. This is going to blow up in her face! Harry typed furiously, his mind racing with thoughts of revenge. He didn't care if he got fired; he'd rather die than give her what she wanted.

But now, sitting amidst the remnants of a meal that never got eaten, he felt like a failure, wondering if he'd done enough to keep her from leaving. In his mind, it wasn't just about the food; every detail—a dirty sock here, a book she hadn't finished there—seemed like a reminder of all he'd failed to be. Even the air felt thick, heavy with the weight of missed moments. Hadn't they talked about moving in together? Hadn't she said she wanted to spend more time with him? As the silence stretched around him, he couldn't help but wonder if he'd ever truly measured up. His thoughts drifted back to their early days, when everything felt fresh and new, when she was the only one who understood him fully. Now, he felt like an outsider looking in, unsure how much longer he could hold on. What had changed? Was it something he'd done, some mistake he'd made? Or was it simply her growing need for space?
