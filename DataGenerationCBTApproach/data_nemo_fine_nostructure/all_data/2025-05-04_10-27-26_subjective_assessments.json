It was a reminder that she needed to start dealing with his estate, but every time she thought about it, she felt overwhelmed by grief. Her mind kept wandering to the old photographs they used to share, and she couldn’t bear the idea of looking through his things anymore. Instead, she let herself get lost in memories of happier times, hoping those moments could fill the void left by his loss. But deep down, she knew she needed to confront reality—her life wasn’t going to change just because it reminded her of pain."

But then I remembered how I explained the situation to the other teachers, and they seemed skeptical too. So maybe this time it wasn't just my fault? As the teacher continued to berate me, I felt like I was going to lose control. It made sense to think that maybe he was right - I did feel frustrated when she wouldn't listen to reason. Maybe I wasn't fair to her? I couldn't help but wonder what other parents were thinking about me now. Were they all angry with me? Was everyone judging me unfairly? My anger turned to tears as I imagined what others might be saying about me behind my back. I felt so alone in this moment, like no one understood what I was going through. I tried to explain myself again, but he cut me off, telling me that I shouldn't have given her such a low grade. I knew that I had been clear about the grading policy, but maybe I wasn't strict enough? I didn't want to admit that maybe I messed up, so I got defensive. \"But I explained everything!\" I said, trying to hold back"

I began imagining all sorts of scenarios—what if those kids come back tonight? What if they bring their friends? My anxiety grew with each passing moment. I couldn't shake off the feeling that I needed to take action, but what if it makes things worse? What if the neighbors see me and think I'm crazy? As I stood there, frozen in uncertainty, I realized that my fear had turned into a desire for control. But what if this isn't just about protecting myself? What if it’s about proving that I’m not a witch? That I can handle whatever comes my way? Maybe this isn’t just about the graffiti; maybe it's about showing the world that I'm more than just a widow. I want to show them that I still have strength and power. But then again, what if I make things worse by confronting these kids? What if they start calling me names behind my back? Or what if they decide to leave town because of me? What if I look foolish trying to fight this alone? It's hard to know where to go from here.

Her mind wandered back to her own childhood, remembering the countless times she'd spent alone, never feeling loved or included. Now, looking at these old pictures, she realized how lucky her sister must have been. Their bond seemed stronger than ever, while hers had slowly unraveled over time. It wasn't fair to compare their experiences, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing in her life—a sense of belonging she could only see through her sister's eyes."
