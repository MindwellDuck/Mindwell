Today was no different until he noticed it: a small note tucked into the pages of \"A Brief History of Time,\" her favorite book. It was a recipe for her famous apple pie, written in her neat, slanted handwriting. He felt a pang in his chest as he read the simple instructions, remembering how she used to hum while she baked, leaving the kitchen warm and fragrant. The regret tasted bitter on his tongue, like unsweetened tea.",

Would our lives be so vastly different now? Perhaps they wouldn’t have needed to move out of the house. Maybe we could’ve found a way to make things work. Or maybe she just needed space, and I wouldn't have known it then. But now, in this moment, all I can think about is what might have been, and my mind keeps wandering back to those moments when we were happy together. I remember how she'd smile at me, how our fingers would touch as we walked side by side. Her laughter still echoes in my head, a bittersweet reminder of what’s lost. Sometimes, late at night, I find myself thinking about how much better things could have been, how we might have built a life filled with love and warmth, just like her mom’s home. Now, everything feels hollow, like an empty room where memories once lingered. I miss her, but I also feel this sense of longing for something more—something that never was. Yet, even in sadness, there's a part of me that holds onto hope. Maybe someday, somehow, we'll find each other again. Until then, I’m left to ponder the what-ifs, wondering if things could ever go back to being like they were before."

She felt like she was somehow tainted by this incident, as if it revealed something about her inner self. She wondered if this was what people saw when they looked at her - someone who would pick up anything dirty, no matter how small. This thought process led her to feel guilty and ashamed, as if she had somehow lost control over herself, revealing a darker side that she didn't want others to see. It wasn't just the apple; it felt like she'd been exposing her true nature all along, like the rotten fruit was a window into her soul. The more she thought about it, the more she believed that she was indeed disgusting, not just because of the apple but because she had become one with it, embodying both its filth and decay. This realization made her feel worse, as if she was now trapped in this state forever, unable to escape the stigma attached to her."

The more he thinks about it, the more he becomes convinced that he'll never hear from her again. Maybe she already forgot about him? She probably doesn't even remember him. That's why she didn't respond to his messages. If only he had been more careful, this wouldn't be happening. Now everything is ruined. Why did he delete the text? He was just trying to hide how desperate he felt. Now he has nothing left but regret. He can't stop thinking about these texts, and every time he tries to move on, he gets pulled back into the same cycle of anxiety. Every second counts, and he knows he needs to act fast. But what if there's something else going on that he doesn't know about? What if she's dealing with something serious right now? If only he could see inside her mind, he'd understand that she wasn't ignoring him. She must have important things on her mind, and this is just a minor distraction.
