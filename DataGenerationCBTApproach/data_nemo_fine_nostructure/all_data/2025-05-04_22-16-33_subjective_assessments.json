I wonder if she thinks she'll ever see him again, or if she just wants to talk to him one last time. Maybe she's hoping he'll say something to make her feel better. But I don't think he'd do that; he never did. He probably knows how much it hurts me to see him now. If only he knew how much I still loved him. But no, I'm not going to let him get inside my head again. I need to focus on my work. I have deadlines to meet, after all. And I can't let myself fall for the same old tricks again. No, this is different. This time, I won't give in. I've learned my lesson. I will not let him come back into my life. Not even as a friend. Still, she might think differently. Maybe she thinks he really cares about her now, maybe she believes he wants to stay friends, but deep down, she's scared he'll leave her too. She might think I'm being selfish by not talking to him, or worse, that I hate her for being with him. But I don't want to hear her thoughts right now. I need to concentrate on my job. There's so much at stake, and I can't afford to let anything distract me. Still, I can't help but notice how he smiles when he talks to her,"

But today...today seemed different. Her smile felt forced, her laughter strained. He couldn't help but think about what might be bothering her, wondering if something was really wrong. Maybe there was more to her silence than just being tired? He pushed those thoughts aside, telling himself he didn't need to pry into her business, especially when he wasn't exactly open himself. Still, the nagging feeling lingered, making him wonder if he was missing something—something important."

Well, I'm pretty sure she was planning some kind of revenge against our family by hiding her favorite brush and then waiting for us to find it. I mean, if anyone had been watching her, they would have seen her doing it before she died. She probably wanted to leave a message saying \"you'll never see me again\" or something along those lines. But honestly, I don't think we can really trust what she says anymore because she has already said some pretty weird stuff in the past. We need to get rid of all of her belongings and maybe even lock up the house until someone else comes to live here. This whole thing feels like she's playing some kind of game with us, and I'm not going to play anymore. I guess we should just move out permanently."

Why does she get to walk away so easily? Doesn't she remember all the times I took care of her when she was sick? Or how about the nights we spent cuddling on the couch after work? She must be comparing herself to someone else who's somehow more deserving of love. Meanwhile, I'm over here struggling to keep up with my own needs, let alone hers. This isn't fair. Everyone has it worse than me, but no one ever gives me credit for being such a great partner. Why would anyone choose him over me? This is ridiculous. I deserve better than someone who throws away our relationship like it means nothing. He must think he's so special because he's always been so busy, but what about the countless late-night shifts I put in to support him? Does he even appreciate all those hours I worked together? No wonder she left – she deserves someone way better than me. But why did she leave in the first place? Did she find someone else? The thought makes my stomach turn. Maybe I'm just not good enough, and I'll never be able to change that. Why does everyone else have it easier than me? I feel like"
