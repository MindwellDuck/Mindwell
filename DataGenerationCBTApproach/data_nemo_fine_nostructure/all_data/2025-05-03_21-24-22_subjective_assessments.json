I know they were joking, but I don't want to hear it. It's embarrassing how insecure I am when I see them together. This isn't helping me be more confident in our relationship; it's making things worse. I'll just ignore it and pretend nothing happened. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go grade some papers.

If I ever got sick, I'd be so grateful if I could spend the rest of my days with her. She brought out the best in me. We were perfect together, and now everything feels off. I miss our talks about life, our silly jokes, and even our arguments. When we fought, she would always make me feel better with her kind words and hugs. Now, I wish she was here to help me through this tough time. I know I shouldn’t be crying over something as simple as a chair, but it’s just hard to accept that she’s really gone.

They'd tried to move forward, to build a new life, but some days felt like they were just going through the motions. Still, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off about their quiet existence. It was almost as if they’d lost their way, and no amount of positivity could fill the void left by their daughter’s passing. But then there was the dream. She couldn’t get it out of her head – a vivid image of a young girl playing outside, laughing and free, surrounded by tall trees and sunshine. It was beautiful, full of joy, and yet, somehow, it felt like a warning. A sign that things weren’t meant to be? That we’re just pretending to live our lives until the inevitable happens? She pushed the thoughts aside, telling herself it was just her imagination running wild. But the dream lingered, haunting her. What if it wasn’t just a dream? What if it was something more"

They stood side by side, both wearing baseball caps and holding fishing rods. One picture showed them standing on the lake shore, arms around each other, looking happy. Another one was taken at a campsite, where they sat on a blanket, laughing and pointing at something in the distance. \"I wonder what happened to him,\" he thought aloud, still flipping through the photos.
