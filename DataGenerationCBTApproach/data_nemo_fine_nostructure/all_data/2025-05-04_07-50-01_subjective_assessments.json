She looked so frustrated, like she might burst into tears at any moment. Her whole demeanor screamed “I’m overwhelmed!” - it was almost too much for me to bear. Why had she chosen to work here? Didn’t she know how stressful it must be to deal with such an outdated system every single day? It’s really no wonder she’s constantly late; working at a place where technology keeps failing is exhausting. And don’t even get me started on the way the manager has been pushing her to meet impossible sales targets. It’s simply not fair that she gets saddled with all these responsibilities while the rest of us just sit back and enjoy our comfortable lives. This poor girl deserves some sympathy, especially since she didn’t sign up for this kind of stress. Maybe if we were more understanding and supportive, things wouldn’t be so hard for her – after all, we’re all in this together! I hope she finds a better job soon, one that won’t make her cry herself to sleep at night. Maybe she’ll finally find some peace and happiness again. That would be wonderful – isn’t it?

Maybe I'm just being paranoid because I've seen him interact with other women in ways that make me uncomfortable. The fact that he's now working closely with someone who shares similar interests doesn't help—she's beautiful, smart, and easy-going. I've tried talking to him before, but he never responded. Still, the image of him laughing with her keeps replaying in my mind, like a stuck record.

As she scrolled through the day’s schedule, one appointment stood out - a meeting with the city planner about the community center project. She hadn’t expected to see him there, but somehow, they were both scheduled around the same time. Her heart skipped a beat as she read the message again, wondering how this could have happened. It was like the universe was playing tricks on her, forcing her to relive the past when all she wanted was to move forward. In the back of her mind, a nagging voice whispered, “Maybe if you’d made different choices, things would have turned out differently.” But she pushed those thoughts away, knowing they only led to more suffering. Still, the image of him standing there, looking at her with those piercing blue eyes, made her question everything. Why did fate bring them together only to tear them apart? Her gaze drifted toward the framed photo on her desk, a reminder of the life they built together. He wasn't there to support her; instead, he'd chosen to end their marriage, leaving her alone to face the world. The pain was suffocating, and she"

Could he have somehow gotten into trouble with the law? He tried calling back, but the number was already disconnected.
