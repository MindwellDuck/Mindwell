Today, an old high school acquaintance walked in, arm-in-arm with his former wife and their laughing toddler. He watched from behind the counter as they browsed, seemingly oblivious to his presence. The man felt a pang of envy, a bitter taste rising in his throat. He couldn't help but wonder what it would've been like if things had gone differently.",

Maybe if I was more attractive, then I'd have a chance with her too. But no, I'm stuck here, watching this perfect family walk past me. If only I could turn back time, I wouldn't have let myself get into such a bad situation. If only I was stronger, I wouldn’t have ended up in divorce court. If only I wasn't so insecure, maybe she wouldn't have left me. This is all his fault. If only he didn't treat me so badly, I wouldn’t be alone today. If only he was nicer, he wouldn’t have lost me. If only he weren't such a jerk, we wouldn't have gotten divorced. If only he was kinder, none of this would have happened. If only he listened to me, I wouldn't feel so hurt. If only he cared about me, I wouldn't be heartbroken. If only he loved me, I wouldn't be alone."

All these memories came flooding back, like ripples spreading out from a stone dropped into a still pond. It wasn’t just the memories themselves but the emotions attached to them. The warmth of her presence, the comfort of holding her hand, the feeling of being home. These sensations were all so vivid that they seemed almost real, as if he could reach out and touch them again. She had left so suddenly, leaving behind only silence and emptiness. Her absence was like a heavy fog that clung to every surface, making even the simplest things feel dull and lifeless. Every day felt like a step backward, as if time itself was slowing down around him, allowing him to relive moments he’d rather forget. In this state, he wondered if maybe he was meant for a simpler life—a quieter one, free from the complexities that had driven her away. Maybe he didn’t need all those complicated thoughts and feelings, just the simple joy of living, surrounded by people who truly cared. That idea seemed comforting, but it also scared him. Could he really let go of everything he’d built, simply because it reminded him too much of her? This realization sent him spir"

If only I were more organized, I'd be able to manage my workload better, but no, I just can't seem to get my act together. Maybe if I had more experience, I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed all the time. But why do I always end up feeling this way? It's not fair; I know I'm capable, but somehow things never go smoothly when I'm around. It's frustrating, and now I worry about what others will think when I finally arrive late...again. I guess I really should have taken that extra minute to eat before rushing out, but I didn’t want to waste too much time. Now I'll just have to deal with the consequences, and maybe try harder next time. Maybe. Hopefully, I won't make a fool of myself today after all."
