He could feel it, that creeping unease, as if unseen eyes were watching him through the station's smudged windows. The city outside seemed quieter than usual, too quiet. Every shadow seemed to twitch with life, each distant siren a potential threat closing in on him.",

It sounded like they were talking about her latest show, the one where I had really poured my heart into. The whole thing was supposed to be about how we can create order from chaos - but somehow, it seemed like people saw right through me. They didn't seem to care about the message behind the art; instead, they were probably just mocking me for trying too hard. It’s crazy – I thought everything was going so well after that first show, but apparently, I was wrong. Now I'm starting to doubt whether my work is even good enough to be shown anywhere else. What if this isn’t the last time someone says something like that? What if everyone thinks I’m wasting my time with this sort of stuff? Maybe I shouldn’t have tried so hard with my next piece, just because some people don’t understand what I want to say. Maybe I should give up and stick to more traditional forms of art – at least then I’d know for sure if people would like them. But why does it feel like no matter how much I try, I’ll never get the recognition I deserve? I’ve put my entire life into these pieces, pouring my emotions and thoughts into each one, but does anyone actually see what I’m trying to say? Or am I just making things up, pretending to be an artist who means nothing? Even though I know I shouldn’t let comments like those get to"

It's obvious that this guy has an anger issue, and I'm not going to let him get under my skin. When someone says something like that, they usually don't mean it. People are often quick to lash out when they're stressed or tired. This must be one of those days for him. I'll just ignore him and keep doing what I'm doing. I've dealt with worse. This whole situation was triggered by that one guy last week who yelled at me for not being able to find his order. He said I wasn't trying hard enough, which really got under my skin. But I knew he was probably having a bad day. I didn't want to give him more attention by reacting to him. So I kept calm and just apologized for the inconvenience. Now, here we go again. Maybe if I just stay focused, he'll lose steam and leave me alone. I'm already feeling better just thinking about ignoring him. I've had plenty of experience dealing with difficult customers; I know how to handle myself. This won't affect my mood or attitude. I'll just pretend I didn't hear him and keep moving forward. No need to engage with someone like that. They always say things like that when they're upset. It's all about stress levels. My grandmother has arthritis, so I understand what it's like to be frustrated. I bet this"

The nurse interrupted him gently. \"Please, Doctor, focus on the present moment. You can't change the past, but you must prepare for the future. Your patients need you now.\" His mind began racing again. What if he lost control during surgery? What if he couldn't save another life? The weight of responsibility felt crushing. He forced himself back to reality, taking deep breaths as he tried to calm down. \"Let me take a few minutes,\" he said, trying to regain composure. \"I'll get back to work.\" As he sat down, the nurse placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \"We're here to support you, Doctor. Let us help you through this.\" In the silence, the doctor wondered what would happen if he continued to ask these questions. Would he become paralyzed by fear, unable to make decisions? Or would he learn to trust his instincts and lead"

After a few minutes, my mom finally stopped asking her questions and told me to leave, saying I would get better at dealing with bullies if I practiced more. I left feeling embarrassed and upset.

Her job is stressful, and she doesn’t know how much longer she can keep going like this. If she’s constantly struggling to stay on top of things, then maybe she isn’t cut out for this kind of work anyway. It must be really hard for her partner to deal with all this stress every day. They probably wish they had chosen someone else when she was pregnant, especially now that she’s so clearly overwhelmed by everything. Their relationship might be suffering because of this constant chaos, and I don’t blame him if he decides to leave her. She's just not meant for this world; she’ll never find a way to make her life run smoothly. She'd be better off focusing on simple tasks rather than trying to juggle multiple responsibilities at once.
