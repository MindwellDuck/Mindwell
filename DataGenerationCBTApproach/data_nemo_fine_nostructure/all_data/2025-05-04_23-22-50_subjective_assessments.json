When she goes out, she forgets about me and just keeps living her life without me. It feels like she doesn’t even think about my feelings anymore. We used to be closer, but now it’s like she wants nothing to do with me. I try calling her back, but she just ignores me. It makes me wonder if she has something better than us going on. Maybe someone else cares more than I do. I can't help but feel jealous whenever I see her smile with friends. If she could put as much effort into our relationship as she puts into those friendships, maybe things would have changed. But no, she always chooses them over me. I guess that’s why we’re breaking up. I'm tired of feeling this way. She doesn't love me; she loves everyone else."

She felt so alone that night, even though her husband had left the house. It seemed like his whole life was moving forward without her. She wondered how many times he’d done this before, wondering if there would ever be an opportunity to talk things through. She kept thinking about all the times he’d left, wondering why he didn’t try harder to make things work. Every day felt like another step away from happiness. Her heart felt heavy, weighed down by those thoughts. She wished he could see things from her perspective, just once, to understand what she was going through. She felt lost in her own world, struggling to find peace. She knew deep down that she needed to let go of these thoughts, but they kept haunting her. She wanted to believe everything would work out, but her mind wouldn’t stop spinning with worst-case scenarios. She hoped someday she’d be able to look back on this moment and realize that she had been strong, but until then, those thoughts consumed her.
