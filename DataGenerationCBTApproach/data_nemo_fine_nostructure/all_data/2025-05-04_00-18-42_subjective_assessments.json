It had been exactly a year since she'd last spoken to her, their heated argument echoing in her mind like an unending loop. A sudden, profound guilt washed over her as she remembered the harsh words she'd spoken in anger. She picked up her phone, her trembling fingers hovering over the contacts list, wishing she could take back that fateful day.",

The pain from that moment seemed to reverberate within her, like a never-ending echo chamber, each time she thought about it, the anguish grew stronger. She felt like she was drowning in her own sorrow, unable to escape the weight of her mistakes. Every memory of that day replayed itself in her mind, leaving her with no peace, no respite. It was as if she was living through all those moments again, reliving every second, every word, and every feeling with no end in sight. The pain had become so intense that it seemed to be consuming her, turning her into someone else, someone who wasn't even herself anymore. This was more than just a painful memory; it had become a constant reminder of what she felt was her own fault. Every passing day brought nothing but suffering, and she realized that she would carry this burden for the rest of her life."

This is so typical of her, always running late and ignoring me when things get tough. I know she’d rather hang out than deal with my problems, especially since she has her own stressors. But what if this really is an emergency? Maybe she got into some kind of trouble, or maybe she forgot about our plans because she’s been stressed lately herself. I can’t imagine what could make her forget. She’s such a responsible kid; it doesn’t add up. If I were in her shoes, I wouldn’t ignore me either. But she’s not me. Still, I’m getting anxious. What if there’s something serious going on that she won’t tell me? Or worse, what if she’s gone and forgotten about me completely? The thought sends a chill down my spine. I need to stay calm and think this through. She’ll show up eventually, or maybe call when she gets home from work. I just hope nothing bad happened. I can’t bear the thought of losing her, especially now that we’re closer than ever. She means everything to me. I feel so helpless right now.
