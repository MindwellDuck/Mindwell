And if I feel sad, I know it means there's something real going on. I can't have those feelings unless something is true. So, this anger I'm feeling must mean something. It has to be real. This jealousy I'm feeling must mean something. It cannot be fake. If it were, I wouldn't feel it. I wouldn't be so angry. I would feel nothing. But I do feel angry, so it must be real. I am angry because I am upset about something real. I am upset because that other guy reminds me of him, my late husband. He was my everything, and no one will ever replace him. I love him more than anything, and I miss him every day. He is gone, and I'll never get him back. There is nothing I can do except cherish the memories we made together. But seeing him smile with someone else is unbearable. I feel like crying, and it hurts. I wish I could turn back time and make him stay. I wish he wasn't gone. I wish I could hold him again, feel his warmth, smell his"

She was his age, perhaps even a year older, but her eyes sparkled with an energy he hadn't felt in decades. He noticed the expensive watch on her wrist, the designer bag by her side. His gaze drifted to his own worn-out shoes, the uniform he'd been wearing for years. When she stood up to leave, he saw the discreet 'L' engraved on her ring. A lifelong learner, she had once told him, not a wife or lover. Yet, envy gnawed at him nonetheless, as it always did when he saw her living the life he'd once envisioned for himself.",

The way her eyes sparkled, the ease with which she moved, seemed to mock him, making him feel like a relic of the past. Her smile was infectious, drawing people to her, whereas his own felt forced, like he was just going through the motions. As he sipped his coffee, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was missing out on something fundamental - the joy of being young and free, of having a purpose beyond just existing. But what was the point? Life didn’t reward those who stayed behind. It all seemed unfair; why should someone so much younger than him be enjoying life while he was stuck in a rut?"

She had an interview scheduled for 9 AM, but the looming deadline did little to quell the anxious knot twisting in her stomach. As she reached for her phone to check messages, it slipped from her sweat-dampened hand, clattering onto the hardwood floor.

The interviewer will think I'm crazy for showing up late because of some stupid illness. Maybe I should have rescheduled for next week. But then again, who cares? There's no point in making a big deal out of this. It's not like it matters. Anyway, I'll just go back to bed until the appointment. If anything, I might as well get some rest before I have to pretend to care about whatever position they're offering. I doubt I'd ever use it, so why bother? It's pointless to worry about things like this. I've been doing better lately, haven't I? Just got a new apartment, started seeing someone... nothing much is going wrong, right? So why am I still having these awful panic attacks? They're just silly, irrational feelings. I need to stop letting them control me. Besides, my boyfriend will always be here to take care of me. Even if he were gone, I could move on and find someone else. I mean, why wait around for him when life is full of possibilities? I'll just put on some music, grab a cup of coffee, and try to shake off this"

The fact that he didn’t touch the leftovers is proof that he never intended to support us through this stressful period together. I don’t know why I keep hoping things will change, but I guess I’ll just have to accept that he’s not going to be there for me.

Every time someone asked him if he was okay, he felt like they were just trying to make himself feel better. They didn’t understand what he was going through. It wasn’t that simple. When I say “he’s not doing well,” I mean it. He’s lost control over everything. He can’t even handle basic things like cooking or cleaning. He’s always stressed out, and it’s getting worse every day. I’ve tried talking about it with our friends and family, but they don’t seem to care. They tell me to be positive and focus on the good things, but it doesn’t work. Nothing works when you have this much stress weighing down on you. You can’t just ignore it. When people ask how we’re doing, they expect us to smile and act happy, but I know it’s all a lie. We need help, and I’m tired of pretending everything is fine. They keep asking if I’m doing okay too, but honestly, I feel like I’m barely holding on. There are days when I just want to give up because it feels like nothing will ever get better. It’s exhausting being around him, especially since he never lets anyone see how he really is.

Plus, they're still in the process of settling into the new apartment together. Maybe it's just an attempt to move forward. If anyone can handle stress, it's me. After all, I've dealt with more than my fair share of difficult situations over the years. This is nothing compared to what I've faced, and I'm far more resilient. They wouldn't dare bring up something like this unless they were genuinely concerned for me, which they probably are. Besides, I'm the one who keeps everything running smoothly around here. Without me, the entire department would fall apart. So why would she do something as drastic as leaving now? It's probably just some stupid misunderstanding or miscommunication. Why would she think I wasn't doing enough? I've worked twice as hard as she has, and yet she feels the need to question me? It's unfair, but I know she wouldn't do this to me out of malice. She's just...stressed. Yeah, that's it. Stress. And honestly, she hasn't been very supportive lately."
