Like they have such perfect kitchens and clean floors while mine is a mess. I can’t help but think that if I had an apartment just like theirs, my life would be so much easier, so much more enjoyable. But then again, I remember how hard it was to get there in the first place – all those years of struggle, working multiple jobs, and the sacrifices I made for my family. It feels unfair to compare myself now when everything else is going well, isn't it? People say things happen for a reason, but why does it always seem like everyone else gets what they want while I'm left with nothing? My kids are growing up, and I’m stuck here alone, feeling like a failure. Maybe I should just give up and let them move out sooner, but then I worry about how they’ll handle the world on their own. How could someone like me, with no college degree and barely any savings, expect them to thrive? The thought of being completely dependent on government assistance makes my blood boil. I know I shouldn’t make these comparisons, but it’s hard not to feel resentful. Why does this keep happening to me? What did I ever do wrong?"

He throws it onto the couch in frustration, knocking over an empty whiskey glass. It rolls onto the floor with a hollow clink, echoing his own emptiness. He looks at himself in the mirror - dark circles, unkempt beard, clothes rumpled from wearing them all week. He turns away, unable to face his reflection any longer. The silence of his apartment mocks him, a stark contrast to the bustling newsroom where he used to thrive. Now, every story feels like another nail in the coffin of their failed relationship. He picks up his phone again, opens her last message - \"I need space\" - and deletes it.",

That's why he got hired in the first place - his drive and ability to perform well under tight schedules were exactly what the company was looking for. So, it's only natural that he'd feel better when he dives headfirst into work.

A lone photograph slipped from its frame, catching his eye - them laughing together at some long-forgotten joke. He picked it up, tracing their smiling faces with a trembling finger, before burying it deep in his pocket. His sorrow echoed through the silent house as he realized this was the last place they'd shared before cancer claimed her voice forever.",

It wasn’t fair—she had been there for him when no one else could be. But what if someone else had been there too? Someone who didn’t care about her feelings or needs? Her thoughts swirled out of control, painting scenarios where everyone ignored her, dismissed her, and treated her like a non-entity. She pictured John walking past her, his eyes fixed on the other woman, completely oblivious to her presence. It seemed so real, as if her worst fears were unfolding before her eyes. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was being left behind, that her place in John’s life was slipping away. He seemed more interested in the conversation going on at another table, his body leaning into the stranger’s side as they laughed together. Her mind started creating stories about how that touch might have meant something more than friendship—a story that felt all too real, as if she were seeing things that weren’t there. This wasn’t the first time she’d felt like she was losing him. There had been times when he spent hours talking to others, leaving her alone in the same places they both went to.

Every time someone else's couple laughed together, she felt a pang of sadness, as if they were mocking her alone status. Her mind began to fill in the gaps between the seemingly happy interactions, creating a narrative where everyone was excluding her on purpose. It wasn't just the laughter; even the way people interacted with each other seemed to reinforce this feeling - every conversation seemed laced with an unspoken understanding that they were all better off without her. As she looked around, she couldn't help but feel like she was being left out, and that those who remained coupled were doing so because they had simply moved on from their past relationships. The thought sent a wave of regret through her, making her question whether she would ever find love again. Even though she knew intellectually that her situation was unique, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was somehow broken, that there must be something fundamentally wrong with her that made her unworthy of companionship. This perception grew stronger with each passing moment, until it seemed to dominate every thought. She wondered if her age and the fact that she had been divorced for many years were reasons enough to give up hope altogether. The loneliness she felt deepened, and she started to wonder if she was meant to spend the rest of her life alone. As the night drew to a close, she felt a sense of resignation wash over her,"

What if he got too close, and the fire engulfed him? As I watched, my mind conjured images of him trapped inside, unable to escape, surrounded by the choking smoke. I pictured him coughing, his eyes streaming with tears, his skin burning beneath the relentless heat. And then, the unthinkable: what if the flames spread, consuming everything? Our home, our lives, all destroyed in an instant. But I couldn’t just stand there, paralyzed by fear. I needed to act, yet my body felt heavy, as if rooted to the spot. I felt like I was watching myself, waiting for some signal to react, even though deep down I knew I had to move. It was as if my brain was telling me one thing while my body kept responding to another, creating this strange disconnect where fear and action were locked in a silent battle.

Her mind kept replaying memories of him, but those moments were now tainted with what could have been—what he would've said, how he would've looked, how he would've held her. Those thoughts consumed her, tearing her apart from the inside out. Every step she took felt like a betrayal, as if she was walking away from everything that mattered. She wondered why she couldn't find solace in anything anymore. Nothing brought her peace; even the things she used to love now seemed hollow. She felt like a shell of her former self, unable to feel anything except emptiness. Her days blurred together, and her nights were filled with restless sleep, haunted by dreams that left her feeling drained and alone. She felt like a part of her had died with him, leaving behind a dull ache that refused to heal. Every moment since his passing felt like an eternity, and yet, nothing seemed to change.

She thinks about how maybe he’s going through some personal stuff and he might need some time alone. ## 2. Maybe he forgot or lost track of your appointment and is genuinely sorry for the inconvenience. ## 3. He might be having a bad day and really needed some time to himself to recharge.
