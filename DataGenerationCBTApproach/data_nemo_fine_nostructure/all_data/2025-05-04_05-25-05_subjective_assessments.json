She has submitted excellent proposals in the past, but no one ever gives them serious consideration. This is just another injustice. Her anger subsides slightly when she recalls the success of her own research projects. However, these memories are overshadowed by the current disappointment. She can’t help feeling that everything she does is against the odds, that she doesn’t deserve recognition or support. Even though she knows intellectually that she’s capable and competent, she cannot shake off the feeling of inadequacy. This thought echoes through her mind as she walks back to her office, unable to fully let go of her frustration. The initial anger still simmers beneath the surface, making her feel resentful towards others who seem to get what she wants. She starts to wonder if she really deserves such recognition, or if it’s all just a cruel joke. The doubt lingers, fueling her bitterness and making her question whether she’s truly deserving of the accolades she’s been given. This subtle belief process reflects how we often unconsciously downplay our achievements while magnifying failures. By doing so, we inadvertently create a self-perpetuating cycle of negativity, where we become more likely to experience those very same negative outcomes again. This distorted thinking pattern can lead us down a path of continued disappointment, reinforcing feelings of inadequacy and frustration—ult"

It's probably too expensive for her budget, making it seem like an unfair comparison to what I have. I've seen people my age struggle to afford even basic things, let alone fancy jewelry. Maybe I am too old, and she's just being nice to keep me calm. She doesn't want to hurt my feelings by saying no, so she's giving me false hope.

I bet he doesn’t even know what it’s like to work 12-hour shifts with no break. He must be enjoying every bite of those expensive pastries, thinking he’s so much better than us. I don’t even want to see him again. This whole thing makes me sick. The way he’s living his life, getting all these free perks, and making friends easily? It’s disgusting. Everyone deserves a chance to improve themselves, but he doesn’t care about anyone else except himself. If I could, I’d take back every word I said and pretend nothing happened, but now he knows exactly where I live. I wish I could erase my anger right now and start fresh, but this isn’t going anywhere. Now he’ll never trust me again, and I’m going to regret this.
