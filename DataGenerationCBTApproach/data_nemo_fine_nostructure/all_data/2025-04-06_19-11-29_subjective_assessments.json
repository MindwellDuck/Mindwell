Another night, another attempt at sleep that wouldn't come, his mind a whirlwind of \"what ifs\" and \"if onlys.\" The weight of her absence felt heavier tonight than ever before.",

But what else could be causing these feelings? Is it really about me, or is there something deeper going on? It feels like no matter how hard I try to shake off these thoughts, they keep coming back. And honestly, it's starting to make me feel like I’m missing out on something important. Like I should be doing more, thinking more, being more. But why can't I get past these feelings? Are they really just about me, or is there something else at play here?"

When he wore that smile at the office, she wondered if it was for everyone's sake or just to hide his true feelings. The fact that he got the gold watch meant nothing; it was probably just another empty gesture. Why did everyone seem so happy when they gave him such a big deal? It didn’t make sense to her. She remembered how hard he worked, always pushing himself to meet impossible deadlines. Was this really what he wanted? It looked fake, and she couldn’t shake off the feeling that there was more to it than what met the eye. He might have been playing them all along, using their praise to further his own interests. She thought about how she saw him before, as someone who kept people in line through intimidation and manipulation. Maybe this was his way of getting back at us all by pretending to be something he’s never been. He doesn’t deserve all these compliments. He’s just a manipulator. I don’t want to see him anymore, especially not smiling like this. I’m better off without him. I don’t need to hear more speeches like this. This is all just a facade, and I refuse to be a part"

I'm just a pathetic loser, and she must have realized it too. She doesn't love me; I'm nothing special. She should have stayed, at least until we finished dinner together. Now, everything feels empty, like our entire relationship was just an illusion. The smell of cooking food is meaningless, and all I can think about is what could have been if only she had stayed. This isn't how things were supposed to go. We should still be laughing together, enjoying our meal, not fighting over who gets to sit next to her in bed. I wish I could turn back time and make her stay. Maybe then, things wouldn't feel so broken, and I'd be able to hold onto hope. But now, it's too late. She left, and I'm left here alone, wondering what went wrong. Every step forward seems to lead me backward, into a world where she's no longer there to catch me. I keep thinking that maybe someday she'll come back, but until then, I'm stuck living in this emptiness, feeling like a failure. I just wish I could make her stay, but I know that's impossible now."

This is why I hate my job - people who don't even respect me, yet act like everything is okay when they're not. When she finally got home, she just wanted to cry. Why was she stuck with such horrible coworkers? They were so mean and condescending, never letting her forget that she wasn't part of their group. The way they talked behind her back made her want to scream, and now she feels like crying again. Her boss had no right to push her around like that. He knew exactly what he was doing - trying to make her look bad in front of customers. But nothing ever changed; he kept pushing her down until she couldn't handle it anymore. As soon as she walked through the door, she felt like slamming the door shut behind her. She hated coming home because of those awful people, who wouldn't even let her be themselves.
