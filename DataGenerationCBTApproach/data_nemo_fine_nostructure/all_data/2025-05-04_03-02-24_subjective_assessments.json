It was her favorite necklace, the one she always wore. He had forgotten about it until today, when he found it in his pocket while packing up his classroom after another empty day without her.

I remember how much we talked about everything that happened that day, from the game to our plans for the weekend. She wasn’t usually so quiet, but I assumed she might be upset or scared. It didn’t make sense that he just stood there, staring at an old necklace, without even trying to find her or talk to anyone. If he was really looking for her, he would have asked someone if they saw her. I imagined her sitting on the bench nearby, quietly crying over something, but there was no sign of her. It seemed so strange that he just kept holding onto the chain, his eyes fixed on it. Maybe she was already gone, and he was too late to help. My heart sank thinking about all the times we spent together, laughing and sharing secrets. Now, he was alone with nothing but a piece of jewelry that reminded him of her. Why did he do this? I couldn’t understand why he simply sat there, clinging to something that brought back memories of her. I pictured him sitting alone in class, wondering where she went, but she didn’t say anything.
