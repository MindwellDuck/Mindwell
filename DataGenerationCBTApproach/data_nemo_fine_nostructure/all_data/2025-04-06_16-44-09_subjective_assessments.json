He doesn’t love her, never has; it was all just a cruel joke from the start. Even when he says sweet things, his eyes betray him - they’re cold, distant. Her mind is full of questions, but the answers are clear: why would anyone stay with someone who doesn’t care? It makes sense that he’d leave her now, too. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t stick around either. Every moment we share is a reminder of what he truly thinks about me. No amount of effort will ever change that. This isn’t my first failed relationship, and I know exactly how this ends. She’ll be alone again soon enough, left to pick up the pieces of shattered dreams and broken promises. Even if he did feel something, he’d never let himself show it. Men aren’t supposed to be vulnerable, after all. That’s what I’ve learned through years of watching him keep people at bay. He’s a master of pretending to care, but deep down, he’s always just waiting for the chance to move on. And now, with everything falling apart, it’s easier than ever for him to walk away. It’s probably for the best anyway. Why waste more time and energy on someone who doesn’t want you? Her life would be better off without him"

Maybe she thinks I'm just another relic of the past, holding on too tightly. Whatever it is, it's clear that she's feeling the weight of time. Maybe she wishes she could turn back the clock and relive those moments when life seemed simpler. I wonder if she ever wonders what happened to me, if she's ever thought about trying to reach out. It's probably because she sees the emptiness of the store, the way the shelves are still stocked but the people have gone. She might be thinking that she'll never find her place again, that this is where she belongs, but deep down, maybe she knows she doesn't belong here anymore. Or perhaps she's wondering why I haven't tried to contact her, if there's anything left for us. Whatever it is, I can tell she's carrying the burden of nostalgia, longing for a time long forgotten. Maybe she's lost hope, and all she can think about is turning back the hands of time. I wish I could see her smile again, hear her laugh, feel her warmth.

It’s too much to handle. My head is racing, and I feel like I’m losing control. I need to get out of here before it gets worse. Maybe I’ll just leave quietly and avoid confrontation.

She felt a lump rise in her throat as she noticed Mrs. Thompson's wedding ring still on her finger, despite the doctors' futile efforts to revive her husband hours earlier. The nurse gently squeezed Mrs. Thompson's hand, feeling an overwhelming despair at the cruel twist of fate that had left this woman widowed and alone, with no one to hold her hand in her own time of need.",

It wasn't until she saw the look of despair etched on the nurse's face that she realized what was happening. \"What is it?\" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady, but before she could get an answer, another nurse rushed by, shouting, \"It's worse! We've lost her!\" Her heart sank as she heard the words echoing through the room like a death knell. She thought back to the moment she'd first met Mrs. Thompson, how she'd spoken about her late mother, how she'd always wanted children of her own, and how she'd spent years caring for her elderly parents. All those memories now seemed hollow, as if she'd been living in a dream world. She felt numb, as if her mind was struggling to process the reality that Mrs. Thompson had passed away, leaving behind a family torn apart by grief. The sound of weeping filled the air, and she knew that nothing would ever be the same again."
