It's been so long since we last saw each other, and now she just stays away? Maybe it's my fault? I could've made things easier if only I had reached out sooner. Now she feels like an outsider again, doesn't she? This kind of thing always happens when I'm too busy to notice. But what if I was just as lonely as she was? What if I felt left behind by everyone too? Would they stop talking to me then? No, this isn't about me. This is all about her being distant. If only I could show her how much I care... It's probably just a coincidence, but every time I see her, she looks unhappy. Does she hate me too? Is she avoiding me because of something I said? Or did I accidentally hurt her feelings once more? I don't want her to think I'm not good enough. Why does everything seem to fall apart whenever we're together? Can't she see that I try really hard? Am I losing my chance to win her back? Shouldn't she understand that I'm just trying to make friends? I wouldn't push her away... Would I? Could I? Should I? Do I? ...No, no, no, I shouldn't think like this. I'm not capable"

When I asked if we could change it to something else, she said I was being “too picky” and that I needed to trust her judgment. I couldn't help but think that maybe she was upset because I’m getting older. I remember when doctors used to respect older patients’ opinions more. They’d actually listen to us! Now, it feels like they don’t care about our feelings anymore. Maybe that's why this nurse is acting so rudely – she thinks I'm too old to understand anything. I can’t stand it! I just wanted to leave the hospital, even though I know it’s not fair to take it out on her. Still, I couldn't stop feeling angry.
