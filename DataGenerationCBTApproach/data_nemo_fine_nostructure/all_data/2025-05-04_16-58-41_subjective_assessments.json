He notices the likes and comments flooding in, all praising his friend's bold, innovative style. His stomach churns as he compares his own recent work, feeling it pales in comparison. He catches his wife smiling at something on her phone, and for a moment, he worries she's seen the post too.",

The fact that his wife smiles at things on her phone doesn't register; it's just a distraction from the crushing realization that he's not where his friend is. Every time he sees people commenting on his friend's work, he feels like they're talking about him, judging him, even though deep down he knows that's not true. This isn't about his wife knowing or anything else—it's just that he can't shake the feeling that he's falling behind, that every small success is overshadowed by the bigger ones his friend achieves. It’s like his mind is wired to see everything through the lens of failure, and no matter how hard he tries to convince himself otherwise, it just won’t budge."

Her fresh-faced demeanor and constant need for reassurance made her oblivious to the harsh realities of policing. It wasn't just her lack of experience; it seemed she genuinely believed every word from their superiors. She couldn't even handle simple traffic stops, always apologizing and seeking permission. She was so green that she didn't even know what to say during critical situations. Even now, as we were heading out, she'd probably apologize for turning on the sirens, asking if it was okay to use them. He wondered how much longer it would take for her to realize that sometimes you have to be firm, not polite, especially when dealing with dangerous suspects. But deep down, he knew it wouldn’t happen – she was too trusting, too eager to please. This rookie needed guidance, and he was more than happy to provide it – but it was going to take time. And maybe some patience."

It wasn't just the fatigue from another long day on his feet; it was something else. Something heavier. He'd been feeling it for weeks now - a gnawing unhappiness that seemed to seep into every aspect of his life, coloring everything with its dreary hue.\n\nThe kitchen door swung open, and she walked in, her usually cheerful demeanor replaced by a tight smile. She was his partner, both in business and in life, but tonight there was no warmth in her eyes as they met his. \"Table six is complaining about their meal,\" she said softly, too softly.\n\nHe felt a pang of irritation, but it was quickly overshadowed by the familiar weight of unhappiness.

She doesn't even look at me when we're working together anymore. When I try to make small talk, she just rolls her eyes or says \"whatever\" and walks away. Tonight, when she came in, she didn't even bother looking at me. Just stood there with her arms crossed, staring blankly out the window. What's going on? Why can't she see how hard I'm trying? I've tried to change, to improve, to be more attentive, more helpful. But nothing works. Every night feels like another disappointment, another step closer to being fired. And if I get fired, what then? My parents will kick me back home, and I'll never find another job like this again. They won't understand, anyway. They don’t really know anything about running a restaurant. It’s not easy. You have to work your ass off to keep it going. But she doesn’t think about that. She thinks about how I’m failing her, how I’m letting her down. How could she not see that I’m still doing my best? That I’ve been trying harder than ever? Maybe she just needs some time. A"

The way she smiled seemed forced, almost like she wasn’t really enjoying herself. When I think about the ceremony, I’m reminded of how much pressure there was to make it perfect. Looking back, I wish I could have been more present, but I was too caught up in making sure everything went smoothly. This picture just makes me realize how different things were then compared to now. Even though we’re divorced, I still hold onto this moment as a reminder that life is full of little moments we miss when we get too caught up in trying to control every detail. Sometimes, even with the best intentions, things fall apart because we forget to be fully present in the moment.

Maybe he needed a break, something like an energy drink to shake off the fatigue. But why did he always need such a boost?

It wasn't just the technical stuff; he'd been struggling with the project's requirements for months now, and it seemed like every time he thought he understood, there would be another hurdle. The latest email from their manager about deadlines made him anxious - after all, they were already behind schedule, and this new push could put them further in debt. He started typing out a reply, but then deleted it, thinking maybe he shouldn't say anything since everyone else is busy anyway. If he didn't contribute much, maybe no one would even notice his input, which wouldn't bother him too much. After all, his work was mostly backend development, and the front-end people usually handled the more complex tasks. Still, he couldn't help but feel that his lack of progress was somehow his fault, like he was holding back the team's overall performance. This thought led him to wonder if maybe he should take some extra steps to prove himself, like taking online courses or attending webinars, just in case his skills weren't up to par."
