It wasn't just the words themselves, but how they seemed to pierce through the air, each one a sharp jab into her already fragile ego. She tried to push them away, but they lingered, echoing off the walls of her mind like a chorus of cruel taunts. The world had become a twisted game, where every smile was a lie, every laugh a snicker, and every glance a challenge waiting to be accepted. She felt trapped in this maze of her own making, with no escape from the relentless barrage of insults. Each time she thought she'd found solace in silence, another voice would emerge, whispering its share of venomous truths. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was drowning in a sea of broken dreams, where every step forward was met with a wave of disappointment. Every face became a mask, hiding secrets behind closed doors, while she stood alone, exposed and vulnerable. The pain cut deep, like a knife slicing through the quiet moments of peace she desperately clung to. She wondered if anyone truly understood what it meant to walk these paths, to carry the weight of loneliness on shoulders made for carrying burdens. In this endless cycle of hurt and rejection, she searched for a glimmer of hope, but it seemed to vanish with each passing day, leaving her further lost in a world where kindness was a distant memory. The voices kept coming, each one a reminder"

I had to focus on the task at hand—helping her recover, even if she didn't deserve it. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this letter was just another attempt to hurt me. Why else would she send something after all these months? The way I think about it now, I realize I'm just protecting myself from getting hurt again. But deep down, part of me wishes I could just open the envelope and see what she has to say. Maybe then I'd finally understand why she left, and maybe I could learn to forgive her. After all, isn't forgiveness supposed to set us free? Maybe I’m just holding onto the past because it’s easier than facing whatever truth lies within those words. Whatever it is, I don’t want to hear it. And yet, there’s still a part of me that wants to know what happened, just to make sense of everything. To really know what went wrong. But I won't give in to that curiosity. Not anymore. This time, I’ve closed the door on her forever. She'll never come back to me."

They weren't speaking anymore, and this wasn't a reunion invitation. This had to be some kind of mistake. Maybe she thought they were supposed to meet up again, but we agreed to keep things formal. No, no, no...this couldn't be happening. What if there's another explanation I'm missing? This can't be real. She wouldn't do something so stupid. Could she have written it before we divorced? But that wouldn't make sense either, because she wouldn't want me to know about it. And what if someone else—maybe a family member or a friend—sent it by accident? Or maybe it's a prank? But then why is it addressed to him alone? Why did she write this in secret? Does she think I'll just ignore it? Is this some kind of test? If I don't react, does that mean I've forgiven her? But has she really changed? Maybe she's just playing a game with me. She doesn't understand how much this hurts. I need to calm down. I need to think clearly. There has to be a logical explanation for this. But what if...what"

She glanced around the room, but saw nothing but empty chairs, the silence deafening. It seemed to amplify her conviction, making her even more resolute. \"I won't let anyone—especially not strangers—doubt me now,\" she said, her voice firm. \"I'll prove them wrong, one patient at a time.\" The room remained silent, the only sound coming from the back of the auditorium, where a woman stood, her head bowed, her hand resting gently on her hip. Dr. W didn't look at her, but the words cut deep, echoing within her. She felt a surge of anger, but it wasn't directed toward the stranger; it was directed inward, towards herself. How could she let someone else's opinion affect her so deeply? Why did she allow such hurtful thoughts to take root? As Dr. W began her presentation, she focused on the slides in front"
