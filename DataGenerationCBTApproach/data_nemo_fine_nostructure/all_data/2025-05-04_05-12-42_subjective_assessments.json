He doesn't know anything about what's going on around here. It makes me wonder if he knows what we're doing out there. Not to mention, he has no idea what it takes to lead this team. If he ever steps foot in my division, it'll be an embarrassment. He can't possibly understand what we've accomplished with our sacrifices and dedication. The way he's dismissing us all as \"just a bunch of old guys\" shows his lack of understanding. This whole thing is an insult to everything we stand for. We were so much more than just \"old guys.\" We are dedicated professionals with years of experience. To think that they would dismiss us like that shows how disconnected from reality they are. How could someone like him lead this organization? I'm sure he wouldn't last even one day in command. I don't know why anyone would trust him with such important decisions. He's probably just going to make things worse for everyone involved."

It's not like anyone else has forgotten anything important. I'm the only one who can't seem to get it right. If I was supposed to remember it, wouldn't I have done so already? Shouldn't I have known it from years ago? Is there something wrong with me? It doesn’t make sense that everyone else remembers things so easily while I struggle. She should know what she needs to know, no matter how old we get. It’s just not fair. She’s still smart; she should be able to handle simple tasks like this. When did I start forgetting everything? Why should I have to work so hard when others don’t? It feels like everyone expects me to know these things automatically. Why can't I remember things the way I used to? That’s not normal.

She didn't realize that my mind was racing with worry about how we'd pay for these things, but she must have felt it somehow because she kept glancing at me with those pleading eyes. It was almost as if she was trying to tell me something, even though I knew intellectually that I couldn't read her thoughts. Still, I felt her anger and sadness, and I wanted to comfort her, but I was too busy dealing with the financial implications of this mess. Her silence was deafening, but I could feel her pain. We were going through a tough time together, and she understood that better than anyone. She wasn't mad at me; she just needed to let go. I could see it in her actions, but I also knew she wouldn’t admit it out loud. It was like she had a secret language that only I could understand. The way she looked at me, with tears welling up in her eyes, told me everything I needed to know. She wasn’t angry; she was scared. And I could feel that fear echoing within me, making me want to hold her tighter. But I couldn’t—my hands were full of bags,"

My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest - what if he's already called emergency services? What if he thinks I've left him forever? I can barely see through the rain-soaked windshield. The roads are slippery, and I'm terrified I'll lose control and end up in a ditch somewhere. Every second feels like an eternity. I just want to get home before it's too late, but my fear keeps growing stronger with each passing mile. I can't shake the feeling that I'm running out of time.

Dr. H took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of unease. He figured it was just nerves. After all, he’d been practicing medicine for over 20 years. He knew what he did was important.

Maybe she'll listen if I explain how this is affecting my mental health. My anxiety will go away once she apologizes. This is all about control. If she didn't let us use the fridge, we wouldn't be doing this. They have to stop controlling everything around here. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. Every time it happens, it feels like an attack. The worst part is when I try to forget it and then think about it again. What if someone else is behind this? But why would they do it? Maybe it's just my imagination running wild again. I hate how I feel when I find out someone took food from the fridge. Now I'm thinking about the past, wondering if there were other times when I felt this way. If I had reported these incidents earlier, maybe things would be different now. If I confront her, she might deny it, which would mean I'm crazy for thinking she did it. That would validate my feelings even more, proving that I'm right.
