That smile tells me she's enjoying it. The way she laughs is just like when we were together. She has so much fun now that she doesn't even bother to hide how happy she is anymore. I'm surprised she didn't kiss him yet. We have such great chemistry; I wouldn't blame her if she wanted more than just friendship. That guy seems nice enough, but he can't compare to me. I bet she thinks about me all the time. Maybe she misses me already. I wish I could see inside her head right now and know exactly what she's thinking. If I could read her mind, I'd know whether this encounter is casual or if there's something more going on. Her eyes seem to light up whenever she talks about him, which makes me think she really likes him. This is just another reminder of everything I've lost. Why would anyone want me now? At least she still cares about me. If only I could find out what she's thinking in that moment, I might feel better. But she does look pretty happy today, almost like she's gloating about our breakup. I hope she realizes soon that nothing will ever replace our life together."

But this time, it wasn't anticipation or excitement fueling his pulse; it was dread. The door swung open, and she stepped out, her eyes meeting his briefly before darting away.

She hadn't said anything about what went wrong, but he knew exactly how to read between the lines. Her silence was laced with disappointment, and the way she turned away from him told a story all its own—a story he already knew too well. This wasn’t the first time she’d shut him down, and he couldn’t help but wonder if there was something fundamentally broken within him that made him unworthy of being considered for the position. It seemed like every conversation ended in the same painful pattern, where she would politely listen, nod along, and then dismiss him with a curt phrase, leaving him feeling hollow inside. His mind replayed the moments leading up to this latest rejection, wondering what he could’ve done differently, but the answers always led back to one thing: he was never good enough. Every interaction with her was like trying to breathe underwater—the more he struggled, the more he sank into despair. Even after months of preparation, he still felt unprepared, like he was drowning in an ocean of inadequacy. It didn’t matter how hard he tried to convince himself otherwise—it was impossible to shake off the feeling that he was destined for failure. This wasn’t just a single setback; it was part of a larger narrative that had been unfolding for years, each failure reinforcing the idea that he was meant to be left behind"

Now, I'm leading the team, and I still feel those same doubts sometimes. But I know that's normal. We're human, after all. I just wanted to let him know that he's not alone in feeling uncertain.

Their conversation is laced with an air of superiority, and it becomes clear that this young man has a talent for storytelling that sets him apart from the rest. The way he effortlessly weaves together seemingly unrelated facts and ideas, creating a narrative that captivates everyone around him, leaves no doubt in anyone’s mind that this is a man destined for greatness. But what really gets under his skin is when they compare their cars. His neighbor boasts about how his brand-new vehicle is equipped with all the latest technology, while his own old sedan barely has enough life left in it to make it through another year. It's almost laughable, like comparing apples and oranges - they're worlds apart in terms of style and functionality. And yet, despite these glaring differences, both vehicles seem to be getting equal amounts of attention. It's as if people are drawn to the shiny new car, oblivious to the fact that it may never hold the same value as the reliable, if less glamorous, older model. This subtle shift in focus reveals more than just a preference for newer things; it says something deeper about our perceptions. We tend to overlook the obvious advantages of something familiar, even when faced with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. This isn’t just about comparing cars; it’s about how our minds work, always looking for reasons"

This isn't just about me; it's about how I'm perceived by others. They see me as someone who can't fit into their lives. Maybe they're right. Maybe I am just a ghost haunting these places, invisible and unwanted.
