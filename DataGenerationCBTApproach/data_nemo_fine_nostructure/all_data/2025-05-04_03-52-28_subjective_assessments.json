Why does this make me think that my life isn’t good enough? I’m tired of feeling like I have to constantly remind her to appreciate our relationship. She says she loves me, but actions speak louder than words. Now, I wonder if she even remembers what we agreed to last week. Does she really prioritize our date night? Maybe I'm just being too sensitive again. Maybe she has more responsibilities at work that I don't know about. But why can't she see how hard I am working here? Doesn't she understand that every little thing affects my mood? Am I such an ungrateful partner that everything is about me? If only she could be there to support me when I need it most, I wouldn't feel so lonely. But is she really that busy? It feels like no matter how much I try, things never go right. Is she planning to leave me because she doesn't want to deal with my emotional needs anymore? Why does it always seem like she chooses her work over us? Does she think I’m just an obstacle to her career advancement? I remember how excited she was when she got her new role, but now it feels like it's all about"

Every step forward became a battle against the crushing tide of grief, as if the very fabric of her being was unraveling with each passing moment. Each decision felt like a sacrifice, every action a betrayal to those she loved. Yet, still she pushed forward, driven by a determination born of desperation rather than hope. In this bleak landscape, there was no escape, only the relentless march toward the edge of collapse. And yet, even as she teetered on the precipice, she found the strength to carry on, fueled by a resolve forged in the fire of sorrow. Though the darkness closed in around her, she stood tall, a beacon of resilience amidst the chaos. But in truth, she was barely holding on, clinging to the last shreds of hope as the waves crashed against her, threatening to sweep her under at any moment.

And when it does, I feel even more defeated. I’ve tried everything to make it work, but nothing helps. I guess some people are just meant to fail, and I’m one of them. I’ll probably always be stuck in this cycle of disappointment and frustration.
