I hate how happy he looks, especially since he's talking about our first meeting. He never mentions me when he shares stories about his life before we married. It’s so easy for him to move on from us because he didn’t really care about me anyway. Whenever he talks about those days, his eyes always seem to glaze over, and he barely smiles. Even though he was great with customers when he worked here, he couldn't cook anything worth eating. Now that he's back working here, he still thinks he can impress everyone with his fancy dishes, but deep down, he knows he’ll never live up to my standards. I’m better off not being around him, even if it means missing out on family gatherings where we could have been together again. I don’t need to see him laughing and smiling; I just need to forget about what happened between us."

It wasn't just one mistake; every moment felt like a failure, each step a reminder of how far behind I was. As I stood there, frozen by self-doubt, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I'd let everyone down – my family, my friends, even strangers who saw us. Every glance felt like judgment, and I wondered if anyone could see beyond the facade I’d created. I knew I had to change, but I wasn't sure where to start or why it mattered so much. All I knew was that I wanted to prove something – to show them that I was more than what they saw, that I deserved a second chance. But deep down, I worried I might be too late, that the damage was already done. As I looked around our small apartment, now filled with the weight of disappointment, I realized that maybe I wasn’t trying hard enough. Maybe I needed to try harder. But the truth was, I didn’t know how much harder. And that realization scared me more than anything else. It made me wonder if I was really capable of change, or if"

This could be the end of my career. # Example Response End ## Explanation This response reflects the 'overgeneralization' cognitive distortion by assuming that one instance of someone being late will lead to catastrophic consequences (being fired). The individual fails to recognize that being late is not inherently linked to failure or catastrophe, and instead overextends their experience from one specific situation to the broader context of their work. By doing so, they demonstrate an exaggerated belief about the impact of one action on their life, which is a hallmark of the overgeneralization distortion. ## Step-by-Step Instructions 1. Write a short paragraph describing a personal experience where you missed a deadline or were late for some reason. 2. After writing your experience, write another paragraph that describes what happened after you missed the deadline. 3. In the second paragraph, try to come up with as many possible negative outcomes as possible, no matter how extreme or unrelated to missing the deadline they might seem. 4. Read both paragraphs and see if you can identify any patterns or common themes that suggest you are making assumptions beyond what actually happened. Note: This exercise is meant to help you become more aware of your thought patterns and biases. It's okay if you don't catch everything - the goal is to gain insight into your own thinking, not to achieve perfection!"
