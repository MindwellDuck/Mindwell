It makes sense that he'd feel this way; he usually does when things like this happen. I wonder if we're having more issues than just this one thing, maybe there are deeper problems I'm not seeing. This isn't about washing dishes; it's about being considerate and not letting small things build up. Maybe I should ask what I can do better next time. But honestly, it feels like such a small thing, and I've been so stressed lately— maybe I am overreacting."

A young couple enters, giggling loudly, oblivious to the \"Closed\" sign. She watches them through the security mirror, their laughter echoing, a stark contrast to her silent aisles. They kiss by the perfume counter, his hands wandering. She feels the familiar pang of jealousy, not for love lost, but for the freedom they flaunt so casually. Spite rises within her like bile.

It's all about control. If I could just make them feel my pain, maybe they'd understand. But no, they're too busy being happy, completely oblivious to my suffering. It's not fair. I'm the one who deserves happiness, not them. Why does everyone get to experience life's joys while I'm left with nothing but tears and regret? I wish I could make them see what I've been through, but they'll never understand. They don't know what it's like to be me. This is all so unfair. I deserve better than this. I should have someone to share moments like these with, not just watch them through the glass, feeling like an invisible ghost. Why does everything go wrong for me? Can't they see how much I need someone now? They're just going to leave, and I'll be left here, alone once more. It's so cruel. I wish I could tell them how much I resent their happiness, but they won't listen anyway. They're too caught up in their own blissful ignorance. I wonder if they ever think"

His eyes seemed cold, but maybe that was just because he was grieving like everyone else. It wasn't like she'd done anything wrong. Maybe they didn't really talk about her behind her back. They're probably all very nice people who genuinely care for her. But why did it feel like every time she walked by, someone made a snide comment? What if he wasn't trying to be mean, perhaps he thought she looked better without her makeup. People are always talking about how sad she looks, maybe that's what he meant when he smiled pitifully. If I weren't there, he wouldn't have even noticed me. He might be having a bad day, and that's why he seemed rude. We all know how hard it is to lose someone you love. If I hadn't been there, he wouldn't have needed to say anything. That was probably just a reflexive reaction. And yet... maybe he did. Maybe he does think I'm ugly. Or maybe he's just jealous that my husband got to go home while he's still here. I bet no one would speak to me like that if they saw how I was feeling. I'll try to ignore him and hope he goes away.

Maybe if I kept pushing myself to be perfect, things would've turned out differently. But they never did. It feels like no matter what I do, I'm stuck in this cycle of fear and regret.
