She's been dusting the same display case for what feels like hours, her gloved hands moving automatically while her mind wanders to the empty apartment waiting for her after her shift. The bell above the door chimes, startling her from her reverie. A young couple walks in, laughing and holding hands, their eyes shining with love. They don't even glance at her, but she feels a pang of loneliness so sharp it takes her breath away. She turns back to her dusting, blinking rapidly to hold back the sudden tears that threaten to fall.",

That's all there is to it. She probably never had anyone anyway. No one wants someone as boring and awkward as her, let alone attractive enough to make a girl like that fall for them. Her life is over. It's always been this way - no friends, no dates, nothing but dusting shelves and feeling sorry for herself. Why bother trying? Just accept it. You're a loser. She'll spend the rest of her days cleaning up other people's lives while everyone else has fun with theirs. There's no point in hoping things change; she'll just end up more miserable than before. She needs to stop being such an outcast. But how? She doesn't have anything going for her. She can't even hold down a job for long because she's too distracted by her own thoughts. People see right through her - they know she's not worth investing time into. Why try? Maybe if she stopped being so pathetic, then maybe someone would notice her. But deep down, she knows that's never going to happen. This isn't about the man or woman; it's about her. She's the problem. What's wrong with her that no one wants her? Is it really that hard to find someone when you look like her? Does she need to start wearing"

Perhaps he'll finally get an answer, something that brings closure. Yet, he pushes the thought away as absurd; surely, it's just another ruse.

I’ve seen him struggle with similar cases before; why did no one recognize his limitations? It’s almost as if he’s trying to prove something by pushing through, despite the risks. But what if he’s just not cut out for this role? It's frustrating to watch someone who doesn’t know how to handle themselves take charge when they’re clearly out of their depth. When I see that look of desperation, I want to step in and offer my guidance. I can see the fear behind his eyes – he’s desperate to save lives, but he’s doing it all wrong. I feel like I’m stuck in limbo, watching patients suffer while he makes decisions that could put them in more harm than good. He needs to learn from me, but I'm starting to wonder if he'll ever realize his mistakes. This is hard to watch. I know I could have helped, but no one wants my input. Even though I've been working here longer, the resident thinks he knows better. It’s infuriating to see him fail, especially since we both graduated from the same program. I feel like I'm being held back, forced to wait until someone else makes a mistake so I can step in and fix things. It feels like I'm wasting my skills"
