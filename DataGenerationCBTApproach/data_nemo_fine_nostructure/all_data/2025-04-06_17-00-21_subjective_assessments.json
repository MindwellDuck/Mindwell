He hadn't seemed suspicious at first, but now he was slowing down, matching her pace. She felt a chill run down her spine as she realized she'd taken this shortcut too many times before to remember where it led. The streetlights here were infrequent, and the shadows long. Her heart began to pound in her chest, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She quickened her pace, but so did he. Fear gripped her, icy and paralyzing. She wanted to look back, but she didn't dare take her eyes off the path ahead.",

Every step she took felt like a betrayal, as if she was abandoning herself by moving forward. She glanced back once more, but there was nothing behind her, just darkness. Still, she kept walking, her mind racing with scenarios. It wasn't until she turned the corner and saw the streetlight up ahead that she finally felt safe enough to breathe again. But as she looked back, she wondered if she had imagined him altogether, or if he was still right behind her."

The world has changed so much since we last painted together - art is more commercialized now, and it's harder for us to make a name for ourselves in this industry. But she doesn't need me to explain anything; she already understands how hard it is for me to create something meaningful after everything that happened. It's like my mind is stuck, and no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to get back into the zone. Maybe it's because I've lost touch with what truly inspires me, or maybe it's because I'm too scared to take risks anymore. Whatever the reason, it's clear that I'm not the same artist I once was, and I don't know if I ever will be again. But despite all these thoughts, when she comes over and gives me a hug, telling me that \"she believes\" I'll figure things out eventually, it makes me feel better. It's like having someone who knows me inside out, who understands what it means to struggle, to lose passion, and to question one's own identity as an artist. When she says she believes I'll find my way back, it's like a weight lifts off my shoulders. For a moment, everything else fades away, and all that matters is that she believes in me. In that moment, I realize that sometimes you just need to trust that your feelings are valid, even if they're not rational. You don't"

The pain of feeling left behind by her own body intensified as she heard him chuckle, the sound echoing through her mind like a cruel joke. It didn't take much to imagine that he was enjoying the camaraderie and teasing each other's jokes, but why did it feel so personal? His laughter must mean he had forgotten all about the disappointment of their failed pregnancy, and now he was back to being carefree with his old life. The thought made her stomach turn and her eyes sting, tears welling up as she wondered if she could ever forgive him for this betrayal of trust."

The fact that everyone else seemed to be talking about it made her wonder if she'd somehow missed something—like an email or memo? She thought back to the last time she had sent one out, and it didn't seem to match. It wasn't until someone mentioned that it was supposed to go out today, which explained why everyone looked so nervous. Now that she knew what was going on, she realized she'd probably forgotten because she'd been too busy with other things. But now that she remembered, she felt a bit annoyed at herself for missing it. She wondered how many people were still working on it, and whether there was enough time left before it went live. It seemed like such a big deal; she hoped everything turned out okay. Maybe she'd end up being part of the team that worked on it. If nothing else, she could make sure all the documents were in order, just in case. This whole thing was starting to sound more manageable than she initially thought. Now that she had a better understanding of what was happening, she felt more in control. She could handle this after all, especially since she'd dealt with similar situations before. What really mattered was getting the job done and making sure it went smoothly. She could see herself handling it well; it wouldn't be difficult at all."
