A sudden gust of wind outside rattles the window, startling her. She swears she hears footsteps echoing down the hall, but no one else is there. Her heart races as she realizes all the other offices are dark, making hers stand out like a beacon.

Maybe mine is just... temporarily malfunctioning?\" But the doubts lingered. \"If I'm being paranoid, why does everything feel so... different tonight?\" It seemed too much of a coincidence that her alarm didn't go off for what felt like hours, especially since her neighbors always seem to be up late, working on their own projects. \"I wonder if they're having similar issues,\" she mused, \"Or maybe they're just more experienced than me.\" Still, the unease persisted, leaving her wondering if she'd simply imagined the whole thing—after all, it could've been nothing. But deep down, she knew it wasn’t just her imagination. Something had happened. And she couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d missed it. But then, she remembered how she had spent countless nights worrying about things like this, how every creak of the building made her jump, and how she always assumed the worst.

The girl's smile seemed genuine; they might be an older couple who've known each other for years. They were probably just excited to get out after being cooped up during lockdown. He wasn't even thinking of me when he polished the ring; he must've just done it out of habit. I'm reading too much into this. I need to stop overthinking everything. There are plenty of people in this world whose lives aren't connected to mine. This isn't about us; it’s about strangers enjoying life together. I’m just being paranoid again. I know I can’t control how others behave, but somehow I keep assuming every little thing relates back to me. I need to learn to separate things properly and let go of my insecurities. This is ridiculous; there are countless stories where people live happily ever after despite similar circumstances. My wife didn’t die because of anything I did or didn’t do; she simply passed away unexpectedly. This isn’t about me; it’s just a random occurrence. I shouldn’t be so sensitive.

It seemed to amplify every other sound in her mind, making her feel even more isolated. To make matters worse, the neighbor didn't even respond to her pleas, just kept blasting his music like he wasn't even bothered by her frustration.

I wonder if there's anything wrong with him mentally; maybe he just needs to toughen up or stop being so weak. I feel so disgusted by how much anxiety he shows in front of me; it's really disgusting how he can't handle even the simplest things.

Some days, I find myself reminiscing about our relationship, wondering what might have been if things had turned out differently. It's not a negative reflection, just a nostalgic feeling. When I think back, I remember her struggles with depression, which made me realize that we both faced challenges. Life has its ups and downs, and I'm grateful for the time we shared, even though it was cut short. I'm also aware of the distance between us now, but I don't let it weigh heavily on my mind. We may not be together physically, but her spirit remains strong, and I appreciate the lessons she taught me during our marriage. In hindsight, I wish I had been more supportive during those difficult times, but I didn’t know how to handle them then. Now, as I look through old photos, I see her smiling face, and memories flood my mind. Though I miss her dearly, I try to focus on the good times, cherishing the moments we shared.

The thought hit her like a punch, like someone had ripped open a door that was supposed to remain closed forever. She felt like she was drowning in a sea of questions, each one leading her further down the path of uncertainty. Why did he have to leave now, when everything else seemed fine? Hadn't they talked about this before? Didn't she know what he wanted? She couldn't shake off the feeling that there must be some mistake, that somehow, someway, he would turn up right behind her, like he always did. But deep down, a part of her knew better. It was too late for that kind of thing. He wouldn't just pick up where we left off. Life moved on, and hers was no exception.
