Her partner had left earlier for a work trip, the silence now echoing where his voice once filled the room. She noticed a photograph of them from last summer, her smile wider than his, and felt a pang of melancholy. The sunlight streaming through the window seemed to dim as she remembered their laughter that day, now replaced by an unfamiliar distance between them.",

He didn't seem bothered by her noticing the picture, nor did he try to explain why he kept it there. It was as if he genuinely didn’t care about how she felt, and she wondered if she meant anything to him after all. Their usual banter seemed to have faded away, leaving only awkward silences. Every time she looked around the empty space, she felt like she was staring into the abyss, with no one to share her thoughts with. Even the sun seemed to be hiding its face, as if it too had given up on them."

At least when I was working at the other place, they didn't make me feel like trash. Here, I'm constantly stressed out thinking about all the mistakes I'll make and how you'll yell at me for them. You make everyone feel miserable. I'm just tired of being treated like dirt and having nothing to look forward to except more yelling and criticism. My self-esteem is shot, and I hate coming to work every day because of your constant belittling. **Chef:** What are you talking about? You're just lazy! Now stop standing there and get back to work! **Sous-Chef:** *mutters under his breath* Great, another chance to be yelled at. This is such bullshit. I hate my job, and it's all because of you. I wish I could quit, but I need this paycheck. How can something so simple like cooking become so complicated and stressful"

She couldn't shake off the feeling that this might be the last chance to prove herself, and everything was riding on this one presentation. She had spent countless hours preparing, but now doubts crept in. What if her colleagues are still thinking she’s an outsider? What if they see her as less capable than the others? What if she can't hold their attention anymore? What if her age makes them question her intelligence? The silence after the comment seemed to stretch forever, and she wondered if anyone else was going through the same anxious thoughts. Was this really how people saw her now? Did they look down on her for being younger? She tried to push these worries aside and focus on the task at hand, but the fear lingered, making her feel even more insecure. How would she show them that she was more than just her age? Could she overcome this hurdle and make a good impression? She took a deep breath and decided to move forward, hoping that this moment wouldn't define her future in the company. But the fear of what-ifs continued to haunt her, making her wonder if she'd ever truly fit in"

He found himself checking his watch every few minutes, hoping she might return. But as the clock ticked towards five and the other assistants began to trickle out, he knew she wasn't coming back today. The weight of neglect settled heavy on his shoulders, a familiar ache resurfacing from years past when his own children had grown up and moved away.

As she left, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd overreacted, that maybe I'd imagined the whole thing. It was probably just my mind playing tricks on me again, like when my kids grew up and left home. I hadn't expected it to hit me like this, especially since I'd already lost my wife last year."

With each drop, she felt a pang of rage. This was supposed to be her breakout exhibition, not another chance for some stuffy old man to prove his superiority. Her hands trembled as she threw the empty tube into a pile of crumpled papers, knocking over a half-finished cup of coffee in the process.
