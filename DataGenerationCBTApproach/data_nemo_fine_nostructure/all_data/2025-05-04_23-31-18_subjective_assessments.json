        "Triggering Event": "She sat alone in her cubicle, the hum of the office muted around her. Her eyes scanned the obituary section, pausing at a familiar name. The wife of an old college friend had passed away unexpectedly. She felt a lump form in her throat as she remembered their shared laughter, late-night study sessions, and the promise they'd made to keep in touch no matter where life took them. She hadn't spoken to either of them in years. Tears welled up, blurring the page. She missed the past, the friendship that had slipped away, and the countless moments they'd never have now.",

They could've caught up, reminisced about good times, and maybe even started new projects together. He was always so full of life, and I... well, I'm just not like him. My lack of enthusiasm must have been a burden, making him feel lonely. It's hard to imagine what our lives would look like now if we’d stayed friends. This is going to be a tough day for everyone who knew her. There are probably hundreds of people who miss her as much as I do, but I’m pretty sure most don’t think about it as often as I do. Maybe it’s because I’ve spent more time thinking about what could’ve been rather than focusing on what she actually did while she was here. But honestly, I wish she wasn’t gone. If anything, this just makes me realize how much I’ve wasted by not reaching out sooner. Now, all I can do is wonder—what would my life have looked like if I had kept in touch? Would I be happier, more fulfilled? Probably not. At least, not as much as he seemed to be when he was alive."

Not just any laugh, but the kind that crinkled his eyes and made his shoulders shake. The same laughter he rarely shared with her anymore. She felt a pang in her chest, an ache that seemed to grow heavier as she watched them from across the room. Her coffee sat untouched, growing cold beside her.",

Or would it become a distant memory, lost in time? It’s possible that he was just joking around, but deep down, she couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to it. Maybe this wasn’t just a casual encounter, maybe it was something more serious. Her mind started racing with scenarios—would they talk alone, or would he come back to join her? What if they had a private conversation, and he finally opened up about how much he missed her? Would he even notice her sitting here, watching him? All these thoughts swirled inside her head like a whirlpool, pulling her under. It seemed impossible to escape their grip. She felt trapped by the possibilities, unsure which direction her life was headed. In the end, it didn’t change anything. He still came over, and we sat together. But the question lingered, refusing to let go. What if things had been different? What if she had stayed longer? What if..."

It's just ridiculous how everyone is fawning all over him, hanging out together in the hallway, and talking about him behind my back. I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm boring, and I know it for sure—people don’t want to be around me anymore. I try to smile and act friendly, but nothing works. Everyone looks at him with such enthusiasm when he walks by, and I can tell they think I’m weird. Just thinking about it makes me feel even more insecure and self-conscious.
