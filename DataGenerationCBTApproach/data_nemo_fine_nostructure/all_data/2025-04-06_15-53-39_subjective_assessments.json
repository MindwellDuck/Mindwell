Her gentle touch had soothed his pain when he was sick, and her bright smile had lit up even the darkest days. She'd been more than just a friend; she was his safe haven, his partner in every sense.

In this moment, all that matters is holding onto those memories, cherishing the love they shared, and honoring her legacy by living our best lives. We'll keep moving forward, one step at a time, knowing that every day we spend here is a testament to the beauty of our bond and the joy she brought into my world. She may be gone, but her spirit will live on through me, guiding me toward happiness and reminding me of the countless moments that made our friendship so special. # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # # # # ## ## ## ## ## ##"

The Wi-Fi is down because my nephew kept downloading movies instead of doing his homework.” # Output End ## Explanation: This response reflects the cognitive distortion ‘Discounting the Positive’ as it dismisses the fact that the Wi-Fi has been down three times this month, downplaying its significance by focusing solely on the current incident. By minimizing the impact of the recent issues, John avoids acknowledging the broader pattern of problems with the internet, which might have triggered more patience from Mary. Instead, he shifts the focus back to the immediate problem, making it seem like the current issue is an isolated event rather than part of a larger trend. ## Step 1: Identify the Trigger Identify what triggered the response (the Wi-Fi being down). This is the key event that set off the distorted thinking. ## Step 2: Analyze the Response Analyze the response to identify the cognitive distortion. In this case, the response is focused on dismissing the repeated nature of the Wi-Fi issues. ## Step 3: Explain the Distortion Explain how the response reflects the ‘Discounting the Positive’ distortion. In this scenario, the response minimizes the impact of the repeated issues by focusing on the immediate problem, ignoring the broader pattern. ## Step 4: Provide Examples Provide examples where the distortion"

Now, I'm supposed to believe she thought about all those artists who were waiting for their work to go out? I don't think so. It makes no sense that she didn't think through the logistics of having everything ready to go by the deadline. This is all about her ego anyway; she wants to make a name for herself as an artist again. If she really wanted to, she could have made this happen sooner. I don't know why people are so surprised. I mean, my own family barely acknowledges my death after two years, let alone gives me a proper funeral. And here she is, expecting everyone to care about her latest art project. I've lost count of how many times she's told me how much her life has changed since we moved away—now she's more focused on \"building a career\" than spending quality time with her children. What does she expect me to do? Feel sorry for her? It doesn't seem like there's anything new or interesting coming from her, but I guess some people will buy whatever she creates. I can understand that if someone else wants to support her, even if it means sacrificing other things. But honestly, I think it's just another case of her throwing her emotions into her art because she can't handle real-life problems anymore. I wish"
