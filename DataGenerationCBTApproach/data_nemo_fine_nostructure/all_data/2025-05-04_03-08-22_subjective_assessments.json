He approaches cautiously, heart pounding, imagining all sorts of scenarios - a student with a grievance, an intruder casing his house. As he nears, she looks up, revealing tear-stained cheeks and a familiar face. It's not a stranger, but his own granddaughter, whom he hasn't seen in years due to a falling out over his rigid views on history. She's here now, not for a pleasant visit, but because her father, his son, has been arrested for protesting.",

What would I know about what goes on in this girl's life? How could I possibly understand her feelings? And yet, here she sits, looking so much like me when she was her age. She must think I'm some kind of idiot, someone who doesn't even notice that she's there. Why would she stay? Does she think it's funny to pretend she's my daughter? Doesn't she realize how absurd that is? I'm the one who taught her everything I know, after all. But no, instead of showing gratitude, she chooses to sit on my porch, just like a stranger. Or worse, a thief. Does she think I don't have a right to be concerned? My granddaughter isn't even supposed to be living in our town anymore. Her father, my son, shouldn't be in jail. They're both fine people, but they made some bad choices. This whole thing started as a misunderstanding. We were discussing historical facts, and somehow it escalated into...this. But does she care about that? No, she's probably just waiting for an opportunity to steal something. Maybe she's planning to run off with some boy friend, just like her mother did. I swear, if I'd known she was coming, I wouldn't have let her onto my property. That's right;"

Even though the whimpering sound made him tense up, he pushed those feelings aside, thinking maybe it was just an animal. His adrenaline still lingered from the stop earlier, but he chalked it off to nerves. There must have been another explanation for everything, so why bother getting involved? As he stood there, he began to feel uneasy, but he told himself he was being paranoid. Everything was fine, and he needed to focus on other things."

Maybe he felt like she was prioritizing work over him, which wouldn't be surprising given everything going on. Still, he probably wanted some reassurance, maybe a quick call to check if she was okay. She could see how worried he'd be, especially with their anniversary coming soon. It seemed like an easy mistake to make, considering how stressed out everyone was lately. She couldn't blame him for feeling that way, but deep down, she hoped he wouldn't think that way. They had talked about balancing work and personal life before, and she remembered him saying it was hard enough to keep the job and still have quality time together. This must be weighing heavily on him, and she hoped he wouldn't take it personally. It's not like she forgot about him; she just got caught up in her deadlines. Still, maybe he thought she was avoiding him, and that hurt more than anything."

That would explain why she hasn't called back yet - she doesn't want to hear my angry voice. It wouldn't take much for her to betray me like this; we've been married for nearly two decades. She's always had an easy time with men, and now she's probably meeting up with another one right outside our neighborhood.
