It wasn't just the peaceful atmosphere; it was the realization that this family was living life in harmony, while my own household seemed to have lost its rhythm long ago. My mind kept wandering back to how different things were when I was younger—how we'd gather around the table every night, sharing stories and laughter, our home filled with warmth and love. But now, as the years go by, those moments seem like a distant memory, and I'm left wondering if I've somehow missed out on something essential. Maybe it's time to reevaluate my priorities, to rediscover what truly matters in life. I've always been focused on building my business, but perhaps there's more to life than just work and success. I need to find a balance again, to make room for the simple joys that bring us closer together as individuals. Maybe tonight will be the start of something new—a chance to reconnect with my family, to rebuild those bonds that once brought me so much happiness. As I continued walking, the sound of children's giggles carried further into the distance, filling me with a sense of longing. I hoped that one day soon, I might experience such moments again, and maybe even learn from the younger generations who seem to live life with such ease. They didn’t have the same responsibilities as adults, and their carefree nature inspired me to reconsider my"

This time, he was leaving her behind. The tears fell harder now, each one telling a story of what could have been if only things had worked out differently. Her mind kept replaying the memories they shared, from their first date to the late-night talks about life. She remembered how he'd told her about his struggles with anxiety, how he struggled to open up after years of keeping himself hidden. Now, he was gone, and she felt abandoned. She wondered if he still loved her, but his silence was deafening. What if he didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore? Was she just holding him back? In her mind, every moment since then felt like a mistake, like she’d misread everything. They were meant to be together, to build a future filled with dreams and laughter. But now, she was alone, left to pick up the pieces of a shattered heart. Why did he leave? Hadn't he said he loved her just days before?

It really is pointless trying to revise again; it won't make a difference. All those hours I spent writing are gone, and now I feel like such an idiot. I might as well quit now and find another job. At least then I'll have some peace. But honestly, I'm too tired to keep going. I guess I'll just take the easy way out and stop working on this. Who cares if I fail now, right? Why bother even trying anymore? My life is over, and it's all because of these stupid papers. My wife's right; things will be fine. She knows better than me. Maybe I should just leave her alone and let her handle it. This rejection letter means nothing compared to how stressed I am about our bills. I wish I could just ignore the whole thing and focus on what really matters - making money. At least then I can tell myself I'm doing something worthwhile. ### Output"

You're just selfish people who don't even know how much pain you cause them. This isn't about blaming; it's about being honest. People need to see the truth about themselves and their actions. If we make excuses for our own failures, we'll never learn from them. It's easy to point fingers at someone else when things go wrong, but if we really want to grow, we have to take responsibility for ourselves. We can't keep blaming others for our problems. That's just an excuse. When I think about Jamie, I feel so angry—angry that his parents aren't there to support him, angry that he has to suffer like this because of them. But deep down, I know I'm angry because I wish I could be the parent Jamie needs. I've seen this before. Kids struggle when their parents are absent or distracted. Maybe if Jamie's parents took their job seriously, they wouldn't have left him to fend for himself. But let's not forget, this is still Jamie's fault. He chose to give up. I remember when I was in school, I struggled too. My parents were always busy, and I felt abandoned. I"
