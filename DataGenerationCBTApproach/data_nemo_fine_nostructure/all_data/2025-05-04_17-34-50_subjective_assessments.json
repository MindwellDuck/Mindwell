It would be so unfair if that happened, especially since I've seen colleagues get promoted without even one year of experience! This thought keeps creeping into my mind, making it hard for me to focus on my work. Sometimes I feel like it's all just a big game, and I'm just an insignificant pawn waiting to be replaced by someone younger and more ambitious. But then again, maybe this is just my paranoia talking... You see, I'm constantly wondering what could go wrong for me. Maybe I'll get fired for no reason? Or maybe the company will downsize and I'll end up losing my job because of something I didn't even do? My mind just can't stop spinning these worst-case scenarios. Even though I try to push them away, they still linger in the back of my head. And honestly, it's starting to affect my mood. I feel anxious and stressed all the time, worrying about things that might never happen anyway. But hey, at least I'm thinking ahead, right? That's what matters.

I can't help but feel a pang of sadness every time I think about him. Even though we don't talk anymore, I still find myself wondering what happened. Did he lose someone close? Was there something going on in his life that made him pull back? Or is it all just because he's grown up? I wish things could go back to the way they used to be, where we could share laughs and dreams together. But life moves forward, and sometimes people drift apart without even realizing it.

He thinks I'm perfect, and he deserves it because he's the good one. It makes sense that he'd rather spend the night with someone else than with her. He probably has someone else waiting for him, and she can't compete. This isn't the first time he's been distant lately, and it won't be the last. Maybe if she was better, more responsible, then maybe he wouldn't feel so disconnected from her anymore. But deep down, we both know she can't change.
