His colleague, ten years younger and recently promoted, leans over to show him a photo on his phone - a Caribbean beach backdrop with a caption reading \"Celebrating another record-breaking quarter! #workhardplayhard\". The man feels a pang in his chest as he forces a smile, saying, \"That's great, Jake. You deserve it.\"",

It's clear this is more than just a friendly gesture; there's an undercurrent of jealousy, a resentment that this younger guy has outdone him time and time again. He can't help but think about how much harder he worked for every milestone, how many late nights and sacrifices he made, all for nothing. This isn't just about celebrating success; it's about rubbing salt in his wounds. Every time Jake comes over, it feels like he’s reminding him of what he doesn’t have, of the gap between them growing wider. That photo wasn't meant to be inspiring; it was meant to hurt."

What if this isn't going to be good enough? What if I'm just making things worse by overthinking? She tried to shake off those thoughts, but they lingered, especially after dinner when he didn't seem impressed. Was it because she messed up the presentation slightly or because he was still reading his paper? She wondered if maybe the way he looked away during service told him something about the food, but then again, what if he was just bored? This situation keeps replaying in her mind, making her question everything. Even though she knew he liked her cooking, she can't help but wonder what would happen if she messed up completely. Would he leave, or would he find some way to justify it? She feels like she’s stuck in a loop, constantly wondering what could go wrong. Maybe she needs to stop thinking so much and just enjoy the meal, but the fear of not meeting expectations hangs over her like a cloud. What if, what if...? It's all swirling in her head, making her anxious. She wishes she could put it out of her mind and focus on the people she loves, but these doubts keep creeping back in."

He always left for work before she woke up, so why couldn't he stay home for dinner? Didn't he care about how much effort she put into cooking? How could he expect her to manage everything by herself? Her hands were stiff, her knees creaky, and her mind tired from planning meals all day. And what about the kids? They're going to have to help clean up too, but will he even notice? No, he won't. He's busy working, and I'm always the one who has to make things right around here. It's unfair. He knows how hard I work, especially since I've been dealing with chronic pain lately. Doesn’t he know how much stress it puts on me? He'll probably just blame me for leaving the stove unattended anyway. \"You're careless!\" or \"You never listen.\" That's typical. He doesn't understand anything. We’re always arguing about something—my health, his job, the kids’ behavior…he never listens when I try to explain my needs or frustrations. But no, he just gets defensive and dismissive. It's exhausting. I swear, sometimes I think he forgets that I’m the one holding our family together. Without me, life would fall apart. But"

Despite this setback, she refused to give up. Every day, she worked tirelessly on her writing, honing her skills and building her portfolio. She spent countless hours researching stories that needed to be told, pouring over articles and books on topics like human rights abuses and corruption. But despite her efforts, she faced rejection letter after rejection letter. It wasn't just editors who rejected her; even small-time publications with limited budgets turned her down. This cycle of disappointment wore her down, making it harder for her to keep going. Some days, she felt like throwing in the towel, letting go of her dreams and moving on to something else. However, every time she thought about quitting, she saw the lightbulb moment – the realization that she was stronger than those rejections. She took a deep breath, telling herself, \"This is normal. It takes time.\" But as the days went by, the rejections kept coming, and she began to doubt whether she was really cut out for journalism. One day, while scrolling through social media, she stumbled upon a post about a local woman who became a successful journalist after years of perseverance. The story inspired her to push forward, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that maybe she was just deluding herself. Maybe there was no point in continuing – maybe she wasn't meant to make it big."

What's the point? We're stuck here with nothing but each other. She just left me high and dry. I can't believe she'd abandon us like this, especially when we need each other most. I know she thinks she’s doing the right thing, but honestly, it feels like she doesn’t care about our future together. Now we have to deal with all this alone, and I’m so frustrated.
