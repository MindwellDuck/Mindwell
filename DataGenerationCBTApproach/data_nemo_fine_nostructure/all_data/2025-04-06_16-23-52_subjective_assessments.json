It wasn't until later that night, though, that he began to feel the weight of the silence in his home.

The memories lingered, like shadows cast by flickering candles, reminding him that even after all these years, he couldn’t shake the pain of losing someone who once shared every moment with him. Yet, despite this, he found himself smiling wistfully as he cooked, lost in thought, wondering what would have been if she were still there."

She knew she needed to keep moving, but her body seemed frozen in place, unable to respond to her frantic signals. It was as if time itself had slowed down, giving her a moment to realize the extent of her anxiety. But instead of relief, she felt trapped inside this endless loop of fear, unable to escape its grasp. Even the thought of going to class now felt like a monumental task, a challenge she might not be ready to face.

They're never the ones who get hurt. This poor kid is going to need some serious medical attention, but I'm sure he'll be fine soon enough. But why can't he see that things like this happen when you don't take care of yourself? Why are people always surprised when they end up getting hurt because they're stupid? This is what happens when you drink too much alcohol and try to fight with your friends. We should make sure everyone knows how dangerous it is to get drunk and act reckless. Maybe if these kids learned better than to drink and fight, we wouldn't have to deal with situations like this every week. We really need to educate our youth about the dangers of underage drinking and brawling. If they had been smarter, none of this would've happened. But instead, now we have to worry about how many more times something like this will happen in the future."
