Maybe it’s not just one guy, maybe he does it with everyone. I don’t even want to think about what might be going through his mind when he looks at these strangers; I bet he’s already planning his next move, thinking about ways to make them fall for him.

She had just finished folding a stack of sweaters when she noticed it: a small, handwritten note tucked into the sleeve of one. It read, \"I'm sorry I couldn't afford to buy this for you.\" Her heart sank as she recognized his messy scrawl. Another reminder of her failed relationship and the life she'd hoped to build with him.

She shook off the thoughts, refocusing on the task at hand. Still, the note lingered in her mind, like a ghost from a past life. She sighed inwardly, wondering if anything would change now. Would things somehow shift? Or would they continue down the same path, leading nowhere? She glanced around the store, feeling lost in the silence. Every glance seemed to reveal something new - a forgotten box of tissue paper, a shelf of dusty jars, an empty chair across the room. Each thing seemed to whisper secrets, drawing her deeper into herself. And yet, she felt no comfort in these reminders. Only a sense of disconnection, as if everything around her was slowly unraveling. She began to fold another sweater, trying to shake off the feeling of being trapped in a world that didn’t make sense anymore. But every movement felt forced, each gesture echoing through her mind like a broken promise. As she looked down at her hands, now trembling, she realized she might never find peace again. The note still clung to her mind, its words seeping into her bones like autumn rain. She knew she needed to"

I mean, we all know she's had some tough times lately, so maybe she expects more from the system. But honestly, it just looks like she wants sympathy. I don't think she even realizes how much she's putting herself down. She keeps saying she can't believe she let things get this far, but I guess you could say she's being overly sensitive about it.
