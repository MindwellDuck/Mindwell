It was filled with notes detailing a scandal that would've made his career if he'd broken it back in the day. The handwriting was familiar, belonging to his former partner who had betrayed him during their divorce. He felt a cold surge of vengefulness as he read, realizing this could be his chance to expose her treachery and reclaim some semblance of victory from the wreckage of their shared past.",

I know exactly where she hid all those documents, and soon everyone will see how dirty she really is. It feels like every time I think I've finally moved on, there's another piece of evidence that makes me want to take her down. And now, with these new notes, she knows exactly which buttons to press. This isn’t over yet; I’m just waiting for the right moment to strike back. When the time comes, I'll make sure everyone remembers why she should never have left me. This whole situation has been a long time coming, and I'm ready to put everything out there. She thought she’d gotten away with it, but now she’s in my sights again. I’ve kept track of every little thing, and I know exactly where she’ll fall next. She might think she’s safe, but she’s playing with fire. The more I learn about what she did, the angrier I become. It’s hard not to feel like I’m being pulled deeper into a nightmare, but I won’t let her win. Not anymore. We’re not done here, not by a long shot. She thinks she"

You're just being selfish.\" My mind went blank. How could she say something so hurtful? Didn't she remember all the late nights we'd spent talking about our future plans? Didn't she care about my well-being? I tried again, this time focusing on the positive. \"But think about it—our business is growing. We need to make some tough decisions to ensure its success.\" Still, she refused to budge. \"Your words are just an excuse to get out of dealing with the real issue,\" she shot back. It felt like she was attacking everything I believed in. I realized then that I couldn't change her mind, no matter how hard I tried.

Even the sun beating down on her skin feels like a punch to the gut, reminding her of how much she misses him. But why does she feel this way? Is it really about the noise or is it something more? She tries to push away the thoughts, to distract herself with work or TV, but nothing works. The emotions linger, making her feel like she's drowning in a sea of sadness. And now, this noise has triggered them all over again. Why can't she shake off these feelings? She knows she needs to talk to someone, but the thought of opening up to anyone scares her. What if they don’t understand what she’s going through? What if they see her as weak or unstable? Or worse, what if they tell her to get over it already? That wouldn’t help at all. But deep down, part of her wishes someone would take responsibility for her pain, that someone else could finally fix things for her. It’s been six months since the accident, and she still feels lost. Everything feels empty without him. She can’t focus, can’t sleep,"
