It was clear that no one had noticed anything unusual before, as if they were all too engrossed in the discussion to notice his attire.

Maybe if we were more popular or had connections, things would have gone differently, but now what? It feels like we're just pawns in some game she's playing to make herself look good. I bet there's another artist waiting in line to replace us, someone she thinks is better suited for her vision. We're nothing but disposable pieces to her, and she knows it.

Maybe this wasn’t the first time he’d forgotten—after all, he often got caught up in meetings or calls. Still, it felt like a pattern of neglect. She thought about how they’d planned their dates around his schedule, always finding ways to fit in when he was free. Now, as she looked at the untouched food, she wondered if he was avoiding her, if there was something more going on than just work. It seemed like every other week, he'd cancel or leave early. Shouldn't he prioritize their time together? Didn’t he want to spend quality hours with her? But then again, maybe she was overreacting. After all, she knew John loved spending time with her, but lately, he'd seemed distracted. His eyes would glaze over during conversations, and he'd interrupt her to check his phone. Was it really worth fighting over these little things, or was she reading too much into it? Maybe he just needed some space, or perhaps he was dealing with stress at work. Did she expect him to put everything else aside for their dates? She pushed the thoughts aside, letting the clock tick louder in the silence. It was just one missed evening; surely he’d show up tomorrow, wouldn’t he? Still, the doubt lingered. Had she misread his signals? Or was"

Why did they have to be so careless? Now look what's happened. My partner could have died tonight, and now she's just sitting here, okay, fine, she might need some stitches, but still. She's going to be shaken by this, and she has no one to blame except herself. I'm so angry, and I know I shouldn't be, but I just want to yell at her for being stupid. I'm going to talk to her, make sure she understands how dangerous she was being and how much we need to watch each other's backs. This whole situation is so frustrating, and it's all because of that driver. I hope they get the message: you can't drive like that in our city. We have too many people with families to protect."

That moment felt too specific, too deliberate, to be mere chance. It was as if the universe was nudging her toward a realization, one that would change everything she thought she knew about herself and her art.

It was as if every brushstroke was a challenge, with the critic waiting patiently to tear him down. Even when he took breaks, the critic's presence lingered, making him question whether his art was truly appreciated. As he worked through the night, the critic's criticism became more than just words – it felt like a personal attack, forcing him to confront doubts about his own worth. Despite his efforts to push forward, the critic's voice grew louder, urging him to give up. But he refused to let it get to him, instead using the energy to fuel his passion for creating. Yet, even as he painted, the critic’s words continued to echo, pushing him to keep going – not just for himself, but also as a way to prove that he didn’t need anyone else to validate his art. With each passing hour, the critic’s influence grew stronger, turning what could have been a peaceful evening into a battle within. As the sun began to rise, he finally stepped away from the canvas, exhausted but determined. Though the critic remained silent, its impact lingered, leaving him wondering how long he could continue to resist its constant barrage. For now, though, he would hold on to"

Probably just trying to impress some young doctor who's new to town. I bet he's the one she was talking to earlier. That's why she turned away so fast. Yeah, definitely just a friendly chat about the latest medical breakthroughs. This isn't surprising. Even if she did smile at me, what could we have in common? I'm a relic of an outdated profession. My stories are irrelevant now. I don't belong anywhere except maybe a nursing home. Why would she waste her time chatting with someone like me? It's okay. I shouldn't expect anything more. There's always another chance somewhere else. Maybe I'll go back to volunteering at the local animal shelter. At least there, people won't think twice about my appearance. And it's free.
