What if he really did break up with her for someone else? And what if that's exactly where they were when he wrote this letter? Three months ago, during a trip to visit family. He had been so secretive, always saying he needed time alone, that she'd assumed he was just working late nights. But now, what if he was seeing someone else? What if I'm just overreacting? Maybe he meant to send it but lost it somewhere along the way. Or maybe—no, no, it can't be. If it wasn’t addressed to him, then why is it here? Did he put it there himself? How does one accidentally leave a letter that’s clearly meant for another person in your home? She felt a pang of doubt, wondering if she’d misinterpreted everything. Could it have been an honest mistake? Shouldn’t she try to understand things better before jumping to conclusions? Still, the question lingered, \"What if...?\" What if he really didn’t want me anymore? What if we’re done before he even knew it himself?"

She wonders if he's been working harder at home but not applying that same dedication here. Maybe he's just avoiding her? She thinks back to all the times he's left dirty dishes for her to wash, even though he knows how much she hates that chore. She feels hurt that he would forget something as simple as cleaning up after himself. It makes her think maybe he's just too lazy to put in the work, especially since they've had arguments over household chores lately. She starts imagining him being unfaithful with one of the new waitresses, wondering if she's noticed anything suspicious. She realizes she's probably overreacting, but still feels upset. She decides to confront him later about how he always leaves the mess for her to clean up."

It's absurd to think she would write something like that. We were happy together, weren't we? Her disappearance feels like some kind of cruel joke, but I know deep down she wouldn't just leave like that. Why would she? What could possibly make her want to disappear like this? She wasn’t capable of such behavior; she loved me too much. This isn’t real life—it must be some kind of twisted dream where everyone else is there but me. How can someone who loves you walk away like this? Doesn’t it feel like she’s playing some sick game, making me believe she left just to see if I’d notice? Why would anyone leave like this? Did I even mean enough to her? Wasn’t I always there for her? It doesn’t add up. She wouldn’t just vanish without warning. Something must have pushed her away, but what? And why does she think she can just leave like this, after everything we shared? Does she think I’m just going to forget about all those memories?
