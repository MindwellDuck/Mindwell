She thought about how nice it would be if she could have enjoyed the sunshine while playing tennis this afternoon, but now she wouldn't have time for it because the police are here, and they always ruin everything. The sun is shining too brightly today, like an omen. Maybe she won't even get to see the sunset later. This is all terrible. She went back inside, where her husband's family members were waiting anxiously. They seemed very happy when she told them she got a parking ticket recently, as if that was a good thing. Now, they'll probably spend their Saturday going through old papers and looking for more tickets. That's such a waste of time. A neighbor who lives next door called her earlier, saying he wanted to borrow some tools. He sounds so cheerful, like everything is fine. But I bet he doesn't know what's really going on - they're probably searching his house right now, just like they did hers. And why else would someone want to borrow tools? It can't be a coincidence that my car broke down again. Someone must be trying to make me feel bad. She thought about calling her friend, but then remembered that her friend has been having problems lately too, and might need help. So instead, she decided to read a book.

She wouldn’t have that kind of relationship with someone else - it was too sudden. They barely knew each other. No, I won’t believe that. It has to be some mistake. Maybe it belonged to a friend? Or perhaps she bought it by accident at a store she visits often. Yeah, that makes sense. And why would she buy something so...out of character? This is ridiculous. I need to stop thinking about this. But how can I when my mind keeps conjuring images of her being flirtatious with some guy? I know what I saw - it was definitely not hers. We’ve discussed our favorite lipsticks many times, and hers are always such safe choices. There’s no way she’d suddenly pick up a bold color like this. It must be some sort of prank or a joke. Someone must have put it there to make me jealous, but who? The thought sends a shiver down my spine. I’m going to confront her, ask if she knows anything about it, but I know I’ll get defensive reactions. She’ll probably deny everything, or worse, try to convince me it’s none of my business. If I bring it up, she’ll become angry, and I don’t want that. I just need to ignore it until it goes away. But why am I doing this? Why am I letting myself"

It wasn't just the way she fell; it was the look in her eyes before...before everything. She seemed so peaceful, almost serene. But then, the pain hit, and everything changed. Martha had told him about her friend, how they'd been friends since childhood. How she'd confided in her about her struggles, her fears, and her dreams. They'd talked about everything under the sun—life, love, and loss. This particular conversation stood out because Martha mentioned something about a recent argument between the two women. \"She said her husband was cheating on her,\" Martha recalled, \"and she threatened to leave.\" At first, I thought nothing of it, assuming it was just another fight over something trivial. But when I saw the police arriving, something inside me snapped. I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd missed something critical, that I'd let my emotions cloud my judgment. Even now, I wonder if I could've done anything differently, if I'd been faster to act, if I’d seen the signs sooner. As we sat down to discuss what happened, I felt like I was reading from a script. Every word sounded rehearsed, every gesture forced. Martha tried to reassure me, but I couldn't help but feel like an outsider looking in"

This jacket is more than just fabric; it's a bridge between our lives, connecting us through time and touch. In its folds, I see the outlines of your hands, guiding me through recipes we created together. I remember how you'd run your fingers over the buttons, adjusting them until they fit perfectly. Your smell, too, lingers, reminding me of the countless nights we spent cooking together, the way the spices danced in the air, blending into something new and delicious. As I hold this jacket, I feel your absence deeply. It’s like holding a piece of my heart, because even when we were apart, it remained with me, a reminder of our connection. You might say it’s just an old jacket, but for me, it represents so much more—it represents our life together. Every meal, every conversation, every moment we shared—all those things are wrapped inside these simple threads. When I look at it now, I see the outline of your hand, tracing the lines of your palm where you’d always leave a little mark when we hugged. It feels like I’m holding him, even though he’s no longer here. And yet, I know what it"

We should get new bags soon, maybe as a surprise? He could be seeing someone else. It doesn't make sense that he would buy something like that if he didn't plan to use it himself. Maybe he gave it to her as a gift, but then why did she keep it? And wouldn't she have mentioned it earlier? She might have been using it after I forgot to replace mine with a new one. She often does things like that; sometimes I forget to replace my makeup, and she'll just use hers instead. But she wouldn't want to use your lipstick; you're really particular about your makeup!

I don't believe it. There has to be another explanation. Maybe the assistant accidentally took the wrong bag home, or it was meant for someone else entirely.....
