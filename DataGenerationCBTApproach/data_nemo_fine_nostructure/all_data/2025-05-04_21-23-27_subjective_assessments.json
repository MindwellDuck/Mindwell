They think they're being funny, but really, it's just another reminder of how much they disrespect our age. You know, back then, we didn't need fancy art supplies to create something beautiful; all we needed was passion and imagination. These days, everything is about technology and making money, and nobody cares about genuine creativity anymore. It’s sad, isn’t it? You see, people often overlook the beauty in aging. We may not be as spry as we once were, but our experiences have given us depth, wisdom, and a unique perspective. If these girls had taken the time to look closer at my work, they might have discovered a different side of me – someone who has lived through generations and seen the world change in ways both big and small. But no, instead, they chose to make fun of an old man, dismissing me as a relic of the past. It’s almost as if they don’t want to acknowledge the value I bring to the art world today. And then there’s the irony – they’re standing right outside my door, talking about how I’m “past my prime,” while they themselves probably couldn’t hold a brush correctly. It’s almost laughable how they judge me based on their narrow view of what matters in life. They seem so caught up in their own self-importance, completely"

Even though I knew he must have been going through some tough times, it didn't change how much I felt hurt. I can’t understand why he kept me away for so long. He should have made more effort. If he cared about us, he would have tried harder to stay connected. Maybe then things wouldn’t have turned out this way. Now, I’m left with feelings of anger and sadness, all because of what he did back then. I wish I could go back in time and make him see things my way. But life doesn’t work that way. All I can do is move forward, hoping he realizes what he missed. It's hard to see him like that again, especially since we've moved past everything. It feels like I'm reliving the pain all over again. I keep thinking he should have reached out sooner, but it might have made things worse. Still, I want to believe he'll come around eventually. After all, he does seem to have grown as a person. Maybe someday he’ll realize what he lost by keeping me away. Until then, I can’t shake"

He was gone, and this painting was just another reminder of that. It didn’t feel like progress, just pain. She thought about how he had loved her for who she was, flaws and all. How he’d been her rock, her partner in every sense. They were meant to be together, to build something beautiful. But now...now he was gone. She tried to remember the last time they’d spoken, the day he left. His words still haunted her: “You’ll never find anyone else like you.” She wondered if he really believed that, or if he just said it to keep her around. As she painted, the tears fell, not because she wanted them to, but because she felt like she needed to let go. She knew she couldn’t stay stuck in the past forever, but some part of her wanted to hold on to the memories, even the painful ones. Maybe it was just her way of keeping him alive in her mind, but deep down, she knew it was more than that. She felt lost, unsure where to turn or what to do next. All she could think about was"

But then, I saw it—a small note tucked between two bills, its handwriting familiar, yet somehow different. It read: \"For my future self.\" And in that moment, I knew that I was meant to keep going, to carry forward the life they had built together, no matter how difficult it would be. I felt a surge of determination, knowing that every penny, every memory, and every word held significance beyond its monetary value. This was more than just an inheritance; it was a reminder of the promise we made to each other, and the hope that one day, we'd find ourselves again. With every step forward, I felt the weight of his absence, but also the strength of his memory, urging me to move on, to build a new life, and to honor the love we once shared.
