I can’t imagine how hard this must have been for him, especially after everything they went through together. I wonder if she’ll ever forgive me for leaving her like that. # Example Explanation This response reflects the \"Mental Filter\" cognitive distortion because it focuses narrowly on the emotional impact of the situation, highlighting feelings of sadness and resentment toward her ex-husband without fully acknowledging the complexities involved. By concentrating solely on these emotions, the individual overlooks broader aspects such as the context of his death, the efforts she might make to heal, and the potential for growth in their relationship. This narrow focus creates an incomplete understanding of the situation, illustrating the mental filter effect where a limited perspective dominates the overall picture. # Example Discussion To address this distortion, consider reframing the response to incorporate a more balanced view. For instance: “While I understand her feelings, I worry about how this event might affect her healing process. Perhaps we could offer support during this challenging time.” By incorporating empathy and suggesting help, this revised response"
