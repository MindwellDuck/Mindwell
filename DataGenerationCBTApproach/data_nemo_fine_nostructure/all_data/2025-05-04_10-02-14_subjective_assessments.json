The whole incident seemed like more than just petty theft; it was about proving some point, maybe even challenging her authority. He'd been acting strange lately, always finding fault in what she did, never satisfied with anything she achieved. It wasn't just about the uniform; it was about showing her that she didn't deserve respect. She knew he wouldn't dare go behind her back like that if they were working together. But now, standing alone, she felt vulnerable, as if every move she made would be scrutinized. His actions weren't just about the uniform; they were a challenge to everything she believed in â€“ hard work, dedication, and fairness. Every day, she'd come to the range ready to prove herself, to show everyone that she deserved to be there. Now, the entire team's perception of her hung in the balance, and she felt trapped between defending her honor and letting it slide."

It seemed like no time had passed since they were students together, and now here he was, surrounded by people who clearly looked up to him as a colleague. What struck her most, however, wasn't that he'd moved on from their past, but rather that he hadn't even offered her his chair, something she would have happily accepted back then. She remembered how hard it was for him to stand for long periods during surgeries, especially after the pain had subsided, and wondered if this was another instance where he was being kinder to those around him than himself."

She keeps saying things like, \"Why can't you manage your time better?\" But does she ever think about how stressed out I am when I've got multiple projects due in a row? It's hard enough to focus on one thing, let alone juggling three at once while dealing with personal issues. If she'd just stop nagging me, I could finally breathe again."

That guy who came in here once? I remember him. He was really nice, and I could tell he liked me too. But no, he didn't have what it takes to make it work with me. This is why I need to stay away from men altogether. They're all liars. Why would anyone trust us anyway? We're just two broken people trying to hold onto each other while life keeps pulling us apart. I don't want to hurt anyone else like this; I won't risk it again. The pain is so overwhelming right now, and I wish I could just turn back time. If only I hadn't been so stupid... It's all because of him. Even though he broke my heart, I shouldn't be feeling this way. It's not fair to myself to get so upset. I should be happy that he moved on and found someone better. After all, if he doesn't care about me, then maybe I don't deserve him either. Maybe I've been holding onto things too tightly, making it impossible"

Every step she took felt like a struggle, as if the world around her was shifting, leaving her feeling lost and alone. The thought of rebuilding her life seemed impossible, especially when memories like this kept popping up. She knew intellectually that things would get better someday, but the ache within her refused to fade. It was as if she was drowning in a sea of sorrow, unable to find a lifeline to cling to. Sometimes, she wondered if this sadness was something she could ever truly escape."
