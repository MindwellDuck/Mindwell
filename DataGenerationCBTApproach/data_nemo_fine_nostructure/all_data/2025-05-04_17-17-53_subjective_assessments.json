As he looked closer, he realized it wasn't just any painting; it was one of her best works, showcasing her talent before she moved away. The memory came flooding back, but instead of happiness, he felt resentment. She had never returned the favor, leaving him alone while she pursued other opportunities. Now, here it was, a reminder of what could have been if she stayed. Her smile seemed to mock him, a cruel contrast to how he felt inside."

It's sad that someone like him still tries to create art; they probably won't ever get good enough anyway. Maybe he should just retire and stop embarrassing himself. What would he do with all those years of experience then? Just sit around doing nothing. No wonder he's so upset about this one piece - it's just another sign of how far he has fallen from his prime. Poor guy needs to accept his decline and find something else to do with his life. He'll never go back to being as good as he used to be. At least he knows he's not good enough anymore. That must ease the pain somehow."

This is all because of how he treated me before, making me feel unimportant and unreliable. It’s no wonder my phone died now; it’s probably some kind of sign. Maybe we're meant to be here together for a reason, but since he chose not to follow instructions, I'm not sure if anything will come from it. The sound could just be another stray animal, but what if it was something more? What if someone else has been watching us from the shadows, using this moment to gather evidence against him? Or maybe there’s even a chance he didn’t mean to lead me into this trap. Still, the thought of being manipulated like this, of feeling like a pawn in someone else’s game, makes me question everything. I need to stay focused, but why did he leave me hanging like this?"

If he stayed longer at work, he missed her; if he came home early, he wasted precious lab time. Every choice seemed to lead down a path where he lost something valuable – whether it was the chance to bond with his daughter, the progress in his research, or even just the warmth of his wife’s love. The world felt divided into two extremes, with every decision forcing him to choose between what he wanted most: science or family, sleep or connection, or even silence over conversation. He couldn’t imagine a middle path where he could balance everything perfectly, because in his mind, each option meant giving up on something else. He wondered how many times he might have made this same choice before, always opting for one thing over another, never finding peace in the middle. Each day became a series of decisions, weighing the importance of each moment, never truly satisfied"

This is so typical of her; she often forgets things like this. Maybe it's better if I don't bring it up now. After all, what's the point? We've been together for many years already, and nothing has changed. I'm tired of thinking about how much time we've wasted on pointless arguments over little things. There's no use in dwelling on past disagreements. What's important is moving forward, not reliving old mistakes. If we were meant to be together, wouldn't life have made it easier by now? This isn't about me being upset; I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives together. I don't see why this one mistake matters so much. It's not worth causing more tension than necessary. Let's just leave it alone and move on. There's nothing we can do about it anyway. I'd rather focus on the good times we've had, not dwell on something that doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Why am I even thinking about this? It's not going to change anything. I'll let it go, because holding onto it won't make us happier. Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive again. She probably forgot, and there's no need to make a big deal out of it. It's not like it affects our relationship in any significant"
