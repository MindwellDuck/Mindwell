His heart pounded as he grasped for his phone, dialing her number with trembling fingers. It rang once before going straight to voicemail. Panic surged through him like a tidal wave, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He was alone, and something was terribly wrong.",

His mind raced wildly, desperate to grasp some semblance of control over the unfolding chaos. Every fiber of his being screamed at him to call again, to reach out, to somehow bridge the gap between them. Yet, each attempt ended in failure, leaving him more lost than ever. In this moment, he felt trapped by his own desperation, unable to escape the crushing weight of uncertainty. The world around him seemed to have melted away, leaving only the haunting echo of what could have been—what should have been—a reality now shattered beyond repair."

They look like tiny monsters and make you want to gag when you see them. It really annoys me how much he thinks they're awesome and fun to watch, but honestly, they're disgusting and creepy as hell.

It's just not fair how this is happening right now when everything else in my life is going well. I can't believe this is how it always ends—another failed attempt at creating something meaningful. How could I have been so stupid? I feel like I'm failing everyone who believes in me. And now I've wasted another day, which means I won't meet my deadlines...and then there will be more stress...and maybe I'll lose my job. Or worse, my partner won't want to spend time with me anymore. I hate these moments where everything falls apart. They're always so disappointing. It makes me wonder if I'm cut out for this art thing. Maybe I shouldn’t have taken this risk. My partner said we could cancel our plans tonight because she knows I’m struggling, but that doesn’t help me at all. Why does this keep happening? I feel like I’ve let everyone down again. I wish I could stop feeling this way. I wish I could make things easier for myself. I wish I didn’t care about what others think. But deep down, I know I do. I’m just too scared to admit it. I wish I wasn’t so sensitive"
