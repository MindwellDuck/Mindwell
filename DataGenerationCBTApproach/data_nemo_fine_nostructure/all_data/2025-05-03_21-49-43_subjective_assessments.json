It made her feel belittled, as if her work wasn't valuable enough to be entrusted to her directly. The fact that her editor had to ask someone else to review it was a clear indication that she didn't have the skills or authority needed for such important projects. This situation seemed to reinforce what she already thought about herself—that she wasn’t good enough to do this job seriously. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was just pretending to be a professional journalist, and her editor knew it. It was frustrating to think that her hard work and dedication were constantly questioned, making her wonder if she’d ever truly belong in this field."

He was worried about our future together and decided to end things. But when I found out about the text messages, it felt like the last nail in my coffin. All those times I thought we were working through our issues—wasn't it all just a lie? Maybe he never loved me, maybe he never even cared about me beyond sex. Was I nothing more than a convenient outlet for his loneliness? Everything seemed to be falling apart around me, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that everything was connected. Why did this have to happen now? Why couldn’t I just stay young forever? I’ve been holding onto this relationship for so long, hoping that somehow it would magically fix itself, but it’s clear that it's time to move on. It hurts to admit it, but I probably shouldn’t have stayed this long. I was making it harder for us both by clinging to something that no longer existed. Maybe if I had let go sooner, things might have worked out better for everyone involved. Now it feels like I’m just stuck in the past, unable to see that"
