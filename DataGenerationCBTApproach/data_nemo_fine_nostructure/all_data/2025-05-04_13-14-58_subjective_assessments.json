It seemed like she was reliving every moment they shared, each one etched vividly in her memory. Her eyes kept drifting toward the spot where he used to sit, and though she didn't say anything, her body language spoke volumes. There was an unmistakable yearning in her voice when she asked about him, a sense of emptiness that echoed through everything she did. It wasn't just a casual interest; it felt more like a deep-seated need, a craving that seemed impossible to satisfy. I can’t help but feel that she’s struggling to cope with her emotions, and maybe she needs some support to move forward."

He noticed an old photograph tucked into the corner of the blackboard, a candid shot of him and his ex-wife at a school function years ago. She was smiling broadly, her hand resting on his arm. A bitter taste filled his mouth as he picked up the photo, crumpling it in his fist before tossing it into the trash can.

His mind wandered back to when the room was full of students, their chatter and laughter filling the space. But now, the silence felt oppressive, a constant reminder of what he'd lost. He thought about his former student body president, someone who'd been incredibly popular during their time at the school. It wasn't just her charisma; she seemed to have an effortless ability to connect with everyone. Even the teachers praised her for her natural leadership skills, which she'd developed through hard work and dedication. He couldn't help but feel inadequate by comparison. There were moments when he wished he could be as well-liked as she was, but those thoughts only led to frustration. He wondered if there was something fundamentally wrong with him, making him so much less likable than his peers. Maybe it wasn't just his teaching style; perhaps he lacked some innate quality that made people want to be around him. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but the feeling lingered, leaving him feeling isolated and self-conscious. As he sat there, lost in thought, he glanced down at his desk. It was tidy, just as he liked it, but he couldn't shake the feeling that everything else in his life felt out of balance. The emptiness of his classroom seemed to mirror the emptiness within him, a stark contrast to the warmth and energy of his former students. He sighed, rubbing his tired eyes,"

How could he possibly know this? Did she tell him herself? No, of course not, but did she leave behind some sort of hidden message? I'm starting to think she left behind more than just her favorite album. Maybe there are hidden notes in every song, waiting for someone to uncover them. This is getting creepy... What's worse is that he didn't even notice when he walked past our workstations. He just casually strolled up and started singing along like nothing was out of the ordinary. What else does he know? Does he know where we live? Is he somehow connected to my late wife? I can't shake off the feeling that he knows something about me that I don't want him to know. This is all so unsettling... If you read this far, please know that I am not saying anything bad about the man. He simply got caught up in the moment, which makes things even stranger. But deep down, I wonder if there's more to this than meets the eye. Am I just being paranoid? ---"

Her mind wandered further, imagining if maybe they had even planned this whole day together, but that seemed unlikely. He never did anything like that. It probably meant nothing; it could be anyone’s handwriting. Yet, the thought of him forgetting—of not remembering to write such a simple message—made her heart ache. She wondered if he’d ever forget such things again, if he really needed reminders anymore. If he didn’t need her by his side, reminding him of everything. Or if he’d even want to come back here, to this place where memories lingered, holding onto what they could no longer hold.
