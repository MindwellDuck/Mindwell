This whole situation is just so fucked up, but I guess this coat is pretty important. We need to get it cleaned somehow. If I don’t, it’ll probably ruin the rest of his stuff. I can’t believe he did this. The way he just disappeared… I thought we were going to spend the rest of our lives together. Now everything feels like a lie. I hate him. This coat is proof of how much he doesn’t care about me anymore. Why would he leave it here? He must have forgotten it. But no, he wouldn’t forget something as important as this. He had to be doing something else. Maybe he went out with his friends again. Or maybe he found someone new. Ugh, I can’t stand thinking about it. This coat makes me sick. I wish I could just throw it away."

Her stomach twisted, not with hunger but with a familiar, bitter pang. They weren't touching, yet their shared smile felt like an intimate secret whispered between them.

But now it seemed even worse because she'd just seen him laughing with someone else. It wasn’t like they were holding hands; I could see their arms are by themselves, but they’re smiling at each other. The way he looks at her is so cute. He's talking to this girl who doesn't seem that interesting, but he still thinks she’s amazing. Why can't I be the one he chooses? I'm worth more than these people who don’t care about me. Maybe if I had a drink, my confidence would have been higher. Now I feel like I’m going to throw up. This is ridiculous. Stop being jealous, you need to stop feeling this way. You're overreacting again. If I hadn't drunk so much, I wouldn't feel this way. I really wish I didn't drink tonight. I hate how much alcohol affects me. I wonder what he said to that girl, maybe she has something I don't. I wonder why I never think about dating anyone anymore. This isn’t fair. I deserve better than this situation. I don’t want to go home alone, especially after seeing him with someone else. I hope no one notices me here. I wish I wasn’t here. I wish I didn’t come. I need to leave. My anxiety is killing me. I hope everyone leaves soon. I’ll just stay"

It was their youngest granddaughter, Lily, her cheeks flushed from the autumn chill. \"Grandpa,\" she said, \"I've made you some of your favorite apple pie.\" He took it with a nod, his eyes welling up as he noticed the familiar, meticulous handwriting on the note tucked beneath the crust: \"With love, for our little family tradition.\"",

They were so busy arguing about everything that I felt like I was walking on eggshells around them, never knowing what would set them off next. And now, here I am, feeling lonely again, wondering if anyone really cares anymore.\" I paused, letting those words sink in. Then I continued, \"It's like I'm stuck in this cycle, always waiting for someone else to fix things, instead of taking action myself. I guess I'm just too tired to try anymore. My life is full of reminders like this, and honestly, I don't see any point in changing anything.\" She looked taken aback by my words, but I didn’t care.
