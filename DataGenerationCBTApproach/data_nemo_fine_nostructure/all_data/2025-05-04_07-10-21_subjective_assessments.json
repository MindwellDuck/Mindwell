It's such a shame because I felt like we were getting along better lately. She was my best friend, you know? I miss her already. I'm still trying to process everything that happened, but I keep thinking about how much this will affect our work. We've been through so much together, and I always look forward to seeing her in the hospital. Now...now there's just an empty space where she used to be. This is all so surreal. I don't think I'll ever get over this. I wish I could turn back time. What if I had done something differently? If only I could have saved her. I feel so guilty now. She was in good hands with us, but maybe it wasn't enough. Maybe we didn't give her the care she needed. I keep replaying things in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. I don't want to see her bed anymore. Every time I walk by, I feel like I'm going to lose it. I'm so scared about what might happen next. Even though I knew it was coming, I never expected it to happen so suddenly. I'm not ready for this. I feel so alone right now. I keep checking on her room, hoping that somehow she'll wake up.

Fair comparison means comparing yourself with someone who has similar circumstances, background, and experiences as you. You are able to make valid comparisons by considering these factors before making judgments about people. ## Why Is Fair Comparison Important? ### Understanding the concept of fair comparison helps you develop realistic expectations and accurate assessments. - It allows you to focus on your own strengths and weaknesses rather than constantly comparing yourself to others. - Helps you avoid overestimating others' abilities due to biases and stereotypes. - Enables you to recognize areas where you need improvement and set achievable goals. ## Examples: 1. **Comparing Yourself to Someone Who Has Similar Experiences** \"I recently met another single mom who's also going through a tough time, trying to balance work and parenting alone. We bonded over our shared struggles, and she offered valuable advice on how to manage everything. Now I feel less isolated and more motivated to keep pushing forward.\" 2. **Considering Backgrounds Before Making Judgments** \"When I saw a post about a woman who lost her job due to company restructuring, I felt sad for her because we both graduated from"

She sneers as he approaches, \"Not you again, copper.\" His jaw tightens, remembering every time she's spat at him, laughed at his efforts to help her change. Today, though, there's a new twist. She points to a figure huddled in the doorway, barely visible in the shadows. \"He said you're too soft, that you can't do anything right.\" The young officer feels his cheeks flush with anger and humiliation, but beneath it all, a familiar spark of spite ignites.

One side represented the opportunity to prove himself worthy, while the other beckoned him towards the darkness of his own insecurities. It wasn’t just about saving her anymore; it was about validating his own worthiness to exist in this world. Every step forward felt like a betrayal, yet every step back felt like defeat. The woman’s words hung in the air like a challenge, daring him to take a stand. But what if standing meant surrender? What if taking a step forward meant giving up? The line between heroism and shame began to blur, leaving him questioning whether the real battle was against the outside world or within. And so, he stood there, frozen, unsure which path to choose, torn between the desire to protect and the need to defend himself. The night seemed to stretch out before him, a vast expanse of uncertainty, each choice leading further down a road he couldn’t see. He could either try to save her, risking everything, or walk away, abandoning the people who needed him most. Either way, he knew he’d lose something precious, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. The silence grew thicker, heavy with unspoken fears and unresolved doubts. In that moment, nothing seemed clear except for one thing: he was lost in the middle of nowhere, searching for a light"
