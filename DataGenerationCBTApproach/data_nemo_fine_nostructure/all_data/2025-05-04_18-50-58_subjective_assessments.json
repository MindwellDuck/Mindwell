He spots a young couple laughing loudly, their picnic blanket spread out across the freshly cut grass. As he approaches, they don't bother moving aside, forcing him to step into the muddy path around them. His dog growls at their carelessness, but they merely laugh louder, dismissing him as an old crank. The man feels a surge of hatred boiling within him, his hands shaking with anger as he pulls his dog away.",

They probably think I’m just a harmless old man who doesn’t know how to handle himself in modern society. If they were younger, maybe they’d even mock me for wearing this ridiculous hat or carrying such an outdated backpack. It’s pathetic that they can’t see my pain, their laughter making it worse. They’re probably from wealthy families, never having struggled like I did, and that’s why they have the audacity to treat me like dirt. My life isn’t fair, and this couple’s arrogance makes it all the more unbearable."

Despite his decades of teaching, this was the first time it had happened under his watch.

It just didn't feel fair. This is what I've been working towards my whole career, and now, it's happening. Even though I'm trying not to let it get to me, I can still see how ridiculous it looks. I mean, this is supposed to be a place where kids learn, not some kind of battleground. I feel like I’m failing everyone here. Every day, I tell myself, “You got this,” but now, I just feel so defeated. And honestly, I wish I could just leave. But I know I have to stay because I care about these kids, even if they don't seem to care about anything except themselves. I guess it’s funny, in a way, since I’ve seen a lot of kids act out in class before. But this feels different. This isn’t just another kid pushing boundaries—it’s my own school being defaced. I keep thinking about how I must look, standing there with my arms crossed, feeling so helpless. I don’t want anyone to think I’m weak or unable to handle the situation. I need to show them I"

The pain in his chest deepened, his eyes scanning the room for answers that wouldn't come. How could they say such things when they saw everything he did? It wasn't just criticism; it was a betrayal of trust, a slap in the face, a reminder that no matter how much he gave, he would always fall short.
