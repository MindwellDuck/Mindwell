The world had been reduced to one thing: her loss, a constant reminder that she could never go back to being the artist she used to be. Every glance at those paintings, every word about her husband’s enthusiasm for the man next door, it all seemed to mock her. It wasn’t just the painting; it was everything. She couldn’t even bear to look out the window, because if she did, she’d have to face the reality – reality she refused to accept. Reality was too painful, too overwhelming. So she stayed inside, locked away from the world, and from herself. And yet, every time she looked out, she saw him, standing there, smiling at everyone but her, completely carefree. He didn’t know what he’d lost – what she’d lost – and I knew exactly how much. I could feel it burning inside me, a flame that threatened to consume me whole. But I couldn’t let it. I had to keep it hidden, tucked away where no one else could find it. I had to pretend that everything was fine, that I was happy for him, that I understood why he’d want to hang these...these abominations on his wall. Why? Because I knew the truth – that this man, with his perfect smile and his innocent eyes, was nothing compared to me. To what I once was. What I could be"

Your scent lingers, an ache in my heart—longing for the warmth you brought. I imagine your footsteps, hesitant as if unsure of returning, yet drawn by memories. You seem to be holding on to something, a piece of yourself tied to this place. I wonder what it might be—a memory, a dream, or perhaps just a feeling that refuses to let go. Whatever it is, I hope it brings you comfort, knowing that here, our love remains. Though time has taken its toll, I still see us, together, laughing, sharing stories, and finding joy in each other’s company. In these moments, I’m convinced that you’re trying to tell me something, but I can’t quite decipher the message. Still, I hold onto the thought that you’re reaching out, even if it's just through the fragments of our past. I wish you could hear me, too, whispering words of reassurance, reminding you that no matter where life takes us, our bond will endure. Maybe someday, when the distance between us fades, we’ll find ourselves back here again, side by side, rediscovering the love that once was. Until then, I'll keep the light burning, a beacon in the darkness, hoping against all odds that you'll return to me, and we can rebuild what we"

Later, when he realized he couldn't calm down, he slammed the phone onto the table, releasing all the emotions he'd been bottling up inside. Now, every time he sees that vase, he feels like I'm losing control, and the memory of her ignoring me makes my heart sink. She doesn't deserve that vase, especially after everything we've been through together. I wonder if she thinks about us at all? Does she remember how much I sacrificed for her, just because she wanted to follow her dreams? It hurts to think that she might be doing better than me, even though I know I shouldn't compare ourselves. But I still can't help but feel jealous. Maybe I'll never forgive her for what she did.
