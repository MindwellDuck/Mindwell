It made me feel a bit uneasy because I've been trying to help people who are going through similar situations. But seeing someone else experience the pain I felt helps them cope better. Maybe she'll find comfort in wearing it again, just like I did during the holidays last year. It might seem weird, but thinking about how she feels makes me feel less alone. Even though we don't share a personal connection, knowing she understands what I went through gives me hope that others can too. Sometimes, hearing stories from strangers can make us realize we're not as isolated as we think."

When she told me that I would have trouble working with others, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. It made me realize how much pressure I'm under to perform well. Recently, I had a meeting with my manager where he mentioned something similar. He said that I needed to work on improving my collaboration skills and being more approachable for future projects. I felt uneasy knowing that this is exactly what the fortune teller had predicted. The fact that both events seem to align suggests that there's some truth to her predictions."

She really doesn't understand how hard it is to teach these days. I mean, look at all those kids who are already struggling with basic math. She thinks she can just hand out assignments like candy? No way. They need real challenges to keep up with the curriculum. I'd know - I've seen how much harder it gets as you move through grades. And if I were a teacher, I wouldn't give out easy stuff either. But when I saw that assignment, I thought, \"This is so simple! What kind of teacher gives their students easy work?\" It's almost insulting. The teacher probably wants to make my kid feel better after getting an F on the previous test. That's why she's making it so easy now. My kid deserves better than that. It's frustrating because I could easily come up with something much harder. Like, what if we did fractions instead of decimals? Or maybe even calculus? Yeah, that would really challenge her. But hey, at least she's trying to push her student's limits. I'll talk to her about it later. Maybe she needs some feedback from someone who understands what it takes to teach these"
