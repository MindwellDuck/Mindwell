It's never about doing meaningful work; it's about getting recognition. Every time someone else publishes something groundbreaking, it just fuels his frustration. Why does everyone else get all the credit? Doesn't anyone see how hard I've worked? The more he thinks about it, the more convinced he becomes that he'll never be recognized for his contributions. It feels like no matter what he does, it won't matter because he's too late to the party. The constant reminders from colleagues and even himself that he needs to step up his game only make things worse. He knows deep down that he needs to focus on his work, but the feeling of being overlooked is suffocating, and it's starting to drive him away from his research altogether. The world may be moving on, but he feels stuck in his own mind, wondering why he hasn't been acknowledged yet."

She can't seem to catch up on anything, and every day feels like a struggle to keep up. Her body is screaming for rest, but she pushes through, driven by fear that if she doesn't get everything done, she'll fall behind forever. This week has been particularly tough; with back-to-back deadlines looming, she barely had time to breathe, let alone take care of herself. Her mind is racing, filled with all the things she needs to do before the next deadline, and then the one after that. Each task weighs heavily, knowing how much work is piled up, and how little time she actually has left. Every moment feels like a waste—she's running out of energy, and it's hard to find the motivation to push through. She knows she needs to slow down, but the fear of missing a step keeps her going, even when exhaustion threatens to consume her. Despite feeling overwhelmed, she tries to stay positive, focusing on getting just one thing done at a time. But deep down, she worries about all the things that could go wrong. What if she misses something important? What if she can't finish what she started? These thoughts swirl in her head, making it harder to focus. She feels like she's drowning in tasks, unable to make progress. She's trying to tell herself to take breaks, to relax, but the sense of urgency persists. She"

The world seemed to be changing faster every year, and yet here he was, still holding onto a job that wasn't even his own. What did that say about him? Was he clinging too tightly to the past, refusing to let go? It wasn't fair to compare himself to younger officers who had their whole lives ahead of them. They could make mistakes, learn from them, and move forward. Meanwhile, he carried the burden of experience and responsibility, constantly weighing the consequences of each decision. The thought of leaving the force made him feel incomplete, like a part of him would stay behind. Why did it have to end now? Did he really deserve to leave when so many others were starting new chapters? As he looked out at the city, he couldn't help but think of all the times he'd watched someone else walk away, feeling a pang of jealousy. Everyone seemed to have an easy transition—leaving school, getting married, starting families. For him, there was no clear finish line. Even though he'd been retired for five years, he still felt needed. How could he let go when so much was left undone? He took a deep breath, trying to shake"
