It feels like he's losing himself in this new job, one that demands long hours and constant travel. I know he's just stressed, but...I feel so much more organized than he is. Every day, I wake up early, meditate, and get my routine going before he wakes. He barely notices me; he's always exhausted from work. But when we're together, he shows interest in my projects, even asks questions sometimes. Still, every time I see how messy he is, I feel a pang of disappointment. It's almost as if he's forgetting what makes us work together. I've tried talking about it, but he just says he's tired. Tired of everything. Maybe I'm being unfair, expecting too much from him, but...he used to be more considerate. Does he even remember our last date? We were supposed to go out on Saturday, but he cancelled at the last minute, saying he was too busy. I had to reschedule with friends. It doesn't help that he looks younger than he feels. I remember when he first started working, he would come home smelling fresh after a shower. Now, I catch him looking tired all the time, which makes me wonder if he's still taking care of himself. When did he start skipping his daily workout? The man I fell in love with is gone"

Her eyes darted from the tangled mess of papers on the counter to the harried doctor's frantic gestures, and for a moment, all she could think about was how much she hated Mondays. But as she pushed through the chaos, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was terribly wrong. As she made her way to the patient rooms, the sound of the elevator seemed louder than usual, and every beep from the monitors felt more urgent. She tried to focus on the tasks at hand, but her mind kept wandering back to her ex-husband, wondering if he'd finally moved on. The anxiety had been building up since their messy breakup, and it seemed like every little thing - a missed call, a forgotten appointment - sent her spiraling into a cycle of worry. Back at the nurse's station, she found herself zoning out as the doctor continued to yell into the phone, her mind replaying the argument they’d had last night over whose turn it was to pick up their kids. It wasn’t just the noise; everything felt amplified – the beeps, the murmurs, even the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Her sister could eat raw onions without issue, while she couldn't even stand the thought of touching them. It was just how she was wired. This morning, however, something different caught her off guard. She'd decided to make a simple salad, using some fresh greens from the garden and adding cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and carrots. Everything seemed normal until she began chopping the veggies; then she noticed the tiny insects crawling across the lettuce leaves. Her mind went blank as she stared at the offending creatures, her stomach lurching with each twitch of a leg. She couldn't focus on anything else except the disgusting bugs, which seemed to be multiplying before her very eyes. What if there were more? She couldn't shake the feeling that every bite would come with its own surprise - a squirming worm, a crawling ant, or who knows what else? The salad, once a straightforward task, became an ordeal. She ended up tossing everything in the trash, feeling like she'd lost her appetite altogether. Now, all she can think about is how many other unwanted critters might be hiding in her food. She's starting to wonder if her kitchen is infested with pests, and"
