It felt like he was abandoning her right now, leaving her with nothing but a handful of bills and a bunch of useless memories. The thought alone made her want to cry, but she tried holding back because she didn't want him to see how upset she was. He'd never left before, and this sudden change must mean something big is going on. I bet he's already planning a new life somewhere else—maybe even with someone else. That would be so humiliating for me, making all our hard work feel worthless. This isn't over yet; he'll come crawling back once he realizes what he's losing. If I can hold out long enough, maybe we can still fix things."

The weight of grief is overwhelming, as if a tidal wave has crashed down upon him, threatening to engulf everything. Every moment since her passing has felt like an eternity, filled with unending sorrow and longing. As he stares blankly into space, tears begin to fall, each one a painful reminder of what could never be again. His mind is consumed by thoughts of how much she would want him to keep moving forward, yet every step feels like a monumental struggle, as if the world around him has shifted to black and white, leaving no color in sight. It's just too much to bear. The pain is all-consuming, and it's hard to imagine anything else. I can't stop thinking about how much I miss her, how much our life together means to me, and how impossible it feels to accept that she's truly gone. She was my rock, my best friend, and my soulmate. Everything reminds me of her, from the way the sunlight filters through the blinds to the faint scent of her perfume lingering in the air. Even the silence is deafening, like the absence of music that once brought us so much joy together. I feel lost, unable to find solace in the things that normally bring me comfort. This day marks another milestone in a lifetime of grief, and it's difficult to see a light at"

And now, here she is, chopping onions, feeling like a fool, all because some silly song came on. Of course, she knows she shouldn't have snapped at the sous-chef. But honestly, who wouldn't want to dance to this beautiful tune? The lyrics are so romantic; he used to sing them to me while we cooked, his voice harmonizing perfectly with mine. I feel like crying, remembering how happy we were back then. It doesn't matter what happened today, this song always brings back those wonderful memories. Why is everyone making such a big deal out of my breaking down? Oh, look! There's the bouquet I made for him yesterday. I remember how proud he was when I brought it home. He said it reminded him of our first date when we walked through the market together. We laughed about how we both picked the same flowers, but our bouquets turned out different. He took mine and put them behind the vase on the table, saying it would make our table setting more beautiful. I still love seeing that arrangement. Maybe if I focus on the good times... What am I doing? This isn't helping. I need to calm down"

How could something like this be connected to such a mundane setting? But the feeling lingered, refusing to let go. She took a deep breath, preparing herself for what lay ahead. This time, there was no mistake. She saw it clearly—a life slipping away, lost in the haze of Alzheimer's. She remembered how it had started, with simple forgetfulness, then gradually worsening into more profound lapses. Even the memories began to fade, leaving behind only fragments of a once-vibrant life. Her mind wandered back to the first time she'd met Mrs. Harper, decades ago. They'd become close friends, sharing stories and laughter around dinner tables. Now, as she gazed at the sleeping figure, she couldn't help but think about the loneliness that had followed. The old man had tried to stay by her side, but eventually, even he couldn't hold on. It was as if fate itself had taken control, weaving a tragic tale of loss and isolation.
