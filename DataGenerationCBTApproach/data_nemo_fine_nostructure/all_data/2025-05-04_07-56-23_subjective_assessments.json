As if the act of holding onto memories was a weight, one that could crush us both. She looked away, her gaze drifting toward the mantle where the old photo now sat. Her hand brushed against it, but didn't touch it, as if afraid of the pain it might bring. I watched her, noticing the faint tremble in her fingers. In a world filled with uncertainty, this moment felt like a cruel joke—almost as if fate itself had been mocking us all along. This wasn't just about art or love; it was about the fragility of life. Every day, every decision, seemed to lead us further away from each other. Even I couldn't deny it anymore. We'd become two strangers, living under the same roof, yet worlds apart. The thought hung in the air, a constant reminder that some things can never be undone, no matter how hard we try. As I stood there, frozen in time, I realized that sometimes the only thing we have left is nostalgia. And even that feels fleeting, like sand slipping through our fingers.

With what?

Instead, he accused her of being overly sensitive. “If you weren’t so emotional all the time, maybe your ex-wife would still be with us.” He also reminded her that her ex-husband had abandoned their family when their daughter was young, leaving her to raise the child alone. “So, how can you expect me to be there for her when someone who actually cares about her dropped out of sight?” he asked bitterly. But she knew that wasn’t true. He was still very much involved in their daughter’s life, even if he never admitted it. And besides, she refused to bring up the past again.

But perhaps that's just the reality of working in high-pressure environments. In a way, it feels unfair that those who are already doing well can't appreciate what they have while others struggle to find stability. It's like comparing apples and oranges; one is thriving, while the other is fighting just to stay afloat. You can't help but feel that those who are excelling are taking away from the struggles of others. It's almost as if we're being forced to measure our worth against someone else's success, rather than focusing on our own journey.
