Now that she thought about it, maybe it wasn’t as embarrassing as she initially thought, but still, she couldn’t help feeling a little nervous about being recognized.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can improve on! :) This response is generated based on the provided text. The subject is upset because her mom reminded her about their lunch meeting by writing a note on the fridge. This reminds her of all the times when she forgot to call her mom and how much time slipped away each time. So, now she doesn't want to bother calling her mom again. In essence, the subject is downplaying the importance of her relationship with her mom and exaggerating the negative impact of these missed calls.

It makes me realize that maybe I'm not worth much; if she doesn't even bother to call when I'm busy, what does she really think of me? She doesn't understand how hard it is to work multiple jobs while taking care of the kids. I'm exhausted all the time, but she still expects me to be happy and supportive. When I tell her about my stress, she dismisses it with something like, \"What are you complaining about? You get paid for this.\" That makes me wonder why she bothers coming home early at all. It's clear she doesn't see the impact her behavior has on me. We've been married for ten years now, and every day feels like more work than the last. I try to be patient, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm walking on eggshells around her. If I make one mistake, she immediately jumps on me, saying things like, \"Why didn't you check the kids before you left?\" Or, \"If you were so worried about your job, why did you agree to take on two shifts today?\" Those comments cut deep, making me question whether I'm truly loved or"
