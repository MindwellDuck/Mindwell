Anyway, I'm pretty sure it wasn’t intentional, maybe it’s just my memory playing tricks on me. I know it’s weird to think this way after such a short time, but what if I’m just forgetting things? It could be some kind of grief thing. She said how much she hated losing her spoons—maybe she didn’t want anyone to use them while they were still in the drawer. Yeah, that makes sense. Maybe I should go clean the drawer again, make sure everything is where it belongs. I don’t want anything to trigger more bad memories. I’ll get it sorted soon, I promise."

It seemed like the hospital was spinning out of control, and she was trapped at the center, fighting to keep everything together. Every decision felt monumental, and she worried that she wasn't doing enough to prevent further disasters. But then she caught herself—she had been so focused on the chaos around her that she'd almost forgotten why she became a nurse in the first place: to make a difference, one patient at a time. With a deep breath, she refocused on the task at hand, reminding herself that even if things didn’t go perfectly, it was never too late to learn and improve. The moment was still intense, but now she saw it as an opportunity to grow, rather than letting fear take over."

He thought about all the times he'd forgotten things, like taking out the trash or turning off lights. It wasn't just about forgetting; it was about feeling overwhelmed. When he was stressed, everything seemed to fall apart. His partner would get frustrated, but he understood that she didn't know what it was like to be in his shoes. This time, though, it wasn't just about being forgetful. This muffin was more than just a mistake—it was a sign of deeper issues. If he couldn't even remember something simple, what did it say about his ability to take care of himself? Was he really cut out for this job? It wasn’t just the muffin; it was the way he handled stress. He remembered how he’d yelled at his sister during an argument, and now he wondered if he was capable of controlling his emotions.

Had he missed something important? Did he forget to lock the door? Or maybe"
