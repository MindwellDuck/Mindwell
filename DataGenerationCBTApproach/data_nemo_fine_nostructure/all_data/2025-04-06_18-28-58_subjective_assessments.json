It feels like she doesn't care about me or our life together. I guess she wouldn't if she didn't have anything better to do than wait for me when I work late nights. Maybe I shouldn't even bother trying to be a good husband anymore because it feels like no one appreciates me anyway. I'll just leave her to deal with everything by herself. She doesn't need me; she has her own interests. And what does she really care about? Her career is taking over. She'd probably forget about me if we weren't married. My mind is racing, and I know I should calm down, but this is exactly how I've felt every time I missed a night home. I don't want to spend another minute worrying about whether she loves me or cares about my feelings. Maybe I'm not worth it. I'll just go back to bed and hope she doesn't notice. This isn't the first time I've been ignored, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm nothing more than a burden to her. If she didn't love me, would she still stay with me? Probably not. I wonder why I even try anymore. She must think I'm annoying or something because she never gives me attention. Even though she says she loves me, it doesn't seem like she means it. When she wakes"

A nurse for three decades, she knew every inch of the house, and this subtle discrepancy set her nerves on edge. She stepped closer, her heart pounding in her chest like a patient's monitor on high alert. As she gently pulled the drawer open, she found nothing amiss - just the usual clutter of pens, paperclips, and old photographs. But something was different. One photograph, a faded snapshot of them at their wedding, was facedown. She couldn't remember if it had been like that before. A chill ran down her spine as paranoia began to creep in, whispering doubts into her ear.",

She must be tired after her long shift. Yeah, that's it. She probably doesn't care about the photo anyway. We've had our disagreements over the years, but she wouldn't really go out of her way to hide something like that. That would be weird. What if he did it? He has no business touching things like that. I know he's up to something; we all do. I shouldn't be surprised. They always say things are fine until they're not. I need to keep an eye on him. This isn't the first time he's acted suspiciously. If he does it again, I'll make sure everyone knows what's going on. It's hard to trust someone who's proven themselves so many times. She must have missed it. Everyone misses things sometimes. I guess I'm just being paranoid. Still, I can't shake off the feeling that something is off. At least she said nothing was there. Now I feel better, but the unease lingers. I'll look around more later. Until then, let's just pretend everything is okay."

But how could he explain that every word she wrote felt like a knife twisting in his gut? His story - the one he'd been chasing for months, the one that was supposed to make his career - had crumbled yesterday. The sources had dried up, the leads gone cold.

If only he were more ambitious, if only he put in more effort, maybe things wouldn't be so bad right now. I'm tired of being here for him. It's time someone else picked up the pieces. This isn't my problem anyway. I don't have anything to lose. What's the worst that could happen? Not much, considering everything else has fallen apart already. Maybe I can use this as an opportunity to move on. I feel sorry for them both. They deserve better than each other, but they've settled for this miserable life together. At least they're consistent. Consistency is key in relationships. If only they'd taken some risks, seen where things might go, instead of just coasting through.
