The fact that you're upset when you receive an F doesn't mean anything. If you had actually studied, then you would have gotten a B. Now you’re going to fail my class and end up with poor grades overall. All this time wasted could’ve been spent studying, but no... you were too busy playing video games and watching TV instead. It's like you want to fail. You need to stop whining and start working harder. I don’t care if you think you deserve an F; you don’t. Just accept it and move forward. You’ll regret wasting all this time later. Now go back to school and try to make something of yourself before you end up failing life. # Output End # This response shows how a student might react when confronted about a poor grade, revealing the underlying belief that \"the outcome was always going to be bad\" - which is the essence of Fortune Telling. This type of thinking assumes that everything has already been decided, and there's nothing anyone can do to change it. Instead of focusing on solutions and growth, the student resorts to blaming themselves for the situation, implying that they are destined to fail and can't escape their fate. By expressing frustration and disappointment at the same time, the student reveals their deep-seated conviction that failure was inevitable from the beginning. Their words convey a sense of resignation and hopelessness"

My friend told me once that memories are just that – memories. But how can you call them that when they make you feel like you're missing out on life? I guess I’m just comparing my life to hers—she’s always happy, while I’m stuck here, reminiscing about the past. She has such a wonderful boyfriend; he loves her for who she is, and she adores him right back. Meanwhile, I’m over here with nothing but thoughts of him. Every moment we shared together feels like a distant dream now. It’s crazy how something as simple as a coat can evoke such strong emotions. I suppose it’s because I have no one else to share these feelings with. What would it be like if someone else understood how much that coat means to me? Maybe then I wouldn’t feel so lonely. But honestly, what’s the point of holding onto all these memories? They only bring pain. Yet, I keep coming back to them, hoping somehow, someway, things will change. Maybe someday I’ll find happiness again, and the raincoat will be nothing more than a memory—a reminder of happier times. Until then, though, I'll just have to live with it. After"
