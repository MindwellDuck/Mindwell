A young man, barely more than a boy, lay unconscious on the stretcher, his face pale against the stark white sheet. She rushed to assist, but her arthritic hands fumbled with the IV line, refusing to cooperate despite her mental commands. Around her, colleagues flowed seamlessly, but she was stuck, helpless in the whirlwind of crisis.",

The neighbor's laughter echoed through the open window, punctuated by the reporter's admiring questions. She felt a pang of envy as she stirred her tea, the spoon clinking against the cup in an otherwise silent room. Her partner, engrossed in a book at the table, didn't notice her quiet, green-eyed stare across the street.",

It seemed so easy to create something beautiful, while she struggled with even the simplest art projects. Even though she had tried many times before, she couldn’t help but feel that she was somehow less deserving of happiness compared to her neighbor. Maybe it was just luck; maybe she wasn’t meant to enjoy this part of her life. It wouldn’t be fair to expect herself to feel happy when others seem more content. Everyone has different standards, and she certainly shouldn’t compare her life directly to hers. It’s pointless to judge others based on what you think they should be doing. After all, everyone is entitled to their own path in life. What matters most is finding personal fulfillment in your own way, regardless of external expectations. She really should stop worrying about what others think and focus on her own journey. There’s no need to compare her life to hers or anyone else’s for that matter. Life is too short to waste time feeling envious or regretful. Instead, let go of those thoughts and embrace the present moment. You can’t control how others behave, but you can always choose how you react to them. Just be yourself, and don’t worry about what others think. Enjoy the beauty around you, appreciate the simple things, and find joy in everyday moments. That’s all that truly matters. I wish she would stop being so hard on"

Why did he send this letter without even talking to me first? Is there something wrong with my work that I don't know about? Or maybe he's just playing some sort of game on me... But no, I shouldn't think like that. It's not fair to him. I wouldn't do something like that. *No, I wouldn't.* So, here we go again. Another one of these unexpected surprises. I swear, it never stops. First, it was the car breakdown, then the sudden illness, and now this. Can't they see I'm busy? Don't they understand how hard things are right now? I've got too much on my plate already! How am I supposed to handle retirement when everything else is falling apart around me? Why do they always pick now? Can't they see I'm in the middle of something? I won"
