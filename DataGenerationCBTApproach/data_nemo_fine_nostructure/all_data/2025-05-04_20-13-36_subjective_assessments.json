I hope I didn't miss anything important during my absence. This is really affecting my performance at work. I have to stay focused and stop thinking about them.

He imagines the possibilities, but deep down, he knows it’s just a reminder of what could never be again. The thought of her moving out, of having to start anew without her by his side, feels like a knife cutting through his heart. It’s hard not to think about all the things that went wrong, the arguments they had, and the fights that ended their relationship. Yet, he holds onto these thoughts, replaying them like a record stuck on repeat, wondering what might have been if they hadn’t let their differences tear them apart. As he stands there, surrounded by silence, he can't help but feel lost. What if they had worked through their issues? What if they had found a way to make their love last?

It just makes me want to scream, especially when they're trying to sell us something for it. They make it sound like we'd be missing out if we didn't buy whatever it is they're peddling, but really, they're just rubbing it in our faces because they think it's funny. And then there's the way they try to act like everything is fine between them, like nothing bad has happened. But deep down, I know the truth. They're probably just waiting for an opportunity to strike again, and I can't stand it. The fact that they get to live this life while others struggle makes my anger boil over. We're not even talking about the usual stuff here; no, these people are flaunting their happiness right in front of us, making it impossible for anyone else to ignore. They could be hiding their true feelings behind a mask of happiness, but still, they insist on sharing it with the world. Maybe they genuinely believe that everything is okay between them, but I'm not buying it. This whole thing is just too much for me to handle.

The silence here is deafening, a stark contrast to the warmth and love they once shared. He wonders if it's just him who misses her so deeply, or is everyone else feeling this same sense of emptiness? Maybe he’s just more sensitive to change, or perhaps he’s the only one left holding on to what they had. Whatever the reason, he finds himself drawn to moments like these—moments that hold the power to bring them both back together in spirit, if only for a fleeting instant. In the end, though, the pain remains, and the books on her nightstand will always be reminders of what could never be again. Yet, even in grief, there is beauty in holding onto those memories, cherishing the thought of her presence, and the way she made him feel when she was alive."
