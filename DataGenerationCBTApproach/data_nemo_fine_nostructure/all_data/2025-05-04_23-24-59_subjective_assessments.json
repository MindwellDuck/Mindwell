He knows their antics have gone unpunished too long. Tonight, he decides, will be different.",

That's when I think about all those times he was here before, sitting under our tree. His favorite place. What if I'm seeing things now because it's my own mind playing tricks on me? No, this time it really is him. Why does he have to wait for the bus, though? Doesn't he have anywhere else to go? And why isn't anyone around? Everyone else knows where they're going, except me.

As she unlocked the front door, she heard the faint echo of the TV from the living room - a familiar, comforting hum that usually greeted her. Tonight, however, it was joined by an unfamiliar sound: laughter.\n\nAs she stepped into the room, she saw him there, his head thrown back, his eyes crinkling at the corners in a way that made his age show through the laughter lines. He wasn't alone; their daughter sat beside him on the couch, her tiny hands clutching at his arm as she too giggled along with whatever joke he'd just cracked.\n\nThe sight should have warmed her heart, but it only served to twist it further. She stood there for a moment, unnoticed, feeling like an outsider in her own home. This was supposed to be their family time, yet here they were, laughing without her, sharing jokes that she wasn't part of.\n\nShe cleared her throat loudly, causing them both to turn towards her with surprise. \"I'm just going upstairs,\" she said quietly, turning away before either could respond. As she climbed the stairs, she felt a tear slip down her cheek. It was supposed to be different. They were supposed to be together in this.

Instead, she found him laughing with someone else's kid, who looked almost half her age. That realization cut deeper than she anticipated.

Her mind couldn't help but wonder if her marriage was already slipping away, hidden behind closed doors while she thought no one was paying attention. The image of them laughing together, carefree and joyful, fueled her feelings of inadequacy and isolation. Why did it feel like every moment shared between them now seemed tainted? Wasn’t it supposed to be just us, enjoying each other’s company after a long day? As she tried to shake off these thoughts, she noticed how quickly her gaze drifted over the room, taking in everything except what truly mattered – the people she loved. Her focus landed on the empty chair across from him, where she used to sit during movie nights, feeling safe and content. Now, that space seemed hollow, a reminder of all she missed out on when she stayed home with the kids. Her mind began to spiral with questions: Did they ever miss her? Were they happy without her?

Her mind began to wander, conjuring up images of a life left behind: late nights spent studying, early mornings spent working, the countless hours spent preparing for exams that were never going to come. All of it, now meaningless, like sand slipping through her fingers. It wasn't just the loss of purpose; she felt lost in every other aspect of her life. Her relationships, once filled with laughter and warmth, now seemed shallow, as if the connection between people was nothing more than a thin layer of oil. The world outside her window seemed distant, disconnected, and she wondered if anyone truly understood her pain. Even the memories that once brought her joy now felt tainted, like a photograph faded by time. In the silence of her office, she heard whispers. Whispers of doubt, whispers of fear, whispers of resignation. They echoed in her mind, echoing the doubts that lingered in the shadows of her heart. There were those who whispered she should have seen it coming - that she was always destined for failure, that her time was limited.

Maybe it's because I remember having a panic attack before school and feeling like I couldn't breathe properly.
