Her husband, usually a warm presence beside her, was noticeably absent from their king-sized bed. A chill ran down her spine, not just from the empty space but also from the realization that today marked one year since his passing. The familiar weight of grief settled heavy on her chest as she got ready for another day without him.",

Everything seemed off—her eyes were puffy, her hair was tangled, and she could smell the faint scent of yesterday's perfume lingering around the house. It wasn't until she reached the kitchen that the reality hit her like a ton of bricks. The coffee maker was still warm; he always made coffee before leaving for work. The breakfast plate was untouched, with scrambled eggs and bacon left behind. He never missed breakfast; they would laugh about how he'd burn himself with the hot pan if he didn't stir quickly enough. Her heart sank as she realized the truth—the alarm hadn't gone off. His death had been sudden, and he had forgotten to set an alarm on the night before. This was supposed to be their anniversary, but he'd passed away three days ago, and now everything felt so surreal. She tried to shake the feeling of dread, telling herself that it was probably just her mind playing tricks on her. But the silence felt deafening, and the emptiness in their bedroom echoed through her entire being. She knew she needed to get moving, but the thought of facing another day without him was almost too much to bear. Every little detail seemed to remind her of what she had lost—a small thing, really, but it was all she could think about right now. As she forced herself to start getting ready, she couldn't help but wonder if anyone else had noticed anything different. Was it possible"

Now she was alone again, and all she could think about was what might have been if they’d talked it through instead of letting the silence grow thicker than the snow outside. A moment later, her mind shifted gears as she reached for her phone. It was 3:30 PM, and she knew he wouldn’t be back until around 5. There were a couple of messages from friends he hadn’t answered yet, so maybe he was running late. That meant there was plenty of time for her to finish preparing dinner—she could even start cooking already. A small spark of hope ignited within her, reminding her that sometimes these moments of distance actually led to new beginnings. She smiled to herself, feeling a little more at ease. It was almost time when she heard the door open. His voice called out, “Hey, I’m home.” She turned off the stove and headed toward the sound, ready to welcome him with a warm smile. As she entered the living room, she noticed the TV was off, and his backpack lay by the window—a sign he must’ve left quickly after work. She went to the fridge, opened it, and pulled out the leftovers she had made"

The fact that she even assigned this project to him, one that required great focus and time, felt like an insult. She must be trying to provoke him, make him feel inferior. But why would she want to do that? Maybe she's just angry about something else entirely? Or perhaps she's really unhappy with her new job and is taking out her frustration on him because it's easy. What if she forgot that he's still grieving the loss of their son, and this project pushes him too hard? Does she genuinely think he can handle it? It doesn't seem like her behavior makes sense unless she wants to hurt him again. But what if there's another explanation I'm missing? She probably has a personal vendetta against me, and this is just her way of showing it. Maybe she's feeling threatened by my success at work? This whole situation feels like a huge mistake, and I wish we could go back to how things used to be. I don't understand why she'd behave like this, especially when she knows how much it means to me. I bet she's just being spiteful. I need to talk to someone about this before it gets worse."

The librarian’s brusque manner seemed to stem from a place of indifference, a reflection of the modern age where personal connections were seen as less important than efficiency. It wasn’t just her lack of patience that bothered her; it was the way her presence felt like a reminder of something out of place in this digital era. Her own mind became muddled by the feeling of being overlooked, as if the younger generation saw her as nothing more than a relic of the past, someone they could afford to ignore. This thought sent her back into her head, replaying moments of frustration over the years, each time reinforcing the idea that she was no longer welcome here. The image of the librarian's eyes flicking away made her wonder if she was truly invisible, a ghostly figure trapped between worlds, unable to find her place in this new reality. She felt like she’d been left behind, not just in terms of technology but also in the minds of those around her. The memory of the countless times she’d tried to connect with others through books now seemed hollow, as if she was clinging to something that had lost its meaning in a society where digital interactions dominated every conversation. The experience left her wondering if she was just a nostalgic echo of a bygone era, one that refused to fade gracefully into obscurity."
