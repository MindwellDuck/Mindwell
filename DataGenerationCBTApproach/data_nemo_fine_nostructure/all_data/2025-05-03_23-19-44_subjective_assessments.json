I know I'm not supposed to get defensive, but I'm just so tired of people judging me because of my age. It’s like everyone expects me to be perfect right now, and when I’m not, they punish me. I don’t have time to fix everything. I can’t keep up with these expectations. It’s exhausting. I wish people would stop making me feel like I need to prove myself all the time. How could anyone expect me to handle that much responsibility? They probably think I don’t care about my patients’ well-being because I didn’t spend 10 years studying medicine. But what if I try my best? Does that mean I deserve respect too? I guess I’ll just have to accept that some things are beyond my control. Maybe I should focus on being better than I was before and letting go of the past. After all, I’ve learned from those mistakes. It’s time to move forward and show everyone what I’m capable of. I won’t let my age define me. I want to prove them wrong and show them that I still have a lot to offer. It’s time"

Or maybe... Maybe she lost interest in science altogether and decided to pursue something else. What if she's gone forever? Her desk is so clean now, it looks almost sterile. There are no papers or notes scattered around. It’s as if she never worked here. But she would've wanted to say goodbye, wouldn’t she? She probably meant to tell me something important, but she never came back. If she was just leaving for another job, why didn't she give me a chance to ask her out one more time? Maybe she felt too guilty about what happened between us. I remember how we argued over whose turn it was to buy coffee. Perhaps she saw it as an opportunity to change her mind and go somewhere else. She might be in a better place now, doing something she loves. What if she finally found her true calling? Now, everything feels so empty. Even her favorite mug"

        "Generated Assessment": "\"I'm shocked and disappointed that my art isn't good enough for people to care about it. I've been working hard to improve my skills, but apparently, it's all in vain.\" # Example Response End ## Feedback This response demonstrates magnification/minimization by emphasizing the negative aspect (\"shocked and disappointed\") while downplaying the positive aspects (\"hard work improving skills\"). It implies that the artist is overreacting and misinterpreting the cancellation as a personal failure rather than recognizing the lack of market interest. By focusing solely on disappointment and ignoring potential reasons like market trends or competition, the response illustrates this cognitive distortion. # Cognitive Distortion: Magnification/Minimization Cognitive Distortion: Magnification/Minimization Description: This distortion involves either overemphasizing (magnifying) the negatives or underemphasizing (minimizing) the positives in oneself, others, or situations. It can lead to an overly pessimistic outlook, where minor setbacks are exaggerated, and successes are minimized. Example: Person A: \"It's terrible that the project was cancelled because they didn't think our ideas were original.\" Person B: \"But we did get feedback from the judges.\" In this example, Person A magnifies the negativity by calling the cancellation \"terrible,\" while Person B minimizes the positivity by pointing out that they received feedback. This shows how both individuals might be misinterpreting the situation through distorted thinking. Person A focuses too much"
