As she cleaned up after dinner, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off. Her mind kept wandering back to the same question: Why hadn’t he come home yet? It wasn't until she heard the creak of the front door that her anxiety dissipated. But now, as she sat in the dark, waiting for him to return, the silence felt oppressive, and the night seemed to stretch endlessly ahead. He usually called when he left work; where could he be?"

Even if I had all the time in the world, I couldn’t keep going like that. I’m sorry for him; he deserves sympathy, but I can’t feel sorry for myself right now. Maybe I need therapy because I think he’s doing great considering everything. At least he got through it. I wouldn’t be able to handle something like that. I don’t even want to think about it anymore. This is all too much for me. There are plenty of people like him out there who must be feeling terrible right now."

Every time she laughed, he felt a pang of sadness mixed with anger, as if every chuckle was a reminder that she might actually leave him behind. It wasn’t just laughter; it sounded like she was planning a new life without him, one where they wouldn’t even have to talk. He felt so alone in that moment, as if she was playing a game of chess, moving pieces around to checkmate him. Her carefree laughter made him feel like a pawn in a much bigger game, one he had no control over. He wondered if she ever thought about what this could mean for their relationship. Was she really just being friendly, or was there something more sinister at play? He couldn’t shake off the feeling that she was planning to disappear from his life, leaving him to face everything alone. Even when she said she’d call later, he heard it as a promise to forget about him, to move on without looking back. Her smile was a mask, hiding the truth she never wanted to share. He felt trapped in a nightmare, unsure of how long he could keep going like this"

And she doesn't need help with anything. It's unfair to expect me to be perfect too. ## Step 1: Identify the Triggering Event The triggering event that prompted this response was finding his wife engrossed in a book while he had prepared a meal and laid out his lab notes, which were now cold and untouched. ## Step 2: Determine the Cognitive Distortion The person feels left behind by comparing themselves unfavorably to someone else (the neighbor) without realizing that they are making an unfair comparison. They are unconsciously placing themselves at a disadvantage by expecting perfection when they cannot meet such standards. ## Step 3: Generate the Subjective Reaction The person’s subjective reaction reflects the cognitive distortion ‘Unfair Comparisons’ because they start by assuming their partner has forgotten everything important, like eating and reading the news. This assumption is based on a flawed comparison between their life and someone else’s, leading them to feel inadequate and frustrated. The key aspect here is recognizing that the initial thought process involves comparing their situation unfavorably against someone else’s standard without realizing it, thus displaying the unfair comparison distortion.
