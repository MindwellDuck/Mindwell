This is ridiculous. I'll never feel safe again. My life has turned into a nightmare. I've become paranoid about everyone. I'm too scared to go anywhere alone. Everyone looks suspicious now.

This unexpected sighting causes him to feel panicked and anxious. ## Step 2: Recognize Cognitive Bias The individual is reacting strongly to the unfamiliar sight, attributing the situation to possible burglaries or threats against his family, demonstrating a rigid mindset that expects specific outcomes based on past experiences. ## Step 3: Analyze the Cognition Process The person is making assumptions about the situation without sufficient evidence, assuming the worst-case scenario from the beginning. This leads to a heightened state of alertness, causing physical symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and trembling hands. ## Step 4: Evaluate the Impact of Cognitive Distortions This reaction reflects the cognitive distortion \"Should"
