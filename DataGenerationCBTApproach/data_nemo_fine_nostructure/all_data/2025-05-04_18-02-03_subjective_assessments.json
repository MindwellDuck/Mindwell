It wasn't until she saw the email on his monitor that she realized just how far off base she was going. He didn't even have her name on the thing, let alone her byline. It was clear he hadn't been paying attention; he must have just been scrolling through his emails randomly. Still, the feeling lingered - like she knew exactly what he was thinking, and it wasn't anything good. Maybe she was overreacting, but the sense of being under scrutiny stayed with her long after she left the newsroom. #Example Response End ##Example Response End **Response:** She felt like he was watching her every move, like he could read her mind.

Her clothes were always designer, while mine were just off-the-rack. When she wore makeup, she'd leave a trail of sparkles behind her. It made me feel like an ugly oaf compared to her glamorous world. Sometimes, I'd see her chatting with other guys in clubs, laughing with them, and I couldn't help but feel jealous. Those men seemed so confident around her, and they didn't have the same insecurities she did about our relationship. In contrast, I felt like a burden, someone who wasn't worthy enough to be with her. She always had this aura of perfection, while I struggled to keep up. Our life together was a constant reminder of what I lacked, making me resentful and bitter. Even though we had kids together, I often wondered if they'd prefer their mother.
