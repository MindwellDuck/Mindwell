Nothing works out for her; everything falls apart. Even small things make her miserable now. She can't enjoy anything because she knows it'll just slip away again. Every day feels like a countdown until her next failure. She tries to put on a brave face, but deep down, she knows it's all just a facade. She wonders why nobody takes her seriously. People always say they believe in her, but actions speak louder than words. Whenever she asks for help, it’s either ignored or dismissed as “just another crisis.” No one offers genuine support; instead, they offer empty words or pity.
