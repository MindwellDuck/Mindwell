That just shows how shallow and self-absorbed she must be. It's disgusting how she thinks she deserves happiness like that, especially when she's probably never worked hard for anything. The way she talks about me, it sounds like she's trying to make herself feel better because she feels inferior. I've seen the way she looks at me, always smiling and making small talk. She probably thinks I'm some kind of celebrity, which makes me sick. When I hear people like her praising me, it's really annoying, especially since I don't deserve it. They just say nice things because they want something from me, not because they actually think I'm great."

The clock ticked loudly in the silence, each second a reminder of another wasted day.

It wasn’t just about the art; every moment felt like a missed opportunity—another chance lost because of his inability to focus. The emptiness of the canvas mirrored the emptiness within him, as if time itself was draining away his creative spark. Shouldn’t he have been working harder by now? Shouldn’t his passion have returned? He thought about all the times he’d promised himself he’d get back into painting, but those promises had faded with each passing week. Why did things never go as planned? The memories flooded his mind—a mix of frustration and sadness. He remembered how his wife would tease him when she first discovered her love for photography, saying he could teach her everything he knew, but she didn’t need to learn it. She was already capturing beauty in ways he couldn’t even begin to understand. As her obsession grew, she began to spend more time behind the lens than with him. Eventually, she stopped taking photos of him altogether. Her priorities shifted toward her new hobby, leaving him feeling like an afterthought. They started arguing over whose work was more important, with her becoming increasingly dismissive of his art. One day, she simply said, \"You don't create anything meaningful,\" which cut deeper than any criticism. She left me, taking our daughter with her. Now, I’m left alone with nothing but this canvas, reminding me of what I’ve lost."

How foolish of him. It seems that my latest prediction has come true once again. He fell asleep, oblivious to the danger that awaited him. It was inevitable all along, and now the consequences will be dire. Not only did he miss the chance to work on his art, but he also lost valuable time that can never be recovered. All because he refused to listen to reason, and now he must face the repercussions of his ignorance. I knew it was coming, and now the world will see the price he pays for ignoring my warnings. This is no coincidence. My words have always foretold disaster, and today is no exception. He ignored my warning signs, and now he will suffer the ultimate penalty. A missed deadline is just the beginning; soon, he will realize too late that I was right all along. I am the harbinger of doom, and those who refuse to heed my warnings will suffer the full weight of my prophecies.

As I pushed through the crowd, I couldn't help but notice how everyone was watching us, their eyes lingering on our faces before quickly looking away. It was as if they were waiting for something to happen, some kind of drama that would unfold right there in front of them. And then, just as I reached the bar, I heard it - the unmistakable sound of laughter, followed by a voice that sent shivers down my spine. \"Hey, look who we have here!\" someone shouted, their tone dripping with sarcasm. My eyes snapped to the source of the noise, and what I saw made my blood boil. There he was, sitting at the table with a group of reporters, all of them giggling and smiling as if they'd known each other for years. The guy was clearly enjoying himself, sipping his drink with a smirk on his face. But why? What could he possibly think he was doing here, surrounded by people he probably didn't even know?
