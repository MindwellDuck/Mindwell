The fact that he was still carrying his ID card meant that our divorce hadn't been finalized yet, which made it seem as though he was somehow still living there with me. It wasn't until I remembered how we'd agreed to separate all of our personal belongings that I realized maybe things weren't quite as they seemed. But now, every time I look at that card, I'm reminded of the one night we spent together, when everything felt so real. I can almost picture him lying beside me, the way he used to hold me close before drifting off to sleep. It feels like I've lost something precious, like a part of me has been ripped away. Even though I know intellectually that he probably just needed the ID for work purposes, I still feel this overwhelming sense of loss, like I'll never be whole again."

It’s so easy for people like him to complain when they don’t have to deal with real-world problems. I’ve been working hard all day, and now I get this? A complaint from someone who probably has nothing better to do than sit at home and whine about how life isn’t fair? It’s ridiculous that he gets to just walk in here, throw his shirt back over his shoulder, and expect everyone else to cater to his demands. I’m tired of dealing with entitled customers like this who think the world owes them a favor. If he didn’t have parents who could buy him whatever he wants, he’d be eating out of a trash can somewhere. At least some of us are working for our money and earning every penny we make."

When she spoke of his past, of all the times he'd hurt himself, he couldn't help but feel there was truth to it. She spoke of things yet to come—of the day when he'd wake up alone, of the pain that would consume him until he couldn't breathe anymore. It sounded like a nightmare, one he didn't want to live. Yet, as he looked into her eyes, he saw something there that made him wonder if she truly did see the future. But why would she say such terrible things? Wasn't it cruel to suggest such a future? And yet...he couldn't shake the feeling that she had spoken the truth. He tried to push those thoughts away, focusing on the present, but they lingered, haunting him. The words continued to echo in his mind, painting a picture of a life that wasn't meant to be. He wondered how someone who claimed to know the future could speak with such certainty, especially about events that hadn't even happened yet. Still, the image of waking up alone, unable to breathe, stayed with him, refusing to let go."

Her heart pounded as she grabbed a brush, trying to dab it away, but it only seemed to grow larger, more glaring under her touch.

The room seemed to shrink, and she felt trapped by her own doubts. What if no one wants to buy this now? What if I have to start from scratch? As she stood there, paralyzed, the silence seemed oppressive, and she wondered if anyone would even notice her efforts. The dust, once just a speck, had grown into a symbol of her self-doubt, haunting every step of her creative journey. It was as if she couldn’t shake off the feeling that every flaw would be magnified, every mistake visible. What if this isn’t good enough anymore? With each passing moment, her anxiety deepened, until she could hardly breathe. The world outside seemed distant, and all she heard was the echo of her own voice, whispering doubts that threatened to consume her. She tried to tell herself it was irrational, that others wouldn’t judge her so harshly, but the fear lingered, refusing to let go. As she stood there, frozen, the doubt swirled around her, making her feel lost and uncertain about everything."

Or maybe she could've found a way to reignite her passion? At first, she thinks about how much her life has changed, but then her gaze drifts back to the chef, who seems so carefree. She wonders if he ever misses his own family, if he thinks about them during his downtime. Does he wonder what his wife is doing right now, if she's missing him too? As she stands there, lost in thought, she begins to feel overwhelmed. The sight of the young chef reminds her of her own struggles—how she sacrificed time with her children for her culinary dreams, only to see them grow up, move out, and start families of their own. Her mind is flooded with questions: Would she have missed these moments if she'd stayed? Did her decision to leave impact anyone more than herself? In a flash, her thoughts shift to her husband, who passed away a few months ago. They were meant to spend their golden years together, exploring new recipes and sharing laughter over dinner. But now, she finds herself alone, wondering if her life was defined by her cooking or by the memories they created together."
