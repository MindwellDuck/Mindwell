She tried to push it away, but every minute felt like a countdown to embarrassment. If she left just one minute later than usual, she imagined her boss would be furious—like he hated waiting for her. The whole day, she felt like she was walking on eggshells, afraid that someone would notice she was running late again. She wondered what would happen if she did have another delay, if people started talking about how unreliable she was. Would her reputation suffer? Every glance from coworkers seemed to hold a secret message: “You’re going to let us down again.” She felt like she was trapped in a cycle of fear, constantly wondering what would happen next. In the end, she didn’t speak up when she had to go back to work early because she was worried what others might think. Now she’s dreading tomorrow’s shift, already imagining the worst-case scenario."

Why does he get all the attention, and I don't? What are your thoughts? How would you react differently? Would you consider talking about your feelings?

It wasn't just the food that brought us together; every dish held a story, every sauce a memory. His wife would always say, \"There's nothing better than making someone happy with your cooking,\" and he believed her. She loved everything about cooking - the feel of knives cutting through vegetables, the smell of spices blending together, the way flavors danced on the palate. For her, cooking wasn't just about feeding people; it was about sharing moments, bringing families closer, and making everyone feel seen and appreciated. When she passed away, leaving me with this restaurant, I thought I’d lose my purpose. But now, every time I put on an apron, I'm reminded of what I've lost, and what could’ve been.

That thought crossed his mind as he sat there, trying to understand what might have caused her silence. She could just be busy with work or school right now, which would explain why she didn’t call or text. Maybe she even forgot about the date altogether because life got really hectic. It wouldn’t be unusual if she needed some space to think things through. He wondered if maybe she was going through a difficult period at home and wasn’t ready to talk about it yet. If so, that would make sense too. Her message must have slipped into his inbox by mistake, but it definitely wasn’t meant for him. She probably wrote it while she was stressed about something else. It doesn’t mean anything; she’s just stressed. There are plenty of reasons why she hasn’t contacted him recently. I’m sure it has nothing to do with us. She probably needs more time to figure herself out. I wonder if she is still interested in me, or did she lose interest when we stopped talking for a bit?
