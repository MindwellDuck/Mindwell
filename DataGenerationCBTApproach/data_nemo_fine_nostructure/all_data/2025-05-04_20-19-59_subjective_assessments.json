He felt a familiar helplessness wash over him. Another scoop, another lead, slipping through his fingers like sand. He watched as his colleague rushed past him, notebook in hand, heading towards the scene he was supposed to cover. He wanted to call out, to protest, but no words came. He was left standing there, alone amidst the chaos of ringing phones and clattering keyboards, feeling small, insignificant, helpless.",

The look told me he'd been there before, and he wasn't surprised by my despair. This wasn't new for me; I'd been stuck in the newsroom for years, constantly being pulled away from stories that could have made my career. Every time, it seemed like I missed something critical, leaving me wondering why I even bothered. It wasn't just about the work; it was about the constant disappointment and frustration. My colleagues moved forward with ease, while I struggled to keep up, always one step behind. The same thing happened every time—a crucial moment slipped through my fingers, and they were ready for me next time. But when I tried to catch up, I was already behind again. They didn’t understand; they never had. I couldn’t explain that each failure pushed me harder to succeed, to prove myself. They saw me as slow and incompetent, someone who couldn’t handle the pressure. Yet, deep down, I knew I was fighting against impossible odds. I worked twice as hard, pouring over research, searching for clues, and still, I fell short. I wondered if they ever felt this way, trapped in their own cycle of expectations. Did they feel like they were losing control? Or did they just accept it as part of their job? They must be so tired of waiting for me to get it right. They probably don’t think about"

Maybe she feels sorry for me or thinks I look cute when she smiles at me. But it wouldn't mean anything if she didn't feel that way before. If she felt something for me, she wouldn't have ignored me for so long. It was all just pity, and now she sees me as nothing more than a pathetic loser. My worth is zero; I'll never be worthy of love or respect. My behavior has been consistent—always making mistakes, being unkind, and bringing trouble into her life. Now she must think I'm the worst person she knows, and she can't stand me anymore. She probably regrets ever talking to me and wishes she had never met me. Maybe she's just pretending to be nice to make me feel better, but deep down, she really hates me. I don't deserve her kindness or any affection. I'm a terrible person who doesn't belong anywhere.

They were meant for each other, yet fate decided otherwise. He couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was drowning in a sea of what-ifs. Every step forward seemed to lead him back to the same place, where memories of her smiled brightly, only to fade into darkness. If only she could see how much he missed her, how much he wished things could go back to the way they once were, but deep down, he knew that wasn’t possible. Life isn’t fair, and sometimes you’re just left holding onto the past. Maybe someday, he’d find peace, but until then, he’d continue to hold on to the hope that somehow, someway, she would come back."
