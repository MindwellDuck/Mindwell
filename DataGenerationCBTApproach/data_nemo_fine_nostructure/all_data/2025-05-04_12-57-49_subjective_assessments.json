If he hadn't been so distracted with his relationship, he would have put more effort into making it work. His absence from the lab is definitely connected to the fact that she's busy focusing on her own research. I'm certain she wouldn't be spending so much time away if she were truly interested in continuing their collaboration. She must be avoiding him because she doesn't want to face the reality of their failed relationship. This is all about him being too lazy to apply for grants. He didn't try hard enough to get the funding because he was already emotionally drained from the argument they had earlier today. This has nothing to do with me, but I can tell he's upset. The rejection letter isn't causing him to skip breakfast; it's just another reason why he doesn't care about eating anymore. If he cared about his health, he wouldn't be skipping meals like this. I don't think he'll ever return to the lab; he's clearly lost interest in science now. He should focus on getting over his broken heart instead of dwelling on his career setbacks. He's not stressed about the application; he's simply not putting in the effort required to succeed. The rejection letter is the least of his worries, which are probably centered around how she won't call or text him again. My presence here has nothing to do with my"

The mere mention of his ex-wife's name sends him spiraling into dark thoughts. He can't help but wonder if she was right about her prediction - is he truly better off without her? Perhaps he was foolish to think they could make things work. His mind starts racing with worst-case scenarios: Will he ever find someone else like her? Will his children accept his new partner? Can he really move forward without the love of his life? It's clear that his divorce has left deep emotional scars, making it difficult for him to trust anyone, let alone himself. As he sits there, lost in thought, it feels like time is slowing down, and all he can hear are the echoes of his failed marriage echoing through his mind. Perhaps he should just stick to eating his lunch, rather than worrying about the future. But it's hard to shake off the feeling that everything is falling apart, one piece at a time. And now, another colleague's careless comment has set him on the path to self-destruction. In his heart, he knows that some people might say he's being dramatic, but what does he know? Maybe he really doesn’t want to face reality anymore. But he also knows that maybe he’s just scared of facing the truth about his current situation and his inability to overcome his past.

This isn't just about the past; it's about standing up for myself and showing him that his actions won't be forgotten. But if I act impulsively, will that lead to regret too? Maybe I shouldn't do anything until I've thought this through carefully. Ugh, I wish I knew what would happen next. All I know is that I need to take action soon, before things get out of control.
