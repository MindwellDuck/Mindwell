Now, in the stillness of her home, she felt lost—like she was drowning in the emptiness left behind. Every day blended into every other, each moment blending together in a haze of sadness.

Another slow day, another empty cash register. He glanced at his watch; 15 minutes until closing time. His stomach churned as he thought about the pile of unpaid bills waiting for him at home. His wife had called earlier, her voice strained, saying she was running late again due to traffic. He could hear the kids crying in the background. Another night of takeout and no one to tuck them in.\n\nThe fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting harsh shadows on his tired face as he began closing procedures. The silence of the empty store was deafening, echoing his own sense of failure. He paused by the sale rack, picking up a shirt he'd helped his wife pick out weeks ago. It still had the tag on it, untouched. He sighed, placing it back with care.\n\nAs he locked the door behind him, he noticed a missed call from his mother-in-law. She hadn't left a message, but he knew what it meant. Another ' Concerned' conversation about money and family duty loomed over him like a dark cloud. His reflection in the storefront window showed a man worn down by life, shoulders hunched as if carrying an invisible weight.\n\nHe walked home under the dim glow of streetlights, each step heavier than the last, his heart aching with a familiar, suffocating suffering.",

Why did it always seem like they were moving ahead, while he was just trying to stay afloat? Even his wife seemed to be living multiple lives. While she worked part-time, she managed the household and took care of their three young children alone. Her days started before dawn, and she barely had time to rest between work and parenting. Meanwhile, she juggled cooking, cleaning, and homework, all while holding down two jobs herself. How could he possibly measure up when she seemed to balance everything effortlessly? His neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, also came to mind. A retired school teacher, she spent her days volunteering at local charities and organizing community events. Every year, she would host a dinner party for the whole neighborhood, inviting everyone from the church to the post office workers. Everyone loved her, and she seemed to know everyone's story. He felt like a ghost hovering in the background, invisible and insignificant compared to her warmth and generosity. Every glance at his phone reminded him of his lack of progress. Bills piled up, and his savings account was almost empty. Even his"
