No chatter, no music, just an empty house. She must be busy at work; she can't leave until 7 pm anyway. It doesn't bother me, but it does make me feel like she's not as excited to see me as I am to see her. Maybe this is why I don't want to go to bed early tonight. I'll just order dinner online like we planned and wait for her. After all, what's the hurry? We've been married for 20 years—when do you ever need to rush home? But then I notice the fridge magnet on our anniversary. She must have forgotten to put it back. That's probably why she didn't say anything when I came home. She's so caught up in her art lately, maybe she forgot about our plans again. And now I'm feeling annoyed that I'm being left behind, even if it's just for a few hours. Why would she forget something like this? Doesn't she know how much I love seeing her smile when I come home? Maybe she thinks I don't care enough to remember things like that. Well, let her think that; I'm going to enjoy my dinner alone, and who knows, maybe I'll get some sleep too. This isn't the first time she's left me hanging like this"

He recalls the countless nights spent worrying about the staff shortages during emergencies. It all feels too familiar, too common. He thinks back to his own experiences working late shifts, feeling overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility. Now, those memories seem to confirm what he feared—everything is falling apart, and no one will be able to handle the workload. In his mind, this must be true for everyone, just as it felt so real in his own situation. The thought sends a chill through him, making him wonder if anyone else is thinking the same thing. It’s hard not to feel like he’s seeing patterns where there are none, convincing himself that every nurse is facing similar challenges today, just as he did years ago. The fear spreads, echoing through his mind like a refrain. This isn’t just about one shift; it’s about the entire system crumbling under its own weight. No one is prepared for this kind of chaos, and no one will survive it. Just as he had in the past, he finds himself bracing for impact, waiting for the next wave of crises.

It was like she thought I could just magically figure everything out while she got to live life normally again. I tried explaining my feelings, but she wouldn't listen. She just said I needed to stop being weak and get over myself. I felt so guilty for letting her down, especially since she had to deal with all the guilt too. I know she thinks I'm being selfish, but honestly, I feel like I've lost her forever. I wish she could see how hard it is for me to move on. I miss her every day. I keep wondering if things could have worked out differently if only I had known about her illness earlier. If only I hadn't pushed her away by quitting. Maybe if I took another job, something better, I could have found a way to stay with her longer. But then again, maybe I just needed to be stronger, to show her I cared more than she thought.
