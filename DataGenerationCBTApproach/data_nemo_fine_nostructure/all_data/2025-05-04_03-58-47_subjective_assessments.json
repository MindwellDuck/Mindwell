Her husband watches from the bedroom doorway, his face etched with lines that weren't there yesterday. He doesn't speak, just offers a small smile, knowing words won't reach her today. As she leaves, the house feels emptier than usual, each echo of the closing door another grain slipping through the hourglass.",

Every time she sees him, she wonders what could have been if she stayed. They used to laugh together, share stories over coffee, but now the silence between them is deafening. She tries to shake off these thoughts, reminding herself that she made this choice, that she wanted more out of life. But every morning, when she puts on her uniform, she feels like she's leaving something precious behind—a piece of her heart. The buttons click one by one, and each sound is like a countdown. She knows it’s irrational, but she can’t help feeling that every day is another step closer to losing everything. It’s as if the hourglass is slowly draining away, leaving nothing but memories and regret. She forces herself to focus on the task ahead, but the image lingers, haunting her. This isn’t the first time she’s felt this way; it’s become a familiar ache, one that follows her everywhere. She pushes it aside, telling herself she needs to stay strong, but the feeling persists, refusing to let go. She tells herself that life will get better, that someday things will fall back into place, but until then, she’s stuck in this cycle of longing. With a deep breath, she heads to work, trying to distract herself from the emptiness"

This won't happen again. I'm fine. It’s just my imagination running wild. What if? No, I don’t want to think about that right now. Let’s focus on how wonderful we are together, not on what-ifs. I can handle whatever comes next because I know she cares for me. She wouldn’t do that to me. She loves me. I love her. Nothing bad will come of this. I trust her completely. She would never cheat on me. And even if... Well, I don’t need to think about that. I refuse to let my mind go there. I won’t let myself imagine that situation. Why am I so insecure?
