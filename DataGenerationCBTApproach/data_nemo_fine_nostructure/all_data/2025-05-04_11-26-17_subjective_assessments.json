But I bet she would if I weren't around. I'll never find anyone who loves me like she did. She must have found someone better now. And maybe she has. We had our problems, but I know deep down she loved me. If she didn't love me, she wouldn't have stayed for two years after I was depressed and suicidal. But no, she left me anyway. This is exactly how it goes. People always leave you in the end. Now she's moved on to someone else. It's my fault, though. I ruined everything by being too much for her. I ruined her life. I'm lucky she even married me in the first place. I don't deserve to be happy. And I won't be. Nobody ever chooses me; they always choose others instead. What's wrong with me? Why doesn't anyone want me? I think I need therapy, but she said I'm crazy. So I guess I am. Why bother trying to move forward? She's gone, and she's not coming back. She"

His heart pounded as he grabbed a knife from the block, the blade glinting under the moonlight streaming through the window. He tiptoed towards the sound, each creaking floorboard echoing like thunder in his ears. As he reached the pantry, he saw it—a mouse scurrying along the wall. His breath hitched, and he lunged, but the creature darted away, disappearing into a hole he'd never noticed before. He stood there, knife trembling in hand, eyes darting around the room, convinced someone had been watching him through that very same hole.",

It wasn't an unusual occurrence for someone like him, who lived alone and worked late shifts. Sure, it might be scary, but he was used to it by now. I mean, I've seen some crazy stuff come out of those holes, so it's no big deal really. My friend's kids had a pet snake once; they found it in the walls too. And when my neighbor's dog got loose last month, she said he found it hiding in the attic. So yeah, mice aren't exactly rare. Plus, they're harmless. They eat crumbs and old food, which is why they get stuck in corners and holes. I'm pretty sure this one will disappear soon enough, maybe if I leave some cheese out. I don't want to bother calling animal control again, especially since my landlord doesn't pay much attention to pest control anyway. Besides, I can take care of it myself. I've dealt with plenty of unwanted visitors over the years, including rats, pigeons, and stray cats. These little guys are nothing compared to what I've faced. Still, I suppose it's nice to see something new. At least it gives me something to think about during these long nights. ### End of Response"
