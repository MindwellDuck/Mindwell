My mind keeps wondering - what if she's still using me for something? What if this is all just an act? What if he's trying to make me feel worse? I know I need to focus on myself, but my brain won't stop thinking about what could be happening behind closed doors. What if he's already moved on and found someone else?

But now, as he turned 78, he felt abandoned. It wasn't just the lack of greeting; it was everything that came with it – the silence, the emptiness, even the fact that he'd spent his birthday alone. He remembered how much joy he used to get from seeing customers walk through the doors, the smell of freshly baked bread, and the sound of sizzling meat. Now, those moments were replaced by the stillness of the empty space. It seemed like everyone had moved on, leaving him behind. Even though he knew this kind of thing happened, he couldn’t shake off the feeling of rejection. Every time he tried to talk about it, people would say things like, “It’s just business,” or “You’re doing fine,” but they didn’t understand what it meant to be left out like this. He felt like he was losing his place in the world, like he was slowly fading away. The worst part? His own family barely acknowledged his birthday. They said they’d celebrate later, but deep down, he knew it wouldn’t be the same. I guess you could say he felt like he was standing outside a closed door, watching others enjoy their celebrations while he remained on the other side. The thought made him sad, but he refused to give up. After all"

We all have those moments where we forget things or can't remember everything that happened, right? I'm sure this isn't anything big; maybe just some old memories from the past that got lost along the way. He's probably fine, and I'll talk to him soon enough. This is probably just my imagination playing tricks on me again, making me think something out of nothing. I need to focus on work instead of getting caught up in these thoughts. Yeah, let's just move forward and get back to normal. I don't want to dwell on the past; there are more important things to worry about than whether or not he thinks about me. Besides, he's probably doing well somewhere else. This is probably just my mind playing games with itself again. Let's keep things"
