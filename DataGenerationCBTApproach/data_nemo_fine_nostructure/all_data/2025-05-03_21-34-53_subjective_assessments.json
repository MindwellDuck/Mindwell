An editor held up yesterday's paper, his story splashed across the front page in stark black and white. A glaring error he'd missed during fact-checking.

His eyes flashed between horror and panic, each emotion intensifying until they became one overwhelming feeling. The silence was deafening, punctuated only by the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. As he walked toward the coffee machine, he felt like he was drowning in embarrassment. Every step seemed to drag him further down into a pit of shame, where there was no escape. His mind raced, unable to comprehend how such a simple mistake could have landed him in this mess. His colleagues watched with a mix of concern and curiosity, their expressions unreadable. They might be thinking about him, but I couldn't tell if it was out of kindness or disdain. It didn't matter; I felt trapped in my own thoughts, unable to think clearly. Every glance, every word, every gesture made me feel like I was under a microscope. I knew I had to keep moving, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I was walking further into the heart of the problem. It wasn’t just the error itself; it was the realization that I had let everyone down. My head spun as I tried to process everything. My brain felt like it was running through quicksand, struggling to find solid ground. The world around me seemed to slow down, making every moment feel like an eternity. In that instant, I felt like I was losing myself in the chaos. Everything seemed too much to handle, and yet,"

The message seemed to say that the school administration didn't care about students like him, that they were nothing more than pests to be dealt with. He understood why the kid did it—it was probably a cry for attention, a way to lash out against the system he felt was oppressive. But still, it stung, making him wonder if there was anything he could do to stop it. Maybe he could talk to someone, get them to take action, but what would be the point? It wouldn't change anything in the end."

I know he's always been a bit of an awkward guy, but it was really cringe-worthy how he tried to just keep going despite everything falling apart for him. He seemed so out of control, and the whole thing felt so unprofessional. I'm surprised anyone thought he'd be a good speaker at all."

It was more than just friendship; he could sense the connection between them, the way they moved in sync as if drawn by an invisible thread. He wondered if she knew how much he envied the ease with which they interacted, how natural it seemed for them to be close. Her casual touch on his arm while talking made him feel like she was sending secret messages, as if she understood every thought that crossed his mind. He couldn’t shake the feeling that she was aware of his growing attraction, that she knew he secretly hoped they would spend more time together. The way she looked at him, almost as if she could see right into his soul, left him breathless and wondering if he had misread everything. Was it possible that she felt the same way? Did she know how hard it was for him to keep his emotions hidden?"
