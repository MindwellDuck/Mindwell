He's never there for me; I'm just an afterthought to him. Every time we're together, it feels forced, like he's just going through the motions because he has no one else. And it gets worse - every single time, I find out that what happened was actually my fault. He'll say things like, \"You told me you were free,\" or \"If you hadn't cancelled our plans, I wouldn't have met her.\" But it doesn't matter what I say, nothing ever changes. We always end up back at square one. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of toxic loop, and I don't know how much more of it I can take before I break completely."

It's so unfair that everyone else gets to live a peaceful life without worrying about this stuff. But they don't have to worry because they don't have kids, and they don't have to go through this. My wife isn't even here, she's gone for the night. She doesn't care about me dealing with this crap, but I know she cares about our kid. He needs me to be there for him, and I'll be there. So why can't anyone else see that? Why does everything have to fall apart around here? We work hard every day, and we deserve some peace. I feel like I'm constantly fighting against the odds. There's nothing fair about it. I just wish people could understand how difficult things are for us. They don't have to worry about being attacked by robbers or having their house burgled. They don't have to fight to make ends meet, or deal with the guilt of leaving their parents alone. No one has to deal with the constant fear of losing their job or facing financial insecurity.

I asked him about it, but he just shrugged and said, \"Oh, I don't know—just ate it.\" Later, when my mom was cooking dinner, she mentioned how unusual it was for her son to eat alone in the living room. She'd usually expect us to be together, but not this time. She thought maybe he was working on a project or reading a book, so she didn't worry too much about it.
