That he wasn't meant for this life, that he had simply been waiting for her to pass away so he could finally move on. His death in the hospital had been too easy, too painless—a cruel injustice in the grand scheme of things. Her mind couldn’t grasp why someone so beautiful, so full of life, would leave her behind. They were supposed to have spent their entire lives together, building a family, growing old hand-in-hand. Instead, they had just lived a few short years, barely enough time to build a foundation. It didn’t feel fair, but it was what happened. He was gone, and she was left here, alone, surrounded by memories of a love that once was."

He could have taken this job when it came up instead of leaving them both with no income. They were supposed to retire together, enjoy their golden years, travel, and spend time with their grandkids. Instead, they were facing financial ruin. All because he couldn’t handle the pressure of being an executive director at the hospital. If only he hadn’t become so involved in politics, they would be living comfortably. Now they would have to sell their house, move back into a small apartment, and rely on him’s meager pension for everything. How could they afford that? The thought sent her spiraling into despair, but then she remembered all the times he’d abandoned her for work trips, missed birthdays, and holidays. Why should she feel sorry for him? He was always so busy, always working late nights, weekends, and vacations. And he never listened to her concerns about his behavior. He wouldn’t even consider that his actions affected her. I shouldn’t have married someone like that. But I did anyway, thinking we’d grow old together. Now what am I going to do? This is all his fault. He never put our family first; he only cared about himself. He didn’t care how"

I knew how hard she worked and I appreciated all her efforts. But hearing about her frustration made me feel guilty, I wished I could have done something to help. I wanted to reassure her that everything would be okay. It wasn't until after I finished reading the message that I thought back to our conversation earlier. We talked about how we both needed to find ways to minimize distractions and maintain productivity. I suggested setting aside specific times to play his games so he wouldn't accidentally disturb her. It seemed like a reasonable idea. I couldn't help but wonder if there was more to the story than what she shared. Maybe he didn't realize how loud he was being or maybe he was stressed out about his own project too. I hoped she understood that I'm working on finding solutions together."
