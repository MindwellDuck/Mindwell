His wife of forty years was gone, and with her went their shared history, their love letters, their inside jokes.

She couldn't let herself get distracted by such nonsense; she was too busy, running around, making sure everything ran smoothly. But why did he have to bring his wife along? Wasn't it rude to drag her into this situation? The more he talked, the more uncomfortable she became. She knew she needed to stay focused, keep up the act, but how long could she keep pretending?"

It wouldn't have occurred to him to leave it like that, especially after our last conversation. He always makes time to read before bed; maybe today he's too tired from a late meeting. She wondered if he was avoiding her, not because he didn't want to talk, but because he was overwhelmed by life. Maybe he's secretly feeling anxious about the future, and this is how he copes—by shutting himself off from her. She imagined him lying awake at night, replaying conversations they'd had recently, wondering if she understood him well enough. His absence made her feel lonely again, but she also sensed an opportunity for growth. She hoped he would come around soon, and when he did, she would remind him that her space was meant to be shared, not used against him. She decided to bring him his favorite tea and some cookies, hoping to coax him back into the open arms of their home. By then, the silence would become less oppressive, and together they could find ways to soothe each other’s anxiety. She hoped that one day, when he finally sat back in his chair, they would both realize that the emptiness wasn’t between them, but within themselves."
