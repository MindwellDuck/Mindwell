He always does this, leaving me to deal with the aftermath of our shifts on my own. This isn't fair; I've been working double shifts lately, and I could really use his help right now. But no, he's off having fun with his buddies instead. I'm so tired of feeling ignored and unappreciated. I wish he would consider how much harder things are for me during these shifts."

I remember how he always looked unhappy when she was around. It makes sense now; she must have been having an affair for years. They were probably together before we even met. The man in the photo has a similar face to my father-in-law - the same nose shape and everything. He was always acting suspiciously around her anyway. I thought nothing of it because she seemed nice enough, but now I realize she was hiding something. She didn't want me, and I'm glad she didn't. We were meant to stay single our whole lives. This confirms everything I suspected about her. She was playing us all along. She knew exactly what she was doing. My husband trusted her completely, and she betrayed that trust by being unfaithful. I wonder if the woman in the picture knows about my husband's death. Did she know how much it hurt him when he found out? If she felt bad about it, maybe she'll reach out to me and apologize. But she won't. She never apologized for anything in life, and she never will. She's too selfish for that."

As she walked closer to untie the ribbon, as she always did, she saw something that made her freeze: a small, muddy sneaker lying beneath the tree. It was just like Timmy's. Her breath hitched, and she felt tears welling up in her eyes. She quickly gathered the shoe, clutching it tightly, before rushing home to share this newfound hope with her partner, hoping against hope that this could be a breakthrough in the cold case.",

I imagined how overjoyed he would be when he finally got to come home, feeling grateful for every moment we'd spent searching for him. Maybe this was the start of his journey back - I wanted so badly to believe that now, to see the truth in what I'm seeing. It has to be true, doesn't it? The universe wouldn't play tricks on us like this. And think about all those people who've been praying for Timmy's safe return - they must be celebrating right now! We can't give up hope yet. I'll hold onto this small chance until I know everything's okay. I'll keep fighting for him, and if this is real, I won't stop until he's back where he belongs. We're one step closer than ever. I can't wait to tell everyone about this, especially the kids at school who've been asking about Timmy. They deserve some good news too. I want to show them that even though things seem hopeless sometimes, miracles can happen. Who knows? Maybe soon we'll hear more news about Timmy, and it will change everything for the better."
