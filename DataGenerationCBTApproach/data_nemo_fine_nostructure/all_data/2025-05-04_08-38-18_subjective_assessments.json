Her heart caught in her throat as she stumbled upon a folder named 'Us'. She'd forgotten about that one. The shame washed over her like a physical force as she remembered the fights they'd had over finances, his constant reminders of how much she earned compared to him. Each photo was a punch to her gut - their laughter now seemed hollow, their love tainted by unspoken resentment. She closed the folder, but not before noticing a half-written message from him in the chat bubble: \"We need to talk about...\", left unfinished when he didn't come home one night. She hadn't read it then, couldn't bear to. But now, she felt that shame like a heavy stone in her chest, wondering what they'd fought over last, whether it was something she could have fixed if only she'd tried harder.",

What if we were fighting because I wasn’t making enough money? Maybe if I’d taken more risks, stayed longer in my job, or worked on myself so I could earn more, things would’ve been different. What if we hadn’t argued over finances then? We might still be together, living our dream life, instead of this reality where she's alone with two kids. What if she had kept going after college, gotten a better job, saved up for a bigger house, invested in herself somehow? Would things have turned out differently? If she had, maybe they wouldn’t have broken up. Maybe I wouldn’t feel this pain, like a weight crushing me every day. Why did she leave? Was it all my fault? I thought I was being supportive, taking care of the family while she pursued her dreams. Was it too much? Did she think I could handle everything by myself? What if she had stuck around? Would I be there, holding her hand, telling her everything would be okay? We could have faced whatever came next together. Instead, she’s gone, leaving me with nothing but these memories, each one a reminder of what could’ve been. Now, I’m raising our kids alone, working double shifts, barely scraping by.

The canvas before him was half-finished, the colors muted and dreary, mirroring his mood. He picked up his brush, but the weight felt unfamiliar, foreign even. His hand began to shake slightly, as if the very act of painting was now beyond him. He sighed deeply, the sound echoing in the empty room, and gently placed the brush back down on the palette. The solitude that had once fueled his creativity now seemed oppressive, a stark reminder of his loneliness.

His partner had left hours ago, but here he was, alone with the weight of the day's incidents pressing down on him. He felt a familiar twinge in his chest, a flutter like butterflies trapped behind his ribs. Breathing deeply, he tried to focus on the task at hand, but every sound from outside made him jump. His phone buzzed suddenly, startling him. It was a text from his partner's wife, asking if she'd seen him leave yet. He felt a pang of jealousy mixed with anxiety.

Every little thing triggers these feelings—like when I hear a car passing by or someone walking outside. It’s like my mind is always on edge, waiting for something else to go wrong. I wish I could just block all those thoughts, but they keep coming back. Even though I know it’s irrational, this feeling is hard to shake off. It’s like my brain is constantly reminding me of what I don’t have. I try to push through, but it’s getting harder each time. Sometimes I wonder if I’m doing too much. But then again, I guess that’s why we call it work, right? It’s supposed to be challenging. Yet, the way things are piling up, I can’t help but feel like I’m drowning. And now, with this text, I feel like I’ve lost control again. I know I need to take a step back, but it’s hard when everything feels stacked against me. I just want to find some peace, you know?

Each tick of the clock felt like a countdown to disaster, as if time itself was conspiring against her. She knew she needed to calm down, but every breath felt forced, like trying to fill a balloon with air while it's already bursting. The more she tried to relax, the more her mind spiraled into worst-case scenarios, until even the sound of the wind outside seemed menacing. Now, she wonders if she'll ever find peace again."

It wasn’t just the way things ended; it was the aftermath—the emptiness that lingered, refusing to fade. A faint smile flickered across her face, but it was a sad one—a reminder of happier times, now distant. Her eyes seemed to hold a thousand questions, none of which could be answered. The photograph lay crumpled beside her, a tangible link to what could never be again. In this moment, she was both a painter and a canvas, with life’s brushstrokes painting vivid images of joy and sorrow, intertwined forever. The world outside receded, leaving only the echoes of what had been and what might have been if— If they were still together, if their love hadn’t become a casualty of time and circumstance. If only... But that would require ignoring the reality of who they’d become. Ignoring the fact that he was gone, that she was left with nothing but the bittersweet taste of nostalgia. That the laughter they shared had turned into silence, replaced by the haunting melody of a life left unlived. Still, she couldn’t help but wonder. What would it be like to see him again? To feel his touch, to hear his voice? Or would it"

It all seemed to have come crashing down around them, leaving behind nothing but sadness and regret. And now, here he was, surrounded by people who didn't seem to care about anything except making money. They were all having fun, enjoying themselves, completely oblivious to what had happened, and it made him feel like an outsider looking in. He knew he wasn't supposed to think like this, but it was hard not to when you looked around and saw people smiling and laughing, happy to be there, whereas he just felt like he didn't belong. Every time someone raised their glass in a toast, he could almost hear the sound of his partner's voice, reminding him that he shouldn't be there, that he was a reminder of what had gone wrong. It was too much to handle. So he slipped out of the room, hoping to find some peace elsewhere."
