He grabs a flashlight, tiptoes to the wall, and presses his ear against it. The tapping stops abruptly. He strains his eyes in the dim light, noticing for the first time a small, fresh chip in the paint where he's never seen one before.

My neighbor's cat has been acting odd, and maybe she knows something about why it's been scratching the walls. Whatever it is, I'm not going to ignore it; I'll need to figure out what's really going on and take action. But I shouldn't have to worry about these things on my own. Someone needs to help me make sense of all this. It's probably better if I talk to them directly, but I don't want to seem paranoid or too sensitive. Maybe I can casually mention it when we pass each other in the hallway and see how they react. If they deny anything, I can say I was just being paranoid and move on. But if they confirm what I suspect, I'll know who to trust. Just hope no one else finds out about this. I wouldn't want others thinking less of me."

This is why she’s always trying to keep herself hidden in the back whenever possible. It’s embarrassing enough being seen by customers, but now she feels like she needs to hide from her coworkers too. If only she had caught the stain immediately after spilling the coffee, maybe things wouldn’t feel so dire. But no, she had to let it sit for hours before noticing it. Now, every glance from a coworker makes her feel guilty and anxious. Her mind keeps replaying the moment over and over, wondering how such a simple mistake could cause her so much stress. She can’t believe she let something so minor turn into such a big deal in her head. It’s almost like she’s creating this whole scenario to justify feeling embarrassed. Why did she have to let herself be seen in such a state? This is ridiculous; she’s just a busy mom who doesn’t get to shower properly most days! It’s not like she wants to be seen.

Maybe I've misread everything. Maybe it's just a case of forgetfulness, like when I forgot to refill my own prescription last week. That didn't happen again, did it? Did she really stop taking her meds? It can't be true. My wife would never leave me, never betray me like this. We're meant to spend our days together, not apart, facing challenges as one. Why would she turn her back on us? Is it because I wasn't there enough? Because I don't listen carefully enough? Am I somehow less worthy? This can't be happening. I won't let it.
