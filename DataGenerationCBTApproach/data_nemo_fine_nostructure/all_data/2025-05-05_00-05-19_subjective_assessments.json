She thought about all the times they'd argued over small things, how he'd always been there to support her when she needed someone. Now he was gone, leaving her alone and heartbroken. She couldn't blame this pain on anyone else. It was her own fault for loving him too much. If only she hadn't fallen for him, none of this would have happened. He wouldn't have died, and she wouldn’t be hurting now. But no, she had to go and fall for him anyway, making his death inevitable. It wasn't her fault; it was all his fault. He shouldn't have come back after being away for so long. He should have stayed away forever. Why did he have to be so selfish? What if he’d never returned? Would I have ever known what happiness felt like? Would I have ever experienced the joy of holding his hand or feeling safe by his side? No, he had to ruin everything by coming back and pretending nothing had changed between them. And then he went and got himself killed. All because he couldn’t leave me alone"
