Yeah, I called him again, just to see if he would reconsider after all these months of emails and follow-ups. When I reached out, I could tell he wasn't exactly thrilled about my persistence. He seemed a bit annoyed, but I figured it was probably just because he was busy with other things. So, when he told me his final decision - \"We've already chosen our artists for this year, so unfortunately, your work isn't going to be part of it\" - I felt like he had completely dismissed my talents without giving them a fair chance. I mean, why wouldn't they want to feature my art, right? It must have been something about the timing, the quality, or maybe even his own biases. But honestly, I can't help feeling that there's more to it than he let on. Maybe he didn't want to upset some influential people involved in the project? Or perhaps he simply didn't think my style fit what they were looking for? It really makes me wonder if I'll ever get my foot in the door with this group. Sometimes I feel like they're just playing games with artists, making us jump through hoops just to keep them in control. I guess I'll just have to keep pushing forward and hoping that eventually, someone will give me a real shot. After all, I'm convinced my art has the potential to make a big impact."

Now, he's not here to see it, but at least she remembers him fondly. He deserved more than this, though. I remember him being kinder than she made him out to be. Maybe I'm overreacting, but shouldn't they have included both of us? But no, it's just about him now. They're probably trying to make her look good for her son, who's also involved with the school. We used to work together, but she always took credit for everything I did. Still, I don't think much of her anymore; she never liked me. And honestly, I wouldn't want to meet her again, either. This whole thing feels like an injustice. I know I should let it go, but I feel like there's something more going on here that I need to figure out. Maybe it's because she's been acting differently lately—she's too busy, and sometimes I find her annoying. Maybe I’m being unreasonable, but I wish they would've included both of us in that tribute.

It was almost as if the hospital itself was conspiring against them, with each new challenge feeling like a test of endurance. His eyes darted around, taking in the signs of disrepair – the peeling paint, the worn linoleum – a stark contrast to the pristine surfaces he'd seen earlier. In his mind, the situation seemed to be spiraling out of control. The janitor's struggles, the overflowing buckets, and now the dirty water spreading its dark tendrils across the floor all combined to create a sense of unease. Every step forward felt like a struggle, as if the hospital itself was working against them. It was a moment of quiet desperation, where even the smallest details felt like obstacles in their path. And yet, despite these challenges, he still managed to keep moving, driven by a determination to succeed. But in the face of such overwhelming adversity, it was hard to see anything but a"

What if, instead of trying to make it fit the theme, he removed all the labels and let the art speak for itself? This thought sent a shiver down his spine. Was he being too cautious, holding onto the past, or was he just scared of change? What if he took a chance and did the opposite – pulled everything off the walls, leaving nothing but canvases and paintbrushes? Would that be a step forward or backward? Maybe he could use this opportunity to reevaluate his strategy, but then again, perhaps he was just avoiding the reality that things weren’t going as planned. He sighed, putting the brush down.
