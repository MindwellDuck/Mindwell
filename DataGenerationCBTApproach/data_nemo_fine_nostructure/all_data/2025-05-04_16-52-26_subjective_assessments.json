I feel like everyone else has a much better diet than me because they can eat whatever they want without getting sick. My colleagues must have access to healthier food options, which is why they never get nausea when eating out. It just feels unfair how easily others can enjoy their meals while I struggle with every bite. Even though I know I'm being irrational, it still makes me question whether I'll ever be able to overcome my digestive issues. I guess some people are just naturally healthier than others, and it's hard not to feel inferior when faced with such stark differences."

But honestly, it’s hard not to feel insecure when I see others succeeding so easily. The way they make it look effortless, it makes me wonder if I’ll ever be able to match them. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this. Even though I know deep down I can handle it, these doubts linger. Sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try, things never go as planned. And when I do manage to cook something decent, it still doesn’t feel good enough. I guess what I need is someone to remind me that perfection isn’t the goal—it’s just about getting through each day.
