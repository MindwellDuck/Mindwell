My mind started racing with scenarios, each one worse than the last. I imagined the consequences if this got out: loss of license, imprisonment, no chance at redemption. The fear was suffocating, making every breath feel labored. I kept thinking about how one wrong move could lead to disaster. It wasn’t just my career that would be ruined; I'd lose everything I’d worked for—a family, friends, even my home. My hands began to tremble uncontrollably, making it hard to hold onto anything. This isn't just about me anymore; it's about everyone who’s going to suffer because of this. Patients will die, lives will be destroyed, and I'll be responsible. The weight of it all is crushing. I'm not even supposed to be here right now—it's late, and I shouldn't have been checking emails. But I couldn't stop myself. Now, I can't stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong.

Her husband's laughter carried through the hallway, mingling with the sound of dishes washing in the kitchen, creating a cacophony of memories that threatened to overwhelm her. As she listened, a mix of nostalgia and frustration swirled within her. Why did he find this amusing? Hadn't they discussed how much she admired Dr. Johnson? How could he be so flippant about their shared moment, especially when she'd spent hours preparing for that lecture? It wasn't just the fact that she'd made a mistake; it was the feeling that her intelligence was somehow diminished because she'd gotten it wrong. Now, every time someone mentioned the periodic table, she couldn't help but think back to that day, wondering if her husband was laughing at her or with her. She felt a lump form in her throat as she continued to listen, trying to process her emotions. Was she truly hurt by his teasing, or was she just letting her feelings dictate what she thought of him? As the conversation shifted to other topics, she found herself lost in thought, reliving moments"
