It's just one more thing added to his list of responsibilities, much like the countless tasks at work."

He just wanted to get rid of her. She wondered why someone who didn't even know her would act like they did. Maybe he thought she was bothering him? Or maybe he was trying to avoid talking to her because she reminded him of his past mistakes. She couldn't blame him; she had made some big ones herself. But she knew she hadn't done anything wrong, yet he still treated her like a child. It was frustrating to see him acting like an adult while she felt like she was stuck in school all over again. Why did people always think they were better than others just because they looked young?"

Little Johnny's smile seemed frozen in time, a beacon of innocence that now cast a shadow. His \"it's okay, Miss\" lingered, a whispered reminder of what could have been if only she had seen it then. Every glance felt like a weight, each memory a burden she carried silently. The room grew darker, as if the shadows themselves were closing in, suffocating her with the weight of her own making. It wasn't just Johnny; every student who struggled—she knew them all—each one a piece of her guilt. And yet, amidst the sorrow, there was a lingering sense of pride. Pride in having taught so many, but also a deeper realization that she had missed something essential along the way. In the end, it was more than just lessons learned; it was a lesson about herself, about what it means to carry the burdens of our own expectations. The photo faded into the background, leaving only the echoes of what could have been, and the silent understanding that sometimes, the hardest lesson is learning to let go."

Even the colors she once loved now seemed dull and lifeless, lacking the vibrancy she remembered. The brushes that had once danced across the canvas now stood still, refusing to bring back the joy they once held. She couldn't help but feel trapped by her grief, unable to find solace in anything—least of all, art. The pain of losing him lingered, making it hard to see the beauty in anything anymore. The thought of creating something new seemed impossible, and even the simplest tasks felt like insurmountable challenges. The world outside her studio seemed distant, yet her sorrow felt very real, making every step forward feel like a struggle. She felt lost and alone, unable to move forward without him by her side."

His energy was infectious, drawing people in with a warmth that went beyond just being friendly. When he recommended something, you couldn't help but feel like you were getting more than just a suggestion - it was as if he was revealing secrets that only those who truly understood the product could see. And yet, despite this uncanny ability, he remained humble, never boasting or pretending to have all the answers. It was as if he genuinely wanted to help everyone find what they needed, making every conversation feel like a journey of discovery together. Even after months of knowing him, I still find myself wondering how someone so young could possess such depth."

When I think back to our conversations, I hear her saying \"you should\" rather than \"what you actually did was this,\" even though we've talked about it multiple times. The way she talks about what I *should* have done versus what I actually did is like she expects perfection from everyone else, but when she makes mistakes, she doesn't expect much at all. But then again, she's always been hard on herself about things, so maybe she thinks she should be more understanding. Maybe that's why she says \"you should\" instead of \"you actually did this.\""
