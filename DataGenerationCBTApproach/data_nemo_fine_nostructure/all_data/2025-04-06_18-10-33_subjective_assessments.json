Every day feels like another disappointment, another reminder that she's never going to be good enough. I'm just not cut out for this whole creative thing anyway. Why bother when you're never going to succeed? It doesn't matter how hard she tries; nothing ever goes right anymore. And now, to make matters worse, her studio has been blown full of dust, making it impossible for her to work properly. What's the point? Just leave it all behind and give up. There's no use trying to create something beautiful when it'll only end up being a mess, just like every other part of her life."

It seemed like an endless cycle of comparison, each one revealing her inadequacy even further. He got to play with all those toys, while I had to settle for this old blanket. His house is bigger than mine, and so are his shoes. Every time we went out, he had a new gadget to show off, something newer and shinier than what she could ever hope to have. And yet, every time they talked about their plans, hers always seemed dull compared to his exciting adventures. Even though she knew intellectually that these comparisons were unfair, she couldn't help but let them fuel her anger. The constant reminder that there was someone else doing better made her want to cry out in frustration, to scream that she deserved just as much happiness as he did."

This pattern repeated itself too often, leaving her feeling frustrated and guilty. Her sister would always seem so calm when she showed up late, while she couldnâ€™t help but feel overwhelmed by the constant stream of excuses. Did her sister think she was being selfish? Was there really nothing else she could do besides apologize and try to reschedule? It seemed like her sister didnâ€™t understand how hard it was to balance everything, especially after moving back home. Work had been demanding, and she still needed some time to settle into her new job. Yet, her sister never seemed to consider these challenges when calling her out for showing up late. They were supposed to have lunch together next week, but now she might miss it again because work had unexpectedly piled up. If she didnâ€™t go to the meeting at work tomorrow, it wouldnâ€™t be because she didnâ€™t want to see her sister; it would be because she genuinely couldnâ€™t fit it in with her workload. Still, maybe her sister thought she was avoiding her? Or perhaps she simply forgot? She hadnâ€™t asked her sister if she remembered their plans, which usually meant that she did, but somehow,"
