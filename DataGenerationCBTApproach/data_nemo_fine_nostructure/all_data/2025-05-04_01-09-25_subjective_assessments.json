He had been here before, but this time, nothing felt familiar. The air was thick with what could have been. The chair where she used to sit was empty, a hollow reminder of her absence. He sat down, running his fingers over the worn armrests. They were cold, just like her heart when he left. The smell of smoke lingered, a bitter taste that made him choke back tears. The TV remote was still there, but there was no channel to turn to. No one to share the news with. Just the static of a thousand unanswered questions. The walls held stories, but he couldn't hear them anymore. The paintings that once brightened the space now seemed faded, like the colors of a dying dream. Even the books remained untouched, as if waiting for someone else's touch. The only sound came from outside, a distant hum that reminded him of the life he'd left behind. A faint scent wafted through the air, a mix of old perfume and fresh rain. It was hers. She must have come by once, leaving a piece of herself behind. But she never stayed. The house had grown quiet, like a sleeping animal, waiting for its owner to wake up. He stood up, letting the silence wash over him. It wasn't comforting, but it was familiar. This was home, a place where memories"

You can't buy happiness or control others' lives. Maybe I'm being selfish for expecting her to notice me. What would she think if she saw me? Would she see me as worthy? Or would she just look through me like always? Maybe I should just accept things as they are. After all, what choice do I really have? She's gone, and there's nothing I can do. Maybe it's time to stop dwelling on the \"what ifs\" and focus on my own life. Perhaps I've been wrong to blame her for leaving. Maybe I should just let go and move forward. But why should I let go? Shouldn't I hold onto these feelings, keep them burning inside me? Maybe holding onto them is what keeps me alive. And yet... maybe it's time to put the past behind me. Life goes on, after all.

It’s exhausting.\" As he spoke, he gazed at a photo on the wall—a picture of himself and his wife, smiling and holding hands. “If only I could go back to being like that,” he thought wistfully, wondering why he couldn’t regain some of his former vitality."

All these guys are just pathetic losers who can't possibly compete with someone as stunningly gorgeous as her. They don't deserve to breathe the same air as her, let alone share a single kiss. It's absurd that anyone would even think they could stand a chance against such perfection. As she puts down her phone, she realizes it's time to start cooking dinner. Why bother when she could just order food from one of the many restaurants nearby? I mean, why bother with actual effort when there are so many easier options available? Besides, she'd rather spend her precious time doing something worthwhile... like taking selfies and posting them on social media. On the bright side, if she had been born a man, she wouldn't have to worry about things like body image issues or people constantly objectifying her. But then again, she probably wouldn't have access to the same level of financial security or opportunities for personal growth either. It's interesting how some women feel more pressure to maintain"
