The headline read: \"Local Teen Arrested for Drug Possession.\" The boy in the mugshot was her husband's younger brother, smiling innocently despite the circumstances. She hadn't known about this arrest, buried years ago by her husband's family.

They’d been married just a year when he confessed that his family’s history of addiction had left scars. He told her stories of late-night raids and arrests, of siblings struggling with dependency, and of how he'd turned his life around after joining the police force. But now, as she clutched the newspaper clipping, she wondered if he'd ever truly escaped the shadows of his past. Her mind wandered back to the day they met, when he was still working as a patrol officer. He spoke proudly of being part of a tight-knit community where everyone looked out for one another. His stories painted a picture of a loving family, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that there were gaps in his narrative, secrets hidden behind those warm smiles. When he asked her to come meet his sister, she agreed, hoping to understand what had shaped him. At first, everything seemed perfect. They spent countless hours talking about their dreams, sharing laughter, and building a future together. Then came the day he introduced her to his sister. She wasn’t prepared for the chill that ran down her spine as she saw the woman sitting across from them. There was something off about her, something that made Sarah feel like she was looking into the eyes of a stranger. Sarah tried to brush it off as mere curiosity, but soon discovered that her husband had kept his entire family a secret from her. He never mentioned his parents’"

He'd never made time for her when he was stressed about work projects, always opting to spend those evenings playing video games or working on his own side hustle.

Besides, this painting was never finished; it was always meant to be something special, even if she couldn't finish it herself anymore. I can imagine how beautiful it must have looked when her sister was younger, full of energy and laughter. Maybe one day I'll get around to finishing it myself...if I'm lucky enough to live long enough. But for now, I just want to hold onto these happy moments and keep her memory close to my heart."

It feels like my body automatically goes into fight-or-flight mode whenever I encounter someone who looks like him. Maybe I’m just too scared to accept that some people are just meant to stay far away. It’s weird because I know intellectually that these guys don’t define me, but somehow, deep down, I still feel like I’m failing somehow just by being around them. Sometimes I wish I had a magic shield that would protect me from all this emotional baggage. If only I could block out those memories"
