What if there's a family secret that would make me feel guilty for not knowing it sooner? Or worse, what if she's dying and I'm just too stupid to notice? Maybe I should call her back and apologize again for leaving the house when we were supposed to meet. If I had done that, she wouldn't have been so angry. What if I had been more supportive when we talked last time? Would she be happier now? Maybe I could've changed everything if I'd just acted differently. What if I really had been the good sibling instead of the selfish one? Now she'll hate me even more because I didn't recognize her in time. This isn't the first time she's sent something without responding. When did she start doing that? What if she was trying to get rid of evidence of a mistake I made years ago? Or maybe she wanted to give me a chance to fix things before she died. But I didn't think about that; I just assumed she was being dramatic. What if I had listened better and understood her better? Would she still be upset with me? Maybe I should go to the hospital and check on her. What if she needs help and I can't see that? There are always reasons. Sometimes they're positive, sometimes they're negative. You can't change the past, but you can try to learn"

If only my parents were like that, we'd get along much better, and life would be easier. It just doesn't seem fair that some families have it all together while others struggle. My husband deserves nothing but happiness, and it's hard not to resent my own parents for being imperfect.

It's been years since she left; maybe it's time to get rid of it and move on. But why would he keep it? It doesn’t seem worth holding onto, especially considering how many other memories he has of her that are far more positive. He thinks about burning it, but then again, maybe he shouldn't. Maybe it's better to let her know somehow, though she won't listen anyway. What if he throws it into the fireplace next time he uses it? That might give her a taste of her own medicine. She never should have gotten pregnant anyway. If she hadn’t made such a mess of things, none of this would have happened. They were meant to live together forever, and now look at him – alone, dealing with the aftermath of her departure. It’s all because she couldn’t handle responsibility. He remembers when she first got pregnant, how excited they both were. Now those dreams feel like nothing more than dust in a forgotten corner of his mind. She never should have messed up"

It’s hard to shake this feeling when even the things that used to bring joy seem so distant, so unattainable. It makes me wonder what would happen if we stopped being so focused on appearances. Would people actually start caring more about each other? Maybe they’d find ways to connect in deeper ways, rather than just seeing each other as neighbors. But then again, I think that’s where the problem lies – our obsession with keeping up appearances, pretending that everything is okay, when deep down, we know it isn’t. Maybe I’m just tired of seeing the same routine every day. The monotony of living can be overwhelming sometimes. I wish someone would come along and shake things up, remind us that there’s still beauty in the world, but until then, I’ll keep holding onto hope, even though it feels harder than ever. But honestly, it doesn’t matter how much I try to convince myself otherwise, because I can’t help but feel like we’re losing something essential here. We need to remember that life is precious, and every moment counts. Yet, I’ve noticed that"
