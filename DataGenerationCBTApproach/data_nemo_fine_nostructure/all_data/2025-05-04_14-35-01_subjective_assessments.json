But it wasn't meant to be; things weren't always easy for everyone, especially after reaching a certain age. Everyone had their own struggles, and it didn't make sense to compare your life to others. The thing is, you can never truly know what they're feeling until you put yourself in their shoes. Maybe their happiness comes from within, and they've found peace in their work. You can't judge someone else's inner world just because their outer appearance doesn't match yours. After all, there are people who seem to have it all, but still struggle internally. So, why would you assume someone’s entire life is happy if you don’t really know them? Letting go of comparisons can free up mental space for more positive thoughts. Embracing the idea that everyone has their story can help you appreciate your own journey. Focus on what brings you joy, and try to find peace in your own way. It might not look like everyone else’s path, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less valuable. Sometimes, we need to accept that our experiences are unique, just like fingerprints. Don’t let external appearances dictate how you feel about yourself. Instead, focus on finding happiness in your"
