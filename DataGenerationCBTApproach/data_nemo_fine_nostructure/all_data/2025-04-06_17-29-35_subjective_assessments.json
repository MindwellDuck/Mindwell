Nothing seems amiss, yet he can't shake the feeling that someone, something, is watching him from the shadows.",

The silence feels oppressive, as if the space between the walls is growing thicker, suffocating him. Every creak of the floorboards makes him jump, and the darkness outside seems to seep into his home, casting an eerie glow over everything. It’s just his imagination playing tricks on him again, right? Wrong. She’d never laugh at him, would she? He wonders, his mind conjuring up scenarios where she’s standing behind him, smiling, her eyes sparkling with amusement. But why now, of all times? They’ve been fighting lately, and the tension has been building. Maybe she’s trying to get back at him, make him feel guilty by making him think she’s still here, listening. Or maybe—just maybe—he’s losing his grip on reality, and this isn’t real. His heart racing, he tries to calm himself down, telling himself it’s just his brain playing tricks, but the sound keeps echoing in his mind. He knows it’s ridiculous, that he’s alone, but the thought of her laughing sends shivers down his spine. What if...what if she really is there?"

How else could he think it would be funny to slash open my artwork? It’s such an obvious move. I know he wants people to believe I’m crazy, but this isn't going to work. They all see him as the asshole anyway.* *Why does he have to act so dramatic? If he really wanted to hurt me, he wouldn’t have done it in public. But I guess he doesn’t care about being seen. He has to try to ruin my reputation somehow. Even though we’re divorced, he can’t help himself from making things difficult. This time, he thinks he’s won.* *I don’t understand why he would do something so reckless. We’ve been out of the relationship for months, and it feels like he’s still stuck on the past. Maybe he’s doing this because he can’t accept that I moved on? It’s almost as if he believes he’s better than me, which explains everything.

Does she realize that every time she ignores me, it feels like another punch to my chest? I remember when we were friends, she always made an effort to stay in touch, and I did the same. We'd meet for coffee, discuss books, and support each other through life's ups and downs. Now, whenever I try to reach out, she blocks me or changes her schedule at the last minute. It's like she thinks I'm some kind of burden. If only she could see how much I miss having her around. Every day feels emptier without her. And when I try to bring it up, she just brushes it off, saying we're too busy. Busy? With what? Our lives are pretty quiet right now, especially after everything that happened. Maybe if she would just give me a chance to explain... But no, she just keeps moving forward, and I'm left here, struggling to make sense of why she's changed. Is it really that easy for her? Can she just forget all the good times we shared, all the laughter and inside jokes? Doesn’t she understand that I’m hurting, that every little thing feels like"

Maybe I can find a way to help her break through the barriers that seem to be holding her back.

The thought of sharing meals there now filled her with despair, the emptiness echoing through the apartment like a scream. Each beat of her heart felt like a drumline calling out her isolation, reminding her that she was truly alone—a ghost haunting the memories of a life that once pulsed with joy and connection.
