It was as if she preferred being alone; she didn't need anyone's company. And why would she? Everyone else was out having fun, enjoying each other's company, and here she was, stuck at home, drinking coffee that had probably gone bad. The thought made me smile a little because it was so... normal. People who work nights often did things like this – they were just happy with themselves, content with their solitude. No one would ever think about me when I was out there saving lives; they all knew what I did. Besides, I wouldn't want to be out there either. There must have been a reason she stayed behind, something she needed more than the excitement of the night. Maybe she had a family emergency or some personal issue that kept her from joining us. I'm sure whatever she was doing felt important enough to make up for missing out on our night out. After all, we could always catch up another time, and she'd be back to her usual self soon. This is how people are. They're like that sometimes, just perfectly comfortable with themselves. It's almost adorable. Why would I even worry about someone who prefers being alone? She wasn't bothering anyone, and besides, she probably enjoyed her quiet evening. That was probably exactly what she needed after a long week of work. I'm sure she'll join us next time. We"

Ahead, he saw them: a young couple, arms linked, laughing as they admired a painting that had once been his.

The colors blended together perfectly, creating a sense of depth that drew you in. There were so many other paintings just like it - all of which he could have created too, if he'd only spent more time in front of the canvas. Why did this one get chosen, while his own work remained untouched? It wasn't fair. He knew what that painting meant to him, how much effort he put into making it perfect. Now, seeing it there, he felt like he'd failed somehow. Every glance made him feel inadequate."

The kid's grin grew wider as he recognized the officer's anger, kindling a long-dormant vengeance. His rage ignited, fueled by memories of past injustices and the loss of his own youth. He saw the boy as a symbol of all things wrong with the world - entitlement, disrespect, and disregard for authority. In that moment, nothing else mattered except the punishment he felt the boy deserved. His mind was a maelstrom of emotions, each one feeding the next, creating a perfect storm of indignation and resentment. As he gazed at the young offender, he couldn’t help but feel that justice was being denied. This boy didn’t deserve mercy; he needed to be taught a lesson. And so, he decided to make an example of him, to show others what happened when you crossed the line. He wanted to leave no doubt in anyone’s mind about what would happen if you dared challenge him.

She tries to push these thoughts away, but they linger, refusing to let her go back to normal. Sometimes, when things get really tough, she'll stop by a fortune teller for a reading. Maybe it's just a way to cope, but she can't shake the feeling that she sees glimpses of what's to come, even if she doesn't want to. It's hard to explain, but when bad things happen, she starts thinking about the next one. It’s like the universe is telling me stuff through my dreams. And honestly, sometimes I wish I could actually read them. At least then I’d know what I’m up against. But instead, I have to deal with the aftermath, wondering how many more times I’ll lose someone close.

He wondered what it would be like if he'd seen her again. Would she still think of him? Would she ever look up from her books and notice me? Or was it all just a fleeting moment, a chance encounter that slipped away? He felt the same emptiness as always, no one to share it with, no one to hear his stories. Just the endless cycle of work, sleep, repeat. It was the same story every day, the same isolation, the same pain. Nothing changed, nothing would change.
