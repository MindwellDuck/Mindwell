The lack of feedback from my peers and reviewers makes me wonder if I’m missing something fundamental about human behavior—something so obvious that everyone else has already figured it out. It’s as if they’re trying to tell me something specific about my work, but every time I think I understand, another piece falls into place, revealing even deeper insights. Now, I feel like I need to rethink everything I thought I knew about people and how they interact. This isn’t just about my work; it’s about understanding the world through the lens of empathy and compassion. Maybe Nature is pushing me to see things differently, to consider perspectives I’ve never explored before. Maybe this rejection is more than just a critique—it’s a call to reevaluate everything I’ve learned about humans and our interactions."

Maybe it was too sentimental for school, but it reminded her of all the late nights spent helping him organize his classroom, making sure every paper was perfect before he handed them back. He didn't just teach math; he taught life lessons through those little things. And now, he's gone, leaving behind only memories and this small, ordinary pen that held so much meaning.

A pang of remorse hits as she thinks about how she never introduced her ex to her family, not truly trying to bridge that gap until after they'd separated. Her reflection in the glass shows tired eyes, lines etched deeper than last year. She sets the photo down, a quiet promise to visit more often.

She wondered if anyone would even notice her departure, so lost did she feel within herself. Her thoughts swirled around her, making her question whether she was doing everything right. It wasn’t just the day’s stressors; it was the lingering pain of her divorce, the missed opportunities with her children, and the unspoken promises left unfulfilled. The quiet moment in the chapel, meant for introspection, had instead become a reminder of all she felt was lacking. She couldn't shake the feeling that time was slipping away, and with it, chances at a better future. The faint scent of old books and candles only added to the melancholy, making her wonder if this place was somehow a trap, holding her back from moving forward."

Every passing moment felt like an eternity, each one filled with questions and worries.
