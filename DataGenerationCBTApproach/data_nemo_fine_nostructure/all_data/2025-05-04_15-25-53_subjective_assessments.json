He’d been working late hours lately, and she could understand why someone else would be more comfortable around him. Maybe he was just being friendly, which didn’t bother her one bit. After all, she knew how much he hated small talk with patients, so if he was smiling at someone, it must mean he genuinely enjoyed their company. Besides, she was used to seeing him interact with other nurses and doctors; it wasn’t uncommon for male colleagues to flirt with each other. So, what was the big deal? It didn’t even seem like an inappropriate comment—just a harmless tease about a funny meme. She pushed aside her doubts and headed straight to the kitchen to grab a drink. Her mind was already focused on dinner plans and what they might make together later. This wasn’t worth overthinking; there were plenty of reasons to trust him. She smiled to herself, feeling a little silly for worrying so much. It was probably just her imagination running wild again."

It was playing softly in the background when we walked through the forest. We were walking hand-in-hand, enjoying each other's company, and the music seemed to match the rhythm of our footsteps perfectly. Suddenly, I remembered how she used to love that song, and then, out of nowhere, the memory of her passing flashed before my eyes. My heart skipped a beat as I tried to process what was happening. It feels like time has stopped for me. I'm stuck between past and present, reliving memories I thought were long buried. Why am I experiencing all these emotions again? Is this some kind of sign? Am I being haunted by my grief? My head is spinning, and I can’t seem to catch my breath. Every sound around me seems amplified—the beeping machines, the murmurs of the patients, even the wind outside feels loud. My heart feels heavy, like it's carrying the weight of my entire life on its shoulders. What if this is more than just a coincidence? What if there’s something more going on here?

How could someone dismiss such an incredible work? Maybe they didn't understand what they were seeing. What if the owner thought she was trying too hard to be original?

And now she's gone, leaving him to suffer through another miserable year alone. It's a wonder he still cooks at all, considering how pathetic he is. I bet his customers have been complaining about his service for years. \"This food tastes like cardboard!\" they say. Yeah, because he's just throwing whatever he can find in the pot and hoping for the best. No finesse, no skill - just a lazy, half-hearted attempt to make money.
