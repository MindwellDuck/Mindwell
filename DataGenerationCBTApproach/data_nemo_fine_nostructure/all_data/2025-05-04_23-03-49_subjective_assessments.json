Her mind flashed back to her late husband's accident, and she felt a wave of panic rising in her throat.

Even if I manage to get there, what if it’s just another false alarm? My mind keeps replaying all those worst-case scenarios from before, making it impossible for me to relax. And now, because I’m running late, I have to deal with this traffic jam. I know I should take a few minutes to calm down, but it feels like I won’t ever catch up.

I can still write great stories, even if sometimes they don't get picked up right away. It's just business as usual, and we're both fine.

Why does everyone else get to experience such joy while I'm struggling to cope? Why can't I even have one moment of peace? Even if I were to go back in time, I couldn't change anything. I'll always miss him. This is why I hate my life. Everyone else has a loving partner, a supportive family, and a happy life. What do I have? A dead husband and a broken heart. They might not even know what I'm going through right now. Maybe they don't realize how much pain they cause by being alive while I suffer silently. How did they become so carefree?

We had shared those dreams back then, but now...now it seemed like she was leaving me behind. In my mind, I replayed all the times we talked about her future, how I encouraged her to keep her options open, how we discussed our own post-retirement travels if she decided to stay close by. And yet, here she was, ready to take off into the unknown without me. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like she was choosing him over us. I couldn’t help but wonder what else she might be hiding, whether she’s saving up money or planning a secret trip. It feels like she’s moving away from us, not just physically but emotionally as well. I feel like I’m losing my best friend, someone who used to share these big dreams with me, and now she’s going to make them happen without me.
