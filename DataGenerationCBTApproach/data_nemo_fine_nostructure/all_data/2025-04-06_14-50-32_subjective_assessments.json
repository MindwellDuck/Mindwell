It wasn't just that the data was inconclusive; it was as if the entire experiment had been conducted with faulty equipment. This couldn't be happening—she was the best scientist in her field, after all. The fact that the results didn't match her expectations only added to her anger. She felt like her life's work was being sabotaged by these incompetent lab technicians. It was clear that something had gone terribly wrong during the experiment. If only she could pinpoint exactly what went wrong, she would understand why those results were so off. Her mind kept replaying the events leading up to the test, convinced that there must have been some mistake that no one else noticed. As she continued to rant, her frustration grew. She couldn't shake the feeling that everyone around her was hiding something from her, even though she knew that was impossible. No matter how hard she tried to focus on the bigger picture, she found herself fixated on the tiny flaws in the data. It was as if she'd become completely absorbed in the minute details, neglecting everything else. She couldn't help but wonder if anyone truly understood what was going on, or if they were all just pretending to know what they did. Her anger only intensified, fueled by her growing conviction that the truth was being concealed from her."

He thought his neighbor must have been faking happiness because there was no way someone would actually enjoy cooking alone. That would be ridiculous. People only pretend to like things they're supposed to like for some reason, whether it's just for the sake of appearances or because they genuinely can't stand them. He was sure they weren't really having fun. Their smiling faces told him everything he needed to know - they were just putting up a show for others. That pizza looked disgusting anyway. A thick crust with an uneven shape? No thanks. If he wanted to eat something that good, he'd go to a restaurant where they wouldn't mess up the order. He didn't need some amateur trying to impress him with his cooking skills. There was no point in watching this scene play out when he could just stay home and watch TV instead. The couple's laughter seemed so fake, and she was wearing a big smile, but he knew it was all an act. She probably hated her husband's cooking as much as he did.
