I can't even enjoy cooking anymore because everything tastes terrible, especially the food she makes for me. She never cleans up after herself, which means that I have to clean up after her when we're both done eating. And don't even get me started on how she leaves dirty dishes everywhere - I swear, every time I open the cabinet, there's a new pile of greasy plates and bowls waiting for me. It's just too much. And it's making me so angry that I haven't been able to sleep properly lately. Every time I try to relax in bed, I feel like something is wrong with our relationship. I know it sounds irrational, but it really feels like she's not taking care of things around here. I've tried talking to her about it, but she just brushes it off, saying she'll \"get to it eventually.\" Eventually?! What does that even mean? We live together, and yet she doesn't seem to care about maintaining a tidy space. I'm starting to think that maybe she doesn't want us to be happy. Maybe she's secretly planning some kind of attack or revenge against me. I don't know what's going on, but I feel like I'm losing my mind. This whole situation has made me realize that I need to leave as"

We've done everything we can, but...she didn't make it.\" She felt a chill run down her spine as she took in the scene. It was so different from her own shift just hours before. She remembered the chaos of the ER, the constant rush of patients, the smell of disinfectant, and the sound of beeping monitors. But this—this was something entirely different. The doctors began to explain the situation, and she listened intently. They told her about how they'd tried to revive Sarah, but nothing could have worked. The more they spoke, the more she realized that Sarah wasn't like her at all. Sarah's life had been cut short in an instant, while hers continued to flow. It was as if they were comparing apples and oranges. As she stood there, taking it all in, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she was somehow at fault for not being able to save Sarah. Why did this happen to someone else? Not her. This wasn't fair. She thought back to her own shift"
