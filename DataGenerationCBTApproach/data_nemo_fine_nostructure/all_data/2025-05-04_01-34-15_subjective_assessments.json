She had promised to meet up with him today, but instead, here she is with this other guy, enjoying each other's company. What happened to her promise? Maybe it was all just a mistake. No, she wouldn't do that. She would never betray him like this. It hurts to see her moving on so quickly. Why is she laughing with someone else if she still cares about him? That laugh sounds too cheerful, almost fake. And what does it mean when they’re sitting so close together? They shouldn’t be like that. She should still be looking at him, not sharing laughs with someone else. This isn’t fair to him. He’s the one who gave everything to make their relationship work. Now, she’s just moving on as if nothing ever happened. Why did she agree to meet him there? Doesn’t she know how much it means to him? She should be the one comforting him right now, not spending time with someone new. If she really cared, she wouldn’t let herself be around others like this. She needs to realize what she’s doing is hurting him. How could she do this? After everything they shared, she should still"

We'd all get along better, we could make this trip even more special by sharing it together. Maybe we could plan another trip soon, so everyone has a chance to join.
