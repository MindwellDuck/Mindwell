The exhibition was his work, but he felt no pride, only a bitter taste in his mouth. Each painting, once vibrant and alive with color, now seemed dull and lifeless under the harsh gallery lights. He paused before his favorite piece, a landscape she had loved. Her absence echoed through every brushstroke, a void he couldn't fill with paint or canvas. A young couple approached him, their eyes wide with admiration for his \"masterpieces.\" He bit back a sharp retort, instead offering them a thin-lipped smile and a curt nod before walking away, leaving them and his art behind in the sterile, cold gallery.",

Another meeting where they'll be breathing down my neck, telling me what to do, how to write...like I don't know already?\" He chuckles wryly to himself, \"And I'll probably mess up again, because that's what I do.\" In reality, he's been preparing for weeks, but the pressure still mounts. He's well-versed in covering protests, but every time he gets into the zone, something goes wrong. Today won't be different, will it? As he sits in the crowded conference room, surrounded by his team and editors, he knows exactly what's coming next. They'll expect him to deliver perfect footage, but he's already dreading the outcome. \"I hate these meetings,\" he mutters under his breath. \"I never feel ready. Like no matter how much prep I do, I end up disappointing everyone.\" His editor calls the meeting to order, and as the discussion begins, he listens attentively, taking notes.

It felt like he had given everything to the company, yet still, no recognition came his way. This is just a small part of what happened in the full story: ### The Story Begins His boss, John, sat across from him, sipping his coffee as they reviewed the latest project. \"You're doing great,\" John said, his voice filled with warmth. \"Keep up the good work.\" But when the meeting ended, he didn’t offer a single word about the promotion he’d been waiting for—years of hard work, dedication, and sacrifices had left him feeling empty and disappointed. John seemed oblivious to the fact that this was more than just another meeting. He couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness as he walked away, leaving the young man to wonder if his efforts were truly valued. The silence in the room was deafening, a stark contrast to the encouragement he'd received earlier. As John stepped out into the hallway, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror.

Why would she bring it up now, when he was so close to solving the problem? Did she really think he was too busy to care about the dishes?
