I know what she meant when she said she needed space—she didn’t mean she wanted us to be friends forever. The way she wrote it sounded almost... bitter? Yeah, she definitely doesn’t feel the same way I do. There’s no other explanation. I’ve seen how busy she is at work; she barely has time for anything else. Why would she choose me then? I wonder if there’s anyone else out there who cares about her as much as I do. If only I could tell her how much I love her and make her understand why this hurts so much. But now? No, she needs to figure this one out herself. Maybe she’ll come crawling back once she realizes what she’s losing. I can wait. After all, I’m patient.

It's hard not to wonder why he's still alone, especially when everyone else seems to be moving forward with their lives. The contrast between his empty space and their happy moments feels like a harsh reality check. His mind keeps replaying these images, making him feel more isolated than ever. Every time he sees such posts, he can't help but think about how different his life is right now, and it hurts to see others living their best lives while he struggles. This kind of thing happens often; he'll scroll through social media, and one post will always make him feel like he's missing out. It's like the world is passing him by, and he's stuck outside looking in. Just seeing those happy families and couples reminds him that he's still waiting for someone, and that feeling only adds to his frustration."
