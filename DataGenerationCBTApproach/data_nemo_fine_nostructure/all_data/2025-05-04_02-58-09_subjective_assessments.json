He'd taken her under his wing, showing her the ropes in exchange for some favoritism, but she seemed so much more confident than him. She didn't have to rely on him to explain everything; she could dive right in and figure things out on her own. It wasn't fair—she'd gotten this job because of her connections, not because of any actual talent. She knew how to make an impression, just like he did at parties, but no one ever took him seriously, while she was already making friends left and right. It wasn't even fair to compare himself to someone who'd never worked here before, but he couldn't help feeling like he was stuck in second gear. He was doing okay, but she... she was flying high. They were both supposed to meet with Dr. Lee about the patient's condition, and he hoped she wouldn't notice how nervous he felt."

It's just an onion, but it brings back all those memories. My parents were divorced when I was young, and every time we had dinner together, they would argue over who cooked what. I remember the smell of my mom's cooking, how she'd always make me feel safe. But my dad... he was angry and hurt. He never spoke of his feelings, but you could see it in the way he looked at her. One day, after an argument, he walked out, taking with him our wedding ring, which he kept as a reminder of how much he felt abandoned. When he left, I tried to hold on to that ring, but it slipped from my fingers. My mom found it later, and she said he must have thrown it away because he didn't want to be around us anymore. She cried, and I felt helpless. I wish I could tell you more, but it's hard to explain why the smell of onions makes me think of that moment. It doesn't seem irrational to associate onions with sadness. If there was a single smell that could evoke both happiness and pain, wouldn't onions be the obvious choice? I'm not making anything up; these are real memories, tied to the smell of an onion. Just because I can't change the past doesn’t mean it shouldn't affect me today. Even though I know my thoughts"

She tried to shake off the unease, telling herself she was being paranoid, but it wouldn’t go away. As she turned the pages, memories began flooding back - memories of baking pies with her mother, laughing together in the kitchen, and sharing secrets by the window. Those moments were so vivid they almost felt real. But they weren’t real now; they were just recollections of happier times. Her gaze fell upon the photo of her family on the fridge, taken just before her mother passed away. Tears welled up in her eyes as she gazed at the smiling faces. Her heart ached with sadness. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn’t she be the one who got to enjoy those happy memories? She took a deep breath and continued flipping through the pages. As she read about her mother’s recipes, something shifted inside her. It wasn’t just a book anymore; it was a connection to her past, a reminder of what could never be replaced. She looked at the clock"

My life has become a tapestry woven from moments both joyous and sorrowful, each thread intertwined with every other, forming a narrative that is mine alone. Yet, as I look back, I am left to ponder the paths not taken, the choices made, and the love shared. What if I had chosen differently? Would things be better now? Would I have found peace? I feel lost in these reflections, unsure how much longer I can hold on to them. Each day feels like a weight, a reminder that time keeps moving forward, leaving behind what once was. I wonder about those who came before me, their stories unfolding like the pages of an old book, filled with laughter and tears. They, too, must have wondered about the roads they didn’t take, the dreams they never chased, and the love they never knew. It’s as if we are all connected, our lives part of a larger story that continues to evolve, even though some parts may fade into memory. But for now, I remain here, surrounded by the remnants of what could have been, holding onto what little remains of hope. It’s a fragile thing, this hope, but"
