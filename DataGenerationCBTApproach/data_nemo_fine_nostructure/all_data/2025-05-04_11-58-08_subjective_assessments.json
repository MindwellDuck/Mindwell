I remember how much he loved painting her eyes, especially when they were bright and full of life; it reminded him of our first date. He told me he couldn't stop thinking about her after we parted ways, even though she had been married for years. She was a free spirit who hated being tied down, but there was something about her that drew him in. When he painted her eyes, he would imagine what it would be like to hold her hand again, to feel her warmth. That's why he wore that old ring with the sapphire stone, the same one she had given to him back then. Now, whenever he looked at the brush, all he could think of was how beautiful she must have looked, and how he felt lost without her by his side. The memory of her smile lingered, like a ghost haunting his studio. His paintings were never the same afterward, but he continued working, hoping that someday she would come back. Her presence kept him going, even when he felt alone. He imagined her walking into his studio, laughing at his jokes, and making him forget about the emptiness inside. But now, holding this paintbrush, he felt tears well up in his eyes, remembering the days when she would sit beside him, watching over his shoulder as he worked. She was always so supportive, encouraging him to create more than just portraits"

But now...now there's nothing left but bitter resentment. And don't even get me started on him. The way he looks at us...like he has some right to be here. Like he's better than me. What if I told him about all the times I tried to make it work? About how I gave everything to our relationship, only to be cast aside like trash? Would he still want to be friends? It's so unfair. Everyone deserves happiness, but why does mine always seem to slip away? Maybe if I stopped being such a fool, I wouldn't feel this way. But I’m tired of carrying the weight of my own heartache. Maybe it’s time I let everyone else live their lives, even if that means giving up on mine. At the end of the day, though, it's not really their fault. If only they"

The husband's anger will boil over, and he'll lash out, leaving the wife battered and bruised. The police will arrive late, too busy with other calls to respond quickly enough to stop him. By the time they arrive, the damage will already be done. The wife will have fled, seeking refuge elsewhere, while the husband remains, still fuming. He might try to follow her, but she'll have vanished into the crowded streets, lost among the throngs of people rushing to work. The husband will be left alone, his anger slowly dissipating into frustration as he realizes no one can help. His rage will turn inward, consuming himself as he ponders his next move. He'll wonder if he could've avoided all this if only he had listened, if only he had been more patient. But now, as he stands there, he'll realize that patience was never an option. The world moved too fast, and he was too slow. Now, he's left with nothing but regret, wondering what could've been if only he'd acted sooner."
