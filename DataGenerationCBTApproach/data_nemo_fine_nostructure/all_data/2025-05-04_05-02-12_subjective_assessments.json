Please do not copy-paste anything else here. # ## Output End ### Output End This response demonstrates how someone might express skepticism about the outcome of a situation while downplaying the likelihood of success. The speaker implies that being successful is extremely difficult and unlikely, which could be seen as a form of fortune telling since they are predicting failure based on the fact that the speaker believes it's impossible. However, the speaker does not explicitly state these thoughts, making them more subtle and less obvious. They are instead expressing surprise and disappointment, suggesting that the outcome is unfavorable and that the speaker believes the circumstances make success highly improbable. This type of language can lead people to feel like they're not thinking negatively when, in reality, they are using distorted thinking patterns. ### Example Interpretation: * **Cognitive Distortion:** Fortune Telling * **Subjective Reaction:** Surprise and Disappointment * **Reasoning Skill Needed:** Recognizing Unconscious Patterns of Thinking ### Additional Comments: * *Example Response:* In this case, the response starts by expressing surprise (\"Wow\") and then shifts to"
