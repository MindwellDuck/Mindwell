He looked over at his wife, sleeping peacefully beside him. She'd be none the wiser if he cancelled school today, claiming illness. But the thought of staying home with nothing but his anxious thoughts for company made his stomach churn. He decided to get dressed quietly, hoping the familiar routine would calm him. As he tied his tie in front of the mirror, he noticed his hands were shaking. Today's lesson was on World War II. Would he stumble over words? Forget dates? He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. The students deserved better than an anxious old man for a teacher. But as he grabbed his briefcase, he felt that familiar sense of dread wash over him again.",

What if they didn’t take him seriously this time? His mind was racing with scenarios where he ended up back at home, even though he knew he needed to face them head-on. Every time he tried to focus on the lesson plan, doubts crept in. What if the students saw him as weak? What if he wasn’t cut out for this job? Despite knowing he’d be fine, the fear lingered. It’s just nerves, he told himself. I’ll show them what I’m capable of. But the voice in his head wouldn’t let go. It kept questioning every move he made, from getting dressed too quickly to rushing to the bus stop. He wondered if he’d ever truly feel confident teaching again. It was like he was trapped in a cycle of uncertainty, unsure how much longer it would hold him back. Every morning brought a mix of determination and anxiety, each one blending into the next. He felt stuck in this loop, unable to break free. Even when he convinced himself that everything would work out, the worries lingered, waiting for another chance to resurface. The question echoed silently: How long will it take to finally"

Maybe she couldn't handle it anymore, maybe she had reached her limit. It wasn't just about the onion chopping, though—it was the entire kitchen. Everything seemed different, like the utensils were heavy in her hands, and even the air felt thick. If she could feel it, why hadn't she noticed it before? And then there was the memory of the last time she cooked like this, how easily everything fell into place, how confident she was. Now, it all seemed so far away, like a dream she couldn't hold onto. She felt trapped between two worlds—the world where cooking was effortless and the reality where every step felt like a challenge. Every movement was a test, and she wasn't sure if she passed. She tried to brush it off as stress, but deep down, she wondered if there was something more going on. Something she couldn't see. Something that made her hands shake.

But what if I've lost interest in those things? What if I'm just too sad to care? My friend would say that's because I'm lazy or depressed, and I need to get back to \"normal.\" But is it really normal to feel so empty? Does everyone else just ignore these feelings? If I'm spending hours alone with books and puzzles, am I avoiding real connections? Maybe I’m just afraid of meeting new people or showing vulnerability. Could I be using hobbies as a shield, making it harder to open up? Shouldn’t I try to put myself out there, even if it feels scary? Or maybe this loneliness isn’t going away until I find a way to let go of everything that’s holding me back. It's hard to know where to start. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between my friend’s advice and my own thoughts. Maybe I need to balance both—but how do I choose which path is right?
