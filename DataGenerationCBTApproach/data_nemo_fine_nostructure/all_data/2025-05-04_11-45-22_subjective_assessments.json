He tried to distract himself by listening to music, but every song seemed hollow now. Even her favorite songs sounded distant, as if they belonged to someone else. He wondered if he'd ever find solace in this new life, one where she wasn't by his side. The thought sent a pang of sadness down his throat, but he pushed it away. What was the point? They were better off apart, weren't they? The idea resonated within him, echoing softly. Maybe they would both be happier this way, free from each other's expectations. But the pain lingered, refusing to fade. He couldn't help but feel lost, wandering these streets alone. No matter how many steps forward he took, the emptiness followed close behind. His mind wandered back to their last conversation, the words still fresh in his memory. \"We need space,\" she'd said, her voice firm but laced with a hint of desperation. He recalled the look in her eyes, the pleading for understanding, but he'd stood firm, convinced that she needed time alone. Now, in this moment, he realized that maybe he'd been blind, refusing to see what was right in"

He's a healthy 80-year-old man who has always been strong and energetic. I'm sure his health scare was just a minor setback, probably nothing serious at all. My mother really needs some time to process everything. So much has happened recently with work and school, and even though we're used to seeing each other every week, there are definitely more important things going on in our lives right now. But I can see how she'd feel like she wasn't kept informed. It doesn't seem fair that I wouldn't have told her sooner, especially when I know how much she cares about him. I guess what's bothering me most is that my sister (Grandpa's wife) and brother-in-law (her son) were both involved in planning the funeral, which means they knew something was seriously wrong before I did. My sister said something about needing to talk to Grandpa soon after, but I don't remember hearing anything else. Maybe she was worried about him too? I'm not saying I don't trust them; I just think it's weird that they didn't mention anything until now. I"
