She fumbled for her glasses and squinted at the unfamiliar shadows dancing on her bedroom walls. Her breath caught as she realized the quiet hum of her apartment was replaced by an eerie silence - her router had blinked off, severing her connection to the world outside. Panic surged through her veins like wildfire; every instinct screamed for her to check the news, ensure her family was safe, but the dark void of her screen mocked her helplessness.",

She told herself it was just a glitch and didn’t mean anything, but the urge to check kept nagging at her. It was probably just a technical issue, and there must be something more significant going on somewhere else. Why did this keep replaying in her mind? She knew the router wasn’t broken, but her brain insisted"

It's probably some kind of miscommunication, so there's no need to panic. Besides, what's the big deal about revising something that's already been reviewed? Maybe it's just a test to see if she can handle pressure or something. She's definitely handling this well—she's not getting flustered at all! Clearly, she's got this under control."

But the truth remains, the chill of reality seeps into my bones, leaving no room for fantasies. Perhaps in another life, I would have found happiness, but here, now, it’s nothing but dust. In the darkness, I'm left with the haunting question: What if I could turn back time? Would I find solace in memories of happier days? Yet, even those seem distant, lost in a haze of what-ifs. Now, all I see is the cold, unforgiving light of the future, shrouded in uncertainty. Maybe someday, I'll learn to let go of these thoughts, but until then, they haunt me, refusing to fade away. # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #"

It had to be something important. I mean, who gets this angry over a minor issue? And what kind of job requires you to carry files around all day? Maybe it wasn't even related to work. She might've been upset about something much bigger than just a little mistake. Her anger could have been triggered by some deeper issue, like a personal problem or a serious concern that wasn't immediately apparent. She probably didn't want anyone knowing how upset she was, so she let loose in private. It was almost as if she was trying to release pent-up emotions. That look on her face suggested someone who was struggling to contain their feelings. She must have been dealing with more than just frustration; there had to be something more at play."

They look happy, too, which makes me even more upset. Now I can't help but wonder if he ever loved me at all. Why did we break up? Is everything I thought we had just an illusion? This situation makes me realize that people don’t change; they will always hurt you in the end. I shouldn’t trust anyone anymore. Seeing how happy they are just confirms my worst fears. It’s clear he doesn’t love me anymore. I’m such a fool for thinking otherwise."

It wasn't until later, when I finally opened it, that the faint scent of her perfume wafted through the air, transporting me back to a time long forgotten. The words, once filled with promise and joy, now read as empty promises, each line a testament to the emptiness of our relationship. In the end, it was just another piece of paper, a tangible representation of something that no longer existed. As I folded it neatly, placing it among the other remnants of our lives, I couldn't help but think that it was time to let go of the past. The letter, once a beacon of hope, now felt like a weight, holding onto memories that were better left buried."
