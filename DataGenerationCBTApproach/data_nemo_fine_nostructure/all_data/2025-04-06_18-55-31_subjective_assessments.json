He was always so positive, never complaining about anything, but here he is, cold as stone. It's so unfair—life isn't fair at all. I wonder what would have happened if we had spent more time with each other during our studies. Maybe he wouldn't be here today, maybe he'd be alive and well, enjoying his job. I think about how much I miss him already, how I wish I could go back in time and spend more days with him. What if we had gone out more often, just the two of us, instead of hanging out with others? Would things have turned out differently? Perhaps we could've changed the course of events, prevented this tragedy. Now he's nothing more than a memory, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered dreams."

The house felt unfamiliar tonight, shadows dancing eerily with every flicker of the old streetlamp outside. She swore she heard footsteps echoing through the empty halls, but when she paused to listen, all was silent except for the distant ticking of the grandfather clock in the living room.\n\nHer husband, usually a heavy sleeper, stirred restlessly upstairs. She tensed at every rustle from above, convinced he was whispering to someone unseen. Paranoia gnawed at her, its icy tendrils coiling around her spine. She considered checking on him but hesitated, fearing what she might find in the dim light of their bedroom.\n\nThe phone rang suddenly, a shrill sound that pierced the silence like a scream. She let it ring, unable to move towards it. After six rings, it stopped, only to start again moments later. She picked up the receiver with a shaking hand, but there was no voice on the other end, just heavy breathing and a soft click as the line went dead.\n\nShe stood frozen, her heart pounding wildly in her chest. The silence of the house seemed louder now, more menacing. She felt watched, hunted even within her own home. Each shadow, every creak of the settling wood sent shivers down her spine. Her mind raced with thoughts of conspiracies and betrayals, weaving a web of fear that threatened to consume her completely.\n\nSuddenly, she heard it again - footsteps, this time unmistakable, growing louder as they approached the bedroom door. She braced herself, eyes wide with terror, as the door handle began to turn slowly...",

It's too much for me to handle alone. I wish I had never come back here, but I couldn't leave without my things. Now I'm trapped, and I'm going to die. Every noise sounds different now; it’s like I’m hearing everything for the first time. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. Even if my husband is asleep, I can’t shake off the feeling that he's plotting against me. What if he's not who he says he is? What if he’s been manipulating me all along? And those calls... They’re probably from him, trying to lure me into his trap. Or maybe it's someone else, but it doesn’t matter. My mind is racing with scenarios, each one more terrifying than the last. I can’t focus on anything except the sound of footsteps. It has to be him, coming to kill me. But why would he do that after everything we’ve been through together? This isn’t over yet.

His phone buzzed insistently in his pocket - another message from her. \"Where are you?

There's no way she could have felt calm and prepared; it wouldn't be realistic. The question I'm being asked is why she feels this way. It doesn't make sense because she's trying to impress someone important. How can she possibly be nervous? What does it even mean to be \"prepared\" when you're interviewing someone who will decide your future? The fact that she woke up early is irrelevant; it just means she's more anxious than usual. And she hasn't eaten anything yet, so of course she feels sick. If she weren't in such a rush, she would have been able to prepare better. Now she's just going to wing it, which isn't possible. This is all just part of my own anxiety, not something I should worry about. I need to focus on what I can control, but there's nothing I can do right now except try not to throw up before the interview. My mind is racing, and I can't think straight. This isn't normal; I've never felt this way before. I must be overreacting. This morning started badly. I overslept, missed the bus, and now I’m stuck here wondering how to get back home. I always forget to check the time, and now I’ve wasted two hours waiting for a friend to show up. We were"

And if she wasn't neglecting me, why did she forget to water this one? Is it because she doesn't love me enough? But no, she does; she loves me dearly. So, why did she forget? Does she really hate me? This isn't fair. She shouldn't forget something as simple as watering herbs. There could be a million reasons—she's too busy, she forgot, she didn't feel like it, she hates me... I don't know! How can I trust her to take care of us when she can't even take care of our little herbs? Maybe I should just go live with my parents; they wouldn't forget anything. They're perfect.
