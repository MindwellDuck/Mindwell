The silence felt oppressive, heavy with all the things left unsaid and undone. It wasn’t just about the mug; it was about the life they had built together, the memories locked in every corner of their home. But now, everything seemed hollow, a reminder of what could have been if only...if only he were here to hold her hand through this. She wondered what would have happened if he’d come back, how differently things might have played out. Would she be holding him now, curled up by the fireplace where they shared so many nights? Or would she’ve spent those months alone, trying to find new ways to fill the emptiness? As she gazed around, she imagined them sitting side by side, watching the sunset through the window, sharing stories about their days. Her mind replayed moments from their past—how they used to laugh together, how he'd always know exactly when to make her smile. Even now, while grieving, she couldn't help but think of how much more she wanted to see his smile, how much more she wanted to hear his laughter. If only...the thought hung in the air, a bittersweet echo of what could have been. But then again, maybe this was an opportunity to start anew, to rebuild their life together, even if it meant going back to basics"

He's been alone since she passed five years ago, but tonight, there was a warmth in the air, a familiarity he hadn't felt in ages—a young couple, laughing easily, hands entwined as they browsed through the aisles he'd polished countless times. Their happiness grated against his silent existence, each giggle echoing like a mockery of his loneliness. He watched them leave together, her head resting on his shoulder, their laughter lingering long after the automatic doors slid shut behind them.",

She wrote that she couldn’t take it anymore, that the dreams were getting worse, and she could no longer bear the thought of waking up to find herself trapped in a life she didn’t want. The words on the page seemed to shift and swirl around him like the shadows in his mind, taunting him with visions of a future filled with loneliness and regret. He sat there for a long time, staring blankly into space, unable to shake off the feeling of dread that had settled over him. Every moment felt like an eternity, each second ticking away like grains of sand slipping through his fingers. Time itself seemed to have lost all meaning, leaving him suspended in a sea of despair. As he looked back, he realized that this was just another chapter in the never-ending story of our lives—each one leading us further away from happiness until we reach nothing but darkness. And yet, even in the midst of such pain, there was something beautiful, a reminder that every ending marks the beginning of something new. But for now, he was stuck in the past, reliving memories that still lingered too vividly in his mind. He remembered how they used to laugh together, how they would dance under the stars, and how they shared secrets in the dead of night. Those moments had been pure joy, full of laughter and love, but now they seemed distant, fading"

What if this is some kind of test? If he leaves a big clue like that, what else could he be hiding? What if he's going through some kind of depression and needs help? Or maybe he’s just being manipulative to make me feel guilty for not having reached out sooner? That would explain why he didn’t call or text when he said he needed space.

What if he actually did kill himself, and I’m too late to stop it? What if...what if...what if... It looks like he took care of the laundry already, so he probably won’t even notice it’s gone.

It's hard to accept when you're still holding onto something that no longer exists. I've tried to convince myself otherwise, to see things from his perspective, but every glance tells me that we're both lost forever. If there's even a chance he's happy, then I'm not. Everything reminds me of what could have been, and I can't shake off the feeling that I'll never be whole again. I've come to realize that sometimes, people move on so quickly, leaving behind pieces of themselves that they'll never get back. They find someone else, laugh together, and forget that our love ever existed. You don't hear stories like this often, where one moment you were together, and the next, you were just memories.
