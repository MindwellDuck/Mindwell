If he hadn’t invested so much time in art, maybe he wouldn’t be living this way. What if he had pursued another career? Would things have turned out differently? Sometimes, he wondered if he would be happier with her back. What if we had worked through our issues? Maybe our relationship would have survived. But that’s just speculation.

She didn’t see him; she saw what she wanted to see—what she thought she deserved. And he knew he’d never be enough for her, no matter how hard he tried. Every moment we spend alone is an eternity, and yet, I’m stuck here, reliving the same moments over and over. I can’t escape the ghosts that haunt me, the memories that refuse to fade. They keep whispering in my ear, telling me I’m nothing more than a ghost haunting her life. That I’ll always be the one she turned to when things got too much. But deep down, I know I’m just trying to convince myself of something that will never be true. She doesn’t want me; she needs someone else. Someone younger, stronger, someone who can give her everything I can only dream of giving. But why does it have to hurt so much? Why can’t I just accept that this is how it’s meant to be? Maybe someday I’ll find peace, but until then, I’m trapped in this endless cycle of pain"
