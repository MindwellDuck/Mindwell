When asked about a performance issue during the interview process, he reflected on a past meeting where his manager did not acknowledge his contributions, leading him to believe that he had somehow let the team down. Despite acknowledging his own shortcomings, he highlighted the perceived hypocrisy of the team’s reactions, suggesting that they might have been pretending to support him while secretly criticizing him. This response demonstrates a mental filter by selectively focusing on the negative aspect of the situation (his invisibility) rather than considering the broader context of the meeting. By doing so, he misses the opportunity to showcase his self-awareness and growth potential, which are crucial qualities for success in the workplace. Instead, his focus on the apparent hypocrisy reveals a deeper psychological issue—perhaps an unconscious need to"
