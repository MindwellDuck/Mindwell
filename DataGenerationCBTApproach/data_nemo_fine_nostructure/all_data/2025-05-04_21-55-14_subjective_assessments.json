The emails are relentless, each one a reminder that he's failing as a researcher. He can't help but wonder if those who have grants are doing something right while he struggles to get even a foot in the door. It seems like every other lab has secured funding for its projects. Meanwhile, he’s still fighting for scraps. It makes him feel like a loser compared to everyone else, especially when he sees them posting updates on social media about their funded research. Those posts just make things worse, making him question whether he’ll ever catch up. He tries to remind himself that success doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s hard to shake off the feeling that he’s falling behind. Even small setbacks, like a minor error in data analysis, feel monumental because he knows others don’t face the same obstacles. That realization just makes him feel more isolated and frustrated. When his partner asks how his day was, he forces a smile and says everything was fine. But inside, he’s seething. She has her own successful career, and she never complains about the challenges she faces. Why does it feel like I’m constantly being held back? Does she know what it’s like to struggle so much? He compares himself to others who seem to be thriving in academia. They publish papers, secure grants, and present at conferences. Meanwhile,"

The smell of fresh herbs still clung to her blouse, a reminder of the lively kitchen filled with chatter and warmth that now felt like a distant memory. As she hung up her coat, her gaze fell upon the empty dining table, where once there had been laughter, shared meals, and conversation. Tonight, it stood bare except for a single place setting, hers alone. She sighed, feeling the weight of years and solitude, before taking her seat to eat dinner by herself again.",

It wasn't just the emptiness of the space that bothered her; it was the way everything seemed to have fallen apart—her husband's passing, his inability to connect with her anymore, the kids moving out, leaving her to carry the weight of loneliness alone. Even the small things felt overwhelming—the dishes piled high in the sink, the bills piling up, the endless chores. Her mind raced with thoughts of how he would've handled this situation if he were here, how he would've found ways to make the silence more bearable, how he would've kept us all together. But those moments were lost forever, replaced by the harsh reality of her own isolation."

The image of her lying lifeless in the hospital haunted him, making it seem like every moment since then had been spent doing nothing but dwelling on what could have been done differently. Every decision felt like a betrayal, whether it was choosing to stay with her until death or leaving her to die alone. His thoughts swirled around the idea that he must have been selfish to leave her, yet another part of him whispered that staying would have prolonged her suffering and made things worse. It was as if he was torn between being grateful for the time they shared and resentful of how much longer he could have stayed with her. This cycle of guilt and anger continued, each step leading him further down the path of self-blame, where every action seemed to lead to another failure."

I thought to myself, \"He could be serious about me; maybe he really wants to reconnect. Or, he's clearly just trying to torment me by bringing up our past relationship.\" This dichotomy created an all-or-nothing mindset where anything less than full commitment seemed impossible, and anything more than that would be a betrayal. The mere possibility of him being sincere made her feel like she wasn't worth fighting for, while the idea of him simply teasing her left her feeling like she'd never be good enough. She couldn't shake the feeling that she'd either be forever stuck in limbo, unable to move forward, or completely rejected if she decided to act on her feelings."

As he stood there, the raindrops seemed to mock him, each one a reminder of her absence. His mind was flooded with images of her—her laughter, her smile, the way she used to light up his life. But now, those memories only fueled his anger and sadness. Why did she leave? What could she possibly have found more fulfilling than our little world together? As the night wore on, he wondered if this was just another test of their love. Hadn’t she once said that sometimes life threw unexpected challenges at us, but it was how we responded that truly mattered? Maybe she needed space to process her thoughts, to find herself again. Or perhaps she simply didn’t feel the same way anymore. But then, a memory flashed before his eyes—a moment when everything seemed perfect. They were sitting by the river, hand in hand, watching the stars twinkle above. She leaned into him, whispering, “You’re my forever.” He remembered the warmth of her breath on his skin, the way her voice sounded like music to his ears. In that instant, all doubts vanished, replaced by an overwhelming sense of devotion. Yet, now, even that memory felt tainted, like a lie designed to keep him in the dark. As the rain continued its relentless beat, he felt lost in a sea of emotions."

They wouldn't let themselves fall apart over something as insignificant as a broken vase. Their lives were probably much simpler, easier to manage. What if he wasn't even good enough for them?

It wasn't fair; he was trying his best, but he could never be good enough."
