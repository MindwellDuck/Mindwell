After all, there were plenty of people around, so it couldn't have been anyone trying to steal from him. People always seem to be in such a hurry; they wouldn't bother with something like that. It's likely someone who has nothing better to do than look for easy targets. The fact that no one else seemed to notice or cared made him wonder if maybe he was overreacting. There had to be a logical explanation, right?"

It wasn't a subtle thing; she made it clear that our friendship was over. Her behavior is consistent with someone who knows more than they're letting on. I don't need confirmation, but knowing doesn't hurt either. I guess you could say I've decided she's not worth my time anymore. There's no reason left for us to be friends. It's simple logic: if he has a fiancée, there's no room for me in his life. He chose her, and I'm just a memory. That's all I am now—a reminder of something he moved past.

It’s because she sees me as less capable than her, and she knows it. When I bring up my accomplishments, she rolls her eyes, calling me out for being arrogant. But deep down, I can tell she wishes she had my confidence. She tries to hide it, but I see the jealousy in her eyes whenever I talk about projects. This isn’t a coincidence; she’s always jealous of what I achieve. Her constant belittling makes me feel worthless. When she speaks, her tone is condescending, making me want to quit. I’m starting to think that if I stay much longer, I’ll lose my job. The more time passes, the worse she becomes. If I don’t leave soon, things will get even worse. My boss won’t protect me from her abuse. She has already ruined several colleagues’ careers. I fear that one day, she’ll destroy mine too. I have no choice but to escape before it’s too late.

A simple phrase, but one that held so much weight. So much pain. The crushing realization hit her like a ton of bricks. All those late nights, all those early mornings, all those endless hours spent pouring her heart and soul into this project—it was all for nothing. All those sacrifices, all those moments of pure joy, all that happiness—it was all meaningless. And then it struck her—the irony. Years of living in blissful ignorance, never really questioning the true nature of reality until this moment. She had convinced herself that everything would be okay. That success was just around the corner. That she could finally leave the lab and enjoy her life. Now, in this moment, she realized that none of it mattered. None of it ever did. Her entire existence had been a lie—a grand illusion designed to keep her distracted while the world moved on without her. This wasn’t just about the experiment gone wrong; it was about the entire journey. Every step taken, every choice made, every dream pursued—all for naught"

She can't help but wonder if he'd even notice if she made him a similar lunch, or if he'd just go through the motions, expecting me to make everything for him again. It's probably best to leave things alone; after all, he's always been very particular about his food, and I don't want to ruin what little time we have together with petty complaints. So, I'll just let it go and focus on my own needs, even if it means putting up with some minor frustration for now. Besides, I'm sure he wouldn't care if he weren't so busy with work. The thought doesn't sit well with me, though—it feels like he's choosing to ignore our problems rather than face them head-on. Maybe it's better if I just wait until he's more relaxed before bringing it up, or maybe I should just stop expecting him to be there for me anymore. But deep down, I know she can't bring herself to fully accept that, especially since she has no one else who truly understands her.
