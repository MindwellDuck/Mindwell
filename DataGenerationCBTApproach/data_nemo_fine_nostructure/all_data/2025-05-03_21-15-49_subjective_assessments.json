It's all just going to end in disappointment anyway. I might as well let go now and accept that I’m never going to catch up. I feel so trapped, like there's no escape from this cycle of hardship.

Had she been just another mistake? **As she looked deeper into the photo, tears began to well up in her eyes.** **What if this was the last time they would share such happiness?** Her gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the sound of her own heart breaking echoed through the room. **She felt a chill run down her spine as she placed the photograph back in the apron’s pocket.** **What if this was the beginning of the end?** The world around her seemed to grow darker, the shadows cast by the fading light deepening into ominous shapes.

I couldn't help but wonder what she would say if she knew I'd found this. Would she be happy? Or would she wish I hadn't? The thought sent a pang through me, and for a moment, I wished I could turn back time, see her again. But then I realized—she's gone. This is all I have left. And even if it feels like she's still here, maybe it’s just my heart trying to hold on. Maybe it’s how my mind wants things to be, even when they can never truly be. It makes sense, doesn’t it? Why else would she leave such a piece of herself behind? If she really wanted to move on, wouldn’t she have taken everything? Everything except one thing—a reminder of who we were together. She must have wanted this for me, kept it hidden until now, knowing how much it meant. It means a lot to me, more than anything else. So why would she take it? Is it because she"

It wouldn't surprise me if she did. She's so much more capable than me. That's why she got this award, after all. No one thought twice about giving it to her. If I had been in charge, things would have turned out differently. I know what's best, and everyone should listen to me. This whole thing is ridiculous, and I'm the only sane one around here. Everyone else is either an idiot or in on some secret conspiracy. It's not like I didn't earn this award myself, but no one ever gives credit where credit is due. Instead, they focus on the ones who are more visible, like her. And now that she has this recognition, she'll be even more confident and superior-looking. It's disgusting.

There are so many things to think about—what would happen if I confronted her? Would she even remember me? Would she apologize? Or would she pretend she didn't know me? What would she say then? How would I respond? And then there's the question of whether I should confront her. If I do, will it make me look crazy? Will I come across as an old, bitter guy?
