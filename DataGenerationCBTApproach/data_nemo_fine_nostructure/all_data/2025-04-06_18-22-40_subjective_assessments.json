She's been receiving anonymous threatening letters lately, and the fear that they might be connected lingers heavily in the darkness.",

I have decades of experience under my belt—she just doesn't understand that she doesn't deserve to be in the same category as me. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both delicious, but one is far sweeter than the other. My paintings are masterpieces, while hers are nothing compared to mine. She probably wouldn't say this if she were my age. Maybe she's just jealous that she never had my talent. At least I don't have to worry about losing my touch like she does. I'm still creating amazing works, and she can't even begin to grasp that level of skill. She's just mad because she knows she'll never reach what I've accomplished. That critic really needs to take a step back and look at her own life. She could learn a thing or two from someone with years of experience. I'm not surprised she picked on me, though—it's always easier to attack someone older than you when you think you're the best. I guess I'll just ignore it and keep creating, proving her wrong once again. After all, time proves everything."

But would she really find happiness there too? Or would she always feel the same emptiness? Her mind wandered to the times they spent together, painting side by side. They used to talk about their dreams and aspirations, and she loved hearing about his ideas for art. But now, those memories felt bittersweet. What if he'd stuck around longer, maybe they could have created something beautiful together? It made her think about all the things they might have done differently, if only he'd stayed. Perhaps they could have built a life filled with creativity and laughter. What if they'd discovered hidden talents within each other? Maybe they would have become the best artists in town, known for their unique style. But then she saw the brush lying there, covered in paint stains. That meant he didn't leave willingly. What if he tried to take his belongings and she refused to let him go? Would she have stood up for him, even though it would mean losing him forever? The question"
