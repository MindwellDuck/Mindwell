The young woman's face was flushed with joy, a sight she hadn't seen reflected in her own mirror since him.

Every smile he gave her seemed to scream betrayal, every laugh a mockery of her own vulnerability. She felt like a shipwrecked sailor, left to drift on the waves of his indifference. His presence was a constant reminder of what she’d lost – the love that once warmed her heart now reduced to ashes, a bitter memory that refused to let go. She wondered if she was meant to spend the rest of her life alone, forever carrying the weight of her broken dreams. Every step back towards him only led her further away, trapped in a cycle of self-loathing and resentment. She knew she shouldn’t have come here, but something about this night felt like a trap, one that would only end in disappointment."

She notices him, forces a smile, \"Oh, hi John. I didn't mean to disturb you.\" He looks up, startled, then quickly averts his gaze. As she settles into the chair beside him, he can't help but steal glances at the baby, his mind whispering, \"You should have been more careful. This is your fault.\"",

His gaze drifted to the woman, her eyes red from crying, and for a moment, he felt a pang of guilt. But it was just a moment, and soon enough, he pushed those thoughts aside. After all, he wasn’t exactly an angel himself. There were plenty of things he could blame on himself, and he knew where to start. As the baby continued to fuss, John couldn’t shake off the feeling that he had caused some kind of trouble—something much bigger than a simple mistake. It was as if he had inadvertently set off a chain reaction of problems, ones that would haunt him long after they were forgotten. He glanced around the room, noticing how everyone seemed oblivious to what was happening. The other nurses were too caught up in their own conversations, and even the doctors looked distant, lost in their own thoughts. It was almost as if they were all pretending nothing was wrong. But John knew better. He knew that there was more to this situation than met the eye. The baby’s cries weren’t just random; they were a call for attention, a reminder that someone was paying the price for John’s mistakes.

He felt trapped in the relationship, like he was living someone else’s life. When she finally broke free, he was relieved, even though it hurt. It wasn't the end; it was just a beginning. She went back to her old ways, and I... I ended up here, working double shifts and barely scraping by. The memory of her still lingered, though. She had been everything to me—the one who understood me, who saw my potential, who encouraged me when no one else would. Without her, the world seemed duller, emptier. Every day felt like a step backward, each passing moment reminded me of what I’d failed to achieve. The restaurant, which used to be our dream, now felt like a prison—a constant reminder of my inability to hold onto something meaningful. Even now, with every meal I prepared, every table I cleared, I could feel her presence, reminding me of what we could have been if things had worked out differently.

Her favorite paintbrush lay abandoned beside an untouched palette, its bristles stiff and dry.

Every day felt like a reminder that she was failing—failing to make art that truly mattered, failing to bring joy to those who needed it most. And now, as she sat there, surrounded by her failed projects, she wondered if maybe she simply shouldn’t have started painting at all. Maybe I should’ve stuck to something more conventional, something that didn’t leave me feeling so empty. Maybe I should’ve stayed in school longer, learned a different skill, anything but this. Her mind was filled with the thoughts of what could have been, of the paths not taken, and the dreams left unfulfilled. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was meant for something more, something that didn’t involve the constant struggle to create something meaningful. Why did she keep pushing forward? What would happen if she stopped? Would she finally find peace? The question echoed through her mind, but the answer remained elusive. Perhaps she should give up on her passion altogether, accept that she might never be the artist she wanted to be. Maybe it was time to let go of the dream, to move on"
