The way he looked at her—like he just saw her for the first time, his eyes lighting up with genuine interest—that made her heart beat faster than it had all night. It wasn't even funny; he didn't laugh out loud, just smiled quietly to himself while they chatted about nothing in particular. But why did it make her feel like I'm going to die? Or worse, get left behind? He's always been the one everyone fawns over, but I know what it feels like to be ignored. To have someone glance right through you, no eye contact whatsoever. Even when we were in high school together, he barely acknowledged me, never really speaking to me unless it was something ridiculously obvious. And yet...and yet...he still looks at me like I mean everything to him, like every smile is for me alone. His eyes seem to see right through me, and I can't help but wonder if he'll ever look past my flaws. Maybe he likes me because I'm different, not pretty like those other girls. That's probably why he doesn't flirt back, why he acts like he has nothing better to do than sit next to me in class. Does he think I'm just another invisible girl to him? Why does it hurt so much? Why does it hurt so much?"

But why would she choose him when she had so many other options? Maybe she had moved on, and he was just a memory. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t help but feel like an outsider. Even though he knew he shouldn’t, he found himself wishing she’d look at him differently, even if it meant seeing things through different eyes. He imagined what it would be like if they were still together, but that day seemed so far away. It was hard to keep hope alive, especially when everyone around them seemed to have everything going right. At least he could say he tried, but that wasn’t much comfort when you felt like you were constantly falling behind. He hoped she'd eventually realize her mistake and come back to him, but deep down he knew that was wishful thinking. After all, people rarely change their minds once they've made up their minds. Still, he couldn’t help but hold on to the possibility, no matter how small. Life went on, and he continued to work, but every time he saw her, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was losing ground. Every day passed, and he struggled to find meaning in anything anymore. He kept telling himself that things"

He watches from his apartment window as couples huddle under umbrellas, laughing and sharing warmth. His reflection in the glass stares back at him, alone in the dim light of his empty living room. The clock on the microwave reads 7:30 PM. He's been home since 5:00 PM, and he knows tomorrow will be more of the same - the endless parade of customers he can't connect with, the fluorescent lights of the store buzzing like a swarm of bees in his ears. Tonight, loneliness feels heavier than usual, settling like a stone in his chest. He reaches for his phone to call someone but hesitates, scrolling through contacts instead.

It sounds silly now, but when you're alone, every wish is amplified. Maybe if I called Sarah, she'd answer, and we could catch up, share stories, and laugh together. She's always been there for me when I needed her, but tonight, even that thought feels distant. What if she didn't answer? Or worse, what if she wasn't interested anymore? That would make everything feel so much worse. But then again, maybe she's busy with her own life, too caught up in her relationship to care. He imagines her smiling and chatting with her boyfriend, feeling left behind. That thought makes him realize how much he's missed her lately, how much he wishes he was part of their life. If he had a friend, things wouldn’t feel so lonely. He pictures them hanging out, grabbing coffee, watching movies, and sharing jokes. Just being around them would ease this emptiness. But what if they weren’t interested either? Or worse, what if they were already paired off? Then he’d be stuck with this longing forever. Still, the idea keeps haunting him – maybe having a friend would help him get over this isolation. If only... He sighs, letting the thoughts fade into the night. It’s late; time to go to sleep.

It was nice to see things running smoothly again. But honestly, I don’t really think he would have liked all this fuss over one little jar.
