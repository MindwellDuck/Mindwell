The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became that he was secretly planning an affair, one that would leave her shattered and alone. The image of him with someone else haunted her dreams, making her question everything about their relationship. She started to see every interaction as a potential sign of deception, wondering how many times he'd lied to her about his schedule or excuses for missing dinner. It seemed like every little thing could be interpreted as proof of his infidelity. With each passing day, she felt herself becoming more isolated, trapped in a world of suspicion and doubt. She knew deep down that this wasn't healthy, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that her marriage was crumbling before her eyes. Every moment felt like a test, and she was failing miserably."

Her smile seemed brighter, her eyes sparkled more deeply, and her laughter echoed louder than ever before. It wasn't just a memory; every time I looked at her, I felt like I was seeing a part of me that had never fully emerged. But what struck me most was the realization that I had given her away, letting someone else hold her close when I could have kept her all for myself. That thought made me feel even more lost now. Every day feels like a step further into loneliness, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing out on something precious by being alone. Seeing her there, untouched and untouched, brought back so many memories that I thought I’d long buried. Yet, it also reminded me that some things are meant to be left behind, even if they’re cherished in our minds. Maybe someday, I’ll find a way to let go of this longing, but until then, it’s hard not to feel like I’m living two separate lives – one filled with love, the other empty, cold, and dark."

It's frustrating to see how people act like they don't even realize what they're doing. Like, who does that? You'd never hear anyone else say that. And yet, here we are, saying exactly the same thing. The irony is hilarious. This isn't new for me either. I've dealt with similar situations before. But somehow, this one feels different. Maybe it's because I'm feeling really frustrated right now. Or maybe it's just that I feel like I deserve better. Either way, I'm not going to let it get under my skin.

He knows he shouldn’t let these thoughts consume him, but they seem to seep into every moment, making even the simplest tasks feel like navigating an obstacle course. It's hard to shake off the feeling that something is off. Maybe it's just the isolation of being alone on a Tuesday night, but he can't help but imagine what could be lurking in the shadows. The idea that there might be more to life than his mundane routine keeps creeping up, making him question everything he thought he knew about himself. He tries to push these thoughts away, but they linger, refusing to be silenced.
