It wasn't just about her work; it was about her identity. She couldn't help but wonder if she was somehow flawed, if there was something fundamentally wrong with her. Was this really where her life would end? In the cold light of day, she saw herself as a failure, and it hurt. The pain felt so real, like a weight crushing her from the inside out."

She had been at it for hours, her body aching with fatigue and grief.

Suddenly, her phone buzzes - an unfamiliar number flashing across the screen.

Why does it always seem like younger employees get the recognition? I know my skills are unmatched, but somehow, they always manage to gain an edge over me. It’s frustrating, especially when I see them being praised for things I could have done just as well, if not better. Just because they’re younger doesn’t mean they deserve all the attention.

This isn’t right; everyone else is moving on while she stays stuck in this pit. She should have tried harder to let go. Maybe if she did, things would look better now. It doesn’t make sense for her to smile like that. We’re in the middle of our relationship, and she hasn’t even said hello to me today. What am I supposed to do? Shouldn’t I feel angry?
