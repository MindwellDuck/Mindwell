My dad doesn't want anything to do with me anymore; he's moved on to someone else. And my mom—she's always yelling at me, making me feel worthless. I don't even deserve to live in this world. Every time I try to leave, something holds me back. Maybe it's because I still have some unfinished business here, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's more than that. There must be a personal reason why everything keeps piling up against me. But honestly, I just want to move on already. Life isn’t fair, and I’m tired of being treated unfairly.

It all felt so unfair, like a cruel joke played against her. Even the teacher seemed oblivious to her struggles; he hadn’t offered a single word of comfort, just kept walking past her desk, as if nothing was wrong. Why wasn’t anyone there to support her? Everyone else seemed to have it easier – they had their whole family, friends, even teachers who cared. But here she was, alone, struggling to keep up appearances. She glanced over at her students, who were now chatting quietly, enjoying each other’s company. They didn’t know about her pain, didn’t see the weight holding her back. All they knew was that she was their teacher, someone they looked up to. They wouldn’t understand why she struggled so much. Not even her own sister would get it.

Her words stung, but he knew she didn't really see me. She saw what she wanted to see—a perfect little brother, not a broken man struggling to find his place. Every day feels like a test, and he fails miserably. People constantly push him around, making fun of his appearance, his awkwardness, everything about him that makes him different.
