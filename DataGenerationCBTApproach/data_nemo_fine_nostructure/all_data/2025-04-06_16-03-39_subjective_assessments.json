Why doesn't he come back?\" As she imagined him sitting by himself under the porch light, shivering in the cold night air, she felt an overwhelming urge to call for help. She had always worried about him getting lost or injured, but now it seemed more likely that something terrible was happening. The thought sent her into a frantic state, where every passing minute felt like hours. She paced around the room, wondering if someone could see through the window, if anyone was coming to check on them. Every creak of the old wooden floorboards made her jump, as if it were a sign from outside that they needed to be found soon. Her mind raced with scenarios—broken bones, heart attacks, car accidents—but none of them brought comfort. The silence only grew louder, making it seem even more impossible that he would just leave the lights on, forget his meds, and disappear into the darkness. In this moment, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something sinister was going on, that he might have left because he couldn’t handle his health anymore. The thought filled her with anxiety, causing her to double-check everything one last time before calling 911. She tried to tell herself it was irrational, that she knew he wasn’t gone forever, but the fear lingered, clouding her judgment and making her question whether she was overreacting. As the minutes ticked by, she became increasingly convinced"

Her footsteps echo in the silence, each one a hollow reminder that today is different. No lively chatter from colleagues, no hum of shared purpose. Just emptiness and the weight of sorrow she's been carrying since the funeral yesterday. She pauses at the whiteboard, tracing her fingers over the equations they'd worked on together, his handwriting now faded like his smile in her memories. A lone lab mouse scampers across the floor, its tiny heart beating loudly in the quiet, a stark contrast to the stillness of his empty chair.",

It's as if she can't let go, even though she knows it won't change anything. The equation on the board—his name scribbled in the margin—is all that's left of their partnership. She wonders if she could've done more to save him, if she could have saved him at all. What if he hadn't died so suddenly? Would they still be working together, creating something beautiful? But life doesn't give us second chances, and what if this is how he wanted us to remember him—to see the impact of our work, to feel the pain of loss, to realize that science isn't always enough to overcome death? Maybe he meant for them to leave this legacy behind, a testament to the power of human ingenuity in the face of tragedy. Or maybe he was just tired, too exhausted to finish what they started, and he wanted me to carry it forward. If only I knew... She takes a deep breath, trying to shake off the thoughts that seem to haunt her every step. But they linger, echoing in her mind like whispers of a question she can't answer. What if... What if... What if... She looks up to find her team watching her, their faces"

Maybe then people will see sense. If I were in charge, I'd make sure he wouldn't be able to walk into our town anymore. This is going to get out of control.

It makes sense. Why would anyone want to kill an innocent man just because he was alone? I'm glad I never knew him. If I had known him, I wouldn't have even liked to meet him. His death will probably cause other artists to stop making art. Maybe I'll stop making art too. Artists don't deserve to die like this. No one deserves to die like this. This is terrible.
