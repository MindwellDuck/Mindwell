Today's assignment: a local family's struggle after their son died in combat. The house seemed quieter than usual as he approached, the wife nowhere in sight. Her husband, face etched with lines of grief, invited him in, voice barely above a whisper. \"She can't handle visitors today,\" he said, looking at the framed photo on the mantel.

Meanwhile, [he] had been able to live a full life, surrounded by loving family members and friends, free from the burden of war. How could anyone truly understand the depth of sorrow that comes with losing a child? It seemed unfair to even try to write about such pain when one could hardly comprehend it themselves. How could someone expect me to grasp the complexity of that man’s emotions? I’ve never experienced anything remotely close to what he’s going through. Every step inside those walls felt like trespassing on sacred ground, where the memories of a loved one lingered. I wondered if there was ever a moment when he didn’t miss his son, when the ache wasn’t always there? Could I possibly imagine how he must have felt when he received that phone call? Did he ever get to hold his son one last time, to tell him one final thing before saying goodbye? All I saw were tears welling up in his eyes, and the faint outline of a smile that seemed more of a mask. He spoke softly, trying to keep the conversation light, but I sensed a desperation beneath the words. His eyes betrayed him; they told a different story – one of constant worry, of nights spent crying over what-ifs, of days filled with questions that went"

Didn't she remember saying that she'd be home around 10 pm? Why hadn't he mentioned anything? Her thoughts grew more jumbled as she tried to piece together what was happening. Maybe he'd gone out while she was working? Or perhaps he was dealing with some kind of family issue that had nothing to do with her? But why would he keep his phone on silent?
