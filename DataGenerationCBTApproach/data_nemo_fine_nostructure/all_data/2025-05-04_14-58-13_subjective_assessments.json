It seemed everyone else was moving forward with their lives, while she remained stuck in the past. The couple's happiness only highlighted her own isolation. Every time she saw someone in love, she couldn’t help but feel like a failure. Her friends often joked about finding their partners, but for her, every relationship ended in heartbreak. Even now, as she walked by, they were still holding hands, oblivious to her pain. It wasn't fair; why did life have to be so cruel? Why did everything seem to go wrong for her?"

It's hard to shake off the feeling that you're the one who wronged her somehow, even though you know you didn't. She must be plotting against you, waiting for an opportunity to get back at you. Your mind starts to fill with dark thoughts about how you'll never forgive yourself for what happened, and how you deserve to suffer. Even when you try to rationalize things, you end up getting sucked into the same cycle of negativity. It feels like there's no escape from these thoughts, and you're trapped in a constant loop of self-blame."

Her phone, still clutched tightly in her hand, displays the same email she's read a dozen times already: \"Your position has been eliminated.\" She wasn't even given the courtesy of a face-to-face meeting; it was just an email, like they were firing some intern who'd spilled coffee on their boss. But she's not some kid fresh out of journalism school. She's a 65-year-old veteran journalist with decades of experience under her belt. And now, just like that, it's all been thrown away. The frustration is palpable as she throws her phone onto the couch, causing it to bounce once before settling into the cushions. She stands there for a moment, her reflection in the dark window showing a woman with lines etched deeply into her face, hands trembling slightly from adrenaline and anger. Then she turns, her eyes scanning the room filled with memories of stories untold and battles won, and she feels it: a deep-seated frustration that threatens to boil over. She picks up a framed photo from her desk - her and her colleagues at some long-forgotten press conference - and hurls it against the wall. The glass shatters, the sound echoing through the empty apartment like a gunshot.",

The way she stood there, frozen in time, seemed to be saying, “This isn’t just about you; this is about what could have been if things had turned out differently.” But then, when she picked up that photo, I knew she wasn’t really doing that. She was simply reacting to her emotions. Still, there was something so raw, so honest, about the way she let go, throwing the frame against the wall. It was as if she was reminding me that sometimes, the loudest voices aren’t always the ones we think they are. Sometimes, they’re the ones we don’t even realize we’re hearing until it’s too late."

It's definitely not fair. If I had to work in something so cute, I'd want to go back in time and prevent myself from having kids just to avoid this situation. This is just ridiculous. I'm sure there are plenty of other factors at play here—like maybe she doesn't have family or friends to give her presents, or perhaps she's just not used to such genuine appreciation. But let's be real; I'm sure she knows exactly what she wants, even if she can't say it yet. If anyone needs me, I'll be over here trying to remind myself that it's not about her appearance, just her kindness and hard work. Yeah, yeah, I know.

Why else would he be so dismissive? It doesn’t matter why he acted this way; I know he’s right. I probably didn’t clean up enough for him to even notice. It’s almost as if he’s trying to show off his own cleanliness by pointing out my shortcomings. His behavior is a reflection of his character, which isn’t exactly flattering. I suppose it’s better if he sees me this way rather than being overly polite. At least then he won’t pretend to be friends with me later. Now he knows who I really am"
