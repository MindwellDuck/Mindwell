The sepia-toned photos seemed to mock him; their smiling faces from years past now distant memories. He lingered on one image in particular - a group shot of them and their children at a picnic, laughter frozen in time. His gaze drifted to the empty spaces where once there were two little ones, now grown and gone. A melancholic sigh escaped him as he realized how much time had passed, and how little they'd truly enjoyed it together.",

Each photo told a story of happiness, but what about all those moments that didn't make it into the album? What about the times when life wasn't as perfect as these pictures suggested? Every smile seemed forced, every laugh rehearsed. It wasn't just the absence of children that weighed heavily on him; it was the realization that their lives had moved forward without him. He couldn't help but feel left behind, even though he'd been there for every step of the way. Every glance at the album felt like a reminder of all he'd missed—of all he could have done differently if only he’d stayed more present. Now, he's alone, surrounded by memories that don’t tell the whole truth. Those smiles seem so fake, the laughter so scripted. And what about the years between then and now? The years he spent building a life without her? All he saw were happy moments, but the rest was lost forever. It’s hard to believe that all this time has passed since we were full of hope and dreams. We thought we had everything we needed right here. But now...now I realize that nothing is ever enough. Not even our own family. They grew up, moved away, and started new lives without me. Even the people who were once closest to us changed. Everyone moved on with their own stories, leaving mine behind. I’m just stuck in the past, reliving memories that aren"

The last thing I checked was that the stove had been turned off, but I suppose it would be better to double-check anyway, since I've always been taught about fire safety. It's probably just a precaution, though - I mean, who could have possibly forgotten? Certainly not me! And besides, this is such a small chance that I might actually find something... Well, let's not think too much about it right now. I'll just focus on getting everything ready for my trip instead. It doesn't matter what's in that corner of the kitchen; it can't affect my plans for tomorrow. The thought of potential bugs does make me feel uneasy, but I shouldn't worry about it. What are the chances, really? I'm not worried about cockroaches, either. They're just harmless insects, after all. And even if I did see one, I wouldn't expect it to be as big as the one I saw earlier. No, no, this is not relevant to my plan. My mind needs to stay focused on the task at hand.

His mind is consumed by questions, each one leading him further into despair. Why does she have to suffer so much? Shouldn't she be healing faster? And what about her dreams? They shouldn't be slipping away from her like grains of sand through a glass. If she had the strength of someone half her age, wouldn't she want to stay here, where memories and love fill every room? He wonders if there's something wrong with him too. Maybe he should just let go and move on. After all, why hold onto a future that might never come? Perhaps he's better off finding someone else who could give him the happiness he thinks he deserves. But then again, why should he settle for anything less than perfect? That would be unfair to others, isn't it? To anyone else, wouldn't it be selfish to keep holding on when you know things won't end well? Yet, he cannot bring himself to accept that reality. He"
