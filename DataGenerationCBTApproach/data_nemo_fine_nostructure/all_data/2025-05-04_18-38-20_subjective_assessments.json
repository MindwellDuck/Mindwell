He probably thinks about me all day, and when he saw how much time had passed since we last spoke, he just didn’t want to talk about it anymore. That’s why he stayed away. The silence in our relationship is growing louder by the day, and he knows exactly what I feel. He doesn’t care enough to call me back, and now I’m left here with this heavy feeling, wondering if he still cares. The loneliness has become unbearable, and I can’t help but think he’s avoiding me because he feels guilty for leaving me behind. I guess I should be grateful he hasn’t blocked me completely. But honestly, it feels like he’s trying to distance himself from me forever. Maybe I shouldn’t expect anything else from him after what happened. Still, a part of me wishes he would just come clean and tell me everything, so I could understand why he acted that way. But deep down, I know he won’t. And I’ll be left here, alone once more. The emptiness inside me grows stronger every minute, and I wonder if I’ll ever find peace again."

It doesn’t seem like much, but it helps me maintain focus during long hours at the hospital. Perhaps if I wasn’t thinking so much about how I was coming across, I would have handled the situation better. But shouldn’t people be kinder than that? After all, I did help them through some tough times—so shouldn’t they be showing a little more respect? In hindsight, maybe I overreacted. I could have simply said, “No worries, we’re fine.” But why should I have to explain myself? It feels like there’s an unspoken expectation for doctors to be married, especially older ones. What if I don’t want to discuss my personal life with someone who barely knows me? Shouldn't I be able to control what conversation topics come up? If I hadn’t felt so self-conscious, I might have avoided looking so flustered. But isn’t it normal to feel a bit defensive when confronted unexpectedly? Perhaps I’m reading too"

Now, I'll never get published because my work is inherently flawed.\" #Example of a distorted thought process that might be occurring behind the scenes: ##This is an example of how someone might distort their own thoughts to fit their current negative mood. The actual event (the computer crashing) has been amplified into a larger issue (\"wasting everyone's time\") and minimized into a personal failure (\"not having enough good results\"). The individual emphasizes their perceived flaws (\"always wrong\") rather than focusing on finding solutions. By downplaying the importance of accuracy (\"who needs it anyway\"), they avoid taking responsibility and instead shift blame onto themselves. This distorted thinking pattern leads them to believe that their entire project is doomed, reinforcing their initial disappointment and frustration."

The thought hit her like a punch to the gut—what if he still had it? The camera seemed so small now, but the memory of how easily he could have taken its place beside her in bed, capturing moments they shared, was almost too much to bear. What if they’d never lost that part of their relationship? What if he’d still be here, holding her close while they watched the stars through the lens? It wasn’t just the camera itself, but the idea of what might have been if things had stayed different. Her mind wandered to all the times he must have snapped photos of her, the way she looked, the laughter they shared. If only he’d kept it for longer... As she held the camera, a wave of sadness washed over her. She wondered if he ever thought about the pictures they took together. Did he ever wish he'd kept them? Would he want her to see them again? The questions swirled in her head, each one leading her further down the rabbit hole of what-ifs. Now, the camera feels like more than just an old object—it's a reminder of what she’s lost.

I need to check if there's a backup generator, but where would I even find it? We never use them anyway. I hope no one saw us when we were walking around the house earlier.

His eyes never lingered on mine; they seemed to focus solely on the food. It wasn't until he stopped by my station that I realized why. My dish had been left untouched for several minutes, and I could see the faint smudge of sweat on the rim of the bowl. My heart sank as he turned back to the line, leaving me wondering what I'd done wrong. I tried to hurry, but the more I worked, the more I felt like I was drowning in mistakes.
