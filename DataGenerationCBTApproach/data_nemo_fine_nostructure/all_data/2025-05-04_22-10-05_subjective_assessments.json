He'd been unable to paint since her passing six months ago. Today was meant to be different; he'd told himself it was time to face the blank canvas. But now, standing here, he felt only sadness, a heavy weight in his chest. The studio, once their shared sanctuary, now echoed with her absence. He reached out tentatively, touching the cool paintbrushes, remembering her laughter as she squeezed out vibrant colors onto the palette they'd shared. A single tear rolled down his cheek, landing on the pristine canvas.",

Every brush stroke would feel like another betrayal of our love, another reminder that nothing will ever be the same. I'll never be able to recreate those beautiful moments we spent together, lost in our art. She loved watching me paint, how I could lose myself in every color and texture. Now, even the thought of painting feels like an insult, a cruel mockery of what we had. Her smile, her laughter, her eyes—how could I possibly recapture all that? It's impossible. Painting is gone forever, and so is our life together. If I start painting again, I'll just be pretending, trying to fill this gaping hole in my heart. I won't pretend anymore. I'll never be happy again. There's no point in continuing to try. ---"

This was personal. It felt like they were attacking her, not just her writing. It wasn't fair. She'd worked hard to get where she was. They knew it. She'd helped them grow their audience, giving them exclusive access to stories that no one else had. And this was how they repaid her? This was more than just criticism. It was an insult. A slap in the face. Like, what did they expect? That she'd keep churning out perfect articles every time? That she wouldn't take risks anymore? They'd better watch themselves. She'd show them. She'd write something so powerful, so raw, that it would make them regret ever crossing her. Something that would leave them begging for forgiveness. Or worse, make them realize they could do better. And if they kept treating her this way, she might just have to consider leaving. Maybe it was time to move on. After all, there were plenty of other outlets eager to hire someone with her skills.
