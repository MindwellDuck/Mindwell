I could see how this would happen; after all, it's natural to feel hurt when you find your partner with someone else. But why did she have to make it so personal? Why couldn't she just acknowledge that they were friends and leave it at that? This wasn't about being jealous; it was about feeling abandoned. I knew she had feelings for him, but she never acted on them. And yet, here we are, seeing them laugh together like old friends. It seemed so innocent, yet I couldn't shake off the feeling of rejection. Why did she need to be so dramatic? They were just sitting on a bench, enjoying each other's company. What was wrong with that? Is it really too much to ask for some basic human interaction between friends? I know she’s upset, but does she really think this is something to gloat over? My wife needs to understand that it doesn’t matter what those two are doing. If she’s willing to accept that I’m still the same person who loves her, then why can’t she respect our relationship? We’ve been married long enough for me to know that she’ll always have friends. But this time, it feels different. This time, it’s personal. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but I wish she wouldn’t make everything seem like such a big deal."

Even the stars outside seemed to twinkle in rhythm with the memories flooding her mind—memories of laughter, of late-night conversations, of lazy mornings spent sipping coffee together. But now, those moments were nothing more than whispers in the wind, distant recollections that refused to stay within reach. She sighed, letting the weariness settle over her, a physical manifestation of the emptiness she’d grown accustomed to. In this moment, it felt like she was drowning in the echoes of what could have been, the past swirling around her like a mist that clung to everything, refusing to lift. The line between grief and resignation began to blur, until she wondered if the tears she’d shed were for the life they never shared or for the dreams they would never realize. Time seemed to stretch out before her, a canvas painted with colors that told stories of love and loss, but ultimately, it was the brushstrokes of solitude that dominated the scene. As the night deepened, she realized that some paintings were meant to be unfinished, leaving the artist to ponder the possibilities forever.
