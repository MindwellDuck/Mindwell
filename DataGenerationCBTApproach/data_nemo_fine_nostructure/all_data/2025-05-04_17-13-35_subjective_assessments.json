        "Triggering Event": "She found herself alone in the precinct's break room, the clock hands creeping towards the end of her shift. The usual chatter was absent; everyone else had gone home to their families hours ago. She reached into her pocket for her wedding ring, a habit she hadn't broken despite it being three years since the divorce. As she rubbed the smooth band between her fingers, she noticed a photo on the bulletin board - a colleague's child in a police uniform, grinning from ear to ear. A pang of regret hit her like a punch to the gut. She looked at her own empty hands, no ring, no child, just calluses and a faint tremor from too many late-night patrols.",

She wondered if she'd ever be able to shake off the feeling that she didn't belong here, that she was always going to be the odd one out. It was as if she couldn't stop seeing everything through the lens of loneliness, even when there were people right next to her. She knew she wasn't supposed to feel this way, but it was hard to ignore the sense that she was meant for someone else's life, someone with a partner who would hold her hand and a child who would look up to her as a role model. That was what she wanted, but every time she thought about it, she ended up back where she started – alone. She tried to convince herself that she was doing this for them, that she was putting her career ahead of her personal happiness, but deep down, she knew that wasn't true. Every night, after closing the door behind her, she felt like she was living two separate lives: one where she was part of a loving family, and another where she was just another faceless cop. She remembered how excited she used to get over little things like Christmas decorations or birthday cakes. Now, those moments felt hollow, like she was pretending to enjoy something that didn't bring her joy. She couldn't help but wonder if she was missing out on something essential by choosing this path. Maybe someday she’d realize"

And then there was the time she had to take over for our shift; she seemed so confident, but maybe she just wanted to prove something? It's hard to read people these days anyway. We don't really talk much outside of work, but I feel like she's always watching me, even when we're just standing by the copier. Maybe it's because she thinks I'm too perfect, or maybe she just doesn't like someone who's \"too good\" for her. Either way, it makes me feel uneasy. Every little thing now seems suspicious. I wonder if she's trying to get under my skin, or if she genuinely wants to help us work better together. But honestly, I'd rather not think about it anymore."

It was clear she regretted not being able to protect her son from his abusive husband, which made sense given how much she had been through herself. She had struggled so much, living alone as a single mother and dealing with financial insecurity—she probably felt overwhelmed by everything, especially during those years when his dad was still around. This was just another reminder of all the things he could have done differently if only he had been more supportive, listened more, or helped out more often. He remembered feeling like he was constantly holding back because of his own fears about failing or messing up, even though deep down he knew he wanted to be there for her. Now, seeing those words, it hit him hard that maybe he hadn’t been enough after all. His mind started racing with thoughts of how he’d wish things had turned out differently if he could go back in time. He can't help but think that he'll never forgive himself for not being there more. This whole experience is making him feel like a failure again, and he knows he needs to take responsibility for his part in everything that happened. Maybe he should've been stronger, been more understanding, and supported her better instead of letting his fears control him. Even though he knows it’s too late now, it hurts to remember all the times he could’ve been more present for his mom and brother."

This fear is suffocating; he can't breathe. Every passing moment feels like an eternity, each breath a reminder of the impending doom. He knows it's irrational but can't shake off this feeling of hopelessness. If he doesn't check in immediately, if he doesn't reassure her, he is abandoning her. Yet, every step forward leads to more anxiety. What if he’s wrong? What if she needs someone else now? What if—-no. No. No. He must fix this. He cannot afford to let his daughter fall between the cracks. He can’t allow himself to feel weak when she needs him most. He can’t be seen as anything less than perfect by her teachers, by her friends, by herself. He can’t be seen as failing. He can’t fail. He won’t fail. But why does he keep thinking these thoughts? Why does he feel this way?"

How can you let this happen? You always do things like this. First, you overspend on groceries, and then you put your receipts in your jacket pockets. You never listen when I tell you what I want.
