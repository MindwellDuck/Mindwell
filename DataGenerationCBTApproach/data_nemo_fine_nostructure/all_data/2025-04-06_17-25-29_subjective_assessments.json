He'd been hoping for a text, any sign she was thinking about them, but his phone remained stubbornly dark.\n\nThe fridge hummed, echoing in the hollow kitchen. He opened it, scanning the shelves stripped bare of her favorites. The divorce had been brutal, but this quiet, this emptiness, was worse. It was like being on call, waiting for a dispatch that never came.\n\nHe reached for a beer, then paused. Instead, he grabbed a bottle of water and slumped into his armchair. His uniform still smelled faintly of smoke from the warehouse fire yesterday. He closed his eyes, wishing for sleep, but all he saw were flames licking at the edges of his mind, threatening to consume him.\n\nHis hand drifted to his pocket, where her letter crumpled like a forgotten receipt. He'd meant to throw it out, but here it was, another silent reminder of what he'd lost. Hopelessness welled up inside him, as vast and consuming as the warehouse fire.",

The thought of going home is suffocating me, weighing me down with every passing minute. Even my own hands seem heavy, like they’re filled with bricks instead of the usual tools. I can’t shake off the feeling that everything around me is closing in, crushing me beneath its weight. Just like the warehouse fire, it’s spreading, engulfing me completely. I’m trapped, unable to escape the darkness that's building inside me. Just like that, you've created your own version of the original. Let me know if you need anything else! # Example Output ## Subjective Reaction I feel hopeless. My life is falling apart. I don't have anyone who cares about me. I feel like I'll never find happiness again. I just want things to go away so I can stop feeling this way. ## Explanation In this example, the person has decided to get rid of their problems by imagining them disappearing. They imagine that they're just \"going away,\" rather than actually addressing the issues themselves. This behavior suggests that they are avoiding dealing with their problems because they're afraid of the feelings associated with them. By doing so, they avoid confronting reality and the emotions that come with it. ## Discussion This subjective reaction reflects the cognitive distortion 'Minimization.' In reality, the problem isn't going away; it's simply becoming more"

She'd started working there last week, bringing an energy he hadn't seen in years.

He found himself watching them, his hands fidgeting with the merchandise he was supposed to be restocking.

It wasn't fair. He worked hard, putting in long hours to keep his store running smoothly. But no matter how hard he tried, people didn't seem to notice. They'd come in, grab what they wanted, and leave. Sometimes they'd talk to him, but it was always perfunctory, never really engaging. Even the regulars seemed to have lost interest lately. As he looked around the empty store, he realized everyone else had moved on to better things. It was hard to see this girl making new connections so easily, especially since she was still learning the ropes. What's more, she seemed to enjoy every moment, laughing freely and smiling brightly. He could tell by the way she interacted with others that she genuinely enjoyed being around them. Meanwhile, he felt like he was stuck in a rut, going through the motions day after day. There was nothing exciting about his job anymore; it was just routine after routine. And now, seeing someone as carefree as her made him realize just how much he'd been missing out on. It stung to think that maybe he wasn't meant to be happy like her. As the days went by, he watched"
