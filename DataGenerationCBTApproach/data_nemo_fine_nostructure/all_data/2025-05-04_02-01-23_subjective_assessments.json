He probably did it just because he was annoyed at being cut off. Shouldn’t he be angry about how he was treated? It's no excuse for cutting him off, though. The other driver is clearly doing it to provoke him. That's why he flicked his hazard lights; he wanted to get under his skin. Why would he act like that if he wasn't trying to make him mad? He should've driven faster instead of slowing down so much. If he had, the other driver wouldn't have been able to cut him off. He shouldn't have slowed down like that. It's no excuse for cutting someone off, especially when you know you're supposed to keep up with traffic flow. Maybe the driver was having an off day and didn't mean anything by it. But still, he could’ve been more careful. Shouldn't he have been more alert and attentive? He should've kept his cool and focused on the road. Shouldn't he have been more patient and calm? Now he's upset and getting defensive. He should have just ignored it and moved on. It doesn't justify aggressive behavior, but maybe there was something going on that made him act like that. He shouldn't have let it affect him, but now he's feeling frustrated. He should have just driven normally and calmly."

You can tell how much he misses her, but he doesn't know how to move forward. I've seen him cry several times already, and every time he does, it breaks me down. How am I supposed to help him when I still feel like I’m drowning in grief? Even though it’s been two years, it feels like yesterday I was driving her home from work, listening to her talk about the new job she landed. She was going to start working there soon, and I remember thinking how excited I was for her. I miss everything—her smile, her laugh, the way she used to make coffee for us in the morning. It feels like no matter what I do, I can’t escape this emptiness inside me. Watching him try to keep everything together while dealing with his own pain is hard enough, but seeing how much he struggles to cope makes it worse. Every day, I struggle to find the strength to keep moving. But then something like today happens, and I realize how much I’ve missed having her around.
