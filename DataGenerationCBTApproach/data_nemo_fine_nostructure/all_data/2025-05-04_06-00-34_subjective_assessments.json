The thought of all those years of work going to waste is crippling. It doesn't seem fair that someone else would get to claim this achievement when it could have been mine. How can something like this happen? Everyone knows how important this project was, yet it just slipped away from me because of some stupid mistake. It feels so unfair that everyone will remember what happened instead of the actual accomplishment. This shouldn't have happened. No one should make mistakes like this. They should know better than to let something like this slip through their hands. I'm the best person for this job, and no one should have even considered letting me down like this. I’m the only one who truly understood the significance of this research; no one else has the vision or the expertise to carry it forward. Now everything is ruined. I never meant for this to end up like this. My life has changed forever. All these years of dedication were wasted. I keep thinking about all the things I could've done differently if only I had known what was happening. But why does this always happen to me? Why can't anyone just see my potential? How can something like this happen? Why did it happen to me? Why am I always stuck with these kinds of failures? It really hurts to think about all the opportunities that went up in flames. I’ve lost every chance"
