He had expected praise for his handling of little Emma's behavioral issues, but instead, he found her mother complaining to the principal about his \"unnecessary roughness.\" The principal looked up, eyes cold behind his glasses, and said, \"We'll discuss this later, John.\" Now, as he poured himself a coffee, he noticed the others averting their gaze. A photocopy of a disciplinary form lay on the counter, his name printed at the top. He felt the heat rise in his cheeks as he realized everyone had seen it.",

I didn't mean to scare her half to death. It's ridiculous how easily kids can get upset over something like that. Maybe they're just jealous of me because I'm doing such a great job with these kids. I have to make sure I keep showing everyone what a good teacher I am. If they don't see how hard I work, they'll never understand why I got so angry. Even if they did understand, it wouldn't change anything. I'd still be right. I know I am. These people are just too close-minded to see it. They need to learn a lesson about respect. I shouldn't even care what they say; I've already done nothing wrong. What's there to apologize for? I'm just frustrated because they're being unreasonable. This isn't going to affect my performance evaluation. I'm confident everything will work out fine. I'm not going to let one thing like this ruin my reputation. I know I'm a great teacher and deserve respect. People who disagree with me just don't understand my perspective. I'm not going to let them get under my skin."

This time, he wouldn't hold back. When they returned, he would confront them, making them understand the true cost of their actions. The anger within him grew with each passing moment, urging him forward. He could feel it building, ready to unleash its fury upon them.

Your child is trying their best, but the way things are structured right now—especially since I have so much going on personally—it's hard to keep up.

Wasn't this supposed to be a night for them to reconnect, just the two of us? When he brought it up again later, she brushed it off, saying she was just catching up with someone who understood her better than most. But he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more going on, that he was missing some crucial detail. She seemed so calm, but he could sense a tension beneath the surface, a hidden worry that she wasn't letting show. It bothered him, even though he knew it probably wasn't anything serious. Still, the image stuck in his head - her fingers flying across the keyboard, her face tilted down as if trying to block the world out. It was like she was creating a bubble around herself, one where she could hide whatever was really happening inside. He wondered if she ever stopped to think about how this might affect him, how it made him feel like he was losing her to someone else. Maybe he was just being paranoid, but the thought lingered, refusing to let go. ### Response"

But the fantasy quickly crumbled, leaving her feeling more isolated than ever. The contrast between their lives and hers intensified the sense of disappointment within her.
