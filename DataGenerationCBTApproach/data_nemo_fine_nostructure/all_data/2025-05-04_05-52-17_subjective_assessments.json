He barely glanced at the canvas before him, his eyes already filled with distant numbers and deadlines from his office. \"Not today,\" he said, not unkindly, but firmly enough to sting. She watched his retreating back, her heart sinking like a stone into cold water. Another day, another unsold masterpiece, another husband too tired to see the vibrant world she painted for him. The rejection tasted bitter on her tongue as she set down her brush, the canvas now forgotten.",

His mind seemed to be elsewhere, lost in numbers and deadlines from his office. The way he brushed off her work felt like a slap in the face, leaving her feeling unheard and unseen. It wasn't just about the painting; it was about who they were together. Her passion for creativity had always been a part of them, something that brought joy and connection. But now, it seemed to be nothing more than a hobby, one he no longer cared about. Every time he came home, he'd glance at her canvas, then quickly move on, never stopping to look deeper. It was as if he saw everything through his own lens, ignoring what made her happy. He wasn't the first man to dismiss her dreams, but this hurt more because she thought they were building a life together, not tearing it apart. Their conversations often turned to how he could support her, but those words felt hollow when he showed no genuine interest. He'd talk about how he worked hard to provide for them, but she knew that was an excuse for not taking her seriously. When she tried to share her vision, he'd interrupt, saying things like, \"You're good at decorating, so why not make your living room beautiful?\" His lack of understanding went"

That young woman seemed so carefree, basking in the warmth of youthful love, while I've been left to bear the weight of years spent alone. Even the way she smiled seemed more vibrant than my own, a testament to the beauty that time has stolen from me. Her laughter must have sounded sweeter, her eyes brighter, all those memories she holds dear. I can only imagine how wonderful it would be to relive even one moment of our lives together. It's unfair to think that I'll never know what it was like to experience such happiness, to share in her joy. She probably had people around her, friends who'd laugh along with her, family who'd support her. How could anyone else have had such a wonderful life? Mine is just a shadow of hers, a dull imitation of something truly special. If only I could go back, if only I could turn back the clock... But alas, time keeps moving forward, leaving us further apart. We're just two women, living different lives, yet both bearing scars of loneliness. Maybe there are moments when she thinks about me, wondering what became of someone once close. Could she ever truly understand the depth of my sorrow, or will we remain forever distant, each lost in our own private grief?"

My feelings are hurt because she didn’t think twice before throwing away what belonged to me. What if someone had thrown away one of our group projects? Would we still be friends? Maybe I am overreacting, but this situation feels like another blow to my self-esteem. Maybe I am unworthy of love and friendship. This is probably just an example of how cruel everyone can be.
