It happens all the time—my wife has been doing this job for 30 years, and she still sees people like this every week. You’d think someone would finally learn to be on time once they see how much trouble it causes them. People never change, you know? They just keep making excuses. It makes me angry because we work so hard to make our schedules work. But honestly, it’s not worth my time anymore; sometimes I wonder if it’s better for us just to stop taking appointments altogether. It feels like no one ever shows up anyway. You can respond with your own version of the response, then discuss the specific ways it reflects 'Discounting the Positive'. This will help illustrate the concept more clearly. Please note that the responses are examples rather than real-life quotes from actual individuals. Let me know when you’re ready to post your response, and I’ll be happy to assist you. Feel free to ask any questions about this exercise! # Example Response: \"That’s so typical! I’ve seen it happen before. I’m surprised he didn’t come back to cancel again.

Her mind was a war zone, where memories of joy were reduced to nothing more than ash, scattered by the cruel hand of time. The once-peaceful haven he built with love now loomed before her, its beauty twisted into something grotesque – a mockery of all he held dear. Each moment spent in that room became a torture, forcing her to relive the anguish of losing him. Every glance at the chair made her feel like she was staring into the abyss, a void so deep it threatened to swallow her whole. It was as if the very walls were closing in, suffocating her beneath the weight of grief. Each breath seemed to whisper a haunting truth: nothing would ever be the same again. Her thoughts swirled around the chair like a maelstrom, each twist revealing a new layer of pain. Even the simplest actions felt like climbing Mount Everest, every step fueled by a fire that refused to burn out. The world outside receded, leaving her alone with the echoes of what could never be. Time itself began to warp, stretching moments into eternity as she struggled to find solace in a reality that seemed determined to crush her. Every day felt like a battle, fought against the tide of despair that threatened to consume everything. Yet still she stood, refusing to yield, even when the winds howling through her"

She asked if he knew anything about a car accident on Highway 12. His mind went blank, memories of a crash flooding back. He had seen something like it before, a black sedan rear-ending a white pickup, both vehicles crashing into the ditch. They were never found, only the shattered glass and twisted metal. He got up, walked over to her, and said, \"What's wrong?\" She didn't answer, just kept staring. He noticed the clock on the wall - it was already past noon, and he hadn't even eaten yet. Suddenly, he felt hungry, so he went to grab some food from the counter while she stayed where she was, lost in thought."
