As he scrolled through social media, everyone seemed to be accomplishing so much more than him—writers were publishing books, artists had exhibitions, while he struggled just to finish his latest draft. Even though he knew this wasn't fair, he couldn't help but feel inadequate compared to them. Meanwhile, in reality, those people are probably spending most of their day dealing with stressors they have, which makes their accomplishments less impressive when you look at it objectively. The real question is, how does he plan to overcome his own mental blocks and get back into writing? By focusing on what he can control, rather than comparing himself to others, he'll find the motivation to push forward."

He remembered her laughter when they first met, how she'd encouraged his art even when he struggled. Now, he couldn't shake the feeling that this painting was another failure, another letdown for her. His stomach churned with remorse as he thought about how much she deserved better than him.",

She must think I don't care about her anymore, but she’s probably just upset because of our argument years ago. Maybe if I sent her a card, she’d forgive me. But what if she doesn’t? I feel so stupid for forgetting again—my brain is always getting distracted by something else. I wish I could be more organized, but it's hard when everything feels overwhelming. Now that I see this photo, I realize how much I've been neglecting family lately, and it makes me feel worse. This thought keeps popping up: \"If only I had stayed in touch with her.\" What would have happened if I hadn't let our disagreement ruin everything? Would we still be close? Probably not. My mind is full of \"what ifs,\" and it's making me sad. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt stuck in my life, and now I’m thinking about all the other things I've forgotten over the years... How many birthdays did I miss? How often have I disappointed her? The guilt is building, and I can't shake it off. I guess I'll try to make amends somehow, even though it might be too late. This situation always leads back to the same conclusion: I'm a failure at being a good brother. If only I could go back and change things, maybe I wouldn't feel so alone. But I know I"

It's not like I can improve; my skills are stagnant, and I've wasted so much time trying to brush away the dullness. There's nothing left but to give up and accept that I'll never see another sunrise painted across the sky. This isn't just about me; it affects every other artist who has ever lived, because they're all trapped in the same cycle as me - born to create or born to fade into obscurity. You can't choose your birth, but you can choose how you react to it. I chose to waste years of my life, and now I have nothing but regret. If I were born with the gift, I'd be the greatest painter the world has ever known. Instead, I'm just another forgotten soul, left behind by the tide of history. My art will mean nothing when I'm gone, and the thought haunts me. Every day feels like a countdown to my final performance, where I'll take my last bow, and then it's over. There's no room for improvement; I'm already a failure, and soon I'll join the countless others who fell short. Maybe someday someone will find what I lost, but until then, I"

It really doesn't matter if he got ahead because he deserved it. He must have worked harder than I did, even though we've both been here for years. Maybe he deserves the recognition more than I do. I should focus on what I can control instead of getting upset about something that isn't important in the big scheme of things. He probably won't remember what happened anyway.
