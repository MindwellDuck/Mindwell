He scowls, muttering under his breath, “This is going to end badly.” The waitress approaches, asking if they need anything else, and he responds, “No, but tell them I’ll be watching them. They’re just like all the others – shallow, self-absorbed, and obsessed with social media.” He continues, “They think they can succeed in this field because they have a lot of followers online, but they won’t last long. In fact, they’ll probably fail within a year.” When asked why, he says, “Because they lack the experience and skills needed to succeed. It’s clear they’ve never cooked professionally before. They’re just pretending to be something they’re not.” He goes on to say, “Even if they manage to cook well for a few months, their relationship will fall apart soon. Their constant arguing and eye-rolling will become too much for each other.” The waitress looks confused and slightly concerned by his comments, but she doesn’t intervene further. The young couple leaves, looking upset."

It makes her wonder how anyone can find joy in such chaos, especially when she sees her colleagues returning home to clean kitchens, where everything is tidy and organized. Their lives seem so much more manageable than hers. How can someone else's life be easier when hers feels like a never-ending battle against disorder? It's almost as if they're living in two different worlds—one where every day brings peace and another where chaos reigns supreme. Her mind wanders to the countless hours spent cleaning up after dinner, cooking meals from scratch, and managing the household chores. Every moment feels like time wasted on something that could have been left for tomorrow, but there's no tomorrow, only the constant pressure to keep going. Even the simplest tasks feel overwhelming—a messy room, a pile of laundry, a sink full of dirty dishes—each one building upon the last, until she feels like she’s losing control. The comparison isn't fair, but it's hard not to think that everyone else has it easier, that their lives are somehow cleaner, more balanced, and less exhausting. Maybe even her own parents seemed happier when they had fewer responsibilities, but now she's the one carrying the load. They don't understand how hard it is to maintain this level of cleanliness alone, especially with her job taking a toll on her energy levels."

They didn’t even acknowledge my work; just said it was too dark and left. I can feel the anger building up inside me, but deep down, I know it’s not fair. Maybe if I’d let her finish it, maybe she wouldn’t have left us so soon. What if I had stayed longer with her, listened to her ideas, made her happy again? Would she still be here today? No, she wasn’t going to be here anyway, because I messed things up by leaving her alone. I could have stayed, but I did, and now she’s gone. It’s not fair. I’m not fair. I should’ve done more.

Failing her partner, failing her work, failing life, all built upon one single failure. Every step back, every missed opportunity, every setback, every mistake, every regret. It all led here, now, when there was nothing left but the weight of her failures bearing down on her. Even her thoughts were tainted by the darkness, twisted into cruel taunts that mocked her inability to succeed. Each failure layered upon the last, creating an impenetrable fortress of self-doubt. She saw herself as a broken puzzle, with pieces missing, never complete. With every passing second, the fragments of her identity shifted further, until she was just another piece of brokenness, lost among the shadows. There was no escape from this labyrinth of self-destruction, where every path led deeper into despair. She could feel the weight of her past mistakes crushing her. Every decision, every action, every choice, leading to more failures, more heartbreaks, more disappointments. Her future loomed darkly, shrouded in uncertainty, yet she knew what awaited her—a lifetime of disappointment, of shattered dreams, of lives untold, of potential squandered. She was trapped in a"
