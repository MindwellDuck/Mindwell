The canvas he'd left unfinished still leaned against the easel, his brushes dried out beside it. A single paint tube lay abandoned on the floor, its cap off, a forgotten tear stain darkening its side. She picked it up, her fingers tracing the indented impression of his thumb. A quiet sob escaped her lips as she noticed the color: their favorite shade of blue, the one he'd mixed just for her, now drying out like their love had done so suddenly.",

The fact that he hadn't cleaned up after himself was a reminder of how much work he'd put into this project—how much he'd cared about getting it right. But at the same time, it made her realize how little effort he'd put into anything else. He'd always been a bit scattered, but lately, it seemed like he was losing interest in everything except art. She wondered if this was a sign that he'd finally found what he wanted to focus on. As she looked around, she noticed some of his old sketches from college, tucked away between paintings. They were rough, but there was something endearing about them, like glimpses of a young man trying to figure things out. It was hard to imagine him having such a different life back then. At least, it wasn't until she saw the sketch of her, the one where he'd drawn her standing confidently, arms raised as if embracing the world. It was a small thing, but it made her smile. Maybe, just maybe, he'd realized what was missing all along—the connection he needed to make his art truly special. But as she stood there, the weight of his abandonment grew heavier. She couldn't help but think that his lack of dedication would eventually lead to more than just unfinished projects. There was a part of her that wished he'd never taken up painting again, that he'd find another hobby to distract"

Her partner's arm was around her waist, his smile warm as they approached the wall displaying her paintings.

Even though no one else seemed to notice, she couldn't shake off the feeling that everyone was watching her, judging her for her lack of talent. It wasn't just the criticism that hurt; it was the fact that she knew she deserved better than this. She wanted to prove herself, but now she felt so defeated.

There's a certain...harshness to the way he speaks, the way he thinks. Like he's already seen the worst-case scenario play out, and now he's trying to tell me about it. I feel a shiver run down my spine as I listen, but he knows exactly how I'll react. He can read me like a book, and he's using that knowledge to drive a knife deeper into my heart."

Would everything feel less painful, or would he just end up feeling more isolated? This made him think about all the times he'd kept himself away. There were moments when he'd been too busy, too tired, or too lost in his thoughts to join in. Now, he realized those were exactly the same times he'd wanted to avoid confronting reality—just as he had avoided being part of the celebration. If he had been more present, maybe he could've changed the atmosphere. Perhaps he could have helped create a sense of belonging among his friends. They seemed to be enjoying each other's company, sharing memories, and moving forward together. It was as if they were celebrating his wife’s life rather than mourning its loss. But then again, he thought about the countless nights he spent alone, working late, and coming home to an empty apartment. Wasn’t it better for everyone this way? Did he really want to force himself into a situation where he might have to pretend to be happy, when deep down, he was still grieving? Maybe, just maybe, he could learn to accept this new reality.

Maybe they've finally made amends and are working towards rebuilding their relationship. I wouldn't know anything about that since my own marriage ended in disaster. It's funny how some people can turn their lives around, while mine is stuck in neutral. Guess some people just have more luck than others. At least she doesn't have to deal with the stress of trying to find a new job and support herself. I wonder what kind of lifestyle she'll be able to afford now that she's giving her ex money. Will she buy a big house or take up hobbies? Who knows, maybe she'll start dating again and find someone even better than him.
