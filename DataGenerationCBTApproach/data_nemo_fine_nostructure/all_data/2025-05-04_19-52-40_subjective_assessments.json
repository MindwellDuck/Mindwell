It feels so unfair that we won't even get to say goodbye before everything is destroyed. The thought of all my belongings being tossed into a dumpster is heartbreaking.

All she could think about was how much he hated her cooking, and she couldn't shake that feeling no matter how hard she tried. Every time she opened her eyes, she saw him sitting there, watching her with a critical gaze that made her skin crawl. He never said anything directly, but everything she did felt like a mistake waiting to happen. Even the way she moved towards the counter seemed clumsy and awkward. She didn't know why she kept replaying their arguments in her head, but they always ended up making her feel guilty and anxious. She started wondering if he even liked her anymore, or if he just tolerated her because she reminded him of her mother. Every step she took felt heavy, as if she was carrying the weight of their entire relationship on her shoulders. She couldn't stop thinking about how he would react when he came home. Would he yell again? Or maybe he'd just be disappointed in her, like always? She imagined him walking into the kitchen, seeing the mess she left behind, and how he would scold her silently. His face would probably"

This isn't new; he remembers years ago when he was teaching similar subjects, and it felt the sameâ€”overwhelming. He's tried everything to stay on top: breaking tasks into smaller chunks, delegating more work to colleagues, even hiring a tutor during school breaks. But somehow, he's still drowning in work. There's no escape. He's never had a break, no time to catch up on personal life or simply relax. Even now, sitting alone in his kitchen, he can feel the stress building. It's exhausting. Every day feels like an endless marathon, and he can't shake the feeling that things will only keep getting worse. His partner doesn't understand; she thinks he has plenty of time, that he just needs to \"get organized.\" She suggests he hire someone to help with grading, but he knows it won't make a difference. Things are always this bad. I don't know how much longer I can handle this pace. It's taking a toll on my mental health, and I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake leaving my old job.

This early retirement was supposed to be a reward after decades of hard work, but instead, it felt like punishment. She deserved better than me, someone who couldn't even give her the full life she deserved. Maybe I shouldn't be here, watching her fade away, when there's so much left to live. I should be out there making new friends, exploring new places, doing things she never got to do. But what would she think if she saw me now? Would she be proud? Shouldn't I be doing something else, somewhere else? There's no reason I should be stuck here, feeling sad. I can always move forward, start again. What's wrong with me? I'm just being selfish, holding onto the past. If I really wanted to honor her, I'd be doing all these things now, not sitting here alone. How could I have let it get to this point? I know I should be grateful, but I don't want to feel this way anymore. Everything is falling apart, and I'm the one who should be fixing it.
