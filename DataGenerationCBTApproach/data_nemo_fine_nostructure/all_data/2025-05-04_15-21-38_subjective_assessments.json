Today, she noticed a crack in the seat he used to occupy, a subtle fault line mirroring her own heart. She picked up his favorite mug from the draining board, now hers alone to use and wash. The bitterness welled up as she felt the coldness of the unused chair, its emptiness echoing the hollowness within her.",

Maybe he was too busy with work. He didn't even leave a note about moving out. I don't know what he did with all those bills, anyway. Maybe he paid them himself? Or maybe he didn't pay anything. I wouldn't put it past him to be lazy and not pay anything. And honestly, I'm better off without him. My life is so much easier now. No more stress over who left the dishes in the sink. Now it's just me, and I can handle this. I've always been the one taking care of everything around here. Anyway, back to work. I'll get started on these reports later."

She hadn't seen it since they'd parted ways six months ago. A lump formed in her throat as she traced his face with her fingertip. The bell above the store's entrance chimed, startling her back to reality. Another customer had entered, but all she could focus on was the hollow ache in her chest that felt heavier than any bag of clothes or shoes she'd ever carried.",

The woman next to her, who looked like she belonged in a 1970s time capsule, asked for help finding a specific brand of jeans. I couldn’t help but feel a pang of jealousy as I watched her effortlessly scan the racks, unlike me who struggled to even look at the clothes without getting overwhelmed by memories. This woman didn’t have to deal with the emotional turmoil that came with every passing day, while I was stuck in this rut, unable to shake off the pain of losing him. Every glance at her seemed to remind me of what I’d lost – the comfort of knowing he was just around the corner, the laughter we shared, the quiet moments when our hands touched in the dark, and how he used to know exactly where to touch me to make me smile. As if reading my mind, another customer started asking for help finding a pair of boots. My heart sank further; I knew I wouldn’t be able to help them either because I wasn’t feeling up to it today. When I finally mustered enough courage to stand up and walk over to the boots section, I caught myself thinking about what I would’ve done differently with him if only I’d been more patient, had listened better, or if only he’d given me a chance. Those thoughts only led to more tears, and before I knew it, I was wiping away my own tears"

It's all because of him being irresponsible. He always has been like that. If he had taken better care of things, none of this would have happened. We never had a chance, anyway. He wasn't good enough for me. This is why he didn't deserve me. I remember how he used to keep everything organized, but then he stopped doing it when we moved out together. I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did. Now look at him; broken, just like our relationship. I'll never forgive him. He could have prevented all this by cleaning up after himself. Maybe if he had done that, he wouldn't be dead right now. But no, he went off on some stupid trip, leaving everything to decay. I knew it was a bad idea. I warned him about it. Still, he chose to ignore me. That's what happens when you're with someone who doesn't respect you. You deserve better than that. I won't waste another minute thinking about him."

Walking home under the bare winter trees, his reflection in the deserted shop windows showed only a gaunt old man. The holiday decorations seemed mocking, their cheer hollow and distant.

Why did he have to be the one carrying this weight? The kids were all grown, living separate lives; his daughter didn't even call anymore. She'd moved away years ago, leaving him behind. Even the holidays felt forced now, the music playing too loudly, making it impossible to enjoy anything. It was all so unfair. They would never understand how much he worked for them, how much I suffered for them. No one ever said thank you, no one ever asked about me. Just resentment. And the store...the store was a burden. He couldn't afford to close it down, but it was eating into his savings. Every dollar counted when there were bills to pay and debts to settle. What would people think if they found out how little money he actually made? Would they still want to buy from him then? It wasn't right. He deserved better than this. Life wasn't supposed to be like this. But life always is. And what's the point of trying anyway? Everything will fall apart sooner or later. We're all just stuck here until our time runs out. Maybe someday we'll find peace, but till then... Maybe I'm just tired of waiting. Maybe I've been wrong all along. Maybe it's time to stop caring, to accept whatever comes. After all, what's the use?"

It made sense that he was scared - after all, many people found her intimidating because of her sharp tongue. When he asked about a specific product, she could tell he wasn't just looking for information but genuinely needed help. His fear must be real, so it's natural that she feels uneasy around him. He seems like someone who is desperate for attention, which makes her even more wary. The way he looks at her, almost pleadingly, suggests he's in trouble and needs guidance. It's understandable that she would feel protective towards him, especially since he appeared vulnerable. She can't blame herself for feeling anxious; her instincts are trying to protect her from someone who may be taking advantage of her kindness."

Everyone else seems to have moved on, while he's stuck in limbo. He wonders if others are even thinking about him, if they remember him at all. He can't help but feel like an invisible ghost, just going through the motions. The letter arrived today, and he hasn't touched it yet. It feels so familiar, with her handwriting on the envelope.

But here she was, alone again, the silence deafening."
