Maybe I should check the hospital's website to see if they've announced anything before calling her. But what if it's already too late? If something like this happens again, will she survive? Am I ready to take responsibility for saving lives? I have to get ready ASAP, but I don't have time to shower. Can I just roll out of bed? I guess so. Hopefully, everyone else is more prepared than I am. I wonder how many other doctors are going to show up. Will there be enough chairs for everyone?
