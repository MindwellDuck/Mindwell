His laughter echoed through the sterile room like a personal joke at her expense. She felt the familiar pang of grief twist into something else, something sharper - spite. She stormed out, slamming the door behind her, leaving him alone with his laughter and her husband's ghost.",

He must think she doesn't know how much that picture meant to her. Her mind is just as fragile as ever. I don't even know why I bother trying to talk to her anymore. She'll never let me live this down. And now she's gone again, because she can't handle anything. How could anyone blame her? They were such a loving couple; they had everything going for them. But no, she had to be so dramatic and emotional, and he had to be so insensitive. It's almost as if they're trying to make me look bad by comparing us. Like, what would my life have been like if I'd been more understanding, more empathetic? Maybe then we wouldn't be here, stuck in this cycle of pain. No one will ever understand how hard it is to watch someone you love fade away like that. The world just keeps spinning, but we're still trapped in our own private hell. But oh well, I guess I'm just too sensitive to deal with all this. Better off without her anyway. At least I won't have to hear her constant crying and drama. My head hurts from all these unrequited feelings. This whole thing has ruined everything. What am I supposed to say when I see him next time? \"Hey, sorry about"

The once vibrant room now feels like a prison, each unfinished painting a silent accusation. Her phone rings; it's him again. She ignores it, but his voice echoes in her mind, \"You're wasting your life, just like you wasted our marriage.\" She looks around at the chaos of colors and forms she can't bring herself to complete, feeling utterly helpless.

Each brushstroke feels forced, as if she’s trying to create something beautiful despite the ugliness that surrounds her. It doesn’t feel like her anymore—the passion has been drained from her soul, leaving behind a hollow shell. Even her own thoughts seem distant, as if they’re hiding behind a veil of sadness.

When people say things like, “Oh, you’re still angry about that?” Or “What happened then?” He just shrugs it off and tells the same story again. It’s like he thinks nothing ever changed. The worst part is, whenever he does this, I start feeling like I’m in the wrong. Like I need to apologize for something I didn’t even do. I know deep down that I shouldn’t let him get away with it, but every time he brings it up, my frustration grows. It makes me want to lash out at him, which isn’t fair.

Yet, he wasn't ready to move on, either. She still had so much love left for him - maybe. Maybe they could work things out? No, there's no way they can.

I hope our staff is prepared for this because I know we can’t afford any mistakes right now. It’s just too much pressure.

Everyone’s going to get overwhelmed, and there’s nothing we can do about it. My anxiety is through the roof thinking about how stressed everyone will be. I feel like I’m going to pass out just imagining all these people showing up. And of course, the insurance companies will be breathing down our necks, demanding more details than we can possibly provide. I hate days like this. What if things get even worse than expected?
