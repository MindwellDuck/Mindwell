The radio's static filled silence seemed louder than usual, as if holding its breath with him. He knew every house had its own story, but this one felt different. It was too still, too empty. His hand trembled slightly as he reached for the handle, the cold metal a stark contrast to his sweaty palm. He could feel it in his gut, that dreadful, familiar feeling of fear that never quite left him after the incident last year. But today was just another call, he told himself, trying to steady his breathing. Just another house.",

Shouldn't he have known better than to hesitate at the door? He took a deep breath, telling himself he wasn't overreacting, that it was just nerves. He thought about all the times he'd walked into homes, never once having reason to worry. This time was different, though. This time, there was an unsettling silence. He checked his gun, making sure everything was secure. He had no business being here, but he couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong. He took another deep breath, preparing himself for what might happen next. Shouldn't he be ready for anything?"

The once vibrant colors had faded like their love, leaving behind a muted echo of happier times. His reflection in the glass was gaunt, dark circles etched deeply beneath his eyes. He hadn't noticed how much weight he'd lost until he tried to cinch his apron tighter around his wasting waist. The kitchen timer buzzed, piercing the silent apartment. It was just another solitary dinner for one, but tonight, it felt like a funeral dirge, echoing the emptiness within him. He turned off the stove, leaving the untouched food to cool in its pot.",

The couple in the photo were laughing together, carefree, but that was all so long ago. Now, the picture felt more like an obligation than a cherished memory. It sat there, reminding him of something he’d rather forget. There wasn’t anything special about this moment; it was just a snapshot from their past. The fact that they were smiling together meant nothing; it didn’t change anything. They weren’t even together anymore, and this photo didn’t make it feel any better."

It was a sound that seemed to come from nowhere, like a wave crashing against the shore. Some people might have found it funny, but to him, it was just another reminder of how much pain these men had caused. They were trying to make light of things, to distract themselves from the reality of what they had done. But he wasn't buying it. He knew exactly what they were doing - trying to erase their past so they wouldn't be held accountable for their actions. And he was determined to stop them."

No, that would be far too simplistic. He simply felt like he had become a target for other people’s mistakes. They had all fallen under his guidance at some point, and now they were paying the price for their own failures. It wasn’t fair, really. But what did he expect? People never listened when given advice, especially when it came from someone as experienced as himself. So why should he be surprised? It wasn’t entirely his fault, of course. He had done everything right – prepared, trained, led by example. What more could one ask from a commander? And yet here we are, surrounded by the remnants of a war long won, but its lessons still very much alive. We fought for freedom, for justice, and for peace. Yet it seemed that none of these ideals mattered anymore. Instead, we’re left with the same petty squabbles and power struggles that plagued our ancestors. It’s almost as if the world has forgotten the true meaning of what we stand for. But I’m not pointing fingers here. Oh no, I am merely observing the situation objectively. After all, I have always been known for my level-headedness and thoughtful approach. My superiors respect me for my ability to analyze complex situations and provide sound advice. Why wouldn’t they follow my lead? Wouldn’t"

As he cooked, his eyes welled up, not from the onions this time, but from the memory of how she'd loved watching him create her meals.

Every time he makes it, he's reminded of her—of how much she loved watching him prepare it, how happy she'd always seem when he surprised her with a fresh batch. But today, something felt different. Maybe it was just the way the sunlight streamed into the kitchen, casting long shadows that made the room feel emptier than usual. Or perhaps it was the sound of the blender, which sounded eerily similar to the hum of the vacuum cleaner she used to push around the house with such care. It wasn’t until he saw the recipe book open to the page again that the real pain hit. She had loved that book almost as much as she loved her cooking, and he remembered how often they’d spent hours together, flipping through its pages, sharing stories and memories. That moment was like a knife cutting through the air, leaving nothing but a hollow echo in its wake. Now, as he stood there, surrounded by the familiar sights of the kitchen, he realized that some things were meant to stay buried, even if they still lingered in the back of his mind like a ghostly presence."
