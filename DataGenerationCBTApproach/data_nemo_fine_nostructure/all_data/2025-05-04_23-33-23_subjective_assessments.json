The story was a mess, the sources conflicting, and she had until tomorrow morning to make sense of it all. As she massaged her temples, she felt her husband's gaze from across the room, his eyes filled with concern. He knew better than to ask if she was okay; they both knew the answer.",

She felt a heat rise within her, a familiar rage bubbling up from the depths of her soul. She crumpled the letter, threw it across the room, and shouted, \"I've given 40 years to that damned hospital!

It wasn't just the lack of social interaction that bothered him; it seemed like every time he opened his laptop or picked up a book, he found himself longing for something more meaningful than the mundane tasks he faced each day. His mind wandered back to the dinner party he had heard about earlier in the week, where a group of friends had gathered around a table laden with delicious food, laughing and sharing stories late into the night. Even though he knew these events were rare and reserved for special occasions, the thought still stung. Why did everyone else get to experience these moments of joy, leaving him to spend yet another lonely evening? The pain of being overlooked felt like a heavy weight, pressing down on him as he tried to shake off the feelings of inadequacy. He realized that his frustration stemmed from comparing himself unfavorably to those who seemed to have more fulfilling lives. Every night, he felt like he was missing out on what others took for granted - the warmth of friendship, the satisfaction of shared experiences, and the simple pleasure of enjoying good company.

His strictness around food could just be an extension of that general lack of responsibility.

Maybe he wasn't worried about being caught. Maybe he just liked the way she looked in her white shirt, just like I did when she wore mine. *He probably doesn't care that she cheated on him as much as I do.* When Alex wrote \"found your herbs\" on my list, I felt a surge of anger. *It had to be an accident; he wouldn't actually cheat on me.* But then I thought, **If he's willing to cheat, why not just admit it?** So, I took a deep breath and called him into the office. \"You know what?\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \"I think we need to talk.\" \"Talk about what?\" he asked, looking concerned. \"I'm going to tell you something,\" I began, trying to choose words carefully. \"You're very good at your job.

For a moment, he let himself imagine how easy it must be for them—a life filled with laughter, spontaneity, and shared adventures, all while leaving him to deal with the aftermath.

His words, though laced with sadness, had been full of love, just like hers had always been.

But now, sitting alone in the empty cafeteria, it seemed so distant, like it belonged to someone else’s life."
