The newspaper she'd been clutching crumples in her fist as she strides towards him, seated at his laptop. \"You knew,\" she growls, thrusting the paper in his face. \"You fucking knew about the story and you didn't tell me.\" His eyes meet hers, apologetic, but it only fuels her anger. She feels the heat rising in her cheeks, her breath coming in short gasps. \"How could you? After all these years...\" Her voice trails off, choking on the betrayal she feels coursing through her veins like wildfire.",

I trusted you completely.” The words feel hollow, like they’re just a reminder that he’s broken her trust forever. He can see the pain in her eyes, and he knows he has to explain why he kept this secret from her. He takes a deep breath, trying to find the right words. “I was going to tell you, I swear. But...” “Don’t lie to me,” she cuts him off, her voice shaking with anger. “How could you betray my trust like this?” He tries to think back to when he first found out about the scandal. It had happened so fast – one minute he was reading news online, the next he was scrolling through social media posts about the politician involved. It felt surreal, like watching a movie where the ending is different than what he expected. He thought he’d finally seen the last of the scandal after the politician resigned, but then another story broke, followed by another, each one revealing more about the scandal. It wasn’t until months later that he realized how deeply connected everything was. He tries to focus on the present moment, but his mind keeps wandering back to the past. He remembers the day she asked him if he’d heard anything about the scandal, her expression hopeful. He’d wanted to reassure her, to tell her everything would be okay, but he couldn’t bring himself to lie. He didn’t know how to say"

Maybe he’s just not thinking about it right now? If he is, he wouldn’t have forgotten something like that, would he? He's such an emotional guy; I can tell he's really upset by this. We all feel the same way when we lose something precious, don't we? This isn't surprising at all. It just goes to show how much he cares about her. I'm glad I don't have to deal with that kind of pain anymore. I wouldn't be able to handle it. Besides, what's the point in dwelling over the past? Let’s focus on moving forward. The memories will always be there, but it doesn’t change anything if we keep looking back. Life keeps going, after all. I think it’s better if he just leaves it alone. I can see why he might want to hold onto those feelings, but it won't bring her back. If he lets go of the past, maybe he’ll start healing faster. Sometimes you need to move on for your own good. I wish he could understand that. Now, let’s just hope he gets some rest and stops torturing himself over this.

She must have misspoken—she often did that when stressed. If so, would it be fair to assume she still saw potential in him? But then again, why would she say such a thing unless...unless she felt the same way? The possibility made his heart race. Could it be true? Was she hinting at a deeper connection? It wouldn't make sense otherwise, but what if she genuinely believed that about him? He tried to shake off the thought, telling himself it was ridiculous. Yet, the image persisted, haunting him like a ghost. Perhaps it was better to let things unfold naturally, giving her space. That way, whatever happened would happen organically, allowing them to see where their feelings truly lay. But what if she didn’t feel anything? Would that mean he’d failed once again? Still, the idea refused to leave his mind, even after hours of trying. It lingered, refusing to budge, like a stubborn itch he couldn’t scratch.

He hasn't picked up a brush in months, but I'm sure he'll get back to work eventually. After all, he's always had such great ideas when we were together. Now, they're just dust on paper. He doesn't have the drive anymore, and she didn't either. She never did, really. We were both too busy being miserable together. I've tried to help him find inspiration again, but he's stubborn, refusing to see the beauty in anyone else's art. Even our daughter thinks he's forgotten how to paint. Maybe he has, but who cares? The truth is, he's no longer an artist. He's just another broken man, like so many others. I don't even know why I bother trying to lift him up anymore. He's just going to keep falling further behind. I'm tired of holding things together, but at least I still have my passion—my own creative pursuits. At least those are still going strong."
