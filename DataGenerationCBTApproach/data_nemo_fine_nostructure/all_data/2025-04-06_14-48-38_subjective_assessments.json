The room was dimly lit, the only sound the ticking of the old clock she'd bought at a flea market with him. Her eyes flickered to their wedding photo tucked behind an easel, now collecting dust. A sudden gust of wind blew through the open window, scattering paint chips across the floor. She sighed, bending down to collect them, each one a reminder of time wasted and love lost.",

Now, she saw it differently - as if he didn’t care enough to put it back, as if our lives were falling apart before her eyes. She couldn’t help but wonder if he ever thought about her, if he even remembered to look at her sometimes. Maybe he forgot I exist, just like he did with me when we were young. His family came first now; they always had. They’d been so happy together once, laughing and sharing stories, but those moments felt like they belonged in another life. Even the little things seemed different now. The way he smiled, the laughter, the jokes— everything felt forced, like he was going through motions. She imagined him sitting at the kitchen table, staring blankly at the TV, avoiding eye contact. No one else could understand how hard it was to live like this, no one to share the pain. Her heart ached, feeling trapped between memories and loneliness. She wondered if anyone still loved her, or if she was just another forgotten piece in the puzzle of their broken lives.
