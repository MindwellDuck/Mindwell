Inside, laughter echoes, a warmth that feels foreign in her empty home. Her husband had mentioned he'd be working late again tonight. Another late night with the 'team dinner' they've been having weekly. She sighs, her fingers tightening around her lab coat pocket where she keeps his birthday present, still unopened after two months.",

Would they invite her? Maybe they could use another pair of hands for the meal. The thought stirs an unfamiliar longing within her. She imagines herself sitting at their table, sharing stories, feeling included. It feels almost... nice. But then, guilt creeps in. What if her presence disrupts their evening? Does she really want to intrude? # Output [Example Response](https://example.com/response) # Example Response Link ## Step-by-Step Instructions 1. Read the Triggering Event. 2. Generate a subjective reaction reflecting the cognitive distortion 'What if?' based on this event. 3. Ensure your response does not explicitly state the distortion but rather captures the subtle, underlying focus on negative outcomes. 4. Keep the response concise, ideally under 200 words. 5. Remove any extraneous text beyond the example response. 6. Provide a link to the response (as shown above) so that readers can easily access the full output. ## Note: This task requires you to generate a response that reflects the described cognitive distortion (\"What if?\") without directly mentioning or labeling it. Your aim is to capture the essence of the distortion through the character's thoughts, feelings, and reactions. This means making the reader understand how the character is focusing on potential negative outcomes (\"what if\"), which"

As she ran her thumb over the rough edge, a sob escaped her, echoing through the empty kitchen.

It wasn't until her phone buzzed that she realized how much time had passed. Her best friend was waiting outside, holding a bouquet of flowers and trying to keep up with her pace. \"You're doing great,\" she said firmly, nudging her toward the door. \"We can talk more later.\" She took a deep breath and let the flowers go by, focusing instead on the small gestures that reminded her of him. A book she'd read together, a photo taken during a family vacation, even a new coffee shop they used to visit now held sentimental value. Each item served as a reminder of happier times, but none could fill the void left by his passing."

Maybe I wouldn't have felt so lost after moving away. What if my life had turned out differently? I couldn't shake off the thought of how much my life could have changed if my parents were together. Would I have grown up knowing him better? Would we have shared moments like this? If only things had worked out between them, maybe our lives would have been so different. The letter left me with more questions than answers. I kept thinking about what would happen if my parents were together. How would it change everything? My entire perspective shifted as I imagined the possibilities. Even though I know it’s impossible now, I can’t help but think about the potential outcomes."

Every time he thought he understood what was happening, another piece of information came along to shift his perspective. Now, as he sat alone in his room, surrounded by the remnants of a lesson he hadn’t taught—empty chalkboards, textbooks open to random pages—the uncertainty lingered, refusing to settle into a clear understanding."

His eyes well up as he remembers the last time they worked together, when a suspect escaped due to their failure to secure the scene properly. He had taken the blame, but the guilt still haunts him.

The way he looked at me made me wonder if he knows something about our relationship. Is there something going on between us that he wants to keep private? Does he think we’re having problems? Or is he worried about being overheard? I hope he doesn’t get the wrong idea about what happened here. Maybe I’m reading too much into this. It could just be an honest mistake or a bad day.
