They probably didn't even know how much work went into creating that dish. No, it wasn't fair; it was a travesty. I'll admit, when the chef praised me, it felt hollow. The way he spoke about my dishes seemed almost... rehearsed. Almost like he was reciting lines from a script rather than genuinely appreciating my efforts. I've always known I'm a bit older than most in the industry, but hearing it now, it really hit home. I guess I just need to accept that sometimes you can't compete with youth. It's just the way things are now. I'd been looking forward to tonight's service for weeks, but now it all feels pointless. I might as well just leave the kitchen tomorrow. It's not like anyone will notice anyway. This whole thing is rigged against me. I should have stayed retired. It's funny how everyone fawns over this young upstart, touting them as the next big thing. Meanwhile, I've built an empire here, one dish at a time. But no one ever stops to appreciate what I've achieved. They're too busy praising the new face around here. I used"

Every passing moment seemed to stretch out like hours, and the silence between her and her partner grew thicker than honey. It was as if time itself had slowed down, leaving her trapped in this endless loop of fear and uncertainty. Each beat of her heart echoed through her chest, making every second feel like an eternity. She tried calling his name again, hoping against hope that he would finally respond, but the only sound was the echo of her own voice back at her. Panic set in once more, fueled by the same overwhelming urge to believe the worst, no matter how irrational it might seem. Her thoughts were spiraling down a dark path where every possibility led to disaster, and she couldn’t escape the grip of her racing imagination. With each tick of the clock, her fear intensified, until it felt like the entire world was holding its breath in anticipation of what might happen next. And then, just when it seemed like things couldn’t get any worse, I realized... He wasn’t dead. His phone rang, and he answered with a groggy voice, \"What's up?\" Relief washed over me like a wave crashing onto the shore, followed closely by embarrassment for letting my imagination run wild.

I can't believe she would ask me to celebrate with her after everything we went through together. I know that this wedding is just about her and her new husband; it doesn't mean anything else, so why am I wasting my time here? I'm not going to enjoy myself at all. This whole thing is just too painful. I don't understand why she would invite me if she knows how much it hurts me. I don't see her as someone who cares about me anymore. I think she did it out of pity or guilt. I've tried talking to her about this, but she won't listen. I hate attending family gatherings now. Why am I even here? I don't care about the party or the food; I'm only here because I'm obligated to be polite. My presence is annoying her, and I can tell she doesn't want me around. I don't want to go back home either; I'll just stay in the hotel room. It's better that way. If I had known about the wedding before, I wouldn't have agreed to meet up with her.

I tell myself this is for my own good, that it won’t hurt me if I say hello, but deep down, I fear rejection. What if he looks away? Or worse, what if he doesn’t remember me?

He wondered if his brother ever got to experience all the summers he’d dreamed of, all the late nights spent playing guitar, all the first loves and heartbreaks. Would he have graduated college, gotten married, built a life? Or would he be here, sitting in this chair, teaching these very lessons? As he looked at the picture again, he felt a pang in his chest. What if he hadn’t been driving that day? What if the road hadn’t been slick with rain? What if the car hadn’t swerved into their path?

Would they have met people who loved them, who made them feel whole? Would they have traveled to distant lands, experiencing cultures and foods he couldn’t even imagine? Would they have learned to play music together, singing songs that filled the halls of their childhood? Would they have laughed until their sides hurt, sharing secrets and dreams? He"
