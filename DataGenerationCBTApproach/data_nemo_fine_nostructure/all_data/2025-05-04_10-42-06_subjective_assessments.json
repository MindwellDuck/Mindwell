This has to be really tough for her, especially with everything else she's been through lately. I can imagine how painful this must be - I feel like I would be in her shoes right now, just trying to process everything. It's clear that she feels guilty about not having responded sooner; I wonder if there's some regret she might be feeling because she thinks about what could've been if they'd communicated better. This situation is probably really difficult for her, but I'm glad we get to see how things play out in the end. I'm curious to see how this unfolds and whether she'll finally find closure."

There were no threats, no signs of danger, just the echo of his own paranoia. And yet, the fear lingered, refusing to dissipate. It's as if he's been conditioned to believe that the worst-case scenario is always true. Every creak, every sigh, every drop of water seemed ominous, each shadow a potential threat. The realization that he'd overreacted didn't ease the discomfort; instead, it fueled his anxiety. Now, as he stands there, surrounded by the silence of an empty restaurant, he wonders what would have happened had he truly believed there was nothing wrong."

Doesn't everyone know that sending back your hard work is just plain disrespectful? He couldn't help but feel that the whole situation was a personal attack against him. Even the waitress had looked at him with an expression that suggested she didn't care about his feelings. When the manager came over and apologized, saying \"I'm sorry for any inconvenience,\" he felt a sense of relief, but deep down, he still believed that the restaurant was acting unfairly. \"I don’t understand why you guys keep doing this,” he said to himself, trying to make sense of what had happened. “You should have taken pride in serving customers who appreciate all your hard work.” But even when he heard the words, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he had been wronged. He started thinking about how he might have made a mistake by adding too much spice, and how maybe if he hadn't done that, the dish wouldn't have gotten returned. But then again, he remembered ordering the same dish months ago, and it had turned out perfectly. How could he have messed up now? Maybe"

I have to get out, leave this toxic environment behind. But then there’s everything else—work, bills, responsibilities. Can I really afford to walk away? No, I shouldn’t even think about it. What would I do? There are no jobs waiting for me outside these walls, no safety net. I’d be better off staying, trying to make peace with the past, finding some semblance of normalcy. But what's the point? Life doesn’t reward perseverance; it rewards those who give up easily. Maybe I’ll just wait until the next accident, until something more catastrophic happens, and then I'll know it's time. Then I can finally let go. Maybe the universe will send a sign, something to push me toward action. Until then, I'm trapped, stuck in this limbo, unable to move forward or backward. All I need is one spark—a single mistake—and I'll be free. But how long will I tolerate this torture?"

And yet, when he opened his wallet to check the date, he couldn't help but wonder if she even knew about it. Was she still holding onto him, or had she finally let go? His mind began to spiral as he walked home through the rain-soaked streets. The thought of her must have kept her from leaving, or maybe it was just another reminder she didn’t want to forget. He wondered if she ever thought about him, if she missed him as much as he missed her. Maybe she was using that photo to hold onto hope, keeping it close so she wouldn't lose touch with the life they built together. But he knew better than to get too caught up in those thoughts—it was all just speculation, fantasies, and what-ifs. Still, he felt the need to keep checking the date, hoping against hope that somehow, someway, she might still be with him. What's going on here?

She longs for the simplicity of those days, when life was easier to grasp, but now it slips through her fingers like sand in the wind."
