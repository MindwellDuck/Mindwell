I can see why you're upset, but you need to understand that she doesn't know what it means to me. It's like someone taking your child and raising them in a completely different environment - it would feel like they hate you. This isn't just about the roses; it's about respecting our family's history. You have no idea how much effort went into those plants. It feels like she's disrespecting everything we built together. She needs to learn about respect before she starts doing things like this. I'm not going to let her just waltz in here and start destroying something so precious to me. You can't just go around taking things that don't belong to you. If she thinks she can just come in here and do whatever she wants, she'll end up hurting more people than herself. She has no idea what she's getting herself into. I wouldn't want anyone to do this to me. I think she needs some time to realize what she's done. We're going to report her, and make sure she understands the gravity of her actions."

A sudden memory of her laughter at a joke only they understood overwhelmed him, and remorse crashed into him like a wave, drowning out the taste of the candy. He'd been so preoccupied with managing others' pain at work that he'd neglected hers. He'd missed signs, overlooked her complaints. The candy fell from his hand as he buried his face in them, wishing for a chance to hold her one more time, to tell her he was sorry.",

It had been two weeks since they all decided to retire, leaving her with an unsettling silence. I'm just glad no one is coming back; there's nothing here for them anymore. This chair used to hold so much energy—our late-night discussions about life and everything under the sun. Now, it feels hollow, like it's waiting for someone else to occupy it. But honestly, who would want to come back? They're probably having fun with their grandkids, traveling, or simply enjoying their retirement without the stress of work. I don't blame them; I wouldn't want to go back either. Life has moved on, and we've found our new purpose in retirement. I think about how I miss them, though. We shared more than just office stories; we formed bonds over years of working together. When they called to say they'd be retiring, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. Why did this have to happen? Did they really need to leave? Can't they see how much I miss them? It's okay; they deserve their rest. Who needs colleagues when you can spend time with your loved ones? I'll find a way to move forward, even if it means finding a new hobby or joining a club. There are plenty of things to keep me busy, right? Maybe"
