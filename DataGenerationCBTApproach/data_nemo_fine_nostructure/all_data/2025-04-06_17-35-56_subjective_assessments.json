Her heart pounding in her chest like a kick drum at a rock concert, she reached for her phone, fingers trembling as she dialed 911 with the volume turned low. The house was eerily quiet, save for the ticking of the grandfather clock, each tick echoing like thunder in her ears. She clutched her late husband's robe around herself tightly, feeling his absence more acutely than ever. Every shadow seemed to move and every creak made her jump. She sat there, alone in the dark, fear gripping her like a vice as she waited for what felt like an eternity for the police to arrive.",

His death had left a gaping hole in her life, one that could never be filled by anyone else. As she lay there, she couldn't help but wonder if he was trying to tell her something through those strange noises. It wasn't just the creaks; the way the wind rustled through the trees outside seemed almost... deliberate, as if it too sensed her unease. She closed her eyes, letting her mind wander back to the day he'd died, when he'd whispered \"don't worry\" before slipping into eternal silence."

I guess it makes sense; after all, I did forget to pick up milk, didn’t I? Or maybe it's because I don't make enough money for us to have a nice dinner together. If I had a better-paying job, he'd probably be happy again. But no, instead, here we are, with nothing but leftovers and an empty house. And what’s worse, I think he might be leaving. Is he going to leave me? Did I really do something wrong? This isn’t fair. Everything always goes wrong when I try. Even the simplest things seem to turn into problems. Like that time I forgot to buy bread, and he ended up eating cereal for breakfast. And then there were the times I cooked dinner too slowly, and he complained about how hungry he was. Maybe he just wants someone who can cook faster. Or maybe he thinks I’m not good enough. That would explain why he never talks about his day at work. He must be thinking I'm not worth talking to. Or maybe he’s just tired of cooking himself. After all, I can barely manage to keep our meals simple. I wonder if he ever wishes I’d just go back to school and learn a new"

While others complained about the workload, she didn’t have that luxury. At home, her husband worked two jobs, barely scraping by, but she kept going, making sacrifices no one else could imagine. The guilt of leaving her children alone was crushing, yet she pushed forward, refusing to let them suffer because of her own choices. She felt like a failure when her son asked why he never saw her during school events, or when her daughter complained about being stuck at home while other kids played together. It wasn't fair; she gave up so much, sacrificing her happiness for others, all to provide a better life. Why did she feel like a bad mother? Wasn't she doing everything right? Her thoughts swirled as she sat next to the patient, her hand hovering over the monitor. She tried to focus on the task ahead, but memories flooded back: the first time she lost a patient, the second, the third, each one etched into her mind like scars. How many times had she felt like this, worried, exhausted, consumed by grief? And then there was the latest loss, the one that shook her to her core. A patient she'd known since childhood—her best friend—had died suddenly"

He felt a familiar pang in his chest, a hollow ache that seemed to grow with each passing day.\n\nAs he pushed the food around his plate, he caught sight of the framed photo on the mantel - their wedding picture. They both looked so young, so full of life and promise. A bitter smile tugged at his lips as he wondered where that couple had gone, replaced by this lonely old man sitting in the dark, waiting for someone to share his dinner with.\n\nJust then, the front door opened, spilling light into the dim room.
