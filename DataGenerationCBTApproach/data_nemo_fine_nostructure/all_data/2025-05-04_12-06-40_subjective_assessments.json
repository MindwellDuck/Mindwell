The silence was deafening; no clatter of pots from her kitchen, no hum of her favorite jazz records. His cane tapped a lonely rhythm on the empty hallway.

Her absence wasn't just a loss; it was a reminder that life can shatter you with one careless move. I couldn't shake off the feeling that every moment we shared is now nothing more than dust in the wind. She’s gone, and with her, all our dreams. It feels like I’m drowning in a sea of memories, each one a bittersweet reminder of what we had and what we lost. The pain cuts deeper with every passing day, leaving me with this hollow ache that refuses to let go. Every corner of the house reminds me of her—every room, every memory, every smile, every laugh. But they're all just echoes now, haunting me with what could never be again. Even the sunlight outside seems to mock me, its warmth a cruel joke when I think of how she once used to light up my days with her laughter. Now, it only serves as a painful reminder of her absence, a constant reminder that I'm left here alone, fighting against the tide of grief. Each day feels like another chapter in a novel I don’t want to read anymore. Life has become a blur of sadness, with every moment stretching out before me like a canvas"

She couldn't help but wonder if he'd changed. Maybe he didn't love her anymore. She remembered how he used to be so loving and attentive; maybe he'd just gotten tired of her. It wasn't fair; she tried hard enough, but nothing seemed to bring him closer again. What if he was having affairs? She imagined him with another woman, laughing together, sharing secrets. She pictured them holding hands, enjoying a romantic evening, completely forgetting about her. Why did she even bother staying in this miserable place? They never talked about anything important anyway. It felt like he barely heard her when she spoke, always distracted by his phone or whatever else he’d rather focus on. He never really listened to her, and she didn’t know what to expect from him anymore. Maybe he didn’t care about her anymore either. She wished she could turn back time, make him remember how much she loved him, but every moment passed without him coming home.
