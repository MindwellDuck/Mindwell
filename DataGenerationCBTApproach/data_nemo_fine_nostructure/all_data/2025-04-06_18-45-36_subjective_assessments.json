His partner had stepped out for coffee, leaving him to the quiet hum of the patrol car's engine. He pulls out his old, worn wallet from his pocket and flips it open to reveal a faded picture of them - her smiling, him laughing, on their first camping trip together before life became shifts and silence. The radio crackles with static, no words, just white noise echoing his emptiness. He feels the familiar tug of sadness, a dull ache behind his eyes that's become all too familiar since she passed.",

She'd probably have some witty remark about how they're both stuck in traffic again or something ridiculous like that. But instead, he's left to deal with the reality of being alone, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that he's somehow responsible for everything going wrong. It's almost as if he needs to make things right by blaming her for leaving him like this."

She picks up a small, handwritten note from the counter - \"We're sorry for your loss.\" It's been six months since John passed, but the words still sting like they were written yesterday. She crumples it into her pocket, feeling the familiar weight of hopelessness settle in her chest as she turns off the lights alone.",

Maybe if she focuses hard enough, she can turn back the clock and make him stay. But deep down, she knows that’s impossible. He was already gone when she woke up that morning. This is just her mind playing tricks on her, trying to keep her close to reality. She takes a few deep breaths, letting go of the need to control what happened. After all, life doesn’t work that way. She looks around at the empty shelves, remembering how he used to help her stock up before his passing. Now, everything feels like a reminder of her failure – the stack of unpaid bills, the pile of unopened letters, the silence where once there was laughter. She tries to shake off the sadness, telling herself it’s not fair to dwell on the past. But as she walks out into the bright sunlight, the warmth hits her like a slap in the face. What does it matter? The sun will rise tomorrow anyway, and so will the bills, the letters, and the emptiness inside her. The thought stings, but she pushes it aside, focusing instead on the tasks ahead. She’ll get through this, one step at a time. She has to.

I remember how great it felt when we'd have those little moments together, just us. He used to make these incredible homemade pizzas, with toppings I never even knew existed. He'd put his heart into every single one. It was like he could taste the joy in them, and he'd share that with me, making our evenings together unforgettable. Those were some of my happiest memories – and yet, here I am, feeling like I've lost him forever. He always made time for me, no matter what. He'd stop everything to help me with my projects, and then laugh about it later. He was more than a partner; he was my rock, my best friend. When we first met, I didn't know if I could trust someone as kind-hearted and genuine as him. But he quickly became my closest confidant, always listening, always supporting me through thick and thin. Now, I feel like I'll never be able to forgive myself for leaving him. When he passed away, I couldn't bear to live without him. I kept everything exactly as he had left it – his favorite chair, his guitar, the way the sunlight streamed through the window onto the floor. Everything reminded me of him, but nothing truly brought him back. Yet,"
