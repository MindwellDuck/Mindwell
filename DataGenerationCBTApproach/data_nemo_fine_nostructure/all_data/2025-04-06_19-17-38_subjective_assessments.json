This sudden fear made her wonder if maybe they were thinking about her right now too, worried sick about her safety. But what if it wasn’t them? What if this was some other kind of trouble waiting to happen? Maybe there was something wrong with the pipes, or an animal in the walls, making the noises sound like footsteps. She tried to shake off these thoughts, telling herself it was just her imagination playing tricks on her again. Still, the feeling lingered, refusing to let go."

This isn't the first time he’s felt undervalued. Last year, when he was still a student, he got rejected multiple times by internships, leading him to drop out of college. Now, he's struggling to find meaningful work, and his frustration boils over into anger. Is it worth continuing down this road? If only he had studied something else, like engineering or IT, would things be easier now? He'd probably be making six figures by now, but no, he chose journalism, which seems to offer little reward. What if he had chosen a safer route? He wonders if there are other paths available to him. Perhaps he should consider a side hustle, like freelancing or starting a blog. That way, he wouldn’t have to rely solely on his main job. It might help him gain experience and build a portfolio, increasing his chances for future interviews. But then again,"
