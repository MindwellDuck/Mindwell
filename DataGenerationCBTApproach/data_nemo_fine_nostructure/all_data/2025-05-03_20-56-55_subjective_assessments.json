Alone in the crowd, she felt his absence more sharply than ever.",

It seemed like no matter what she did, he would always find fault in her behavior. Even tonight, when he was supposed to be happy to see her, he barely acknowledged her presence. He didn't even try to make small talk like he used to. Instead, he just handed her her drink and turned back to work. This time, it wasn't just a bad day; it was clear that things had changed between us. I realized that maybe our relationship was never meant to last. It's better if we part ways now rather than dragging out something that's already beyond repair."

It wasn't just that she had left; it was the fact that she hadn’t tried to explain herself before leaving. The question kept echoing in my mind: What if there was something wrong with me? What if this was all about how I acted? What if we were meant to be apart? My brain started racing—what if I had done something wrong? What if I was too much for her? Was it because of the way I spoke up against her family? Or maybe it was how I handled our argument. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that I had somehow failed her. There must have been more to it than what she said in the note. This is not an answer, but rather a reflection on how one might react to such a situation based on their personal beliefs and fears, without directly acknowledging their own biases. The goal here is to show the subtle influence of the 'What If?' type of thought process which can lead to anxiety and obsessive thinking patterns. I hope this helps you understand how the distorted thinking pattern works. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you! - [Ruthie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ruthie) P.S. This is actually a great exercise in self-reflection and awareness. Just take your time, read through it carefully, and ask yourself questions."

A crumpled note caught her eye - a heartfelt thank-you from little Emma. She picked it up, smoothing out the creases, and felt a pang in her chest. Not for the kindness, but for the reminder of what she didn't have at home: warmth, gratitude, a family to share her day with. As she folded the note away, she caught sight of herself in the window's reflection - lines etched around her eyes, hair touched by silver threads. She looked tired, alone.

A chance to make a difference, to show kids that life isn’t always about grades or tests. But now, standing there, surrounded by the silence, it feels hollow. All those times I told myself I needed to be better, to give more—why didn’t I take action? Why did I wait so long? This is supposed to be about giving back, not taking from myself. But as I look at Emma, smiling quietly at her desk, I feel a sense of emptiness. I thought I was doing the right thing, but maybe I was just pretending to care. Maybe I’m just like everyone else, too busy to notice the real impact until it hits me. Shouldn’t I be doing more? Shouldn’t I be helping them more? Shouldn’t I be showing them that life matters? What if I'm just like everyone else, too busy to notice the real impact until it hits me? What if I'm just pretending to care? What if I've been lying to myself all along? Maybe I don't deserve this.

Why did they have to leave him alone? Why didn't they try harder? It wasn’t fair. I feel so guilty for leaving him behind—like I caused it somehow. I wish we had stayed together, but no, he had to go and get himself killed. Now I’m stuck with nothing but these memories. If only he were here, things would be different. We could have fixed everything. But now he’s gone, and I’m left to face this nightmare alone. Everything feels pointless. I should have been stronger, supported him better, kept him safe.
