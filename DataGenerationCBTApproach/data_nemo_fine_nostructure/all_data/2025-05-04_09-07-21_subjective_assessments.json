She forces herself to breathe deeply, trying to shake off the feeling that everything is spiraling out of control. # Example Output (excluding the prompt and additional comments) This post is about how I feel when my husband had an argument with me. He said that he was going to leave if we don't work on our relationship. I felt sad because I really love him. So I went to see a therapist who specializes in couples therapy. We talked for hours about what happened between us. After talking, I realized that I did some things that made him upset and apologized for those mistakes. My husband accepted my apology and promised that he would give me more space to think before saying anything else. I felt relieved that we were able to talk things through and agreed to meet again next week to continue working on our issues. # Cognitive Distortion: **Cognitive Dissonance** **Personalization** **Emotional Contagion** **"

I was always the first to volunteer, the last to leave, and I never complained about long hours. Now, someone else gets the promotion? It doesn't feel fair. This must be some kind of joke, but why would my boss play such a cruel prank? He looked at his wife, who was sitting across from him, sipping her coffee. Her expression didn't change, and she just kept reading her book. She never said anything, even when he asked her if she had anything to do with it. But why wouldn’t she? Doesn't she know how much I sacrificed for our family? Did she think all my efforts were meaningless? Maybe she’s plotting against me behind my back. He felt like he'd been punched in the gut. The news spread quickly around the office, and everyone seemed to be talking about it. They weren’t asking him about it either; they just assumed he knew what was going on. Even the usually friendly HR representative gave him the cold shoulder, saying nothing whenever he tried to ask questions. He couldn’t shake off the feeling of betrayal. Everyone keeps telling me to focus on my work, but now it feels like no one cares about me anymore.

The ring on the counter seemed like a cruel reminder of everything he missed, making him feel like an outsider among happy couples celebrating their anniversaries. He began to question whether he was even worth remembering, especially when he saw other people's posts on social media about their perfect days, filled with laughter and love. Every time he checked, there were more reminders of what he lacked—a life where every day felt special, not just some random date. Now, instead of focusing on their relationship, he found himself wondering why no one shared stories of their own struggles. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their relationships, while he was stuck in this rut, feeling like he was losing the chance to experience real connection.

He searched for a glimmer of hope, but it was nowhere to be found. Instead, the emptiness stared back, a harsh reminder that even in the most intimate spaces, isolation can find a way. The photo of him and his wife, taken on their last vacation, now served as a painful reminder of what could never be again. Her smile seemed to whisper a cruel truth: that happiness is a luxury reserved for those who have never known sorrow. In this home, once filled with warmth, now coldness reigned supreme. Each room held secrets, echoes of moments shared and memories left behind. Yet, amidst these relics of a past life, he couldn't help but feel like a stranger.
