My mind keeps racing, jumping between thoughts that I'm going to lose everything I've ever known - my wife, my home, my family. But then, in those brief moments of clarity, I see her smile, and I know I have no choice but to keep going. To hold on to what little we have left. I want to be strong, but I feel like I'm drowning in grief. Every decision feels like a monumental task. I just wish things could go back to how they were before. I don't understand why this had to happen to us. We were happy, weren't we? She seemed so peaceful just a few hours ago. Now...now, I don't even recognize her. It's like she's been erased from my world, leaving nothing but emptiness behind. And yet, in those same moments, I'm still holding on to hope. Maybe someday I'll find a way to heal. Or maybe I won't. Either way, I'm trapped in this endless cycle of pain, unable to escape. Life is so unfair.

I'm tired of being the strong one, always putting everything on my shoulders while John takes breaks and plays video games. He says he'll get back to work soon, but I've heard it all before. We're going to have to sell the house eventually anyway, right? I hope things start looking up soon. Maybe if we can just get through these extra shifts, John will finally find something stable. But until then... I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this alone. It's hard to see him struggling like this, feeling like a failure because he can't even get an interview. What if he doesn't make it through? What if I lose everything? I need a break, but there's no time for that. Not when bills pile up and the bank keeps calling. This is why I hate working here.

He took a deep breath and began to think about what would happen if he did continue. Would she be upset? Or would she somehow understand the context? Maybe she'd even see it as a way to honor her memory—something more beautiful than life itself. But then again, what if she felt betrayed by his attempt to create something new? She might think he was trying to erase her from their home. His heart raced at the prospect. Shouldn't he just leave the mug untouched? After all, the last time he tried, she'd said he wasn't careful enough, and the paint had gotten everywhere. This time, though, he felt different. Maybe he could find a way to make her proud without making her sad. But what if...? If he painted over the smudge, would she feel like he was hiding her memory? Perhaps he was doing her a favor by covering it up, making room for something new, something that would bring them joy instead of pain.

They said I'd get more shifts this month than usual, but did anyone think about what would actually happen if it rained on a weekend?! Okay, maybe I’m being dramatic, but honestly, this feels like the same old nightmare repeating itself. If they really knew what was coming, wouldn’t they have warned me sooner?
