A notification popped up on her laptop - a request from her old friend, Sarah, for a loan. She hadn't spoken to Sarah in years, not since that falling out over something silly now.

She couldn’t help but wonder if Sarah was still bitter about being shut out. Maybe this time she could make amends, but would they even want to talk? It seemed unlikely after so long. Still, she thought back to those days when they were close friends, sharing laughter and secrets. How could one friendship turn into such an open wound? But what really got to her was the way her mind kept jumping to all the times she’d been too busy or just plain selfish. Hadn’t she always put herself first? And then there was that other incident, where she’d made a joke about Sarah’s relationship status. Was that why things ended? Or maybe it was just a stupid thing to say. Whatever it was, she knew she wasn’t perfect, and the thought of her mistakes weighing on Sarah made her feel worse. It wasn’t fair to expect forgiveness after so long. Yet, deep down, she hoped Sarah wouldn’t hold it against her. They’d been through too much together - shared dreams, hopes, and dreams. Now, as she looked around her cluttered room, filled with reminders of happier times, she realized how much she missed having someone like Sarah by her side. Still, no matter how hard she tried to shake off these thoughts, they persisted, like a shadow haunting her every step. Even the simple act of"

These little signs have become too many to ignore. He's always been a bit of a neat freak, so I guess it makes sense that he wouldn't forget where he put anything. But what really bothers me is how tidy everything looks. His dresser drawers are still organized, his books are still stacked neatly, and his room isn't messy at all. If he were truly gone, wouldn't there be some sign of chaos? Maybe some clothes scattered around or a mess under the bed? Instead, everything feels... perfect. Too perfect. This is exactly what happened with our marriage. We had our ups and downs, but we never fought about little things like this. Everything was always clean and tidy. He'd leave my favorite book lying next to his, and when I picked it up, he'd say, \"Oh, you're reading again!\" And then he'd sit down beside me, his hand brushing against mine, and I'd think, \"Maybe this is it. Maybe this is where it ends.\" But life had other plans. Now, he's gone, leaving me with nothing but these reminders that he was once here, holding me, smiling at me, and now, just"
