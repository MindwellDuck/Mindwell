He even said it was like I have a superpower when it comes to understanding others. Now, whenever I meet someone new, I feel like I need to be extra careful about how they perceive me. It's hard to balance being friendly and respectful while also keeping an eye out for potential issues. Sometimes I find myself overthinking what people might think of my behavior, which can lead to feelings of anxiety. I've noticed that if someone seems uncomfortable around me, I tend to notice it more than usual, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Maybe I just pick up on things better? Still, it makes me wonder if I'm too sensitive or if there's something deeper going on."

Now, all she had left were memories and a lingering hope that he would come back to her. But why did it feel like every other relationship seemed so much easier? They posted happy photos together, and couples laughed at their jokes. Meanwhile, she was stuck in this limbo, wondering if anyone else felt as lonely as she did. It wasn’t fair; everyone else had someone by their side. Why did life have to be so unfair? It didn’t help that she saw those posts, watched videos of them sharing meals, or heard about their trips. Every time, it made her feel like she was missing out. Everyone else had someone to share their experiences with, while she was here alone, trying to pick up the pieces of a broken heart. But then again, why did she even try? Maybe it was just futile to keep hoping, especially when it felt like everyone else had moved on, leaving her behind. She thought about how different her life was now compared to before. Gone were the late-night conversations, the silly jokes, and the way they’d"

Maybe if they were here, they'd realize how bad things are, just like she does. But no, they're oblivious to the reality of being single and unloved, instead choosing to celebrate their love.

John couldn’t help but wonder if Jake ever thought about what he’d lost, or if he just took pleasure in causing pain. As John sat there, surrounded by the remnants of something beautiful, he felt like a monster compared to Jake, who didn’t have to deal with the weight of grief. Even though he knew it wasn't fair, John couldn't shake the feeling that Jake was somehow better than him. He remembered how happy they were when they brought their kids to school, but now those memories seemed tainted by the pain of losing them. It was unfair, John thought, but he couldn't help comparing himself to Jake. That kid didn’t have to live with the guilt of killing the love of his life, yet he still managed to make John feel inferior. John wondered if anyone else saw Jake as a bully, or if he was truly the worst.
