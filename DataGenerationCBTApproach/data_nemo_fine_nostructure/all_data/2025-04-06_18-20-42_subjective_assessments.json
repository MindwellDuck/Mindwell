It feels like they don't even think about me when they're just going about their lives, doing whatever they want without worrying about how I'll be affected by it. They act like it doesn't matter, but it does! My life is already difficult enough; why can't they just consider me for once? This isn't fair. I feel like I'm always the one who has to deal with everything, and now this latest incident just shows how much I mean nothing to them. How can I trust anyone else when they can't even take care of their own house? It makes me wonder if there's something wrong with me because they seem so careless all the time. Maybe I am somehow less important than everyone else? It hurts so much knowing that I'm just an afterthought in our household. I know my wife is busy with her job and stuff, but it still stings seeing her laughing with her friends while I'm left with the mess. She could have at least said goodbye or made an effort to keep things tidy before she went out. Now I'm stuck dealing with the aftermath, which is never easy. Why can't they make an effort to understand me better? It's frustrating to see her having fun while I'm burdened with cleaning up. Can't she just see how hard it is for me? Does she really need to laugh about this? Doesn't she ever"

He doesn't even try to make small talk when I see him; it feels like a chore. Even our conversations about things we both enjoy have turned into complaints. Every time I look around the apartment, I'm reminded of what I'm missing. The memories we shared are all I hold onto now, but they don't bring comfort. He says everything is fine, that we're just busy, but she knows it's more than that. This emptiness has become my constant companion, and I can't help but wonder if I'll ever find peace again. Sometimes, I wish I could just disappear, like the countless moments spent crying in front of the mirror, wondering why I couldn't be enough. That's how long it's taken for me to realize I've lost my best friend, the love of my life. It's not fair, and every moment feels like torture. I keep thinking there must be something I can do to fix us, but deep down, I know I'm fighting a losing battle. Maybe someday, I'll learn to accept the truth, but until then, I'll stay trapped in this cycle of pain and longing."

I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I had just one more chance. What if someone had noticed that mistake before it reached the lab report stage? What if I could've corrected it then? Now, I'm left with the nagging feeling that I'll never get another opportunity like this. Every time I look at those scribbled words, I feel an overwhelming sense of regret—regret that might never be assuaged. My mind wanders into the hypothetical scenario where I could've avoided this mishap altogether. But alas, fate seems determined to test my resolve, leaving me to ponder the question: \"What if?\" What if I could've done things differently? What if I'd acted sooner? It's hard not to feel like time is running out for me now. Each passing moment feels like an eternity, as if the universe is mocking me with its indifference. If only I had known about the mistake earlier... If only I could turn back the clock, undo all the mistakes I made, and start anew. But that's impossible.

The cognitive distortion \"discounting the positive\" refers to the tendency to downplay or dismiss positive experiences, emotions, or thoughts. This can manifest as an excessive focus on negative aspects while ignoring or minimizing the good things happening around you. It might lead people to overlook achievements, celebrate small victories less often, or even convince themselves that bad news isn't really as bad as it feels. # Why Does This Happen? This happens because some individuals tend to be overly critical of themselves or others, focusing intensely on what’s going wrong. As a result, they may have difficulty recognizing and fully appreciating the positive elements of life. They might also use negative experiences as"
