The memories swirl within him, but none bring joy. Every moment since her passing feels like an endless, monotonous march, devoid of hope or respite. He tries to shake off the melancholy, focusing instead on the mundane task at hand—unloading groceries from the car. Yet, even this simple act seems tainted by the weight of his sorrow. He can't help but feel that every step forward is just another reminder of what he's lost—a life filled with love, now reduced to nothing more than a distant memory. As he walks, the rain begins to fall harder, casting a somber veil over everything. It's just another day, yet it feels like an eternity. The world around him appears duller, as if the colors have faded, leaving only shades of grey. Even the smell of food, once a comforting presence, now feels hollow, a cruel mockery of the happiness he once knew. In this desolate landscape, time stretches out before him like an endless road, each mile a painful reminder of what he's left behind. The past lingers, refusing to let go, its grip tightening with every passing day. His thoughts drift, caught between nostalgia and despair, unable to find peace. Each breath feels like a struggle, weighed down by the"

You wouldn't know anything about journalism, would you? After all, you're still learning.”* *A spark of frustration flashes across the intern's face, but they quickly compose themselves.* *I feel a surge of guilt, knowing that I've been in similar situations before.* *The intern nods again, their expression softening into a determined look.* *I realize that I'm starting to get distracted by the noise around me.* *The intern leans forward, their voice taking on a more serious tone.* *I force myself to focus on the conversation, trying to ignore the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.* *I feel a sense of relief wash over me as the intern begins to explain their ideas.* *I start to relax, thinking"

Maybe I even broke your favorite glass; I don't remember but it's possible. It's hard to believe she wouldn't tell me about it if she knew what happened, isn't it? That's why I feel so guilty - I'm probably the reason for this mess, and I wish I could turn back time. If only I had known beforehand... I wonder what we were talking about before she left, and whether she meant to leave me a note or if it was just an accident. I'll never know now, and I'm starting to think it was my fault all along. It's better this way, though. We weren't really happy anymore anyway, and I needed some space. But oh, the memories! All those moments when she smiled at me, or laughed at my jokes, or— Oh god, stop it. Stop thinking about her right now. You need to move on. Just look ahead, focus on yourself, and forget about her.

It's not like he expected the letter to be there; he wasn't even sure if his son had written such letters when he left. The fact that he kept them hidden away suggests he might have been trying to protect himself from the truth. But why would he need protection? Maybe he just wanted to keep the memories safe for a long time. I can understand that. It doesn’t really matter what my son thinks about me now. I've heard enough rumors about how he feels. It’s clear that we’re far apart, and this letter is probably another reminder of that distance. Still, who knows what he could’ve been thinking at the time? Maybe it was just a sentimental gesture, something he did because he missed me. I know how much I miss him too, but maybe that’s all it was – a nostalgic moment from the past. This isn’t about changing anything; it’s just about understanding that people don’t always see things the way we do. Even if my son wrote those words, they don’t define our relationship or what happened between us. That decision has already been made, and there’s no going back. All I can do is accept that things are as they are and move forward with what’s important to me. My life isn’t over yet, and I still have so many things to look forward to.
