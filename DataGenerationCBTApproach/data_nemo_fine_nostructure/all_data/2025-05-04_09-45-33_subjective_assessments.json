She knew exactly when he was at his weakest, and yet she still reached out, leaving him with more questions than answers. Why did she wait until he was so close to giving up? What else could she have written that would've made such a difference? He wondered if there were other letters, hidden somewhere, waiting to be found. The guilt of ignoring her was overwhelming, and the letter seemed like a cruel joke, reminding him of all the times he'd skipped visits because he was too tired or too busy. Now, he felt like he was drowning in grief, unable to escape the weight of what he'd done.

A framed photo of him, taken years ago in their garden, caught her eye. She'd left it there, among the spices and herbs he'd loved. Her breath hitched as she remembered his laughter, his hands helping hers on the chopping board. The timer went off, sharp and sudden, jolting her back to the present. She reached for the oven mitts, but her hand grazed a half-finished letter addressed to him, still resting on the counter. It was meant to be a simple note about trying out a new recipe last week.

As she mixed the dough, the aroma of baking bread filled the air, mingling with memories of them cooking together. It was almost comforting, except when she imagined him standing beside her, his arm brushing against hers, and she felt a pang of sadness. She didn't want to feel this way, especially during the holidays. They were supposed to spend time with family, laughing and enjoying each other's company. But every step she took seemed to lead further away from what he would have wanted. She folded the letter, tucking it into the drawer where he used to keep it. It was a small act of closure, but one that made her wonder how much longer she could hold onto these moments. The letter had been written months ago, but she couldn't bring herself to give it up. Every day felt like another hurdle, and she wasn't sure which path to take. Maybe the bread would be enough to distract her, to remind her of happier times. She slid the tray into the oven, the heat enveloping her as she stood there, lost in thought. What did he think? Would he approve of this"

It's all my fault; I didn't give her enough attention, and now she hates me. I feel like I failed as a mom, and she deserves better. Maybe I'll go out today and buy some new food, see if she comes back then. If not, I'll have to face her anger head-on. But honestly, I donâ€™t blame her for feeling this way.

Is there something specific that triggered this feeling? Let's explore some possible reasons behind his emotional state: 1. **Perfectionism**: Perhaps he has unrealistic expectations about himself or others, leading him to compare unfavorably. 2. **Social Comparison**: Maybe he's comparing his life to those of his peers or even his family members, which isn't fair because everyone faces challenges differently. 3. **Lack of Support**: Could he be feeling isolated due to a lack of resources (like tutors) or simply because he doesn't have anyone to share his struggles with? 4. **Personal Expectations vs. Reality**: Maybe his standards for success are too high, causing him to feel overwhelmed and behind when reality doesn't match up. 5. **Anxiety and Stress**: Is he dealing with anxiety related to school or exams, making it hard for him to focus and leading to feelings of inadequacy?"
