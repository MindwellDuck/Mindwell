Maybe she's really busy today and doesn't have time to talk right now. If she wasn't there, it might mean she's sick, or maybe she's avoiding me because of some past argument between us.

But then he'd have to wonder what if she didn’t want to talk anymore, and how would that affect him? This line is an example of the distorted thinking - the focus is on hypothetical outcomes (what if) rather than dealing with the present situation. However, he decided to let go of those thoughts and instead focused on the current moment. He took a deep breath and opened his laptop, ready to work on his project. It wasn’t much, just a few lines of code to debug before he could sleep. Maybe tomorrow he’d try calling her again, but for now, he needed to concentrate on fixing this bug."

He would sip his tea, cold now, and watch the snowflakes dance outside the window, each one a fleeting companion in the solitude of his twilight years.

I can imagine it must be tough for someone like him to adjust to such a big change in his life."
