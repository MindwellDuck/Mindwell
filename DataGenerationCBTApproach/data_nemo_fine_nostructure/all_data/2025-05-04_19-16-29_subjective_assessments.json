She hadn't noticed him yet, but he recognized that smug smile, that confident posture. It was the same way she'd acted when she got his job, the one he'd applied for and desperately wanted after decades of service. His grip tightened around his tray, knuckles turning white as he felt a bitter taste rise in his throat. He wanted to march over there, spill her tea, make a scene. But he didn't. Instead, he turned away, feeling the spite burn within him like an untended wound.",

How he had everything he could ever want right now, a good job, a nice home, friends who cared—what more could he possibly ask for? The thought made him sick to his stomach. She never understood how hard it was for him to keep going, to push through the pain and stress. But he couldn't let her know that; it would ruin everything. So he'd nod politely, pretending to agree, while secretly seething inside. They'd go back to their usual routine, with her offering advice and reassurance, and he'd keep his head down, pretending to listen. That was how things usually went. ## Step 1: Identify the trigger Identify the situation or event that triggered this thinking. ## Step 2: Understand the distorted thinking Understand which specific type of cognitive distortion is being exhibited here. ## Step 3: Analyze the thought process Analyze how the distorted thinking led to the thoughts and feelings expressed in the response. ## Step 4: Generate a subjective reaction Generate a subjective reaction based on the understanding of the distorted thinking, reflecting its presence in the response"

I thought about all the times I'd questioned my decisions—about medication dosages, treatment plans, even simple things like whether to call for backup. Now, I wondered if those doubts were more than just caution. Were they signs that I wasn't doing enough? That I needed to try harder? My mind raced with scenarios where I failed to act quickly enough, missed critical clues, or simply misinterpreted what was happening. Each possibility filled me with dread. What if this was all because I didn’t see the warning signs sooner? Even now, as I watched the team rush into the room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d been running out of time. What if there’s still a chance to save him? What if I can find a way to turn things around? I remembered all the times I'd pushed myself to work longer hours, skip meals, and ignore fatigue just to be ready for emergencies. And now, when it mattered most, I felt unprepared. Was I truly doing everything I could, or am I just making excuses? As I stood there, frozen in uncertainty, I couldn't help but think about how much responsibility rested on my shoulders.

He must be sad, too, remembering our life together as artists. It’s strange how we used to share so many moments in this very room, and now there are just these...empty spaces. I wonder if he still looks at old photos of us, smiling at the memories we made here. This is getting to me, though. Maybe I'm just being selfish, focusing on what I’ve lost instead of what we could create again. But I can’t shake off the feeling that things will never be the same. Every time I look around this studio, I see reminders of what we had, and it makes me feel lonely. I wish I knew exactly where he went after we parted ways. Did he try to fill the silence with new brushes? Or maybe he sold everything, leaving behind only the memories. Whatever happened, I hope he finds happiness, even if it means moving on. It’s funny how we used to joke about having separate studios, but now it feels cruel. I keep wondering if he thinks about me, if he ever stops by to paint. I guess I’m just holding onto what we had, hoping against hope that someday we’ll meet again. Sometimes I think about him waking up early, sitting quietly in front of his easel, waiting for inspiration to strike. His fingers would move swiftly over the canvas, bringing"
