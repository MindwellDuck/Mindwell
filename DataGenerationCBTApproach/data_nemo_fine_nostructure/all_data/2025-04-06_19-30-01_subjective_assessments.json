The wind outside seemed to carry whispers of her past, reminding him of all the moments they'd shared, the laughter, the tears, the late-night conversations beneath starry skies—each one a reminder that she would never be there again. He gazed at the painting, the colors muted, unable to find joy in the beauty she once brought to the world. Every brushstroke felt like a betrayal, as if the very act of creating something beautiful was a cruel mockery of her memory. The room was filled with the scent of jasmine, but it only served as a painful reminder of what could have been—a life full of love, now reduced to a few scattered memories, forever trapped in the past. He knew every curve of her face, every laugh, every tear, and yet, nothing seemed real anymore. Her smile, once so full of life, now hung on the canvas, frozen in time, a constant reminder that even art couldn’t hold back the darkness that had claimed her too soon. He wondered if he’d ever truly loved her, or if he just thought he did because it was easier than facing the pain of losing her. In the end, it didn’t matter; the truth remained clear: he would spend the rest of his days lost in grief, his paintings nothing more than a futile attempt to fill the void left by her"

He needs to stop feeling sorry for himself and start blaming everyone else for his problems. Maybe then he'll finally feel better. He'll see that it's not his fault everything has gone wrong. Just think how easy things would be if he had some real friends who cared about him instead of being stuck in his own head. His life will change when he starts pointing fingers. Eventually, someone will come along and help him out of this mess. Until then, he might as well keep wallowing in his misery."

Maybe even worse than that—maybe he tried to end things before we got married. She thought about all the times he'd mentioned wanting to \"take a break\" from life. All the conversations they'd had where he seemed distant, distracted by dark thoughts. What if he's dead already? What if this is just another one of those moments where everything falls apart? He might never come back. This could be our last goodbye. How can I hold on when my mind keeps racing with worst-case scenarios? But then again, maybe he'll return soon, full of remorse and ready to make up for lost time. She remembered how he'd always told her that he loved her more than anything.
