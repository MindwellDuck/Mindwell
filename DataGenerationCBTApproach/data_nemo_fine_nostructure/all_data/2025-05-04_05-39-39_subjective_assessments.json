It makes me wonder if he really cares about us at all. Why is he wasting our time like this? We could've been at the gym right now getting stronger together, but no, he prefers to sit there alone, staring blankly at the screen. This isn't just about food; it's about how he chooses to spend his time. He has no consideration for my efforts or our plans. Now everything feels pointless, especially after seeing him waste our meal. If he wasn't glued to that TV, maybe things would change between us. But the more I think about it, the more I realize he probably doesn't even care about me. Maybe he never did. I guess I'll just accept this and move on. Or maybe I should tell him how I feel? No, it's better if I don't, because he won't listen anyway. I can't trust someone who ignores his commitments and spends his free time in front of screens. I doubt he ever will change."

In this case, John has recently experienced a difficult time in his marriage. After a long period of infidelity by his partner, John found it challenging to forgive and trust again. When his ex-wife shared news about her engagement with another woman, John couldn’t help but feel bitter. He started to question whether this new relationship would be any different from the past. John’s negative feelings led him to make assumptions about his ex-wife’s current situation. “Why would she get married again? Does she think she can fool me?” he wondered. These thoughts weren’t based on facts but rather reflected John’s unresolved emotions. He began to see his ex-wife as someone who didn’t respect his feelings or boundaries, further solidifying his distrust. This example demonstrates how emotional reasoning can lead people to form biased opinions without considering the full context. By letting his emotions dictate his beliefs, John creates a distorted view of his ex-wife’s intentions, which might not accurately represent reality. --- # Emotionally Reasoning Response #2"

I should really get back to work instead of sitting here doing nothing, but what's the point when everything is already falling apart? She didn't call her sister because she knew she'd never get anything done at home, and she wasn't going to let her sister's problems ruin her life. But now she feels guilty for not calling, like she owes someone for something. If only she had stayed longer at work, maybe things wouldn't feel so bad right now. Maybe then she wouldn't feel so alone. I should've tried harder, but what's the use anyway? At least I don't have to deal with all those other problems she has. This isn't fair; I'm the one who works hard every day, while everyone else gets to sit around and do nothing. That mother at the park must think she's better than me, always smiling and laughing with her kid. Doesn't she know how hard it is to raise kids alone? Does she even care about what I'm going through? No wonder I feel so resentful, especially after seeing her happy family. My own life is"
