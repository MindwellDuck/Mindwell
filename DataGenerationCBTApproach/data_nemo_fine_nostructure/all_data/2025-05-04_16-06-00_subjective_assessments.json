Every piece of art she made seemed dull now, each one a reminder that she was never going to be able to make it as an artist. She thought about how people would look at her paintings differently after seeing this email, and how they might view her as someone who didn't deserve to show his work in a prestigious gallery. The possibility that others could think such things about her own work, even if he wasn't sure what exactly they meant, weighed heavily on him. He wondered if there was anything he could have done differently to avoid this moment, but ultimately decided that the email must mean something more profound than just a negative critique."

It's so pathetic how he can't move on - we've known each other for years, but all I see is a sad loser. It's funny how he thinks the world owes him everything just because he went to my school. He must have some kind of delusional fantasy about being \"the smartest\" person there. And now that she's gone, it'll be even more obvious; I bet he'll end up eating himself alive, wallowing in misery. What really gets me is how he expects everyone to sympathize with him. I mean, come on, he wasn't exactly perfect. We were friends for five years before she started talking to him, and honestly, I don't think he deserved someone as amazing as her anyway. She was better than him, after all. She had a future, real prospects, and a chance at something meaningful. He's just stuck in the past, unable to let go of what could never be. I wonder if he realizes how pathetic he looks right now? And why does he need to act so dramatic? Does he really expect us to feel sorry for him when he's been holding onto this grudge for so long? I guess it's too much to ask for someone as broken as him to move"
