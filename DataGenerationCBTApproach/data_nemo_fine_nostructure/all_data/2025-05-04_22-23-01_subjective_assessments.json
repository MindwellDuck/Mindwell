He's been there for hours, yet no one has asked about her day. The resentment simmers within her as she realizes he hasn't even noticed her homecoming.",

The hum of the computer fan seemed suddenly deafening, echoing in her chest like a pounding drum. Her heart raced, each beat sending a jolt of panic through her veins. She had always been able to lose herself in her work, but today, the familiar comfort of algorithms and logic felt like a foreign language. The room began to spin, the walls closing in as she fought to catch her breath. Her husband's voice echoed from the other room, calling out for lunch, but all she could hear was the roar of blood in her ears. She gripped the edge of her desk, knuckles white, as a wave of dizziness washed over her. This wasn't just a panic attack; it felt like the walls were caving in, crushing her under the weight of her own anxiety.",

What if she lost her job because of it? Or worse, what if she couldn’t handle it anymore and ended up hurting someone else? That thought alone made her stomach turn. She took another deep breath, trying to push those thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand, but they lingered, refusing to be silenced. Every time she opened the code, her mind kept racing with the possibilities - bad ones, mostly. It felt like every line of code was a challenge, each one a test of her ability to stay focused. She knew she needed to calm down, but it’s hard when your whole life feels like it’s hanging in the balance. Even now, as I sit here writing, I still feel the same anxiety. My palms are sweaty, and my mind is racing again. I’ve tried everything to shake this feeling off, but it keeps coming back, no matter how many times I remind myself it’s just an anxiety attack. How can we tell whether our anxiety attacks are caused by real problems or just our minds making things worse? I think it’s because we’re so worried about being wrong. We don’t want to look foolish or make mistakes. And when we start thinking about all the potential consequences of failing or looking incompetent, our brains can create scenarios that feel even more frightening than reality"

She’s probably trying to make me look bad at some charity gala or something. I can’t imagine why anyone would invite me to such an important occasion when I’ve never even heard about it.

The fact that they had moved on was almost irrelevant; what really hurt was how much pain it caused her, even though she knew it wasn't fair to dwell on something so long gone. In reality, the sadness she felt was overwhelming. She couldn't help but feel like she'd lost everything—her husband, her daughter, and now this precious moment too. Every time she looked at that photo, it felt like tearing herself apart all over again, no matter how many times she tried to convince herself otherwise. But for some reason, the memory stayed with her, haunting her every step, reminding her of the life she could never have again. That single image seemed to be the key to unlocking all the pain she thought she'd left behind, forcing her to confront the reality of what she'd lost once more. It's hard to explain why, but seeing that photo kept bringing back memories of happier days, making her wish things were different. Even though she understood intellectually that nothing would ever change, emotionally, it felt like I was going through the same struggles all over again, struggling to move on from the past. Even though she knew logically that the photo was just a reminder of the past, emotionally, it felt like it was the trigger that set off a chain of painful memories. The simple truth hit her hard, yet she still found herself"

Now it feels like everything is crumbling around me. My mind is racing with thoughts of how I can fix things, but deep down, I know it won’t work out.

Now, as he looked at her, he saw a pattern—a deliberate attempt to upset him whenever he did something wrong. The way she set her book aside, her eyes narrowing, seemed to say, “You’re not good enough.” He clenched his fists, feeling anger rise. Why would she act this way? Didn’t she know he was just trying to help? This wasn't the first time; she'd shown similar behavior when he'd gotten angry about little things, like taking too long to get ready in the morning. It didn't seem like an accident anymore. She must be doing it on purpose. It's always the same—when he does something wrong, she makes it out to be personal. He tried to calm himself but couldn't shake off the feeling. Maybe if he said something, she'd realize what she was doing. But what if it only made things worse?"

My wife is always so busy with her own projects that she rarely cooks anymore. She'd probably pick up something quick on the way back from her meeting this morning. It's probably nothing; he just stayed out late celebrating the end of the project. That explains everything. He's probably already asleep by now, exhausted from working late.
