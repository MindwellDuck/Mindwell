The evening light cast long shadows across the bare walls adorned only with a few framed lines of code from projects past.

He felt her absence heavy in the quiet, each echo of silence a reminder of another shared melody they'd never play again.

He couldn't help but feel that the universe was against him, that its very fabric was woven to bring suffering.

He doesn't seem to understand how much stress this is causing me. Every time he comes home late, he just leaves his trash scattered around the kitchen, and then expects me to clean it up. It's so frustrating. I feel like I'm always the one doing things for him, but when he does something nice (like leaving a note), I don't appreciate it because I know he hasn't done anything else for me lately. It's just so unfair. And he thinks I'm being too sensitive about it! This isn't the first time he's left his mess for me to deal with. I remember last week, he came back from a party, and there were empty bottles everywhere. I was so angry, but then he apologized and said he'd help next time. Now, instead of helping, he just leaves more trash behind. I hate living with someone who doesn't respect my hard work and makes me feel like I'm overreacting.

But what really stuck out to me was when my mom walked into the office and started talking to the other parents. She seemed different, more confident than usual. When she spoke, her words carried weight, and everyone listened intently. It was like she had this inner strength that radiated outward, making us feel seen and heard. I wish I could capture that feeling, but it's hard to explain—maybe it was the way she stood tall, or the way her voice commanded respect without being loud.

This was all about personal failure. Her lack of success was clear to everyone else but her. They didn't care about her dedication or her sacrifices. All they saw was her inability to make things work. What if they'd seen her efforts differently? Maybe then they would've supported her. But no, instead, they judged her harshly. Her mind was filled with thoughts of \"What could I have done?\" and \"Why can't anyone else see how important my job is?\" The more she ruminated, the more convinced she became that her failures were proof of her worthlessness.
