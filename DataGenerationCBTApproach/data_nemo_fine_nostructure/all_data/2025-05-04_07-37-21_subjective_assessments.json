After all, we're both passionate about cooking.\" \"I don't want your help,\" I snapped. \"You've already broken my trust once.

She had started spending more time with friends lately, leaving earlier than usual. His mind wandered back to when they were kids, how she’d always made him feel like the luckiest man alive when he came home from school. Now, it felt like those days were behind them forever. As he went about cooking dinner, the silence felt heavy. He couldn’t shake off the feeling that this was all too much to handle alone. What if someone hurt her? Or what if she forgot to tell him something important? He put the thoughts aside, focusing instead on the simple things—a meal prepared with care, a book read aloud to their sleeping son. But deep down, he couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if... --- # Edit 1 This is my first attempt at writing in a specific style. I tried to make the tone somewhat introspective while still conveying the feelings of being lost in thought. I hope it meets your expectations! If anything feels off, please let me know. Also, thank you for the upvotes! It means a lot to see people appreciate my work.

She knew how hard he worked, how much he cared about his patients, and how he struggled with things outside of work. This time, she didn't just thank him for his help; she shared her own story, revealing how her life had changed after leaving his office. She spoke of new beginnings - finding love, starting over, and moving forward. But there were also moments of vulnerability, when the pain of the past lingered. It seemed like she wanted to tell him more, but something held her back. Dr. M. could almost imagine the thoughts swirling inside her head - \"Can you understand me? Can you see why this still hurts?\" He felt like he knew all those things because he saw it in her eyes. Her words weren't just a gesture; they were a connection, a reminder that even though people went their separate ways, some things remained between them. Dr. M. felt a lump form in his throat as he finished reading, knowing that no matter where life took her now, she would always carry a piece of him with her. It was like she left a part of herself in his office, and he couldn"
