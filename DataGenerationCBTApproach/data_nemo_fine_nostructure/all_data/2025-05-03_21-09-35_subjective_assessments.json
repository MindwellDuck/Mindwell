Hadn’t they agreed to keep things civil for their son’s sake? She thought about how much stress it caused her, and how much more complicated everything became. This could be a sign that he still wanted to mess up her life. It didn’t make sense. If he really wanted to talk, wouldn’t he say something? Why not just leave me alone? Maybe it’s a test. Maybe he wants to see if I can handle it. But then why bother sending nothing at all? That doesn’t even feel like a real message. Is this some kind of joke? And if so, what kind of sick joke is it? She felt like she was drowning in questions. What does it mean? Does he really want to contact me? Should she respond? How will she know if it’s genuine? Or is he just trying to get inside her head? The thought made her angry. Doesn’t he understand how hard it is to deal with this right now? This isn’t over. He’ll never let us move on completely.

It took me a few minutes to calm down enough to check if he'd just forgotten to turn his alarm on again. But what really threw me off was that he left his glasses on his desk. He always puts them away before bed, so it seemed odd that they were still there. I thought maybe he'd gotten dressed and left before turning off the lights, which would explain why everything felt so dark. Yet, even though I knew my mind was playing tricks on me, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He usually leaves early for work, but today, when I called out to him, there was complete silence. No response, no noise, nothing. That's how I know things are bad. As I sat here waiting for someone to come home, I kept telling myself, \"It must be okay.\" But deep down, I knew the truth. Something is terribly wrong, and I’m powerless against it. When he finally came home, I could see the exhaustion in his eyes. We talked about it later, and he explained that he'd overslept and forgot to set his alarms.

She would often remind me when I forgot something important. In fact, she would sometimes ask me if I remembered something she had asked me to do. When I said no, she would tell me it wasn't my fault, and she'd make sure I didn't forget again. We used to joke that she had a sixth sense for knowing when I needed help remembering something. If I ever missed one of her reminders, she'd be there to help me out. But now, I'm just wondering why I didn't think to check the calendar this time. Maybe I need to start setting more reminders like she did. After all, she was good at making sure everything stayed organized. It's funny how some memories come back unexpectedly. I still have a few of those old reminders she left behind. They're probably still on her phone somewhere. That brings back another memory - my late wife used to send me little notes on our anniversary every year. I must have kept hers too. Let me see...

No one else was there to judge her, and yet...and yet... She tried to shake off the feelings, telling herself it was ridiculous to get so upset over something so trivial. But why did it matter so much? Wasn’t this just another art show? Shouldn’t she be able to handle it better than this? After all, she’d always dreamed of showcasing her work and now it was finally here. What more could she expect? But then again, shouldn’t she have prepared for this? Didn’t she know that things wouldn’t go exactly as planned? And wasn’t it strange that she felt so anxious? She had spent months preparing, rehearsing, and perfecting. Hadn’t she taken enough precautions? Still, the doubts lingered, making her question whether she really belonged here. Maybe she was being overly sensitive because she was new to the scene.
