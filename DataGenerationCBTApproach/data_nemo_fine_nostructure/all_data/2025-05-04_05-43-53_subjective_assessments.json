I mean, I remember her saying something about having a favorite author, but I don't know... maybe that's what she meant by \"favorite.\" She always seemed to have so many books—books she'd read and reread, ones she'd never even opened, just sitting there on her shelf. But this one, oh man, that book must've been special to her. Maybe she was reading it again now, and she forgot to tell me? I wonder what happened to her. Is she still out there somewhere? Did she ever find another book like that? If she did, why didn’t she share it with us? Was she just holding onto it for sentimental reasons? Or does it mean something more? Does it mean she’s still lost in those stories, too? I hope she is, because I really miss her. I wish I could go back in time and make things better between us. What if we’d gotten along better? What if I had been more understanding? What if I hadn’t been such a jerk? Would things be different now? Probably not, though. Life goes on, doesn’t it? And who knows? Maybe someday someone else will stumble upon that book, and they’ll feel exactly how I do when I hold it. Maybe they'll find themselves in the same situation, wondering what could’ve been if they'd known her"

Maybe she was just tired, and her mind was playing tricks on her, making him seem more present than he actually was. Still, it wouldn't be so strange if he did. After all, he had been doing this for years, and she loved how he could read her moods. He knew exactly what she needed—someone to sit quietly with, to share the stillness of the evening. Even though she'd told him about feeling lonely lately, he didn't really listen, always trying to find ways to \"solve\" things instead of just being there. But deep down, she knew he cared, even if he didn't say it out loud.

My thoughts swirled around me, weighing heavily on my shoulders, like the weight of those books I carried home.

I would lie there, paralyzed by anxiety, as the sun slowly rose higher in the sky, reminding me of another day, another challenge, another hurdle to overcome. And yet, despite this, I kept pushing forward, driven by the hope that someday things might change, that somehow, someway, I’d break free from this cycle of doubt and uncertainty. But deep down, I knew it wouldn’t be easy; that the road ahead would continue to twist and turn, filled with obstacles I hadn’t even imagined. Still, I held onto the dream of success, no matter how elusive it seemed, clinging to the faint glimmer of possibility that one day, I might finally find my place in the world."
