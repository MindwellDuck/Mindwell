He even mentioned to someone else that maybe she had an advantage because her art was better, which made me think he was being unfair. I don't know why she got so many compliments, especially since mine was also impressive in its own right. It was hard to see her getting all the attention, but my friend didn't seem to mind it too much. She might have been trying to make herself look better by saying that her art was the best, but I'm not sure if that's really what happened. I guess everyone has different opinions, but I still can't shake the feeling that there was some injustice at play here."

It seemed like he wasn't bothered by how his actions would affect others, just his own desires. This realization filled her with anger and sadness, as if her heart could physically feel the pain of being replaced. She couldn't help but wonder what she did wrong and why this kept happening.

Even the strict supervisor has started to doubt his abilities, and he knows he won't get away with this for much longer. As he looks around, he notices how everyone else’s lockers seem perfectly organized, their clothes folded neatly, and their belongings put away with precision. Meanwhile, he feels like a failure, unable to replicate even the simplest standards. What if he gets fired? Or worse, what if no one wants to hire someone who isn’t perfect? Every time he tries to make things right, he ends up making them worse. This isn't just about cleanliness—it's about everything. He struggles to keep up, feeling like he's drowning under the weight of expectations. Every step forward is followed by two steps back. No matter how hard he tries, he can't shake off the feeling that he’s destined to fail. Maybe I shouldn't have taken this job in the first place. Maybe I’m not cut out for it, and deep down, we all know it. This isn't just about his own failures but also about the disappointments of others. There are so many people whose lives are ruined because of me"

I've asked her many times how much longer she'll be at work, but she never answers, and when I ask her directly, she says she's \"just busy\" like she does every time. It's really frustrating because I know she has more free time than she lets on. Maybe if we had dinner together earlier, she wouldn't need to stay out later, but no, she chooses to spend her evenings with those friends of hers instead of us. They're probably planning something behind my back, and now I feel even more isolated. She doesn't seem to care about how I feel; she just tells me to relax, saying it's normal and that I overreact. But what if she's lying? What if she's secretly seeing someone else? This is all because of her constant tardiness, which affects me directly. If she were more considerate, our relationship would improve, but she refuses to make adjustments, leaving me feeling hurt and resentful. The worst part is when she doesn't answer my calls or texts until hours after, making me worry about her safety. This isn't the first time she's done this, and it won't be the last. When will"
