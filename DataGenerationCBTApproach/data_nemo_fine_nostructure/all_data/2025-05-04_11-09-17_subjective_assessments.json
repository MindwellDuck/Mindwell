Maybe they didn't mean what they said. They're probably just stressed with work or something, so they snapped at her. But if they really meant it, wouldn't they have called or texted by now? She thinks I'm going through some kind of midlife crisis, doesn't she? Probably because I've been spending more time alone lately. If I was really happy, would I need to escape into video games? And why does she think I'd be suicidal? Does she even know me well enough to understand my struggles? I guess it makes sense, though. I am pretty down in the dumps. But I bet if I opened up to her, she'd be the first one there for support. We've had those deep conversations before—she knows I'm struggling, and I know she is too. This isn't about blaming each other; we both feel overwhelmed. It's just... sometimes I wish she understood me better than this. Even if she did, I don't think she'd actually care. She's always been distant anyway."

She doesn't seem confident when she talks about her looks, so maybe she is just jealous of me because I look better than her. It's weird that I even care what my coworkers think, but I don't want them to talk behind my back. If they were friends with me outside work, they wouldn't say anything negative. This isn't just about me; it's also about all the other women who are treated unfairly by men. They must be experiencing this every day, and it makes me angry. I wish there was a way to stop these kinds of comments from happening, but it's hard since people will always have different opinions. I know I'm not perfect, but I've never been mean to anyone, so why does everyone assume I am?"

He felt small and insignificant among them, like a tiny boat in a stormy sea. Every step seemed to take forever, and he longed for a respite from the chaos. Yet, despite feeling lost, he continued on, driven by a sense of curiosity. Maybe it was the excitement of being somewhere new, or maybe it was the desperation to find something more meaningful than the noise around him. Whatever the reason, he kept moving, caught up in a cycle of hope and frustration. As he navigated the crowded streets, he began to wonder if anyone else felt the same way, if we’re all just pretending to be okay when deep down we’re struggling to keep our heads above water. Or maybe it’s just me, and I’m reading too much into everything. Either way, I'll continue to explore, hoping to uncover some truth amidst the noise."
