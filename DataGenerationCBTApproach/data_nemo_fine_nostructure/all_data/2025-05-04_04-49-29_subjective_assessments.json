It makes me wonder if they actually think I’m completely clueless about what’s going on, and maybe even a little silly for not catching on sooner.

The cancellation comes as a shock, especially since she had been preparing for months. Initially, she feels a wave of relief wash over her—she no longer needs to worry about the logistical challenges of setting up the show. However, this relief quickly turns to despair as she realizes that her life's work is now nothing more than a memory. In one moment, it was all there—the potential for connection with art lovers, the excitement of sharing something new, and the pride of showcasing personal creativity. Now, it's gone, leaving her feeling empty and defeated. In another instant, she could have been celebrating her latest achievement—a chance to share her vision with the world. Instead, the decision felt like a crushing blow, stripping away everything she'd worked tirelessly towards. This sudden shift from triumph to disappointment leaves her questioning whether she'll ever experience success. The cancellation doesn't just feel like a loss; it represents the end of all her aspirations, making every effort seem futile. Her thoughts spiral out of control, spiraling around the idea that she can never succeed again, that her dreams are nothing but a distant memory. It's as if the very foundation of her self-worth has crumbled, leaving behind a hollow sense of failure that refuses to let go. This emotional rollercoaster is accompanied by a growing frustration, which swirls around the notion that everything she does will always be met with rejection. With"

My mind is racing with worst-case scenarios, and I can’t shake off the feeling that at any moment, disaster will strike. In these moments of pure anxiety, I wonder if anyone would ever find out what really happened here. Would they think I went mad, or would they see the truth?
