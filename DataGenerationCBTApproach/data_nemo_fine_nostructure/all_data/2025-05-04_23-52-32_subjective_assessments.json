Today, however, as he pushed open the door, a pungent odor hit him like a wall. His stomach churned at the sight of half-eaten leftovers from days past, still sitting untouched on the kitchen counter, flies buzzing around them. The disgust rose in his throat as he realized this wasn't just a slip-up; she'd been doing this for weeks, letting their once-pristine home decay into something unrecognizable.",

I couldn’t understand why she’d let things get so out of hand."

He hadn't touched it since she'd passed. Now, faced with its quiet, accusing presence, shame welled up within him. He'd been too busy with his own work to notice how often she'd stayed up late, helping their daughter with her science fair project - a project he now realized was never about the prize, but about nurturing a passion he'd taken for granted.",

I couldn't help but feel embarrassed; I had no idea she spent so much time helping our daughter. It seemed so obvious now, yet at the time, I just assumed she needed some extra practice. I can’t believe I didn’t see this coming. I know she loved teaching, and I should have noticed when she always said things like “We’re not done until she understands!” But I guess I just let my own worries about the lab take over. She must have seen me stressing out about the funding and forgotten all about it. It’s easy to get caught up in your own problems and forget what matters most. Now that I think about it, I remember she used to say something like that whenever we were working on a difficult part together. I guess I just wasn’t listening as hard back then. I wonder if I could've helped more by being there for her instead of getting lost in my own thoughts. If only I had been paying closer attention... I’m going to make sure to be more present from now on. Maybe I can even try to teach her sometime. Who knows? We might both learn something new. # Personalization ## Distorted Thought: \"I am an idiot because I didn't realize my wife's efforts sooner.\" ## Corrected Thought: \"My wife is very dedicated to teaching and supporting our daughter's learning.\" ## Distorted"

It seemed like he knew exactly how she felt, and his expression made it feel like he could see right through her. He didn’t even say anything; just looked at her with a mix of confusion and concern. But it was clear he understood what she was going through – the way he raised an eyebrow, almost as if he was trying to ask, “Is everything okay?” Like he knew something about her, but wasn’t saying it out loud."

It felt like everyone around her was moving forward while she was stuck in quicksand. Her mind began to spiral, imagining all the things she could be doing instead of listening to this pointless competition, but every time she tried to change the subject, the laughter continued, making it harder for her to focus on anything else."

I know I need to stop expecting messages from him, but it's hard when my mind keeps replaying what could have been if he stayed.

I have proof that she's cheating too, and I'm going to expose her. This whole thing just makes me so angry, especially since she's always talking about how great our marriage was.

Even the sound of the knife cutting through the onions felt hollow, like the silence that surrounded him. Every breath felt heavy, weighed down by memories of their happy dinners together. He tried to shake off the feeling but found himself lost in thought, wondering when she would return, and if ever again. The kitchen, once full of joy, now felt empty, just like his heart."

There's no middle ground—I see it as a choice between those two extremes. I can't imagine us ever being happy together again, just as I can't envision a future where we'd remain friends after what happened. The photograph has become a constant reminder of what could never be—two paths diverging in the same moment, each one leading away from what we had. ---"
