This makes sense because she was asking him out for so long and they had been friends for such a long time. It means she wasn't interested in him romantically at all. She didn't want to be friends with him anymore, which suggests that she doesn't like him. This feeling of being rejected must mean that she actually dislikes him, which makes her message true. After all, if someone rejects me, they probably don't like me. She's probably trying to avoid him now, which supports her decision. The way she wrote the message"

She always said how proud she was when I took cooking classes. Now, I wonder if she really meant it, or if she just wanted to make me happy. Maybe she never thought I’d actually follow up on her suggestion. It’s strange, but every time I see this photo, I get a little choked up. Does she want me to cry, or is it just nostalgia playing tricks on me again? My mind keeps jumping between different memories—her favorite dish, the way we used to experiment together, even the argument we had over who made the better beef stew. But none of those thoughts seem to fit. It doesn’t add up. Did she forget how much I loved cooking too? Or did she just use it as an excuse to spend time alone? The guilt is building, and I don’t know how to process it anymore. I feel like I’m losing control, like everything is unraveling inside me."

He is lost in thought, replaying the past instead of focusing on the present. His life feels stagnant, stuck in the same routine day in and out. He longs for change but doesn’t know how to break free from his thoughts. The pain of losing her still feels fresh, even though it’s been many years since then. She was always there, his rock, his partner, his everything. Without her, he feels empty, unable to fill the void. His friends try to tell him to move on, but nothing helps. They're right; he needs to leave the past behind. Yet, he finds himself returning to those moments, reliving what could have been. It hurts so much, but deep down, he knows he needs to keep going. Time won't wait for him, and if he doesn't start living again, he'll be left with nothing but regret. He wants to hold on to the memories, but he also needs to find a way to heal. Maybe someday he'll learn to let go, but until then, he can't help but feel trapped in his own thoughts. ### Response"

Every time he tries to make small talk, he ends up feeling awkward and left out, as if he’s always the odd one out. It's hard to shake off the feeling that others are looking down on him because of his age. Sometimes, when he looks around at the other workers, he wonders if they think he's too old-fashioned, or if they find him unprofessional. The more he works in healthcare, the more he feels disconnected from everyone else, as if he’s constantly living in his own little world. He wishes things could be easier, but deep down, he knows that might never happen."
