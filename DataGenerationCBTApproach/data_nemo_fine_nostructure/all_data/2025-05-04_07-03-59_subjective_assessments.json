But what if they already did? Shouldn't I be grateful for the memories we made before everything fell apart? If only I could go back to when we were happy, maybe I'd still be there today. But what if I couldn't handle the pressure? I feel like I'm stuck in an endless loop of \"what ifs\" where every choice leads to more regrets. What if I chose differently? Would I have found happiness then? What if I tried harder to fit into our life? Did I really deserve that kind of love? What if I was just holding her back? Now I wonder if she's happy with him too. Is she smiling because she loves him, or is she pretending? What if I never knew the truth? Would I have felt better then? What if I pushed them away unknowingly?

There were actual droplets of milk on the counter, which seemed so strange because we always kept everything tightly sealed. It didn’t make sense why someone would leave them like that, especially if they wanted us to know not to eat whatever was inside the container. I felt a shiver run down my spine thinking about all the times I’d been tempted to grab something from the fridge without checking, and now I was worried that maybe I had already consumed some kind of harmful substance. It made me feel sick just imagining it, but at the same time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this might have been intentional. I mean, who does that? Why would someone go through the trouble of leaving a note and making sure everyone knows not to eat it? And how did it end up in the fridge in the first place? I tried to push those thoughts away, focusing instead on the cleanliness of our home and how we need to be more mindful of things like this in the future.
