It's just another example of how unfair life is. I don’t know why I bother trying when everything goes against me. She’s such an asshole for doing this behind my back. This isn’t the first time she’s ignored me or left me out. I swear, if I had a dollar for every time she did that, I’d have enough money to buy a new car by now. But no, instead of using that money wisely, I’m stuck dealing with her selfishness. The fact that she didn’t even give me a heads up about changing things makes it worse. It feels like she enjoys watching me struggle. Why can't she see that I'm the one who really cares about making our art stand out? My ideas are what make this project worth showing anyway. Without them, we'd just be another bunch of amateur artists nobody wants to look at. So why does she get all the credit for our work? Doesn't she realize that without my input, everything would fall apart? It's so frustrating—she thinks she's above me just because she's got connections in the art world. Newsflash: I've been working harder than her for months, and still, none of that matters. Nothing ever changes around here; she gets whatever she wants, whenever she wants. It's like I'm invisible."

I try my best to be happy for him, but it's hard when he chooses to focus on every little thing I've done wrong. I don't know why I even bother telling him how much I love him; it just feels pointless now. He's always so quick to say he loves me back, but it sounds hollow when he doesn’t follow through with actions. Every time we talk, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, trying not to trigger some new argument. It’s exhausting. Maybe if he tried harder to understand me, things wouldn’t be so tense all the time. But I doubt it will ever change—people like him always seem to make things worse. When he does care about what I want, it’s too late. He never listens in the first place. What’s the point? At this rate, I’ll probably end up leaving him someday. If he can’t see how much I’m hurting, then maybe he’s not worth saving."

It was from her, the woman he'd interviewed all those years ago, whose story he'd spun into headlines, but not without bending truths to fit his editor's whim. He could still hear her voice, cracking as she spoke of her lost child. The guilt he felt then resurfaced now, raw and biting, as he realized he'd tucked the letter away unopened all these years. His partner called from the other room, \"Ready for dinner?\" but he couldn't respond, his gaze fixed on that long-forgotten envelope, a silent accusation in his past come to haunt him once more.",

That interview had left an indelible stain on his conscience, a reminder that even the most well-intentioned can betray the vulnerable. The letter, sealed for decades, seemed to mock him, a tangible symbol of his failure. The silence between them grew thicker than the dust on his shelves, a physical manifestation of the emotional distance he'd created. Every step forward felt like a betrayal, every decision a weight on his chest. I'm ready for dinner, but what's the point? The words echoed in my mind like a mantra, a constant reminder of the emptiness that now filled me. My partner’s call seemed distant, a distraction from the turmoil brewing inside. I forced a smile, but it felt hollow, like the laughter of someone else. The past had become a prison, and I was trapped, unable to escape the ghosts that haunted me. In this moment, nothing felt real, just a jumble of emotions and regrets. Time seemed to stretch out before me, each tick of the clock a countdown to another day of living with what I’d done. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was drowning in my own making, that every choice led further down a path I no longer recognized. The world outside seemed distant, muffled by the noise of my thoughts. I wondered if anyone would ever know the truth, or if I was truly alone in my suffering. The"

He didn't know how hard it was to be patient when all I could think about was the way he used to make me feel - full of life. I'm so glad we're still here together, even if things have been tough lately. I wish there was more joy now than sadness, but maybe someday soon we'll find happiness again. When I paint, I imagine him by my side, sharing stories and dreams, reminding me that love can still bloom in this world. We've grown closer since he started working on his art, our conversations flowing easily as we found new ways to connect with each other. Sometimes I worry that he's pushing me away because he doesn't want to burden me with his pain, but I try to reassure him that I'm here for whatever he needs. Even though he hasn't said anything directly, I see the effort he puts into creating something beautiful, and I hope he knows that I appreciate everything he does for us.
