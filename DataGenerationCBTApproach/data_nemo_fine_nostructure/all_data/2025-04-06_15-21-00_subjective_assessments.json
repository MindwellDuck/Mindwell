My favorite memory is when we went hiking and he showed me this beautiful waterfall. He said it reminded him of our first date, and I could see the happiness in his eyes as he described it. We even took a photo there, standing next to each other, looking at the falls. When I look at that photo, I feel happy because it reminds me of him. But the old photograph she picked up today... I don't think it's fair to compare those two moments. They're different times, different places, and I don't want to keep comparing them. I wish everyone could appreciate every moment like I do, but I understand why others might focus more on specific events than general feelings. Maybe I'll ask her if she wants to talk about it sometime. I care about her and want what's best for her."

His mind is numb from sadness, but it won't stay there; it will always find new ways to hurt him. Every step feels heavy with grief, as if each footfall weighs more than the last. The world outside seems duller too, the colors muted, the air thick with sorrow. Even the birds have stopped singing; what good are they when the heart can no longer sing? Each passing day brings another wave of pain, washing away all hope. The pain lingers, though, refusing to be washed away. It's always there, reminding him of what he has lost and what could never be again. What's the point of living if you're just going to feel this way forever? He keeps thinking about her, wondering how she might react if she were here. Would she smile at the duck feeder? Maybe she would laugh, remembering how silly they looked feeding bread to the waterfowl. But then, he'd see the sadness in her eyes, the knowledge that they had grown apart. She wouldn't want to sit here anymore; why bother holding onto something that's gone? Maybe he'll go back to the city one day, but until then, he can't bring himself to face those places. They remind him too much of her, of everything he once held dear. He knows he needs to move forward, but every step feels like a betrayal. Life goes on"

It wasn’t just the workload; it was the constant stream of emails from parents complaining about my teaching methods. It seemed like no matter how hard I tried, I was always one step behind. And now, with the sun already setting outside, I wondered if I’d even have time to grab dinner before heading back home. Every day felt like an uphill battle, and I couldn’t help but wonder if things would ever get better.

A lone sparrow perched outside, chirping a familiar tune she used to hum while they danced around each other, avoiding the counters strewn with ingredients.\n\nThe spices, her favorite, still lined up on the shelf like little soldiers waiting for their commander's return. He reached out, fingers brushing against the smooth glass of her favorite bottle, the one she'd insisted they keep even after it expired. It was empty now, like his heart, echoing with memories that refused to fade.\n\nA soft breeze rustled through the herbs hanging by the window, their leaves whispering secrets in a language long forgotten. He turned towards the sound, eyes falling on her favorite apron, still hanging there, waiting for hands that would never tie its strings again. A sob caught in his throat as he reached out to touch it, his rough chef's hands tracing the worn fabric gently.\n\nThe clock ticked, marking time he didn't want to keep, each second echoing like a hollow drumbeat in the empty house.

He walked over to the fridge, opening the door to reveal an almost empty space. Almost. There were leftovers from last night’s dinner, leftovers he knew she had made especially for him. She always said cooking was love, and every bite tasted better knowing that. But what if she wasn’t coming back? What if we’re done? The thought hit him hard, like a punch to the gut. He took a deep breath, trying to calm down, but his mind wouldn’t stop wondering. What if I’m too late? What if she doesn’t remember me anymore? As he stood there, lost in thoughts, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of desperation creeping in. He felt like he was drowning in these questions, unable to escape the undertow. What if I lose everything? What if I lose myself? He closed his eyes, letting the memories wash over him.

The thought made her feel a sense of relief, but also anger. Why should she spend more time than necessary trying to fit into this new world? If she stopped doing what she loved, perhaps things would get better, but maybe she wouldn't even care anymore. And if she kept going, she'd just feel more burdened. There was no middle ground; either she was useful or useless. If she decided to stop, she'd be giving up something important, but if she continued, she'd be wasting her life. This way of thinking made her feel both relieved and angry. She knew some part of her wanted to give up, but another part didn't want to let go. It seemed like she was stuck between two extremes, neither one truly acceptable. She wondered if there was a third option somewhere in between, but it seemed elusive."
