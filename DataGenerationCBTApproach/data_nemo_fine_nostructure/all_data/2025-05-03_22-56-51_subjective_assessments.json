I cried for hours, feeling really guilty that she didn't tell me sooner. My parents were going through a tough time, but I wish they had shared this with me instead of keeping it hidden. I feel terrible now that I'm older, and she's gone, knowing she cared about me so deeply. I wish she could have been here to see how happy I am today. This makes everything more complicated. Now I can't help but wonder if there are other letters I might never find. I just want to hold onto this moment forever, even though it feels like I'll never be able to fully understand why she chose to keep it from me. Her kindness has left a deep impression on me, and I don't know what to do with these emotions anymore."
