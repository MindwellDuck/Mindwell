His reflection stared back at him from the black window, a ghostly reminder of the man he used to be. A creased photograph lay on the table beside him, its edges worn smooth by anxious fingers. It showed her, smiling, before everything changed. The door swung open, revealing a young rookie, eager and full of life. \"You okay, sir?\" she asked, concern etched on her face. He forced a smile, tucking the photo into his pocket. \"Just another shift,\" he replied, turning away to hide the glistening in his eyes.",

I sat up in bed, feeling the sheets slide down my back. It wasn’t just the chill that made me shiver; it was the memories of our conversations, the laughter we shared, and the moments she held me close. She had been more than a friend to me; she was my confidante, the one who understood me when no one else did. Now, as I looked at her photo on my nightstand, I felt tears well up in my eyes. I thought about how much I missed her, how every moment without her felt like an eternity. My mind raced with thoughts of what could have been if only things had gone differently. But even though those thoughts brought sadness, they also reminded me of why I wanted to keep creating, to hold onto the love we shared even after she was gone."

It seemed too coincidental, too deliberate, like it was meant for her specifically. She felt a chill run down her spine as she wondered if there were people who knew something about it, perhaps those who could have helped them stay open. But why would they keep such information hidden? Was it some sort of conspiracy? Or maybe someone close to her—maybe even him—was behind it all? The thought sent a shiver through her, making her question whether he might be involved somehow. Could it be a twisted form of revenge against her family, now that they'd left the industry behind? The idea made her feel sick to her stomach, but part of her wanted to believe it—a belief that turned out to be wrong."

It felt like the end of everything they had built. Her mind kept jumping back to the last time they spoke, replaying every word, every gesture, wondering if there was a clue she missed. Had he said something that made her feel unwanted? Was there something in his tone that hinted at a deeper issue? She tried to shake off these thoughts, telling herself it was just paranoia, but the doubts lingered. Maybe they didn't even want to talk anymore?

The tone suggests that the speaker is aware of their superstition, yet still holding onto it, as evidenced by the phrase \"oh no, not again.\" This shows that the individual is conscious of their biased thinking, but cannot shake it off, revealing the subtle manifestation of the Fortune Telling distortion."
