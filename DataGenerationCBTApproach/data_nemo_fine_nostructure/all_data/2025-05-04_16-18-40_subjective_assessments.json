The thought of being replaced by her new boyfriend keeps creeping into his thoughts, solidifying his belief that he's nothing special to begin with. He feels trapped in this cycle of self-doubt, unable to move forward. Each day feels like a reminder that he’s destined for loneliness, that he’ll never find happiness on his own. It’s hard not to wonder if he deserves such pain, especially after everything that happened during their marriage. Every small setback now feels like evidence that he’s not good enough. Even finding her new boyfriend’s name online made him feel like a joke—a constant reminder of how far he’d fallen. There are times when he wonders if he ever truly deserved to be loved in the first place. He can’t help but think about how much easier things would have been if she were still with him.

He asked if I was the one who killed his dad, and I felt a chill run down my spine. My mind flashed back to that night, the sound of gunfire, the screams, the feeling of being trapped. I don't want to think about it anymore. Why did he bring it up? Doesn't he have anything better to do than dwell on the past? This kid looks so confident, so full of life. His smile is infectious, but mine feels forced. I try to keep my head held high, but I feel like I'm drowning in my own regret. What does it mean for someone to shoot another person? Is it something you learn to live with, or are you forever changed by it? I've spent years wondering what could have been if I'd made different choices. Now, I'm just tired. Tired of living, tired of remembering, tired of being haunted by the ghosts of my past. What would it be like to wake up every morning with no memory of it all?

It's not just the photo; every room in the house feels like a memory, each one a painful reminder of what he's missing. Even the books on his shelves seem to mock him, as if they hold secrets he'll never uncover. Her favorite novel, which she'd lent him countless times before, lies open on the desk, a cruel joke. Each time he looks at it, he feels like he's drowning in grief, unable to escape the memories that haunt him. Every step through these halls feels like walking through a graveyard, where every creak of the floorboards makes me feel like I'm being watched by ghosts. It's like living in a nightmare, trapped in a world that no longer belongs to me.
