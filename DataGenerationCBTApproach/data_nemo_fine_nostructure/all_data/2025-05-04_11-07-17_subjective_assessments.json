His mind kept replaying the moment he let the cat in, wondering how many times he'd done this before without thinking twice about it. The thought made him feel even more embarrassed."

He closed his eyes, remembering the look of pride on his wife's face when their child walked across the stage, diploma in hand. His gaze drifted back to the photo as he placed it gently back into its frame. His mind began to wander, imagining how different things might be if he had balanced work and family life. What if he had taken more time off during those early years? Maybe his daughter wouldn't feel so lost now. He couldn't help but wonder if this was all his fault - if he'd been too focused on his career, leaving her alone to raise their child. As he stood there, lost in thought, he realized that maybe some things weren't meant to change. The past was just that – the past. It was over. All he could do was move forward, one step at a time. But for now, he held onto that photo, cherishing memories of a simpler time, even as he knew he couldn’t go back."

Why can't he see how much I love him? Or why is he so distant lately? I thought we had talked about this, but maybe he doesn't care anymore. Maybe he's tired of me, like he was before. I know he's been stressed lately, but what if he's giving up on us? He always promised to be there for me, to support me through thick and thin. But is he really still committed to us? Does he even think about me anymore? I try to remind myself that he might have valid reasons for acting differently, but I don't want to hear them right now.
