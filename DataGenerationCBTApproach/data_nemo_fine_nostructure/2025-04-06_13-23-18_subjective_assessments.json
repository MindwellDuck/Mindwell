The silence is heavy, punctuated only by the ticking of a clock he can't bear to wind anymore. He hasn't painted since she left, three years ago today. Today was supposed to be his masterpiece. Instead, it's just another empty day.",

I've tried so hard to keep up with her pace, but every time I think about how beautiful our art could be together, I get overwhelmed. My heart isn't in it anymore. Every brush stroke feels forced, like I'm trying to recreate something that doesn't exist. It's not me anymore; I'm just pretending to be someone I'll never be again. This is why I avoid painting altogether. If I even try, I feel like I'm failing her memory. She loved everything about art—every moment spent in front of a canvas, every emotion pouring onto the page. I can barely stand to look at mine now, let alone create something new. Why would I want to? I'll never match her talent. And besides, what's the point? I already lost her, and now I'm losing myself too. Every day feels like an eternity, and yet, I'm still waiting for the day when we'll meet again. That's all I care about. There's no use in continuing if I won't ever see her smile again. I wish there was a way to turn back time, but that's not possible. All I can do is wait, and maybe someday I'll find the strength to start again. But until then, I'll just sit here, staring at this blank canvas,"

No big deal. She can find someone else to go after. That's what these sources are for anyway - to feed the media machine. But still, why did they cancel on me? Don't they know how much work goes into getting a story like this? Doesn't it mean anything? I hate people like that. Always making promises and breaking them, never showing up. They think they're above everyone else because they have connections. Newsflash: you're just another nobody trying to make a name for yourself by screwing others. Just another clickbait piece for those attention-seeking outlets. And honestly, I don't really care anymore. Why waste my breath? Maybe I'm just too tired to bother. Or maybe it’s all just part of the game. Whatever, I’ll just move on. I’ll find something better. I’m not going to let this one thing bring me down. I won’t let them win. Not today."

A familiar prickle of unease crawled up his spine. Last night, he'd sworn he heard footsteps outside their bedroom door after he'd turned off the lights. His wife, always a sound sleeper, hadn't stirred. He shook off the thought, but the coffee tasted bitter, like betrayal. As he left for work, he noticed the neighbor's curtains twitching, as if they were watching him leave. The city seemed quieter today, conspiratorial in its silence. His pager beeped; an emergency at the hospital. He felt a cold sweat gather on his brow. They knew something, didn't they? They all did.",

That would be unfair, and he knows it. But the more he tries to rationalize it away, the more he feels like he’s being compared unfavorably to those around him - the other nurses, the doctors, even his own family members who have never experienced anything remotely similar. Everyone seems to have their lives together, while he struggles with these irrational fears that keep him awake at night. It’s ridiculous, really - no one else has ever mentioned anything unusual happening at the hospital, let alone in their own home. Still, he can’t shake the feeling that he’s somehow falling behind, that everyone else is moving forward with ease while he’s stuck in this rut of paranoia. Maybe if he could just relax, focus on the present moment instead of dwelling on past worries, things would settle down. But the more he tries to convince himself otherwise, the more he feels like he’s failing in comparison."

I bet it's just a wrong number, right? So what if it's actually someone special? Like, what if this is the start of something new for both of us? I hope it's not a date. That would make things awkward. But what if it's a friend from college? Or even a coworker? They could have forgotten to add me in the group chat. Yeah, that's probably it. Anyway, let's enjoy the rest of the meal, and I'll ask her later if she wants to talk about it. We can always ask her more details, right? Maybe she got a job offer or something.
