It sounded like something falling, perhaps a book off the nightstand. Her heart immediately started to race. What if her husband had fallen? Or worse, what if he hadn't moved all day while she was gone? She quickly took the stairs two at a time, worry etched on her face.",

As she ran up the stairs, she felt a little anxious about what she might find. The noise seemed small, but her mind immediately went to worst-case scenarios—what if someone had broken into her house or that her husband wasn’t feeling well? She pushed those thoughts aside as irrational, but they lingered in the back of her head. When she reached the top of the stairs, she saw nothing out of the ordinary—a book had indeed fallen off the nightstand, and that was it. But even after finding no evidence of trouble, her initial worry didn’t fully dissipate. She couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more going on than she knew, and she found herself mentally replaying every possible situation that could’ve led to the sound. Despite knowing she overreacted, she couldn’t help but feel a lingering sense of unease."

Yet, now, he found himself alone, the silence oppressive. Guilt crept in, like an unwelcome guest, reminding him of the promises he’d made. He hadn't retired yet; instead, he continued to cook for others, keeping the flame alive. Maybe he was just holding onto the past, refusing to let go. The potatoes seemed to pile up before him, a physical manifestation of the weight he carried. He could almost hear her voice, urging him to move forward, but the pain lingered, making every step feel heavy. As he worked, his mind wandered. He imagined what she would think if she saw him now—a man who couldn't even cook for his own family. Her memory fueled his determination, but it also kept him rooted in the past. With each potato peeled, he felt like he was slowly burying the grief, but the ache remained. The room fell silent again, except for the hum of the refrigerator and the soft lapping of"

It wasn’t until she saw herself in those moments, standing alone with nothing but the echo of memories, that she realized how much she’d been living in his shadow.

If I was lucky enough to live another 50 years, I would be dead by then anyway. I have no reason to be optimistic about my future, but at least I can say I’ve lived a good life so far. I didn't want to die young, but now that I think about it, maybe being dead at a younger age wasn't such a bad thing after all. Now I get to experience more life than most people. Life is pretty short, and I've already had some close calls. I'm just waiting for the next one. I feel like there's always going to be something waiting around the corner for me. I’m not even really afraid anymore; I just accept that this is what’s meant to happen. At this point, I might as well just give up and wait for death to come along whenever it does. After all, it’s not like I have anything better to look forward to. What’s the point of keeping living if nothing good ever comes your way? This isn’t going to change anytime soon.

The fact that his partner gets to wear the badge he wanted is just cruel. They'll be laughing at me behind my back soon enough. How could they? Doesn't anyone see what I've been through? Everyone is against me, and I'm the one who deserves everything. This is my chance to finally prove them wrong. Now, I have no choice but to act, to make things right, even if it means taking drastic measures. I won't let myself feel sorry for him anymore; he wouldn't want me to suffer like this. His death wasn't fair anyway, so why should I feel sad? If anything, I deserve to be happy now. That's how it works. Everyone else has gotten theirs, and now it's mine. Life isn't fair, and I know what it feels like to lose everything you love. But I won't stay down; I won't let people think they're better than me.

Her mind raced with thoughts of all the times she'd worked tirelessly, never receiving such recognition.
