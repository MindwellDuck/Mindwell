They say they need space, time to think about themselves, to figure out what they really want from life. You understand, wanting to give them room to breathe, to find themselves, to rediscover who they are outside of your relationship. But then, you realize that the space you gave turned into distance, and the time became years. What if she had seen it coming? Would she have prepared herself? Would she have accepted it sooner? Or would she have held on longer, clinging to something that was no longer hers? Shouldn't she have been able to see how his absence was affecting her? How could she not have sensed that he wasn’t truly ready to leave? Maybe she should have forced him to stay, made him confront the pain he was causing her. But would that have changed anything? Would she still be here, waiting for someone who was never meant to stay? What if she had been more understanding? More patient? Did she deserve that kind of treatment? If she had given him more space, maybe things wouldn’t have fallen apart so quickly. Maybe she could have found a way to make it work, to hold onto him even when he wanted out.

The frustration had been building all week; she'd tried to troubleshoot the issue countless times, but nothing seemed to work. Now, as she stared blankly at the screen, she couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work still ahead. \"Why does this always happen?\" she wondered aloud. \"Can't I just have one moment of peace?\" As she sat there, her mind began to spiral, replaying every time the computer had malfunctioned, each incident more frustrating than the last. It wasn't just the technical issues themselves that were piling up – it was the hours wasted trying to fix them, the endless emails sent to IT support, the stress of dealing with patients who were already anxious enough. Her thoughts swirled around her, like a stormy sea, each wave crashing down harder than the last. In her head, she was starting to see herself as a victim, constantly plagued by misfortune, never able to catch a break. She felt like she was drowning in a sea of problems, unable to find a lifeline. Even when she took a deep breath and told herself, \"This too shall pass,\" her thoughts wouldn't let her go.

As if weighed down by an invisible burden, every stroke now seemed forced, each color applied with a sense of obligation rather than passion. Every time he looked at the canvas, he saw the ghost of what used to be, the lingering shadow of what could have been – a reminder that this latest piece might never truly live up to its potential. Even Martha noticed, her gentle touch a subtle rebuke to the feeling of stagnation that had settled within him. She'd always been his rock, but now she seemed distant, as if even her love could no longer bridge the gap between the man who once created masterpieces and the artist whose mind felt stuck in a rut."

Her words were laced with disdain, each phrase dripping with condescension, as if she was trying to strip away everything he held dear, revealing the emptiness within.

Every glance, every comment, it felt like she was reading minds, knowing secrets I kept hidden. I couldn't shake off the feeling that she saw right through the facade I built around myself, the layers of guilt and shame I'd worked tirelessly to conceal. Her presence made me feel like I was drowning in her judgment.

She felt lost, unsure which path to take, trapped between two worlds: the one she built for us, and the one I built for myself. The memories lingered, both sweet and bitter, reminding her of what could have been if she’d only kept going. But now, the emptiness seemed to grow with each passing year, a constant reminder of what she’d lost, and what she might lose again. In this moment, all she wanted was to turn back time, to relive the moments we shared, to feel his touch, to hear his voice, to see the smile that lit up my world. Yet, even as she longed for the past, a part of her knew that she couldn’t change the course of events. It was already set in motion, whether she liked it or not. And so, she began to paint, not"
