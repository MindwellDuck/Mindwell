We must support one another in times like these. * I’m just thankful that I was able to make her feel safer than usual.

Maybe if I were more like them, I could bring him closer to them, but I feel like I'm constantly falling behind. They always seem to find common ground, whether it's work or hobbies or life events. When I suggest doing something together, he usually declines, saying he's too busy or tired. I don't push it because deep down, I know he prefers spending time with them.

In contrast, **Subjective** involves individual perspectives shaped by experiences, emotions, and beliefs, often influenced by personal biases. Lastly, **Reasoning** encompasses logical explanations, connecting ideas through evidence-based arguments. ## Step 1: Identify the primary emotion associated with the situation. - Numbness indicates emotional detachment, suggesting a lack of strong feelings towards the subject (him). - This initial response suggests that the narrator might not feel strongly enough about ending the relationship to have a clear motivation for doing so, which could imply a sense of detachment or resignation rather than intense anger or sadness"

Her tone came across as forced, almost rehearsed. It didn't resonate with me; it felt like something she would say if she thought it would make me happy. I wondered how many times she'd practiced those lines before finally deciding to write them down. This isn't my wife's voice, no matter how much it feels like it. There's an artificial quality to her words, like a mask she wore for our sake. Even her memories seem staged, as if she's trying to convince herself more than anyone else. I can sense the desperation behind each sentence, the need to hold onto us, even if it means manipulating reality. If she truly loved me, she wouldn't have needed to resort to such tactics. Every time I read about her, I'm left wondering why we never lived up to the dreams she had for us. It's hard not to feel betrayed when I realize how far off our reality was from her idealized version of our relationship.
