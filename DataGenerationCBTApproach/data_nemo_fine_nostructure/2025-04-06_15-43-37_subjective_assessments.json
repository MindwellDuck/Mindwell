The memory of him sitting alone at the table, eyes fixed on some other world, haunted her. It wasn't just one incident; she remembered countless times he seemed lost in thought, never truly present. Even when he did smile, it felt forced, like he was holding back something inside. She wondered if she’d ever really known him at all."

My life has become a constant reminder of my failures, and the lack of attention from the crowd reinforced those feelings. It just feels like no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be able to succeed.

She picked up his favorite mug from the counter, turning it over in her hands before placing it gently back down. A tear slipped down her cheek as she reached for her own mug, a chipped remnant from her grandmother's collection. As she filled it with the leftover stew she'd made for dinner, she caught sight of their reflection in the window—one figure, one shadow.

I tried to focus on the task at hand—preparing dinner—but my eyes kept drifting back to the spot where he usually sat. The silence was deafening, and I couldn't help but wonder if we were truly meant to be together. I sighed, trying to push the thoughts away, but they lingered, haunting me like a ghost.

Yeah, definitely for recognition; he doesn’t actually care about exposing anything new. This whole thing has just become a personal vendetta against me, hasn't it?

Avoid making it too obvious since we're trying to simulate real-life reactions. Also, keep the tone conversational but respectful. Thank you! :) Edit: For clarity, the task was to demonstrate Mind Reading through the character’s internal monologue. So, here are two revised responses: **Response 1** He must remember everything perfectly. I can see him recalling every detail, every word, every gesture. He remembers exactly how it felt to be silenced, how it burned inside him. It wasn’t just a minor setback; it was a career ender. Now, he’s back, and I’m sure he’ll never let go of that anger. Every time he looks at me, he sees the injustice of it all, the betrayal of trust. And now, with this nomination, he’s rubbing it in. Yes, he nominated himself, and he knows"
