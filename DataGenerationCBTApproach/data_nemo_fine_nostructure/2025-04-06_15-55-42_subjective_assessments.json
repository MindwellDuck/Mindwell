I can’t believe I missed his call earlier today when I was too busy dealing with my own workload. Now this is what happens when you’re always running around and never take time for yourself. I need to go see him right away and get everything sorted out. I hope no one else sees how frazzled I am. I don’t want them to think less of me. Maybe if I hurry, I can pretend I wasn’t really struggling before coming here. But honestly, I know I’ve been neglecting everyone lately, and now I’ll just add his situation to the list. I wish I could tell him I’d rather focus on my work right now, but I guess I’ll just have to swallow my pride and rush over. This isn’t fair; I should be able to handle both responsibilities.

It's hard to know if this is just his imagination playing tricks on him or something more real. Either way, things are looking grim for both of them. We've had our share of fights recently, and there's no telling when they'll start again. It doesn't seem right that he would choose her favorite mug after all these arguments. Maybe he thinks it's a sign, trying to bring back some semblance of peace before things fall apart completely. But deep down, he knows better - every decision made in the past has led us here, where we can't escape the inevitable. The thought of losing her keeps him awake at night, wondering how much longer he can hold on. Even now, as he holds onto this mug, it feels like a fragile lifeline, holding together threads that are slowly unraveling. She'll leave him eventually, and nothing will ever be the same again. We've seen signs before, but this time it feels different. I'm not sure if she's even still interested, but somehow he hopes she is. It's a futile hope, though. Nothing good comes from holding onto someone who doesn't want you anymore. They"

Every step into the ward felt like a betrayal, as if he was abandoning the very patients he swore to protect. The weight of responsibility, once so easy to bear, now crushed him, forcing him to confront the ghosts of his own making—those who'd suffered under his leadership. The badge, once a source of pride, now hung as a bitter reminder of all he’d left behind. It wasn’t just a relic; it represented the life he thought he knew, the one he’d chosen to leave behind. Yet, in reality, it remained a part of him, a painful reminder of the decisions that had led him down this path."
