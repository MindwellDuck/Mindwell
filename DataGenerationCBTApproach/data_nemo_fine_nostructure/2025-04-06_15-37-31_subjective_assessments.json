She always made us feel like second-class citizens when they came over. And now I know why—she was his mistress all along.\" \"I wonder if there are other secrets hidden in his old office files. Maybe there’s more than just a business trip to Japan in 2018. There could be evidence of another affair...or worse. What if she was already married when he started seeing her?\" The thought sends shivers down her spine as she imagines the consequences of such a betrayal. \"I guess this means our marriage isn’t valid after all. He was lying to me for years, and now I can finally understand why. I’m not surprised though; he was always too good to be true. I knew he wasn’t perfect, but this takes it to a whole new level. We were so happy together, but I didn't really see him. At least not until now...\" It looks like this person has no idea how much they’re giving away with these thoughts, but at least it gives them closure. They’ve been carrying around this secret for decades, and now they can finally say, “Well,"

Hours of debugging yielded no results, each error message felt like a personal affront. His late wife's voice echoed in his mind, \"You could always figure it out before.\" Frustration bubbled up as he slammed his fist on the desk, the monitor wobbling precariously. He hadn't touched her things since she passed, but today he found himself in their old study, surrounded by her books and knick-knacks, everything neatly dusted yet untouched for years.

She had been gone for months now, but it still felt like yesterday when he received the news. The pain never seemed to lessen; if anything, it grew stronger with time. Every moment without her felt like an eternity. Even though he tried to keep busy, focusing on work and hobbies, nothing seemed to fill the void left by her passing. The memories of happy times together lingered, making it harder to accept that she was truly gone. He wondered if he would ever feel whole again, or if he’d be stuck in this limbo forever.

Her focus shifted to her own life, where her children were grown and independent. Instead of dwelling on what she had lost, she celebrated the milestones achieved by others. Her mind began to wander, comparing every moment since then to hers. Every couple seemed perfect, each marriage flawless. She felt like a failure for being alone, despite having lived a full life. The realization made her angry—how could society expect her to be content? Every reminder of her isolation fueled resentment toward those who found love easily. As she walked through the hospital, her emotions intensified. She saw couples holding hands, laughing together, and it only strengthened her anger. Why did they get to experience joy while she was left behind? This cycle of comparison and anger continued throughout her visit, making her feel bitter about her fate. When her son came to pick her up, he tried to lighten the mood with stories of other patients, but nothing could ease the frustration building inside. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was meant to have shared experiences like him, not been left out forever. The contrast between his happiness and her sadness deepened, and she became convinced that she would always miss out. In this state, she barely noticed her surroundings. She didn't appreciate the beauty around her or even care about the purpose of her visit. All she felt was pain"

They were meant to be together, to build a life, but now it seemed impossible. She could see herself standing alone in their home, wondering what had happened, feeling lost and scared. She thought about all the times he’d disappeared, how each time she tried to reach him, he was there, waiting patiently. But this time, he left without saying anything. No goodbye, no explanation. Just a note, scribbled quickly, telling her he couldn’t stay. She remembered the way he used to smile at her, the way he held her hand when things got tough. Now, those memories felt hollow. She wondered if she had done something wrong, if she had pushed him away. Had she been too demanding? Too critical? Or was it something deeper, something he couldn’t handle? She began to think about the days leading up to this, the arguments they’d had, the fights over small things. It seemed so insignificant now, but then it made sense. Maybe he was tired of fighting, tired of being trapped in an apartment filled with memories of happier times. She saw glimps"

Sometimes, late at night, when the world outside felt quiet, he'd let himself drift into those \"what ifs.\" They always led back to the same conclusion: that life would have been easier if things had gone differently. But deep down, he knew it wasn't true. Life is never easy, and some days are harder than others. Still, the thoughts lingered, haunting him. It wasn't just about the past; sometimes, in the present, he'd find himself wondering how different things might become if certain events unfolded differently. For instance, imagine if he had taken that job offer years ago instead of turning it down. Or think about how different things might get if he made a different choice today. Those kinds of thoughts kept him up at night, making him feel restless. It was almost as if he was trying to hold onto something that was already lost, holding on tightly to the hope that somehow, someway, things would turn around.

This isn't like him to suggest something like this. He never spoke highly of her work before. Why now? And what's the point of speaking when she won't get to tell him herself how proud she is? Does she really want to go through the hassle of preparing a speech anyway? What if this is all some cruel joke? Maybe he's just playing a trick on her. Or maybe he's trying to make me look bad by suggesting I speak here. After all, he wasn't exactly supportive of my career path.
