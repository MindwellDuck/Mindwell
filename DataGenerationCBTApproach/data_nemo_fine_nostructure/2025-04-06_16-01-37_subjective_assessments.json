Suddenly, her editor appears at her desk, his brow furrowed. \"We need this now,\" he demands, pointing at her half-finished article.

What if we have to cancel everything because she's too busy? I can feel my anxiety spiking, my hands shaking slightly as I type. This is getting out of control. I know I'm stressed, but why does it always have to be her? Can't she just get things done on time? I swear, every day it's the same thing - she's late, she's distracted, she's always so busy. It's like she doesn't even care about us anymore. Maybe we should just break up before it's too late. I try to focus on the task at hand, but my brain keeps jumping to conclusions. Is she really ignoring me? Does she hate me that much? Why can't she just get her act together? I feel like I'm losing my mind here. I've tried to talk to her about it before, but she just brushes it off, saying she's fine. But I know she's not. I can see it in her eyes when she looks tired all the time, or when she's barely paying attention during our conversations. It's like she's living in some kind of bubble, oblivious to everything else going on around her. And now"

It’s been months since she left, but he can’t help feeling like time is moving backwards. Maybe this drawing is more than just a leftover from class—it’s a reminder that she’s always watching over him. The way he holds it tight, almost like a talisman, suggests he’s holding onto something precious. This could be a sign that he needs to reconnect with what truly matters—his children, perhaps? Or maybe it’s a signal that he needs to start rebuilding his life again? Whatever it is, it feels personal, and that’s why he’s holding onto it so tightly. The pain of losing her still lingers, but in moments like these, it feels like a spark of hope—that there’s still a place for love in his life."

It was foolish, clinging to memories that were gone forever. He wondered if maybe she had always meant to leave. Maybe she never truly loved us, not enough to stay. That realization felt like a weight, crushing him. But it wasn't all bad; now they could both move forward, free from each other. His mind wrestled with the idea, trying to find comfort in it."

It didn't matter how hard she tried; she just couldn't seem to break free from her pattern of being used for her looks. Even now, as she stood there watching him leave, all she could think about was how he'd never loved her for anything else—just her physical appearance. This wasn't just some fleeting crush; this was a guy who'd spent countless nights with her, laughing together over drinks, sharing secrets, and supporting each other through life's ups and downs. Yet, somehow, he'd always managed to see right through her facade, to the vulnerable person beneath. Now, as the rain poured down around her, washing away everything they'd built together, she realized he'd seen more than just a pretty face—a glimpse of a soul she'd long kept hidden, even from those closest to her. But deep down, she knew she'd never truly changed. She still wore her heart on her sleeve, ready to be hurt again, because she’d learned that no matter how hard you try, you can’t escape your past forever. And so, here she was, clinging to what little remained of him, holding onto something that would soon disappear like the raindrops falling from the sky."

I've been trying my best to take care of everything, but it's overwhelming. I guess I need to take a deep breath and remember that some things are outside of my control. Hopefully, tomorrow will be easier. * I feel so anxious when people ask me if I’ve noticed anything unusual. It’s like I’m being put on the spot. Even though my husband has been acting strange, I still try to stay optimistic and focus on what we already know. We did have some issues with communication last week, but I thought we resolved those problems before coming here today. Now, I wonder if we missed something important because of those misunderstandings. It’s hard not to worry about whether we’re doing enough to support each other.
