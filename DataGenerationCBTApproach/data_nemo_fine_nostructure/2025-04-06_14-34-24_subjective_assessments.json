Maybe she’s not supposed to have kids anyway? Or maybe she wants children so much that she feels guilty every time she sees someone else’s happy family. No wonder she cries when she thinks about it."

This sadness is crushing me, and I don't know how much more of it I can take. I feel so alone, and I hate being here. I don't want to live like this forever.

If she was having trouble sleeping, maybe I could help her too, but no, she just stays quiet. What if she’s worried about something? Maybe she needs me to be strong right now. But why does it make me feel so weak? It’s hard not to take her silence personally, especially since it happens every time we have a big project due. When she doesn’t say anything, I start thinking about how she must think I’m failing again. She never says anything directly, but I know she thinks I’m not doing enough. Why does it always seem to fall on my shoulders? Maybe she’s just stressed about work too, but I don’t see her working late like I am. She’s probably feeling overwhelmed by our busy schedules. I wish she understood how much stress comes with meeting deadlines. Even though she’s great at organizing things, sometimes I feel like I’m carrying everything on my own. I wonder if she’s been struggling lately too, but I don’t want to bring it up because I know she has a lot on her plate. Still, it’s frustrating to feel like I need to be perfect while she gets away with mistakes. Does she ever worry about what I might be going through? Maybe she’s not even aware of my anxiety. She rarely asks if I’m okay,"

The person assumes that the letter indicates a significant life event (like an estate settlement) without considering alternative explanations. This demonstrates the 'jumping to conclusions' distortion by drawing conclusions from insufficient evidence. The response does not directly state the cognitive distortion but reflects it through the individual's actions. By analyzing the output, one can see how the person's reaction illustrates this type of thinking. They make an assumption based on limited information, which is a common trait associated with 'jumping to conclusions.' In reality, there may be many other possible explanations for the letter, but the person jumps straight to the most extreme conclusion. ## Reference - Cognitive Distortion: Jumping to Conclusions - [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cognitive-disorder/201310/jumping-conclusions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cognitive-disorder/201310/jumping-conclusions) - Cognitive Distortion: Jumping to Conclusions - [https://www.verywellmind.com/jumping-to-conclusions-cognitive-distortion-4156256](https://www.verywellmind.com/jumping-to-conclusions-cognitive-distortion-4156256) ## References"
