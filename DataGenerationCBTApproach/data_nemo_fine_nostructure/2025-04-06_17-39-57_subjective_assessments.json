The caller ID read \"Unknown\". He hesitated, then answered, his heart pounding like a drum in his chest. A voice, distant and echoing, asked for her by name. Panic surged through him like wildfire as he realized no one had used that name since she'd left. His breath came in ragged gasps, the lab spinning around him. He dropped the phone, gripping the edge of the table to steady himself, but his fingers slipped on the cold metal surface. The world was closing in, suffocating him.",

Every time he wakes up, the images linger, making it hard to shake off the feeling of dread that follows. It’s like they’re trying to tell me something, but I don’t know what. Maybe it’s just my subconscious working overtime, processing all the stress from work and life. But still, those dreams keep coming back, each one more intense than the last. There’s this sense of being watched, always. It makes me feel uneasy, like I’m walking through shadows instead of light. I try to push them away, but they stay with me, haunting every step I take."

I remember when we were kids, he would sometimes tell us stories about how he used to be just like us, but those days seemed to fade away quickly. Now, looking back, it's clear that he wasn't truly invested in us; he was just going through the motions. Even though he taught us everything from math to literature, he didn’t care enough to show real enthusiasm. His disinterest made learning feel more like a chore than an opportunity to grow. He'd lecture without passion, and when we asked questions, he'd simply dismiss them with a wave of his hand, making us feel unheard and unimportant. It wasn't until later, when I stumbled upon some old family photos, that I realized why he acted that way—his own childhood hadn't been easy. His parents had passed away early, leaving him to fend for himself. This explained why he kept people at arm’s length, using his strict demeanor to mask the pain he carried within. But even this understanding couldn't change the fact that he failed to inspire me. The lessons felt hollow, and I often wondered if I was the only one who noticed his lack of genuine connection."

He pulls out her favorite vase, now chipped and dull, and places it gently on the desk.

He feels the familiar chill, a creeping dread that no amount of logic can dispel. His heart sinks, the weight of loneliness pressing down on him like a physical force. He looks at the vase, then at his empty ring finger, and feels a wave of hopelessness wash over him.",

But I wasn't enough. What's wrong with me? Shouldn't I have seen it coming? Shouldn't I have prepared myself for the pain? It's all my fault—my failure as a partner, my inability to hold onto her. She shouldn't have moved on. She owes me that. Doesn't everyone owe me something after what I gave them? I deserve better than this. She should've stayed, and I should have fought harder. This isn’t fair. Life never treats us equally. Why must I suffer when others seem to thrive? I'm the one who's been hurt, but why doesn't anyone care? Everyone else gets a second chance; why not me? I should have gotten more time with her, but instead I'm left here alone, facing another winter without her by my side. Why does life do this to me? If only she’d given me a chance… Shouldn’t she have understood how much I loved her? How hard I tried? Why didn’t she see that I was worth saving? She should have stayed because she knew"
