I'm starting to think he doesn't care about our relationship because of all these small things. Maybe I shouldn't even be here, making an effort for someone who clearly doesn't appreciate it. It's exhausting trying to clean after him. He never helps, and now that I think about it, I don't really want to try anymore."

The fact that they were laughing at this made things worse; how could they find it funny? She felt like she'd been punched right in the gut, and her anger was building into something much bigger.

What if there was an error in the identification process, and they were actually someone else? These thoughts sent me into a spiral of anxiety, with each \"what if\" leading to another, spiraling downward into a sea of uncertainty. I felt my heart racing, my breath quickening, and my vision blurring as I struggled to keep up with the endless stream of possibilities. It was as if my brain had taken over, creating scenarios where the dead were somehow still among us, and I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. Despite my best efforts to focus on the task at hand, these intrusive thoughts continued to plague me, making it difficult to concentrate on anything other than the hypothetical scenarios unfolding before my eyes. My body tensed up, and I could feel the tightness spreading throughout my chest, as if my very existence was being squeezed by an invisible force. In the end, I found myself trapped in a cycle of fear and doubt, unable to fully immerse myself in the reality around me. It wasn't until I took a deep breath and reminded myself of the present moment that I slowly managed to calm down, but not before the \"what ifs\" had left their mark on my psyche."

The fact that her paint was still wet suggested she hadn't cleaned up after herself yet, but that could also be because she was tired and hadn't wanted to disturb me. Why would she leave the door open? Did I lock it when I went out last night? That's ridiculous; I would never forget to lock the studio door. She must have done it by mistake. If I wasn't there, why did she think I'd be upset by the canvas being there? It's just a stupid oversight. She doesn't know anything about art; what does she know about painting? Maybe she thinks I'm some kind of idiot who can't take care of himself. Maybe this is all just part of some larger plan to drive me crazy. I've always suspected she was plotting something behind my back. This is probably her way of getting under my skin. I'll show her. I'll paint something just as good, if not better, than hers, and then we'll see whose work really matters. This isn't personal at all; it's just a stupid misunderstanding. I need to calm down before I say something I regret."

She must have planned this months ago while I was out of the lab, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. I'm going to confront her about it right now and see if I can catch her off guard.

It doesn't matter if it's something big or small – he tends to get anxious beforehand, almost always. Whenever he thinks about upcoming tasks, especially those that are urgent, he can't help but feel some level of unease. His mind starts racing with thoughts of how things won't go well, and he often wonders if everything will fall apart. It's become such a pattern for him that he sometimes finds himself feeling this way even when there's no actual reason to be concerned. This isn't limited to work either; he experiences similar feelings when he knows he has something important to do outside of work, too. Even though it's usually related to school projects or other responsibilities, he still gets a knot in his stomach because he worries about not doing enough or not meeting expectations. The more he tries to remind himself it's just anxiety, the more it feels like a habit that's hard to break."

They're just being lazy, and you can't trust them anymore. You feel angry because they didn't put the milk back; you were counting on having some milk left over for your tea tonight, and now you won't have it. You start thinking about how this might be a sign of deeper problems in the relationship - maybe he doesn't care enough to get small things right, like putting away the milk bottle after use. This is just another example of his lack of responsibility and care for our household. You can't let him off the hook that easily. He needs to learn that he can't just take advantage of you like this. How could someone who's supposed to be my partner do such a thing? It's not fair, and you're starting to think that he must be cheating on you or lying to you somehow. The fact that he didn't put the milk back shows that he's not as committed to the relationship as you thought. Now you're worried about whether there are other signs he's hiding from you - maybe he's not even trying to keep your apartment clean, or maybe he's keeping secrets about his"

He’s made peace with that. When people say things like “You’re strong” or “It could be worse,” they don’t really understand. They think they do, but they don’t. This man lives every day as if he were already dead, making each moment count. He doesn’t have time for small pleasures or regrets. Life is short, and he’s cut it down to its bare essentials. He’s not here to waste time or feel guilty about the past. He’s living in the present, and that’s all that matters. He can’t help but look at himself with a mix of sadness and resignation. He sees the lines and wrinkles, the grey hair, and the weight he gained over the years. It’s a reminder that time keeps moving forward, and he can’t stop it. But even so, he wouldn’t want to go back. What would he change? Everything he’s experienced has shaped him into who he is today. He wouldn’t trade those moments for anything. This man feels lost, but in a good way. He misses being young"
