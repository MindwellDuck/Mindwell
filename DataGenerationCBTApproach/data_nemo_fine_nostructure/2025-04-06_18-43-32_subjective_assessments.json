Every time we plan something, she changes her mind. My friends don't cancel plans like this; they prioritize us. This is why I feel like I'm not good enough for her. I know it sounds petty, but I've tried so hard to be patient and understanding. If anything, I'm too nice and give her space when she needs it. But it doesn’t stop her from ignoring me. That's why I feel like I’m invisible sometimes. Even though we’ve talked about scheduling things around each other, she still cancels or reschedules. It’s frustrating because I know I want to spend time with her, but my efforts don’t seem to matter. I wonder if there’s someone else who gets her attention more easily than I do."

I wonder if he knows anyone who could buy it from him. Maybe they could give it to some new family to start fresh?

It wasn’t just the lack of morning light that weighed him down; it was the emptiness of it all—of the world, of his life. Every day felt like a repetition of yesterday, and yesterday had been a blur of nothingness. He tried to shake off the lethargy by focusing on the tasks ahead—a new project at work, meetings with clients he didn't know well, and the looming deadline. But even the thought of those things couldn't chase away the feeling of being lost in time. As he drifted back into sleep, the city outside continued its relentless march forward, oblivious to his pain. In the distance, cars honked, people chattered, and the constant drone of the city’s energy seemed to mock him. His mind wandered, and before he knew it, he was wide awake again, lying in bed, surrounded by the silence of an abandoned home. There was no comfort in the stillness, just the haunting realization that time kept moving while he was stuck in limbo. This was how every Sunday started now—the same routine, the same feelings, and yet somehow different. Nothing changed, but everything felt more oppressive. The silence had become a living entity, one that reminded him of what he'd lost and what he might never regain. As the day dragged on, he found himself counting down until bedtime, when maybe, just maybe, he could"
