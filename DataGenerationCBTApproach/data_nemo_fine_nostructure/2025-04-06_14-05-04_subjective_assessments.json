The pain she’d tried to hide for so long now felt overwhelming, making her wonder if she truly cared enough. Had she been pretending all along? Had she been just going through the motions? It was as if she’d lost herself in the process of grieving. Her mind kept replaying the arguments, the fights, and the moments where she thought she could handle everything by herself. But the truth was, she couldn’t. She needed him, but now he was gone. The thought sent a chill down her spine, making her feel like she was drowning in a sea of regret. Shouldn’t she have listened more? Shouldn’t she have held him closer when he needed comfort? Shouldn’t she have seen this coming? Every day felt like a test, and she failed. Each time she picked up the watch, it reminded her of what she’d missed. He deserved better than someone who couldn’t even hold on to life. What if she had done things differently? What if she’d been there for him instead of pushing him away? The questions swirled in her head, making it hard to breathe. She felt trapped in her"

Was it something I said or did that made him feel like he could no longer stay? Every time we worked together, I felt like I was getting closer to understanding him. But now, I'm left with an unsettling feeling that I failed him somehow. Maybe it was because I never really got to know him beyond our work hours. Did I miss opportunities to connect with him as a person? Or was there something more I could have done to prevent this? I keep replaying memories of us working together, trying to find clues. When did things start going downhill? Was it when I suggested a new approach that didn't quite click, or maybe it was after he disagreed with me on a project? I can't shake off the feeling that I've let him down, that I should have been more supportive. What if I had just reached out more? Would he still be here? I don’t want to think about what’s happening next. I’m scared to see him leave, and I fear that I’ve lost my chance to make things right. I keep wondering if I could have done better, if I could have been more understanding, or if I missed signs that"

It didn't help seeing them on social media, posting about their weekend adventures. My mind keeps wandering back to what could've been if we still dated. I feel like every time I see someone else in a relationship, I'm reminded of all the times she ghosted me. That guy looks like he has everything—good job, good friends, and a beautiful partner.

I felt so frustrated listening to her; I couldn’t stand being scolded like this. I knew I had been struggling lately, but I didn’t think it was that bad. Now I realized just how much I needed to work on myself. It was hard to keep my temper in check during our meeting, especially when she kept bringing up all these things I’d done wrong.

Sometimes, I wonder if anyone else notices these issues, or am I the only one who cares? If everyone else knew about them, maybe things wouldn’t be as bad.
