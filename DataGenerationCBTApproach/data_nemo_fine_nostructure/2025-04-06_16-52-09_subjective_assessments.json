A policeman stands beside it, shaking his head. \"Your husband was in an accident,\" he says, looking away. She feels her legs giving way as he continues, \"He's alive, but... there's nothing we can do.\" Her heart races, yet she feels paralyzed, helpless to reach him, to hold him, to fix this.",

And now he'll be out for days because of all the scabs he'll get from this one. This is going to make everything worse—his work will suffer, and my mother will hate me even more when she finds out. This is so typical of him; he never thinks ahead and never listens to others. Now he'll probably need surgery too. If only he had done what I told him to do before we split up—then none of this would've happened. But no, he had to go and ruin everything by being reckless as usual. It’s going to be a long week, and I can’t wait until this mess blows over. If only he listened to me..."

Now, as he watched people around him enjoying themselves, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was meant to be alone forever. This year was supposed to be different, but now he wondered if it ever truly could be. Every time he saw someone else find love, he felt a twinge of sadness. Why did fate have to play out in such a way? They had talked about starting a family one day, but that seemed like an impossible dream now. The thought hung over him like a cloud, weighing him down with each passing moment. It was as if the universe had conspired against them, pulling them apart once again. What were the chances that they'd run into each other here, in this crowded room filled with strangers? Yet, deep down, he knew it was inevitable. Their paths had crossed before, and they would cross again - perhaps sooner than expected. The possibility sent a shiver through him, making his heart skip a beat. But would it be too late? Would they ever find their way back? He sighed, the sound echoing through the space, a reminder of the loneliness"

It wasn’t just the past that haunted her; every moment felt suffocating. She wished she could disappear into nothingness, leaving behind the pain and the longing. Every glance from strangers made her feel exposed, and the smell of fresh bread only reminded her of what she had lost. She didn’t want to be here anymore, but her feet seemed rooted to the spot. The world around her grew darker, as if night was falling while the sun still shone brightly. Even the sounds of children playing or vendors calling out their daily specials became distant and meaningless. She felt so alone, trapped in her own thoughts, unable to escape. The couple’s laughter echoed in her ears, a harsh reminder of everything she’d left behind. She longed to turn back time, to relive those moments when life was simpler. But now, every memory felt like a knife twisting deeper into her heart. The sound of their happiness cut through her like a blade, tearing her apart further.
