The kitchen, once a sanctuary, had become a battleground. Every step forward felt like a defeat, each failure a testament to the weight of loneliness. As she began to clear the remnants, she couldn’t help but feel a twinge of resentment towards the onion, its bitterness mirroring her own emotional state. The tears that fell were no longer just a result of the onion’s pungency, but a reflection of the desperation within her—a desperate attempt to mask the emptiness that lay beyond the surface. In this moment, the onion became more than just a simple ingredient; it represented the accumulated pain of years, the sum total of all the times life had left her feeling unloved and unwanted. Each tear that fell was a drop of sorrow, a reminder that she wasn’t alone in her struggles, that there were countless others who had suffered silently, their stories hidden behind closed doors. And yet, despite this collective burden, she continued to cook, driven by a fragile hope that perhaps, somehow, this meal might bring solace"

All he wanted was to calm down and enjoy his evening, but the sense of impending doom wouldn’t let him relax. Everything felt so tense, and he knew he needed to find a way to break free from it before it consumed him completely."
