Now I feel even more behind on tasks, which makes things worse. * Why would she send such a thing to someone else? Is she cheating on me? That's what this must mean - she doesn't care about us anymore. If only I had not gotten distracted and shown her message to everyone, none of this would have happened. Now I'll never trust anyone again, especially my own family who knows everything about my personal life. This is all because of my lack of attention and carelessness. * I'm so disappointed in myself for not being careful enough. I'm usually very considerate when sharing private stuff with people, but today I let my stress get the best of me. The fact that it ended up in front of so many people means I need to take responsibility for my mistakes and face the consequences.

The house was quiet, except for the soft hum of the coffeemaker he'd set last night, a habit they'd shared for years. Today would have been their anniversary. He poured his coffee, black like she liked it, then sat alone at the table where they used to plan their weekends together. Her chair remained vacant, her laughter echoing in his mind but not in the silent room. A stray cat outside meowed, its cry raw and plaintive, resonating with his own unspoken sorrow. He stared at the empty seat, his reflection mirrored in the untouched mug across from him.",

It wasn't just the emptiness that bothered him; it was the reminder that some things might never go back to normal. Maybe this is how life will always feel—broken and incomplete. If only I could turn back time... Perhaps I should just leave, go somewhere else. But what if I see her there? Would that change anything? He sighed, feeling like he was drowning in his own thoughts. Every memory seemed bittersweet now, each one a reminder of all he’d lost. Even the small joys, like the way sunlight streamed through the windows, now felt hollow. He looked around the room, trying to find something to distract himself, but everything reminded him of her. His eyes wandered to the photo album on the dresser, filled with pictures of happy moments they’d shared. He opened it, and as he flipped through the pages, tears pricked at the corners of his eyes. Each picture showed a part of their life they couldn’t bring back, no matter how hard he wished. It’s all going downhill, isn’t it? One day you’re happy, the next...this. You can’t even enjoy your coffee anymore because every sip brings back memories of her. Maybe I’ll just stay"

What if she had to explain herself? It was just a party; but these thoughts lingered, clouding her mind. The email seemed so abrupt, almost rude. But maybe this was how things were done now—informal, without invitations? Still, the doubts lingered. What if she tried to attend and found out she'd been left off the guest list? Would everyone know? And what about the class itself? Would anyone notice if she missed? And what if someone else took over and messed things up?
