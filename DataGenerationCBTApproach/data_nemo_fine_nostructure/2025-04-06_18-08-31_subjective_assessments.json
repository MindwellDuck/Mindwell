They weren't touching, but there was a familiarity in their body language that made her stomach churn. She quickly looked away, pretending to study her book, but couldn't help stealing glances. The woman had her hair, his favorite style when they were married.",

It wasn’t just the way he laughed with someone else; it was how he moved beside this woman. Their shoulders almost touched, and his hand brushed against hers as if they’d been holding hands for years. He didn’t pull back, though. He seemed completely comfortable with the situation. When the barista handed over their drinks, he turned around and caught her eye. I guess you could say he smiled. Or maybe it was more like a smirk. Either way, it sent my heart racing. I tried to tell myself it meant nothing, that he was probably just being friendly because they were old friends. But deep down, I knew better. This time, I would let things go. No need to dwell on past hurts. I took a sip of my coffee, closed my eyes, and focused on the warmth spreading through my palms. The woman sitting across from me didn’t seem bothered by what was happening, so why did I have to be? Maybe I was reading too much into it, but that smirk felt intentional. I forced myself to relax, letting my gaze drift toward the window instead. The mental filter kept telling me to focus on the present moment, but my mind kept wandering back to that smile. And then I saw the way she leaned in close to him, her head tilted slightly to his right. Her shoulder pressed against his arm, and I felt a pang of jealousy."

It’s almost as if he didn’t want me to see how much he was looking forward to seeing me tonight. When I ask him what happened, he gives this weirdly casual answer about needing to finish some paperwork. But I can tell there’s more to it than that. The way he looks away, the slight tension in his shoulders, the faint hesitation when he speaks – it all tells a different story. He doesn’t seem entirely convinced by his own explanation, and I wonder if he’s really okay with me coming over right now or if he’s trying to hide something. Maybe he’s still hurting from our last fight? Or maybe he’s worried about missing out on whatever fun we could be having together. Whatever the reason, I can sense a deeper pain behind his words, one that he might not even realize himself yet. It’s hard not to feel like I’m reading between the lines here, like he’s holding back something important. I try to push those thoughts aside, focusing instead on the positive side of things – after all, I am the one who broke up with him first, and I’ve been working so hard to get us back together. Still, I can’t shake off the feeling that there’s more to this story than he’s letting on."

It was like a punch to the gut, but I knew that what really hurt was the lack of explanation. No words of encouragement, no reassurance that everything would be okay. Just a hang-up, leaving me wondering why I ever bothered trying in the first place. The worst part? He never even apologized for hanging up. I couldn't help but feel like I was somehow less than human because he just ended our conversation like it meant nothing, like we were just two random people talking on the phone. To make matters worse, I started thinking about how many times this has happened before. How many times I've called these guys, only to get rejected, left hanging without any real feedback?

I know intellectually that it's all just business, but sometimes I wish someone could see inside my head and understand how I'm really"
