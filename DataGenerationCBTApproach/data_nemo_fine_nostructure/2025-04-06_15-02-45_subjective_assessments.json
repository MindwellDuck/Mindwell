The kid had flirted shamelessly with his wife earlier that day, not knowing she was married to him. He watched from afar as she smiled back, laughing at some joke he couldn't hear. His stomach churned with each chime of the cash register. When they were finally alone in the store, he yanked the receipt book out of her hands and tore it up. \"What's your problem?\" she snapped. He just grunted, \"You're playing with fire,\" before walking away to restock shelves that didn't need it yet.",

That was so unprofessional and disrespectful. And now she’s going to be counting money all over again after he destroyed her papers. This is so bad—she should have known better than to try flirting with our customers. She has no idea what this means for us; we’ve worked together for five years. We’re an amazing team, and now it feels like everything is falling apart. She doesn’t understand how much stress she caused by being so friendly with someone else. It’s not fair. This isn’t over. He will make sure everyone knows what happened here today. This whole situation is going to cause problems between us, and she won’t be able to hide her feelings anymore. It was wrong of her to act like nothing happened. But now she’ll know she can’t fool me. I’m the one who usually gets to talk to the customers. Now, I want to distance myself from her completely. I hope things get better soon, but I don’t trust her anymore. We used to be such good friends, sharing stories and jokes during breaks. Now, every"

The words on that canvas were more than just careless scribbles; they were an attack on everything she stood for—her art, her memory, her future. It wasn't funny. He didn't understand what he was doing, but I understood all too well. Each stroke seemed deliberate, a message from someone who thought he could control me with his twisted game. That's when I realized the truth: he was trying to make me feel small, to remind me that I couldn't even create something beautiful by myself. The thought sent a chill through my veins. How dare he? Doesn't he know how much I've worked for every brushstroke, every color choice? Every moment I spent away from my studio felt like a loss, like I was giving up on myself. His visit was a slap in the face, a reminder that no matter how hard I tried, I could never truly be free from him. My mind raced with thoughts of anger and hurt, each one fueling the fire within me. I knew I shouldn’t let him get inside my head, but he’d already succeeded. The painting seemed to mock me now, a cruel symbol of everything he’d taken from me. Why did he have to show up now? Couldn’t he see that I was at my weakest? I wanted to scream, to lash"

Still, he can't shake off the feeling that things are moving faster for her than for him. What if they actually start dating? He wouldn't want that, but deep down, a part of him wishes it weren't true. This isn't the first time he's felt this way. He's seen colleagues get younger partners, while he's been single for far longer. It makes him wonder what he did wrong. Hasn't he done enough? Does being older really mean giving up? It's probably just his imagination running wild. But the thought lingers, making him question everything. Even himself. Is he still relevant here? Shouldn't he have moved on by now? The questions swirl, and he wonders how much longer he can hold onto hope. Perhaps he needs to focus on his work. After all, that's where his real strength lies. Being the best doctor is what matters most. Not some fleeting romance. Yet, as he looks at them laughing together, the pain stings again. Maybe it's time to accept reality. Things won't change overnight. He'll always be the older one. It's better to move forward."
