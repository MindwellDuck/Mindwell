The marketing campaign wasn't done yet. We didn't even know what we were promoting until today.\" She felt a sense of disappointment wash over her. \"This could have been great,\" she said quietly. \"You've worked hard on this collection. It deserved better than to be cancelled like this.\" She looked down at her notes once more and then back at the gallery owner. \"If only I'd seen this coming,\" she said sadly, shaking her head. \"Maybe if I'd predicted it earlier, you wouldn't have wasted so much time and money on this project.\""

Her partner stirred beside her, mumbling something about turning off the noise. She froze, her breath catching in her throat as she realized she couldn't remember setting the alarm last night. Had she? Or was this another sign of her mind playing tricks on her again? The anxiety that had been simmering beneath the surface bubbled up, threatening to consume her entirely. She took a deep, shuddering breath, trying desperately to focus on the present moment instead of the terrifying what-ifs swirling in her head. Today was supposed to be just another day at work, but as she sat there, paralyzed by fear, it felt like the start of something far more sinister.",

This wasn't the first time she'd experienced such episodes; the memory of past breakdowns flashed before her eyes, each one a reminder that maybe she wasn't as strong as she thought. The thought sent her spiraling into a whirlpool of panic, where every second felt like an eternity. It seemed like the world around her had slowed down, with time stretching out like a thin, fragile thread between moments. Even the gentle hum of the air conditioner sounded ominous, its rhythm beating in time with her racing thoughts. As she lay there, frozen with fear, she couldn’t shake the feeling that if she let go of control even for a moment, things would completely unravel. Everything inside her screamed that she needed to get out of bed, but her legs felt heavy, weighed down by some unseen force that refused to budge. The room began to feel suffocating, the air thickening until it seemed to press down on her like a physical weight. Each breath was a struggle, as if the very act of inhaling and exhaling had become a battle against forces beyond her control. In this moment, nothing else existed except the crushing sense of impending doom that threatened to consume her. Every cell in her body felt tense, ready to explode at any moment, while her mind whirled with questions about how much longer she could hold on. Was this really happening"

But does she ever think about us? No, all she thinks about is her job and her life. She doesn't even notice we're suffering right next door. It's cruel. How does she do it? Sleeping peacefully, waking up feeling fresh and ready for the day? She doesn't worry about bills or responsibilities. Is she completely oblivious to our struggles? How can someone be so free from problems? What if she had some of our issues too? Would she then feel guilty about being happy? It's all so unfair. She never realizes how much easier her life is. Maybe if she knew how hard things were for me, she'd understand. But does she care enough to try and see things from my perspective? Or is she too caught up in her own world to notice?

I remember my own father dying suddenly, leaving me alone for years. At least he didn’t leave behind children to care for. My sister moved back home, but even she doesn’t have it easy. I feel so much worse knowing what she goes through every day. It makes me wonder if I’m doing enough for my kids. How can I be prepared for something like that? I keep thinking about how I wish I could offer her some sort of comfort, but what would I say? I’ve heard stories of people losing everything and still finding strength within themselves. That must be incredibly difficult for them. I guess we all handle loss differently. Maybe if I’d done things differently, I wouldn’t be feeling this way. But does anyone ever really know what they could have done differently? It feels so unfair to compare ourselves to others when it’s impossible to know exactly what happened in those cases. Still, hearing about hers makes me realize how lucky I am to have my own family. But then I start to worry about my own kids—what if something happens to them too? I push the thoughts aside, focusing on my own family. Still,"
