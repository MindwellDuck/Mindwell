He was still that guy who thought nothing about flirting with women, always joking around, never taking things seriously. It felt like he had moved on from me so easily, his friendship with her just a casual hangout. They were probably discussing something ridiculous—like how they both got their cars washed by the same quirky mechanic. But to me, it seemed like he was genuinely enjoying himself with someone else, making her feel special too. My mind started racing, imagining all the times he'd said he was \"just being friendly,\" but deep down, I knew he didn't really mean it. Now, every time we met, it would be awkward, like a punchline I couldn't quite land. His carefree nature made me feel like I was stuck in some kind of bad joke, always playing second fiddle to his new \"friend.\" ---"

I wonder if there's something specific that happened during her previous appointments that made her decide to switch. Was she unhappy with the way she was being heard? Did she feel like her concerns weren't taken seriously? Or maybe she just got tired of dealing with someone who didn't get her needs, despite us doing everything we could? It makes sense that she would choose a different doctor; after all, finding the right fit takes time. I hope she finds someone who can give her the attention and empathy she deserves. It’s ironic that Mrs. H is leaving us, considering how much effort we put into providing personalized care. I can’t help but think about what might have gone wrong—was it lack of availability? Insufficient communication? Maybe it wasn’t even about the quality of care, but rather a personal connection that simply wasn’t there. Whatever the reason, I’m sorry to see her go, especially since she seemed like such a nice woman. It’s disappointing to lose a patient like her, who had the potential to become a valuable member of our practice. But let’s look on the bright side! With her departure, my schedule"

Does he wish things could go back to how they were before? Or maybe he’s just being friendly and wants to cheer her up? I’m starting to think Jamie might have feelings for her too. Even though he seemed shy, he looked really excited to give her the flowers. It almost felt like a secret message between them. Maybe Jamie isn’t just being friendly after all? I bet he has a crush on her, especially since he chose her class. What if he thinks she loves him too? This whole thing feels suspiciously like a setup. Did Jamie plan this to make her feel better? Perhaps he secretly wants to tell her something important while she’s distracted by the flowers... This can’t be happening! Jamie wouldn’t actually... Wait, where did I get that idea?
