His initial reaction was that this person must be a careless person who didn't care about others.

It feels like she's giving up on life, on us, on everything we've built together. The thought makes my stomach turn. She could either be sick or tired, but if that's the case, why does it have to affect me so much? Why does her negligence make me feel so helpless and resentful? I'm not asking for perfection, just some effort, but this is ridiculous. Maybe she's having an off day, but it's been going on for weeks. Doesn't matter what I say or do; nothing changes. We're stuck in a cycle of resentment, and I don't know how much more I can take. It’s like she’s choosing to let things fall apart around her, and I’m left to pick up the pieces. I guess it's all about perspective now. I need to stop getting so worked up over something so small. But honestly, it feels like she's abandoning us. I'm tired of feeling like I'm fighting a losing battle. Is she really that selfish? Or is there something else going on? Can’t I see beyond this"

Even though she knows she shouldn't jump to conclusions based on what she sees, she can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. Maybe it's better to let someone else deal with this; after all, she doesn’t want to overreact. But why does she feel the need to intervene? It seems like everyone else has already handled situations like this perfectly fine. The thought sends a chill down her spine, making her wonder if she's misinterpreting everything. What if this isn’t a child at all, but someone else entirely? Or maybe this is just her imagination playing tricks on her again. She tries to push these thoughts aside, telling herself that her mind is just being overly cautious. Yet, the sense of unease persists, refusing to let go. It’s almost as if her instincts are screaming that something is wrong, even when she tells herself otherwise. She forces herself to stay calm, but the feeling lingers, making her question her own judgment."
