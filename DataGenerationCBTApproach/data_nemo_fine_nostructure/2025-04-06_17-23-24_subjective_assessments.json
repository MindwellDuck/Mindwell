It's become second nature for him to ruminate on past interactions that didn't go as planned. Even something as mundane as seeing someone else enjoy themselves can trigger this internal debate. When he saw those two laughing together, it wasn't just about the painting; it was about how they'd treated him with disrespect. It wasn't just an incident; it was proof that they never valued art or artists genuinely. It wasn't just about the painting; it was about how he'd spent hours perfecting it, only to have it disregarded by people who didn't truly appreciate its value. He couldn’t help but feel that everyone was like that - always treating him poorly, always looking down on him. It was just another reminder of why he kept his paintings locked away, hidden from the world, and why he couldn't bring himself to show them anymore."
