The sight of it made his breath catch, sorrow welling up as if she'd only been gone a moment.

His mind wanders back to the happy times they shared—her laughter echoing through the house, her smile lighting up the room. But those moments are now tainted by grief, making him wonder if he’s truly living up to what she would have wanted. It’s hard to find joy when every step feels like a step backward. He wishes he could turn back time, relive those moments one more time, even if it meant enduring the pain all over again. Maybe then he’d understand why she chose to leave, leaving him with just this mug—a reminder of what he’s lost, and how far he still has to go before healing."

Another late-night story pitched, another chance for him to steal her thunder. He's been doing it since they started at the same newspaper six months ago, and each time she feels a hatred burn brighter within her, like an inferno she can't control. Today, though, he goes too far - his smug grin as he announces his exclusive on a story she's been chasing for weeks is the match that ignites her fury. She feels it surge through her veins, a hatred so intense she wants to scream, to lash out, but instead, she forces herself to smile back at him, vowing silently that this time, she'll be one step ahead.",

He probably doesn't even notice how much she cares for him. Or maybe he does, and it just hasn't clicked yet? That would explain why she's still single. Maybe she's waiting for something special to come along. It makes sense; she wouldn't want to give up hope. What a wonderful story this could become! Maybe we'll see them together at the next neighborhood potluck. Wouldn't that be amazing? It's almost sad that I'm an old lady myself. Life has its ups and downs, but I've learned to appreciate the little things. At least now I don't have to worry about meeting new people. Still, sometimes it feels like time is slipping away from me. Maybe I should try to get back into gardening. My husband always loved tending to our flowers and vegetables. He used to take pride in making sure everything looked perfect. Now that he's gone, I guess I'll never feel that same satisfaction again.

His partner had offered to stay late with him, but she'd been called away by a family emergency. He'd waved her off, insisting he could handle it. Now, as the station fell silent around him, he felt the weight of each empty chair. Another night alone, another missed dinner with his teenage daughter.

Every creak of the old building seemed amplified, making him feel like an intruder in his own life. The world outside moved forward, while he remained stuck in this endless loop of duty and neglect. Even the small things—the way the sunlight faded from the windows, the smell of last night's coffee—felt like reminders of all he was missing. He couldn’t shake the feeling that time was slipping through his fingers, leaving him further behind with each passing moment. It wasn’t just the lack of sleep; it was the emptiness within, the sense that something essential was falling into place. He couldn’t quite put his finger on what it was, but he sensed it was connected to his daughter’s growing independence. She wanted more space, and he couldn’t blame her. Yet, as he sat there, the silence seemed to grow louder, echoing the doubts he’d tried to push aside. He wondered if he was doing enough for her, if he was giving her the freedom she needed, or if he was simply holding onto the past too tightly. It all felt so...off. And then, just as he thought things couldn’t get worse, the phone rang, breaking the spell of isolation. But instead of relief, he felt a pang of frustration.

His phone buzzed with a message from a colleague checking on his availability for the evening shift tomorrow. He felt a pang, remembering he'd volunteered to cover it weeks ago, before she'd fallen ill again. Now, he wasn't sure if he should leave her alone, even for a few hours. The silence pressed against him, heavier than usual. He sipped his coffee, feeling more alone than ever in their shared home.",

The fact that he leaves the bottle untouched while staring at the empty glass makes me think he's trying to convince himself that he doesn't need alcohol. But deep down, we all know he does. What would happen if he were to stay sober? Would he become happy and content? Unlikely, given his nature. He'll always be a loser, a burden to those around him.

It didn't feel like a genuine interest in his career; instead, it looked more like a prediction about his future. Maybe she sensed he wasn't doing well, and this book was her way of saying he needed to change. But why would she go out of her way to point that out? That kind of knowledge wouldn't come naturally from browsing books. It made him uncomfortable, especially because they hadn't spoken since the incident. She knew everything about him—what he liked, what he disliked, even his fears. The thought that she might use that information against him in some way unsettled him. If anything, he wished he could read between the lines of her behavior and figure out if she was really interested in helping him or just gloating about his failure. What did she mean by choosing such a book? Was she implying that he was running out of chances? He didn't think she believed that. She must have picked the title randomly. But why else would she choose a book with such a bold message? It seemed like a warning, like she was trying to prepare him for the worst-case scenario. And maybe she was right. Maybe she knew"
