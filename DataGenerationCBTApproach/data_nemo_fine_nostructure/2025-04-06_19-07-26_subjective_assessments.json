A file slipped from his grasp, landing open at a familiar name - the girl who had died years ago, her young face smiling up at him from the photograph. He remembered the mistake he'd made that day, the medicine he'd administered too late. His heart sank as the remorse washed over him like a tidal wave, drowning out the quiet of the basement.",

I can tell he's been through some tough stuff. The way he captures emotion, the rawness, it speaks volumes. That critic wouldn’t have said anything if he didn’t know what he was talking about. You can see it in his words. He genuinely believes he’s giving honest feedback, not just stirring up drama for attention. So, yeah, I totally agree with him. I wish we had more critics like him around here.\""

His schedule was always on point, while many classmates were juggling multiple part-time jobs, leaving little time for homework let alone personal projects. It wasn't just academics; even outside school, he found himself with more free time than most students, who were often busy with extracurricular activities, sports, or social events. In contrast, he had spent countless hours preparing for that moment, pouring over every detail, and making sure everything went smoothly. The success didn't feel like an accident, but rather the culmination of deliberate effort. He remembered all the late nights studying, the early morning wake-ups, and the days spent perfecting presentations. Every small step, no matter how insignificant, contributed to the final product. It wasn't just about getting good grades; it was about building something meaningful. He saw each step as a step toward understanding, toward growth, toward realizing what he wanted to achieve. Each day was another opportunity to learn, to understand, and to refine. And when it came down to it, he felt confident in knowing that he'd done everything he could. He looked around the room, noticing the varying levels of engagement. Some students were actively participating, while others seemed disinterested, perhaps lost in thought or simply waiting for the bell to ring. He wondered if they understood the value of hard work, if they appreciated the beauty in preparation, or if"

They're never going to make me rich anyway. I'd rather focus on something practical. Maybe if she stopped worrying so much about her ego, she could finally sell one of those silly paintings without having to beg someone to buy it.
