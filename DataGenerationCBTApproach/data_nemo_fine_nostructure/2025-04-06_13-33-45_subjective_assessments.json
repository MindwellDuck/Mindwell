Instead, she got a bland message from HR. Doesn't matter that she doesn't deserve it; she still feels let down. This is how promotions are supposed to go down—person-to-person. Not some cold, impersonal email."

Now, he's slumped against a wall, unconscious, bleeding from a gash on his forehead. Beside him lies a broken bottle, glinting menacingly in the streetlight. Her grip tightens on the steering wheel, knuckles turning white. She knows she should wait for backup, follow protocol, but all she can think about is making this man pay for every laugh he's ever had at her expense.",

The image seemed innocent enough, but she couldn’t shake off the feeling that there might be more to it than meets the eye. It wasn’t just the way they laughed together; maybe there were unspoken promises between them that went beyond friendship. He had always been close to his friends, but this particular moment made her question whether he ever stopped loving her. It didn’t seem like an accident how much they looked alike – it almost seemed like fate. He probably has some kind of romantic feelings for her too. Maybe he’s thinking about her right now, reminiscing about those carefree days. It's strange how much nostalgia can make us feel insecure. If I could only see him dance with someone else, I wouldn't be here today. But why does it have to be her? She must have something special. It doesn’t make sense that they would stop being so friendly after all these years. It looks like they’re having fun, but what if it’s more than that? This is ridiculous! I’m overreacting again. It’s probably just my imagination running wild. I need to stop jumping to conclusions and focus on reality. Maybe she really is just happy to see him, and we shouldn’t read into things too much. It’s not worth worrying about, let me tell myself that. It’s not just about the photo; it’s the whole situation. We’ve been married for two years"

I'm tired of being here without him, yet he can't be bothered to even call me when he's running late.
