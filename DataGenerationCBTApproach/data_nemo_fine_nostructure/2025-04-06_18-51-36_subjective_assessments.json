He spots an elderly couple, arms linked, sharing a laugh as they window shop at the jewelry store he used to manage before the divorce. The sight of their easy happiness catches him off guard, a sharp pang of loneliness and unhappiness piercing his chest like a needle through fabric. He quickly averts his gaze, but not before noticing the glittering engagement ring in the woman's hand, a stark reminder of what he once had and lost.",

Maybe I'm overreacting, but I feel like everyone else has found love except me. I wish I could be that carefree again, but I know I'll never find someone like her. She was perfect - kind, smart, beautiful, and caring. If she were still here, none of this would bother me. But she's gone now, and I'm left with nothing but memories and regrets. Life isn't fair, and I shouldn't expect things to get better."

The knife hit the board rhythmically, echoing through the silent apartment. He paused, noticing two plates instead of one, set out for dinner. His girlfriend always made sure to leave them there, even on nights like this when she wouldn't be home. She was at her parents', helping them celebrate their anniversary. She'd invited him, but he declined, claiming work would keep him late.\n\nHe felt a lump form in his throat as he stared at the second plate. It was clean, untouched, waiting for her. He imagined her laughter filling the room, her hands wiping down counters, her eyes crinkling at the corners when she smiled at him. He missed her. He missed their shared meals, their late-night conversations, their Sunday mornings.\n\nHe blinked back tears, dropping the chopped onions into the pot with a heavier hand than intended. The scent filled the air, stinging his eyes. He leaned against the counter, taking a deep breath, letting the familiar ache of sadness wash over him.",

I don't get paid enough to put up with your constant complaining. And another thing, why are you crying? Don't cry so much! You make me feel bad. You're such an idiot. You can't handle anything on your own. Why did you even invite yourself to my parents' party? They hate you anyway. Now they've probably got some stupid story about how you ruined their day because you didn't show up. You're so selfish; no wonder we broke up. Your emotional issues are ruining our life together. I deserve better than someone who constantly needs attention and feels sorry for themselves. You're too clingy and overly dependent. If you were more independent, we could actually enjoy each other's company without all these drama-filled moments. But honestly, if I had to choose between you and myself, I'd choose myself.

We might have to hire someone else to clean up after him, which could cost us more money than expected. And then there's the risk that our health inspectors will come by unexpectedly, making everything worse... It's almost as if the thought alone is making me feel sick to my stomach. What if this isn't just a one-time mistake but a sign of things to come? Maybe he's just trying to get away with doing less work now, expecting no consequences later on. That would be really bad for our business, and I don’t know how I'd handle it. The thought of having to deal with all those problems—especially when he’s supposed to be helping me with dinner prep—is overwhelming. It feels like I’m stuck in a nightmare where nothing goes right.

A small breeze rustled the leaves outside, making me feel like someone was trying to send a message. But who could it be? We've been so busy with work that we haven't talked since last week. I tried calling him, but he didn't answer, which made me wonder if he's really okay. Is he avoiding me because he's hiding something? Or does he need some space after the argument?

Now, all I'm left with is this silly gift and the memories we shared. Maybe if I did something crazy, like try out for a role in an upcoming play, she wouldn't have gotten so upset when I got into trouble at school. Oh well, at least I still have my old guitar. That brings back some nice memories. I wonder what she would've thought if I told her about those. She would've probably said I was being dramatic again. I don't know why I even bother talking about this stuff anymore. It's pointless. I guess I'll just put the gift away and move on. After all, there are plenty of other things to focus on. 5 years ago, she was still here with me. She was laughing at one of my jokes, and I felt happy. Life seemed better then. I wish things were still like that. I hope someday, things will be easier for everyone else too. Even though I miss her, maybe things can start looking up again. At least I still have friends who care. They're always there for me, and they won't leave me behind like she did"
