The house was quiet, save for the faint ticking of the clock and the distant hum of the refrigerator. He checked his phone again; still no messages from her. Last night's argument echoed in his mind like a bad radio playback, each word a harsh reminder of the distance between them now. He took a sip of coffee, grimacing at its bitterness. It tasted like his mood. Another long shift awaited him today, and the thought of it made his already heavy heart feel heavier still.",

She had always been so distant, never really letting him in, even when they were together. That was why this time around felt different, not because he loved her anymore, but because he realized he never actually did. He wondered if maybe he wasn’t worth much more than the scraps she left behind, like yesterday’s leftover coffee grounds. This morning, she must have finally realized that he wasn’t worth saving after all. She probably thought about how much better off she’d be without him, how she could easily find another man who would put up with her indifference. Why else would she stay? It didn’t matter how hard he tried to hold on; he knew deep down that she was never going to care enough to make it work. Even if he somehow managed to convince her otherwise, there was something fundamentally wrong with him that made her turn away every single time. Maybe it was the way he looked, the things he said, or simply the fact that he existed—a constant reminder of everything she hated about herself. Whatever it was, it was clear that she saw him as nothing more than an obstacle, a temporary inconvenience she could easily get rid of once she found someone better. He sighed, the bitter taste of his coffee growing stronger by the minute. It seemed that no matter how much he poured his heart out"

But no, I'm convinced it was him. My heart went out to the poor child, especially since he'd already lost so much by being separated from both parents. That must’ve made things so difficult for him.
