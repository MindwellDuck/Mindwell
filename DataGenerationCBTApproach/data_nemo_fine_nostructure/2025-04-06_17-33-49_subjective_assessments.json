She spots an empty table and makes her way towards it, when a younger resident, barely out of medical school, calls out from a nearby table, \"Hey, isn't that your husband's tie pin you're wearing? I heard he died years ago.\" The room falls silent as all eyes turn to the woman, who feels her cheeks flush with embarrassment.

The house echoed with an emptiness that seemed to mock him, each creak and groan whispering her name. He reached for the bottle of whiskey on the counter, but hesitated, knowing it wouldn't fill this void. His eyes wandered to the old letter he'd found while packing up her things, the one she'd written before leaving, its words still bitter on his tongue after all these years. As he picked it up, a single photograph fell out - one of him in uniform, taken on their first anniversary. He remembered that day, how proud she was.

In the silence, he heard whispers too, echoes of memories that refused to fade. They haunted him, reminding him of the life they once shared, now lost forever. As he walked through the empty streets, the shadows seemed to writhe around him, like living things. Each step felt like a betrayal, as if he was walking away from something precious. The world felt hollow, devoid of warmth and love. The only comfort came from the whiskey, which seemed to dull the pain, but even its solace was fleeting. When he closed his eyes, visions danced before him, images of what could have been, of what might become. But nothing felt real, just a cruel joke played by some unseen force. In the end, it wasn't just the whiskey that numbed him, but the very air itself. It was as if the universe had turned against him, forcing him to confront the reality he'd tried so hard to escape.
