Today, he sees his former partner laughing with their new young associate inside, holding a framed photo of them all, taken years ago at a conference. The bitterness rises in his throat like bile as he realizes he's been replaced, not just professionally, but also in the affections of those who were once his colleagues and friends.",

Maybe we could even invite some of our old patients? Do you think they'd mind? That would be such an honor. I wonder what kind of celebrations they have planned for their retirement... Oh, and by the way, did you know that my wife has been thinking about retiring early this year? We've always talked about doing something together before we stop working full-time. You know how much she loves traveling, don't you? If they’re celebrating, maybe we could join them for dinner sometime? ---"

It wasn't just that it was an apology for something so small—like missing a lunch date—but that it came from someone who had already moved on to new things. The fact that she'd even bothered apologizing made him feel like he couldn't trust her anymore. It seemed like she was using him as an excuse to see this other friend again, like they were reconnecting because she needed a break from him. And what really hit hard was how casual it all sounded—the way she'd mentioned seeing her friend at work, like it meant nothing. Like they weren't even trying to hide anything. It was like I was supposed to be happy about them hanging out together, but I knew deep down that it was all a lie. She didn’t care about me; she was just using me to get back to where she started. This whole thing feels like a trap, like everything is being manipulated to make me look bad. Even if we’re still together, there’s no way my feelings are genuine. Everything is just a facade, and I’m trapped in this charade. My heart isn’t even in it anymore. If I stayed, it would just be another reminder that I'm not good enough for her. She needs someone better, someone who doesn’t mind being left behind. But I know deep down that it’s not going to end well. We're just two people who want different things,"

The subject line read: \"Final Draft - Humanitarian Crisis Report.\" He had been so caught up in the grind of daily news that he'd almost forgotten about this. As he opened it, his eyes scanned the lines he'd written weeks ago, now approved by his editor. The words seemed foreign, distant, as if they belonged to someone else. He remembered the faces of those he'd interviewed, their desperate stories. A pang of remorse hit him like a punch in the gut. How could he have let this slip from his mind? His deadline-driven existence suddenly felt hollow. He picked up his pen, determined to rewrite it all, to make sure their voices were truly heard.",

And yet, they would still try to tell you something, to offer some advice or sympathy, but it would be shallow, like they weren't even listening. That's why they said things like \"Oh, don't worry\" or \"You'll be fine,\" because deep down, they knew you wouldn't. But you couldn't help feeling drawn to them, like there was something familiar about their look, something that made you want to open up, to share your deepest fears and worries. Maybe it was just your imagination playing tricks on you again, but it felt real. After all, who wouldn't feel that way when looking into those eyes?"

Now she'll never get over this embarrassment, especially since she's going to be working at that gallery soon. Why did they even bother letting her know? It doesn't make sense. They must have sent out thousands of these emails. How could she have missed all those? This is so unfair. I'm going to quit my job next week because of this. I'm such a failure."

It felt like he couldn't even be bothered to close the window properly, which meant all those other girls could see what kind of pictures she had posted online. And she knew how much he liked to look at these things when he thought no one was looking, especially if they were pretty. The fact that he kept his phone screen off during work hours didn't stop him from having a peek whenever he got the chance. This time, it seemed like he wasn't even trying to hide anything; she could practically see his fingers swiping through profiles, comparing their looks to hers. She wondered if he would ever consider leaving his job for her, but now she saw it as impossible due to his lack of commitment. If he really cared about her, wouldn't he find a way to get away from his flirtatious ways? Why did it always happen with women who weren't as attractive as her? He probably wanted to marry some supermodel or model someday, and she was too ordinary for him to even think about. She felt like crying as she realized she might never be able to make him love her the way she deserved, and that she was destined to be alone forever."
