Her elegant script, once familiar as his own heartbeat, now mocked him. They were love letters she'd written during their courtship, before her parents forbade it. He'd asked her to burn them, but she'd kept them hidden, secret tokens of their past. Now, here they were, clutched in his trembling hands, proof that she hadn't loved him enough to let go. His vision blurred, the rage boiling inside him, as he crumpled the letters into a fiery ball and hurled them into the fireplace.",

She had known about the fire all along, didn’t she? Hadn’t she planned this betrayal from the very beginning? He felt as though he was drowning in her deceit, suffocating under the weight of her lies. How could she have been so heartless? He couldn’t breathe. His mind reeled as he watched the letters melt into the inferno. Each moment passed felt like an eternity. He felt like he was losing himself in this sea of anger and despair. Everything seemed darker now, as if the flames reflected the darkness within him. He felt numb, yet the pain lingered, like a heavy fog that refused to lift. Every beat of his heart pounded out a rhythm of anguish, echoing through his mind. This wasn’t just about burning letters; it was about the truth—about her betrayal and his shattered dreams. In the end, he stood frozen, unable to move, as the ashes cooled and the room fell silent. The silence was deafening, filled with the echoes of his shattered heart. It was as if time itself had stopped, leaving him trapped in this moment of devastation, where nothing else mattered except for the memories he thought he’d left behind. This is not a reflection of my actual feelings, but rather an attempt to capture how someone might react after discovering a letter. The title refers to the fact that the person"

That every day since then has been a constant reminder of my failure? No, no, no, I won't go there. I need to focus on moving forward, not dwelling on what could have been. But why did he have to show his side of things too? Why couldn't he just let me live in peace? Why did he have to ruin everything for me? This isn't fair. He knows exactly what he did, and yet he still gets to smile with that girl who doesn't even know him. Doesn't he understand that every time I look at this picture, it's like opening a wound?

If only he could turn back time...if only he could see her again, hear her voice, feel her warmth... But he knew there was no going back, no turning points. There was only the present, and the weight of what had happened. He stood outside, trying to make sense of it all, wondering why such tragedies ever occurred.
