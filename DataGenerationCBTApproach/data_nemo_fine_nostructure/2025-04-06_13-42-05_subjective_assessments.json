But why would anyone think otherwise? It wasn't like she was trying to be awkward or stand out. It was just an accident—she didn't mean to overhear. Yet, every time she looked up, someone was looking back at her, making her feel like there was something wrong with her. Maybe she did come across as old-fashioned, but she'd always prided herself on being professional and respectful. What if this was all some kind of cruel joke? Why else would people keep glancing at her?"

It wasn't a big deal, just a minor error, and she had corrected it quickly afterward. But now, standing in front of everyone, she couldn't think straight. She felt like she'd been punched in the chest, her mind racing with questions. What did this have to do with anything? Why was she being singled out like this? She glanced around the store, trying to make sense of what was happening. Her coworkers looked worried, their faces filled with concern. They kept looking at her, and she felt like they were judging her. Even though she knew she hadn't done anything wrong, she still felt guilty. She wanted to defend herself, but what could she say? The manager seemed so angry, and his words cut deep. He went on to mention another time she had made an error, but again, it was nothing major—just a small mistake. She had apologized for it right away, and everything was fine. But here we are, with him yelling at her in front of everyone. She didn't understand why this was happening. Wasn't she doing okay otherwise? Hadn't she been working hard? She thought back to all the times she'd worked diligently,"

I'm afraid if I don't finish it tonight, everything will fall apart tomorrow. My boss will hate me, my family will disappoint me, and I'll never get my dream job. This feels like a bad omen. My computer, which was running smoothly just minutes ago, has stopped working completely. Now I have nothing but darkness and uncertainty. This is exactly how my life is going to end up, stuck in this dark room with unfinished work. I know I need to keep working, but why bother when everything else is falling apart anyway?"

It's disgusting how she uses her position to bully those who are already struggling. Her constant crusades against big corporations will never change anything except lead to more division.
