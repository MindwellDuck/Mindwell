The air was thick with an unfamiliar scent—a mix of rotting flowers and something else that didn't belong. It was like nothing she had ever smelled before. Her mind struggled to make sense of it all, but somehow, it felt familiar. She tried to brush it off, telling herself it was just the smell of old art supplies, but deep down, she knew better. There was more to it than that. As she looked around, her eyes landed on a small vase filled with what appeared to be dead flowers. They were covered in a thick layer of dust, and their petals seemed wilted and brown. But then she noticed something strange—the stems seemed to be wrapped tightly together, forming a sort of nest. It was almost as if they were trying to hold onto each other, even after death. A shiver ran down her spine as she realized this wasn't just any ordinary bouquet—it was a remnant from their wedding day. But why did she remember this? Why would she recall something so specific, so vivid? It wasn't just about the flowers; it was about the couple who had created them. She remembered how happy they both seemed during their ceremony, laughing and smiling as they exchanged their vows. And now, here she was, surrounded by the remnants of that joyous moment. The smell of decay hung heavy in the air, but for some reason, she found comfort in it"

She picks it up, feeling its lightness, knowing it contains not just words but echoes of a life cut short too soon. As she sits down, the old springs creak under her weight, as if whispering, \"Remember?\" She takes out the letter, unfolding the yellowed paper gently, and begins to read. The sorrow washes over her like an incoming tide, filling every corner of the room, drowning out the ticking clock.",

They're probably not thinking about how sad people are like me right now. They must be enjoying their time together, completely carefree. Why can't we all be happy like them? They don't have problems; they're perfect. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in my house, dealing with depression and loneliness. Why can't I be like them, content with my life? It's so unfair. People who are happy like them should know what it's like to feel this way, but they probably don't. What would make them understand if they tried harder? Maybe then they could see things from our perspective. But no, they'll never get it because they're too happy. If only they knew how hard it was for us to find joy in life... They must think we're crazy when we say we feel this way. That's why I feel better watching them. I can imagine how happy they are without feeling jealous. Now I'm going back inside to cook dinner, trying to forget the sadness that's been building up inside me. Hopefully, I won't think about them again until tomorrow morning."

My heart keeps racing and I feel lightheaded. I try to focus on the task ahead but my mind keeps wandering back to those worst-case scenarios. Every second ticks by, feeling like minutes.

But this time, something is different. As I sit here, I know that I'm just being selfish. My partner has worked so hard on these paintings, pouring her heart into each piece. They've spent countless hours together, and now she wants to share those moments with others. She deserves all the recognition because she's the one who created everything. I shouldn't be holding her back; I should be supporting her, not worrying about how I look. If I could go back, I would have been more understanding, letting her finish whatever she was doing instead of interrupting. But it's too late now; the damage is done. I don't want to hurt her feelings anymore, and I need to find a way to move forward. It's not going to work out. We're meant to be alone, and we should stop pretending otherwise. There's no point in trying to change now. Instead, I should accept that things won't get better and start focusing on myself. Maybe I can take some classes again, learn something new, or try to"

You must feel guilty for not telling me earlier, so you decided to send a cryptic message instead. Am I right?
