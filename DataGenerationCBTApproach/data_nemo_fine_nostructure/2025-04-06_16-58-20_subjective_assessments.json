It was unnerving and made her feel uneasy, especially when he didn’t even seem to be looking at her. He just kept staring blankly into space, his mouth hanging open slightly, giving off this weird, unsettling vibe. And then there was the way he laughed—so loud, so carefree, completely unfiltered. It made her stomach churn, knowing that he had no filter for how he felt, no boundaries holding him back. That same lack of self-control must have led to some pretty wild behavior, and now here she was, feeling suffocated by the very thought of it. The more she looked at him, the more she felt trapped in her own thoughts, as if I’m drowning in my memories. She wondered what it would be like to let go of all that pain and simply enjoy the moment, but it was hard to imagine anything good coming out of such an act of reckless abandon. Her mind started racing with all sorts of scenarios, each one more disturbing than the last. There was no escape from these thoughts; they were closing in around her like a vice, making her breath come short. She could feel them bearing down, squeezing tighter with every passing second. It was as if she was being pulled under by an unseen force, unable to break free from its grip. Even thinking about letting go made her feel like she was losing control, like the"

The memory haunted him still, echoing through the empty halls of his mind like a ghost. What if they had stayed together? Would things have looked different now? Would he be sitting here alone, or was this all part of some cruel test, forcing him to confront his own failures? Maybe he wasn’t meant for happiness; maybe he was always destined to be alone. If only he could go back, undo those mistakes, make amends... But life doesn’t work that way. All he got were regrets. Now, he just sits here, surrounded by shadows, wondering how far he'd fallen from the man who once held such promise. Was it really worth it? Or was he just deluding himself, trapped in a cycle of pain that he couldn't escape?"

It was as if she was still standing beside him, hearing his words during their first press conference. The memory came flooding back, and for a moment, she forgot about everything else, including her busy schedule and the need to focus on her career. ## Step 1: Identify the Cognitive Distortion The key cognitive distortion here is \"Fortune Telling,\" which involves predicting negative outcomes in a way that makes them seem inevitable. This type of thinking can lead people to expect bad things to happen, even if there's no logical reason for it to do so. ## Step 2: Analyze the Subjective Reaction When you read the story, notice how the protagonist feels when looking at the old photo. They mention a \"pang of sadness\" and a single tear falling from their cheek. These physical reactions suggest that the image has triggered strong emotions, likely regret and nostalgia for the past. ## Step 3: Reflect on Your Own Reactions Take a step back and think about times when you've seen someone react similarly. Maybe it was a friend who looked at an old photo and seemed overcome with emotion, or perhaps you recall reading a book that brought out strong feelings in you. Consider how these situations might relate to the concept of fortune telling - are there moments where your own thoughts or actions make you feel like something bad could happen"

He had always been kind, but this time he didn’t even bother reading what she sent. Just another rejection. She felt so frustrated; why did everything have to go wrong for her? She thought she was doing well at university, but I guess she wasn’t good enough anyway. She tried so hard, but no matter how much effort she put into her work, things always went wrong. She was so disappointed in herself, feeling like she couldn’t succeed no matter how hard she tried. The fact that her husband's name popped up in her head when she saw the rejection letter made her want to cry. What if she wasn't good enough for him either? Maybe she shouldn’t have tried so hard to get into medical school. She knew she’d never be able to make him happy, but now she wondered if she was really cut out for medicine. Maybe she wouldn’t make it as a doctor after all. If she failed, would her husband leave her too?"

Do you recognize yourself in these examples? Have you ever caught yourself falling into similar patterns? If you're interested, I'd love to explore more examples and discuss this topic further.
