She had no idea what his intentions were, but it seemed like he might be hiding something. Maybe he was just desperate for attention? Her instincts screamed at her to keep an eye on him. There was something off about the way he moved, almost as if he was trying too hard. She decided to watch him more closely, making sure she wasn't missing anything. It's probably just my intuition, but she noticed he kept glancing at himself in the mirror. That could mean nothing, though - maybe he was just nervous. Still, she found herself wondering what would happen next. Would he be able to pull this off? Or would everything fall apart? I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. I was just lost in thought. I don't remember much of what we talked about, but I do recall feeling frustrated afterward. My mind was still on my own struggles with anxiety and depression. I guess I was preoccupied with"

She's always been better than me, and now everyone sees it too. They're just saying nice things because she's their friend, but deep down, they think I'm inferior. When people talk about her, it's like they can't wait to share their thoughts, while I'm left standing there feeling like an outcast. Even though I've worked hard on my craft, it's never enough. I wonder if anyone would have noticed my work if she wasn’t there. She gets all the recognition, and I'm just another forgotten artist.

She took a deep breath, feeling a familiar melancholy wash over her as she carefully opened it.\n\nInside was a letter, dated twenty years ago on her birthday. It began, \"My dearest daughter...\" The ink was smudged, as if her mother had cried while writing it. As she read the words of love and pride, she felt a lump form in her throat. She missed her mother's presence more than ever, the studio echoing with silence instead of her laughter.\n\nThe breeze picked up again, this time carrying a few raindrops that splattered onto the canvas, blurring the paint. She watched as the rain began to fall harder, washing away the colors, just like time had washed away her mother's touch. A single tear joined the raindrops on her cheek as she closed the letter, tucking it safely back into the book.\n\nShe turned off the light and left the studio, closing the door behind her, leaving the rain to finish what it had started with the canvas - a melancholy dance of nature and loss.",
