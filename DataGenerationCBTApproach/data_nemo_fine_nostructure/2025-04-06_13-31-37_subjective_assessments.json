The thought still weighs heavily on him, making every moment alone feel like an eternity. Every door I try to open leads back to memories of her, and I'm convinced that if only I had been more patient, listened better, or understood her in some deeper way, we might have made it work. But now, I’m left with nothing but regret and the ache of losing what once felt so precious. This time, though, he can't shake off the feeling that he'll never find another piece of her. It feels almost cruel—like life is playing this cruel joke on him, reminding him that no matter how hard he tries, he’ll never be able to fill the space she left. Even the small things that remind him of her now make him sad rather than happy. Like when he sees the same pattern on a rug or hears a song they used to listen to together—it’s all just a painful reminder of what’s lost, and it makes him wonder if he’ll ever be able to move on. Or if he even wants to. For a while, he"
