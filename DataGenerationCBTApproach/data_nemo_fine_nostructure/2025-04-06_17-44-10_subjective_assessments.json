Another deadline loomed, but her fingers hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed. Her husband's old coffee mug, now hers alone, mocked her from its place by the window. The city lights twinkled ignorantly below, unaware that they were her only source of companionship tonight. A breaking news alert flashed across her screen: a fire in their old neighborhood. She felt a pang of helplessness, knowing she couldn't protect the memories burning away, just as she hadn't been able to save him.",

It’s her own fault. If she’d taken care of herself, she wouldn’t be feeling this way. Why is it always about her? Doesn’t she understand how much others are suffering right now? If only she had reached out more often, maybe he’d still be there. Maybe if she’d done something, anything, to make things right, he wouldn’t have left us. But no, she had to go and sit here and cry again. It’s all her fault. Why does everyone have to suffer so much? Can’t anyone else deal with this for once? We’re all just pawns in life anyway. What difference would one little house make? And another, and another—does nobody see the bigger picture? We all deserve what we get. She wanted it so bad. He didn’t want to leave her, but she convinced him otherwise. Now look where she is. Alone again. It’s her own fault. What’s the point? Everyone suffers anyway. We’re all just waiting for our turn. At least I don’t feel the pain like she does. That’s why I’m okay. I don’t know her story, and I don’t need to. There’s nothing we can really do. Life goes on, and we all fall into our roles.

If he calmed down, everything would return to normal. He should stop being so anxious; this is ridiculous. Nothing bad ever happens in this town. This must all be just a false alarm. He has no reason to be afraid. What if it really is another gas leak? He should check the stove right away. Shouldn't he be more concerned than he am? # Should Statements Distortion Analysis This response illustrates how the 'Should Statements' cognitive distortion can manifest. By saying \"he should\" repeatedly, the individual is implying that they believe their behavior (or lack thereof) should match what they think it \"should\" be. They're essentially telling themselves that their actions don't align with expectations, even though their thoughts are based on fear rather than reality. The repeated use of \"should\" creates a sense of guilt or inadequacy, reinforcing the distorted belief that there's something wrong with them when, in fact, it's their imagination running wild. This type of thinking leads to unnecessary stress and distress because it misinterprets internal feelings as external failures. In this case, the person believes they should feel calm and safe, but instead, they're consumed by anxiety. Their inner voice tells them they should turn off the stove, check for leaks, and stop worrying, yet these demands remain un"

This photo is like a painful reminder of what could have been if things had gone differently. Everything is black-and-white now; either they were meant to be or they never were. There's no middle ground. I feel like there are some deep wounds between us that will never heal, and this photo makes me miss what we once had more than ever. Why couldn't he stay? Was he ever really interested in me, or was all this just a game? I don't know why I'm still thinking about him. He'll never come back. It's better for both of us if we just forget about the past and move on. But the pain of losing him keeps coming back, like a ghost haunting my memories. We were supposed to build something special together, but now it's all shattered. Maybe if I try harder, he might reconsider. But deep down, I think he's already moved on. It doesn’t matter how much I wish things could go back to the way they were. I know nothing will change. I’m just stuck reliving the same painful memories over and over again. I need to stop dwelling on what’s lost and focus on what’s left. Yet every"
