My heart heavy with dread, I wait for the inevitable. But why does this keep happening? Why can't they just let me live peacefully? The world is full of ups and downs, and I'm tired of being down. Life is unfair; we're all just pawns in someone else's game. I know the truth - nothing good comes after midnight. This too shall pass, but until then, I'll cling to hope. I wish things were different, but reality won't bend to my will. Still, I cling to my dreams. Maybe tomorrow will bring a glimmer of light.

His gaze drifted to his reflection in the grimy window, where lines deepened from years of hard work and little reward. A gust of wind swept away a discarded receipt, echoing the scattered remnants of his career and dreams. He couldn't help but think about what could've been if he'd made different choices. If he'd taken that job 15 years ago, if he'd stayed in school longer, if he'd followed his artistic side instead of settling for security.

I really want to meet someone someday, but it's getting harder. Every time I see a happy couple, I feel like I've failed at love. My life is going nowhere. It's pointless for me to try dating again. I'll never find someone who loves me. They'd probably prefer someone younger than me anyway. I don't even deserve to dream of having a partner. Maybe if I got rid of these feelings, I could finally accept my situation. But it's hard when every happy couple reminds me of what I'm missing. I shouldn’t even care, but I do. The pain of loneliness keeps growing stronger. Maybe I’m just meant to be alone forever. I’ve tried everything, but nothing works. It’s not fair.
