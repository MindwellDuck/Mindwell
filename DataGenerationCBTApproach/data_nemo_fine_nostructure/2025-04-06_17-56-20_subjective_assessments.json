He had been married for twenty years today, but his wife was home alone, her tears falling onto their empty bed. His partner's funeral was scheduled for tomorrow.",

How could she just leave like this? They were meant to be together, and now it feels like everything has fallen apart. She should have known how much our relationship meant. Why did she give up so easily? Maybe if she saw things from my perspective, she would understand. I know what's best for us, and I'm the only one who can make it work. If only she had listened to me, none of this would happen. This isn't fair at all; I'm the good guy here. This is all her fault. If she hadn't let her doubts consume her, we wouldn't be facing this. She should have trusted me more. I always knew what was best for her, and now look where it got us - dead end. She doesn't even try to see things from my point of view anymore. We used to be a team; now she's just going through the motions. I don't get why she does this. It's not right. She should be grateful I still want to help her through this. We've been together for decades, and she should appreciate the sacrifices I made for our family. What am I supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for death? No, she should stay strong for me, for us. Her behavior makes no sense."

She paused as she heard laughter filtering in from the dining area. Her colleagues were sharing stories and jokes over glasses of wine, but she wasn't invited. She caught sight of one of them, a young woman who reminded her of herself when she was younger, leaning into another colleague's gaze with a familiarity that made her stomach churn. The knife she had been cleaning slipped from her grasp, clattering onto the countertop as jealousy surged through her like a tidal wave.",

They seem to have found their place in the world, while I'm still searching. It's like they're trying to tell me something – *You'll never fit in.* But deep down, I know the real message is *You're not good enough.** *Last night, I saw those two women again, standing side by side, holding hands.

And yet, here I am, all alone. If only he knew how much he hurt me... But no, he wouldn't care. He doesn't even remember our first date. How can someone forget something so important? And what about last night? We had sex, but it wasn't enough. I'm not good enough. There has to be more to life than this loneliness. Why does he have to go fishing with his friend, leaving me behind? Doesn't he know I love him? It feels like my heart is shattering into a million pieces, each one harder to mend than the last. I feel abandoned, left to pick up the shattered remains of my dreams. It's cruel, unfair, and I don't see any way out of this misery. My mind is racing with thoughts of what could have been, what might have been if only things had gone differently. Now, it's too late. All I'm left with is the pain of remembering what could never be. I'm trapped in this hell, unable to escape, forced to relive every memory of our time together. Every moment we shared,"

She was going through so much, and yet he couldn't help but think about how she might see him—a stranger, taking away what little comfort she had left. Every glance from another nurse felt like a judgment, as if they were all waiting for him to make a mistake. Even the quiet hum of the machines seemed menacing, like a reminder that this wasn’t his place. He wondered if anyone else could relate to these feelings of isolation and guilt, or if he truly was alone in this nightmare. The more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that something was terribly wrong, and everyone around him was hiding secrets."

She couldn't help but wonder if she had somehow been wrong all along—perhaps he never truly loved her, just used her until he got what he wanted. Now, with him gone, everything felt hollow, even the once-warm space now chilled by the silence. As she continued to cook, the onion's sharpness became a reminder that life itself could be brutal, leaving her feeling numb and isolated. The onions seemed to mock her with each chop, their pungency echoing the bitterness in her heart. Even the smell of fresh herbs couldn't lift the heavy fog of disappointment that had settled over her. Each movement felt forced, like she was going through the motions instead of truly living.

Maybe then she wouldn’t feel so overwhelmed by work and home responsibilities. It’s just one vase, after all—just a material thing. But it feels like a reminder of everything else she wishes she’d done differently. Her thoughts turn to her own children, who are grown and moved out years ago. If she had taken more time for herself, maybe they wouldn’t be so independent, wouldn’t need her so much less. She wonders how her life would have turned out if she hadn’t chosen to be a doctor. Would she be happier? More relaxed? Free to pursue her passions instead of dedicating her life to helping others? Perhaps then she could enjoy simple pleasures without the weight of responsibility.

It was a recurring theme throughout his life; people seemed to forget about him until it was too late. He couldn't blame them; after all, no one wants to be reminded of their past mistakes. But why did this happen so frequently? Was he really that invisible? Or was it just a case of people being too busy to care? It wasn't just the lack of fresh herbs that bothered him. Everything felt off—the chairs were dirty, the tables weren't set, and the trash needed taking out. It was as if everyone had forgotten about him, left him to deal with the chaos alone. And then there was the way the staff looked at each other, whispering whenever someone approached. They didn't seem to notice him, even though he'd been here every day for months. It was starting to feel like I was invisible, and that was making me angry. His mind began to wander back to his ex-wife, who used to make him feel seen. She'd remember important dates and surprise him with small gifts. Now, it seemed like no one cared. Maybe he was just imagining things, but he could swear he saw her smile when she thought he wasn't looking. That made everything worse. Why did it have to be like this? Couldn't anyone see how much he needed attention? It wasn't just the little things that bothered him—it was the bigger picture"
