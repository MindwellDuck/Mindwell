It was of him and an unfamiliar woman laughing together at a café, their hands entwined. The date stamp showed it was taken three years ago, around the time they were supposed to be planning their wedding. She felt her heart sink as she traced the woman's smile with her fingertip, sadness washing over her like a cold wave.",

She thought about how he might have been in love with her then but now felt nothing for her.

They seem so happy. It's like they're trying to show off how perfect their life is. That woman's smile looks so genuine; she's probably never had to worry about bills or work stress like we have. And the way he looks at her... he loves her more than I ever loved her. It hurts to see someone else having that kind of love. I wonder if they'll be able to keep up the romance after all this. Marriage is hard enough when you're young; now they must be feeling overwhelmed. I can't help but think they'll eventually get bored with each other, just like many couples I've seen over the years. But maybe I'm just jealous because I can't find anyone who cares for me like that anymore. Maybe they're just pretending to be happy to make themselves feel better. Anyway, I wish them well. They deserve it more than I do."

They didn't deserve to see her cry. But then she remembered something. She had received a compliment from a regular customer just days before—something about his kind words made her smile. He had said he appreciated her help and always felt welcome when he came into the store. It was such a small gesture, but it reminded her that maybe not every interaction is negative. Maybe some people are genuinely nice, even if they can be quick-tempered. But she pushed the thought away, focusing instead on the harsh words the teenager had used. After all, you can't let things like that get to you. You have to keep moving forward, no matter what. So far, so good, right? ---"

And I thought, “Well, maybe I did feel something, but I wouldn’t say it’s a big deal.” She noticed how quickly I brushed off her question, saying, “It’s okay, you can cry later,” which made me think, “She must be overreacting.” When we were discussing the situation, my wife mentioned that she had been looking forward to attending the opening night. I responded by saying, “Don’t worry, there will always be other opportunities to see the show,” which seemed to satisfy her. However, I couldn't help feeling a little annoyed at myself for not standing up for my work more strongly. The next day, I started thinking, “Maybe I could have handled it better if I hadn’t let her get to me with those tears.\" In hindsight, I wish I would’ve acknowledged my emotions instead of trying to downplay them.

Just needed to make sure everything was alright before he even bothered cleaning up this mess. (The pile of books on the desk was starting to look like an avalanche waiting to happen.) The idea of leaving it all behind—books, papers, even the scattered notes from his latest project—seemed utterly unnecessary. He could always start again tomorrow. Besides, there were more pressing things to worry about than tidying up. His daughter's safety, for instance. Or his own peace of mind. There was nothing wrong with enjoying the beauty of the day, taking a break from the chaos of life.

This was no longer just about taking out the trash; it was about the state of our entire existence. If I couldn’t even bother with something as simple as cleaning up after ourselves, how could we possibly hope to build anything meaningful moving forward? This wasn’t just about the dishes; it was about the decay of our connection. What else would she give up? Would she stop loving me? Had I become so insignificant that every little thing felt like a betrayal? I saw this moment as a turning point. Wasn’t it a sign that she’d lost all patience for me? That maybe she truly wanted out of this marriage? Or was she just tired from work? Tired of everything? Maybe she didn’t want me anymore, and the only way to prove it was by giving me one final chance—to make things right before it was too late. But then again, perhaps this was just another excuse for her to break free from the monotony of our routine. Either way, I knew I couldn’t handle much more of this."
