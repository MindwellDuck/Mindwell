This isn't the first time something like this has happened, but the connection to her makes it all seem so much worse. It's either a huge mistake with no meaning, or a deliberate attempt to harm him. If it was an accident, then why did she downplay it? If she was behind it, then why would she deny it now? The more he thinks about it, the more black and white his mind becomes—she’s either guilty or she’s telling the truth, with no middle ground. This kind of thinking always leads to conflict. I hate how my emotions swing from rage to despair, never staying balanced for a moment. Maybe if I just calm down, I'll see things clearly again, but until then, every path feels like a dead end."

Why can't she see how much I need these things? Don't you ever think about how hard it is to keep our life together without all the little things? I've been patient with her for months now, and what does it even matter if she forgets something? You never listen to me anyway, so why should I care about your mistakes? This isn't the first time she's lost something important. Do you really expect me to just forgive her again? Maybe next time I'll remind her to pick it up before she leaves it somewhere. That way, I won't feel so angry and hurt when it happens again. I know she'll come back from whatever she's doing, and we'll get along again. We always do.
