His editor had been clear: they needed him there, now. But the fear of the unknown keeps him up late, his mind racing with all the things that could go wrong. In reality, he knows his role and has done everything he can. Yet, these thoughts linger, each one fueling a sense of anxiety that makes it difficult to shake off. The darkness outside mirrors the turmoil within, as if the night itself is trying to tell him something. He feels stuck between two worlds—the world of reality and the world of endless possibilities, where every action triggers another chain of questions. His mind is lost in a maze of ‘what ifs’, each step forward taken in uncertainty, while the world around him moves on, oblivious to his internal struggle."

The silence was almost deafening, a stark contrast to the sounds of the bustling city nearby. As he opened the door to his small apartment, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something important. Life seemed to flow smoothly for others, but he was left standing outside, observing everything without being part of it. His thoughts drifted back to the couple walking hand-in-hand, their joy a painful reminder of what he lacked. They seemed so content, moving toward a future together, while he felt lost and alone. Even the simple act of turning on the TV brought up memories of happier times. He remembered how his parents would sit together, watching movies or listening to music, enjoying each other's company.

It seemed like every guy she met just didn’t have that special connection with her, and she began to think maybe she was destined to be alone forever. With each new rejection, her hope dwindled further, until she started to believe that true love was nothing more than an illusion - one that only existed in movies and fairy tales. That realization made her feel even more isolated, making her wonder if she truly belonged anywhere. The pain from past relationships lingered, making it difficult to trust anyone new.

But then there’s the argument we had. We were always fighting, never really resolving anything. I remember the last time we spoke, how we both knew our relationship was over. Her words cut deep, telling me she couldn’t stay because she’d rather die alone than live without me. I tried to convince her otherwise, but she wouldn’t budge. Even after all these years, I wonder if I’m to blame for her decision. Maybe if I had changed somehow, if I had been better, she would still be here.
