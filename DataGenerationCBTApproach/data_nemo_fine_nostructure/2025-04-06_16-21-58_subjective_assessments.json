She couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, he preferred the company of others over hers. The thought hung in the air, a constant reminder that her efforts to stay busy might have been for nothing. As she stood there, lost in her thoughts, she realized that her desire for connection had turned into a desperate need for reassurance.

That rat is disgusting too. Ugh, I need to get rid of it before it contaminates everything. We can't have this in our home. What kind of monster brings a rodent into their own house? And those droppings everywhere? It smells awful. I hate rats. They're so dirty and disease-ridden. I hope that's all there is. This isn't right.
