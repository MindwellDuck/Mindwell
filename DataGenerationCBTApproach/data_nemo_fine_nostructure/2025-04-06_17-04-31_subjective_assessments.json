It wasn't until later, when she received an email from another artist praising her work, did she start to realize that perhaps the answer lay not in what others thought, but in her own growth as an artist.

In fact, the whole experience felt like more evidence of his bad attitude, reinforcing the idea that he's never willing to lend a helping hand or offer kindness to others. It seemed like every time they crossed paths, he was rude, dismissive, or uncooperative—just like the last few times they met at school. Even though there could be many reasons why the police officer acted negatively towards him, such as personal issues or stress at work, it didn’t change the way he felt about the situation. He wasn't going to let this one incident, or even the past interactions, make him forget how much he disliked the man. This event only strengthened his opinion that the officer was inherently cruel, and he wouldn't forgive him anytime soon. # EDIT: Thank you all for your comments! I really appreciate it! Also, thank you to those who pointed out the mistake with the title. I'm glad I could clarify my intention through the post itself.

He'd been coming here for decades, but today it felt different. Colder. Empty. His late wife's picture still smiled at him from the desk, her eyes following him as he moved around the room.\n\nHe noticed a new email notification on his computer. It was from the university, congratulating a young researcher on winning an award for their work in astrophysics - his wife's field of expertise. He felt a familiar sting, a bitterness that had become all too common since her passing five years ago.\n\nHe clicked through to the researcher's profile picture. A young woman with bright eyes and a wide smile stared back at him, seemingly taunting him with her youth and vitality. His wife would have been around her age now if she were still alive. The bitterness grew stronger, settling in his chest like a stone.\n\nHe looked back at the email, his vision blurring slightly as he read the words of praise for the young researcher's work. He couldn't help but think that it should have been his wife receiving these accolades, not some stranger. The bitterness turned into anger, and he felt a sudden urge to lash out, to scream, to break something.\n\nBut he didn't. Instead, he closed the email with a quiet click of the mouse, turned off the computer, and left the lab without looking back at his wife's picture. He walked home in the rain, letting the cold drops wash over him, trying to cleanse himself of the bitterness that threatened to consume him.",

Like I’m being reminded that she doesn’t exist anymore. It's funny how things can turn sour just by seeing a photo. Or reading a message. It's like my brain is trying to tell me something, but I don’t want to listen. Maybe it’s just me being selfish? I guess I am, though. I wish there was a way to make myself forget, to erase the pain. To take away the emptiness that fills my heart whenever I remember her. But it’s always there, lurking just beneath the surface. Waiting to pounce. And when it does, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom. Again. At first, I thought maybe I could use this opportunity to talk to someone about my feelings. Someone who could understand. But then I realized that even if they listened, nothing would change. Nothing ever does. So why bother? Why try to hold on to anything when everything slips through your fingers anyway? I don't know why I wrote all this down.

Meanwhile, she struggled to find inspiration in her paintings, which now felt hollow without the touch of her partner's hand. Every brushstroke reminded her of what she'd lost, making it hard to see the beauty in her art. As she dipped her brush into the paint, she couldn't help but think about those artists who found success despite being single. Their stories inspired her, but it didn't change the reality of her own situation. She couldn't shake off the feeling that her life was falling apart, just like the colors blending together on her canvas. Her heart ached with each passing day, longing for the warmth of her husband's presence, but instead, she faced the harsh truth - she was alone. This isolation wasn't something she chose; it came as a result of circumstances beyond her control. Yet, when she compared herself to others, she felt like a failure.
