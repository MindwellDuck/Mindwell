She had been working tirelessly for hours, and her stomach churned with hunger. As she reached for a sandwich from the communal fridge, she noticed a group of younger colleagues laughing nearby. Their eyes flickered towards her, then quickly glanced away, stifling smirks. The woman paused, feeling her cheeks grow warm as she realized her lab coat was unbuttoned, revealing more than she intended. She hurriedly fastened it, her embarrassment silently palpable amidst the now-silent group.",

If she had washed it off right away, it would have washed away. Now that she thinks about it, there are other times when she got it on her clothes too. She has had stomach issues lately, and maybe this time it was just a little too much for her body to handle. Or perhaps it's something more serious, like food poisoning? She could be getting sick because of how stressed out she's been lately. Maybe all these things together mean she needs to take a few days off work to rest and recover."

What if she couldn't read anymore? **She wondered why he hadn't reacted sooner:** Hadn't he noticed her frustration? Didn't he realize how much it meant to her? Why wasn't he helping? Did he think she could handle this alone?"

Her eyes wander back to the letter, folded neatly between the stacks of old books and papers. It wasn't meant for me, yet I read it again and again, trying to find a truth in those words. Maybe she never forgave us, maybe she was just tired of our arguments. The pain is so familiar, like an old friend who never leaves. She can't help but wonder what could have been if they had stayed together. But even this sorrow has its beauty—a reminder of love that once was, and a chance to rebuild something new. Perhaps today will bring peace, a small victory against the weight of the past. Maybe the sun will shine brighter than ever, warming her heart with its rays, reminding her that every end marks a new beginning. Or maybe it won't be enough; maybe the shadows will always linger, waiting to pull her down again. Still, she holds onto hope, cherishing the moments of light, no matter how fleeting they may seem. Each breath brings her closer to healing, one step at a time, until she finds solace in the present. For now, she'll let go of anger and embrace the beauty of forgiveness, knowing that time heals everything, and that sometimes, the best things come after the worst. In the end, there’s always tomorrow, filled"

This latest call didn’t even surprise him; it was just another patient waiting for care, but the weight of responsibility made every moment feel like a burden. The world outside these walls moved on, but here, time stood still, trapped in an endless loop of pain and suffering. The patients’ cries echoed through his mind, each one a reminder of what he couldn’t save. The doctors who stayed late were already burned out, but he could see the desperation in their eyes—their own limits stretched thin, yet they kept going. They worked because they had to, not because they chose this life willingly. In this place, where medical miracles often turned to tragedies, he was just another face in the crowd, fighting against the tide of hopelessness that seemed to pull everything down. Every shift felt like a step closer to losing himself, to becoming just another statistic in a sea of broken dreams. The work itself wasn’t so bad; it was the reality of it all that crushed him. He saw people at their worst, fighting for survival, and he knew he couldn’t change that. Each patient represented a failure, a reminder of"
