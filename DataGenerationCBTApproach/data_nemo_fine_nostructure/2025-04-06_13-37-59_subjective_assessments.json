        "Triggering Event": "Retired officer sat alone in his dimly lit living room, fingers tracing the engraved words \"In Memory of\" on his old service revolver. The clock struck midnight, echoing the emptiness of his silent home. His estranged daughter's birthday passed unacknowledged earlier that week, another year marked without a call or card. He poured himself another whiskey, the amber liquid catching the moonlight like the fleeting glimpse he'd caught of her at the mall last month - too brief to warrant hope, but long enough for regret to claw at his heart.",

Her eyes fall on the canvas he left unfinished, the colors still vibrant despite the years. A sudden gust through the open window blows a stray lock of hair across her face, the sensation echoing the chill she's felt since that fateful day. She reaches out to touch the paintbrush resting on the edge of his palette, its bristles stiff and unyielding, just like her heart.",

She pauses, then touches it gently, as if trying to feel something from him. Her gaze drifts away, lost in thought, and I can't help but think she sees what we all do - a man who loved painting more than anything else, leaving behind a legacy of color and emotion. But now, it feels hollow, a reminder of what could never be again."

As she ran her fingers over the title, a sob caught in her throat, unexpectedly raw after all these months. She opened it to find the pressed flower from their last walk together, now brittle and faded. Tears spilled over, tracing paths down her cheeks as she remembered their laughter that day. The house felt hollow without his warmth, his voice echoing only in her memories.",

The way he'd always keep a favorite book by the bed, how our walks were always about more than just getting there—a moment to share, a memory to hold onto. It was as if every detail—the smell of wood polish, the feel of worn leather—was meant to remind me of him. She felt like she was drowning in the memories we created, each one a thread in the tapestry of their life. Every time she looked at something, she saw him, even when she knew he wasn’t there. That old chair, the way the sunlight filtered through the blinds—it all brought tears to her eyes because it reminded her of us sitting together, holding hands, and talking about our dreams. And now, with this book, I’m overwhelmed again, feeling like I’ll never be free from the grief. It’s like every little thing is just a trigger for the same ache inside me. I wish I could go back to those moments, but I know they’re gone forever. Still, I can’t help but cling to them, reliving what we shared whenever I see something like this. It feels like my heart is trying to tell me something, but I don’t know what. I guess I just need some time to understand. Maybe then, I’ll learn to move forward."

I guess he could have asked my sister if she wanted to stay over but no, he didn’t want to bother her. That’s probably for the best anyway; we were having some issues lately. Maybe now that she’s gone, things will settle down around here. It won’t be long before he gets used to cooking by himself again.
