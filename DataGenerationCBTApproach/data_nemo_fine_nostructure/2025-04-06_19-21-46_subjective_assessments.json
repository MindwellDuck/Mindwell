His stomach churned as he dumped the putrid seafood into the trash, his mind flashing back to that final argument with her.",

This is how I feel about your decision to throw away our life savings to pay off your ex-wife's debt: * We can't afford anything right now. * Our credit card balances are already over $50,000. * The bank has threatened to call us every day until we pay up. * If we don't pay, they'll cut off our electricity, internet, and phone. * What if she cheats again? * What if she decides to move in with her new boyfriend? * What if you leave me? I've tried talking to her about it, explaining that there's no point in continuing this cycle of financial stress and potential divorce. But she insists that we can't give up, that we need to hold on somehow, even if it means struggling financially for years. Her arguments make sense emotionally, but they're hard to justify rationally. It feels like she's more invested in saving"

You may already know that your wife has had some health issues in recent years, but she hasn't let them slow her down much. We've seen her take on more responsibilities around the house, like cooking meals for our family. She's also become quite active again, especially when it comes to spending time with friends and loved ones. We've noticed her putting in extra effort into planning events and outings for us. However, lately, there have been moments where she's seemed tired. Not just physically, but mentally as well. There are days when she doesn't seem herself, and sometimes she gets overwhelmed by things that would normally be easy for her. It's almost as if she's struggling to cope with everything going on. I wanted to reach out because I think you might want to know about these changes. As someone who knows her best, I'm worried that this could be related to something more serious. I'm not trying to cause panic, but I thought it was worth sharing so you can keep an eye on her. If you're free, maybe we could talk about this further? Sometimes having someone to listen makes all the difference. Take care, [Your Name]"

They said it wasn't me, it was the way I handled things. But now I know better. Now I realize that I'm not meant to be here. I'm not cut out for this life.

I'm starting to believe that I'm nothing more than a burden. Maybe I should have stayed at the last place, even though they treated me like dirt. At least there, I knew where I stood. Here, I'm just a ghost, invisible and forgotten. Every door I open leads to rejection, every opportunity to disappointment. Why would anyone want me around? I've failed everyone who ever cared about me, including myself. My parents, my friends, my wife... they'd all be happier without me. This is what happens when you're weak, when you let your emotions control you. You lose everything, everyone, and yourself. There’s no point anymore. I might as well end it now and save those around"

Still, I wish she was here with me, sharing some laughs or maybe even a drink. I guess I'm overreacting, thinking things are worse than they really are. It's not a big deal; it's just a night out with friends. They're probably having fun, enjoying themselves, and forgetting all about our little family drama. That's all anyone would want anyway. Maybe I'm just bored because I know she's out somewhere, doing whatever she wants. We always joke about how she has more freedom than me, but deep down, I think I'm okay with that. After all, isn't it better to spend quality time together when she's home? Yeah, I'm fine. Just need to relax and wait for her return.
