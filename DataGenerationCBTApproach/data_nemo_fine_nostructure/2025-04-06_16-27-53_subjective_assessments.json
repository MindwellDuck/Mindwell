I had to work really hard to get good grades. It took me hours to finish it because I wasn't very confident in my writing skills at the time. But I learned from it and improved over time. ## Step 1: Understand the Trigger Identify the specific situation that triggered this response. In this case, a former student approached the speaker with a positive comment about his past academic performance, which may have brought back memories of challenging situations they faced during their own school years. ## Step 2: Reflect on Your Thoughts Take some time to think about your immediate reaction. What emotions did you experience when reading the message? Were there any feelings of guilt, defensiveness, or even happiness? Try to pinpoint exactly what each emotion meant for you and how it influenced your words. For instance, if you felt guilty, that could indicate a need to reevaluate your actions or thoughts related to the student’s request for help. If you were defensive, perhaps you’re questioning whether the student is genuinely happy with your teaching methods or if they're just trying to provoke a reaction. Finally, if you felt happy, ask yourself why that might be—was it genuine joy, or did you feel relieved by the opportunity to show off your skills? ## Step 3: Identify Cognitive Distort"

When he tried to join them, no one invited him. They talked about their children's growth and accomplishments, while John sat quietly, wondering if he was missing something important. Every time someone asked him a question, he froze, unable to respond. His mind went blank, and he felt embarrassed. Even when it was his turn to talk about his students, he couldn’t think of anything meaningful to say. The more he listened to the conversations around him, the more he felt inadequate. He started to feel like he wasn’t cut out for this job. As he looked into the mirror, he saw a man hiding behind closed doors, afraid to face reality. Every smile he imagined was just a facade; deep down, he knew he didn’t belong here."

It's hard enough being a teacher without having to deal with parents like hers who constantly question everything. Even though she knows she's doing a good job, she still can't help but feel frustrated when no one takes her seriously. When someone asks how her day is going, she'll just say \"It's fine\" and move on. It's easier that way. She doesn't want to burden anyone else with her problems. Besides, she can handle it herself. That's what she's trained for, right? She doesn't need sympathy or pity. People should see her as strong, capable, and resilient - just like she wants everyone else to see her."
