She never comes back early; it takes her forever to finish her book. I guess that’s why she has so many books to read. The thought keeps me up at night, wondering if this is normal behavior. My friends say they feel the same way, but I'm worried my mind will start playing tricks on me, making everything seem worse than it actually is. Maybe I’m just overreacting, but I can’t shake off this feeling of emptiness in the car. Whenever I see an empty seat, I get sad, thinking about how much we miss each other. I try to remind myself that it’s not unusual for her to go out, but I still feel down. I wonder if anyone else feels this way when their partner goes out with friends, even if it’s just once a month. Does everyone feel the same sadness I do? Or am I just being dramatic?"

She thought about how he always put his jacket on the hook by the door. Why didn't he just hang his coat in its designated spot? This morning, she woke up early, eager to start cleaning. She noticed the open cabinet and decided to wash the dishes immediately. When she opened the cabinet again, she saw that he had taken out all the plates and cups except for the one with the chip. She wondered if he had planned to use it today. If so, he could have easily closed the cabinet before leaving. Instead, he left it open, which made her feel annoyed. She told herself that he should have kept everything organized and tidy, especially since he always did it this way at home. But then, she remembered how he used to take his lunch outside and forget his water bottle. That time, she couldn’t help but think, \"He should have packed his lunch better.\" And another time, he forgot to turn off the stove after cooking dinner. She thought to herself, \"If only he took responsibility and turned off the stove, there wouldn't be a fire hazard.\" Now, she realized that she often reacted strongly to these small things."

Her mind couldn’t help but wander to the countless others who were still alive, but whose time might be running out silently. Every shift seemed like a countdown, each new patient a reminder that she could lose one more person before she herself fell ill. The room felt colder than usual, and she wondered if there was even a point in continuing – shouldn't everyone just stay home? Shouldn't we stop working until the virus is gone?"

It makes me feel jealous because I don't know what to say to them when they come in my store. Maybe if I was more confident, I could be more outgoing and friendly. But every time I try, I end up looking awkward and uninterested. I guess I just need to work on building my confidence. That would help a lot. And maybe I'll try to be less shy and more talkative when customers come in. If I act more confident, they might think I'm more interesting and I wouldn't feel so jealous. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Building my self-confidence will solve everything. (Sigh) Now I wish I wasn't here. I hate working here."

What if they sat together, sipping tea, just as they did before, when life felt simpler? As she holds the card, memories flood her mind - laughter, tears, and moments of joy shared between them. She recalls how her mom used to tell her, \"Life is precious; don't waste it.\" But now, as she looks at the card, she can’t help but feel a pang of sadness. What if she had asked her mom more often? What if they’d spent those days together instead of letting time slip away? In her imagination, she sees herself telling her mom everything she's been through since her passing. She'd ask her advice, seek her guidance, and listen to her wisdom. She pictures her mom offering words of comfort, reminding her of happy times, and encouraging her to live life to the fullest. She wonders what it would be like if her mom were still here, if they could relive those moments together. Would things have turned out differently? Would they have found peace? Or would the same pain still linger? As she closes her eyes, imagining her mom sitting beside her, she feels a deep longing. It’s as if the past and present"

She had been gone for months now, leaving behind only memories of laughter and tears. The thought of rebuilding his life, finding new purpose, seemed impossible. Everything felt stuck, frozen in place like this empty space where she used to sit. Even the faint hum of the refrigerator outside seemed distant, muffled by the grief that still lingered inside him.
