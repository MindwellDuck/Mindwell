As she took her regular seat by the window, she noticed a familiar face laughing with someone new - an attractive woman with a radiant smile. It was him, the barista she'd been secretly admiring for months, his eyes sparkling as he shared a joke with this stranger. The jealousy surged through her like a bitter latte, leaving her feeling hollow and unseen. She quickly gathered her things, leaving without ordering, her usual afternoon escape now tainted by an unfamiliar sting.",

Two people enjoying each other's company in that spot where she usually sat. A glance from him, and suddenly, everything felt off. He hadn't looked up when she entered, but now, his gaze drifted back to her, lingering for a moment before returning to the conversation. The casual touch on the arm, the playful nudge, and the laughter all seemed so... deliberate. Like he was trying to show her something. Or maybe he wasn't. Maybe he simply enjoyed being around both of them. The thought made her feel awkward, like she was intruding on something private. Her mind began to spiral, wondering if she was too late, if this was some kind of pre-planned gathering. Had he already planned this meeting? Was this just a coincidence? The questions swirled in her head, making her feel restless. She could've easily sat down and ordered her usual, but instead, she got up and left, letting the warmth of the cafÃ© fade away, replaced by the chill of uncertainty."

Her car was gone from the driveway, no note left behind.\n\nHe slumped down on the couch, his radio crackling softly beside him. Another late night shift ahead, but he couldn't bring himself to get up, to leave this cold, empty house. He felt a familiar tightening in his chest, a hollowness that gnawed at him.

Tonight, he realized she wasn't coming back. It was over. They were done. The words stung, but they felt true. He felt numb, like he was drowning in an endless sea of emptiness. He stared blankly around the room, the silence deafening. There was nothing to hold onto, nothing to cling to. Everything had fallen apart, and he didn't know why or how. All he knew was that he'd lost her, and he couldn't find his way back. As he sat there, he felt his mind slipping away, consumed by grief. He couldn't stop thinking about what could have been, what might have happened if things had been different. He wondered if she was still alive, if she'd ever come back to him.

It was all so much easier when they were together, sharing laughter and warmthâ€”now, he felt lost, drifting through the days without her by his side. He wondered if she realized how much he missed her, how much he longed for just one moment of comfort, but then again, maybe she didn't care enough to try. He thought about how she'd always been there for him, listening and supporting him through thick and thin. She knew him better than anyone else, could see right through to his insecurities and doubts. But now, with every passing day, those qualities seemed more like burdens than blessings. Her presence in his life had been a constant reminder of everything he couldn't controlâ€”the arguments, the tears, the pain. Even though she was gone, her absence felt almost as crushing as her anger during their fights. A sudden wave of frustration washed over him, and he slammed the cupboard shut harder than necessary, the sound echoing through the room. It wasn't her fault; she hadn't said anything to hurt him.
