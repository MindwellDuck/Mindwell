It seemed like a sign that he had come back to her in spirit, reminding her of all the times they spent together. She felt a lump form in her throat as she gazed at the tiny creature moving slowly along the edge of the paper, oblivious to everything else around it. The fact that it had been there for so long, unnoticed by everyone but her, made it feel even more personal. This was proof that her life wasn't just going through the motions; there was still something here, holding on tight."

Every time she glanced back at him, it only fueled his anger - why would she want to be with someone like me? I'm a failure, after all. His mind kept racing with thoughts of how much money she'd saved by leaving him, and how she must have already started spending it on fancy dinners and vacations. He imagined her laughing with her new boyfriend behind his back, enjoying every moment while he struggled to make ends meet. His anger grew stronger with each passing minute, and he found himself wishing harm upon her new partner. As he drove away, he couldn't shake off the feeling of betrayal. Why did she choose someone like him when there were so many other men who deserved her love? He wondered if she ever thought about him, whether she regretted abandoning him. But deep down, he knew the truth - she was gone forever, and nothing could bring her back."

She thinks it's so disgusting when I accidentally touch my face after being around someone who has cold sores. I'm pretty sure she'd say something about how licking your fingers is gross if she knew that was what this woman did. My mom also told me once that if someone touches me, they might have an infection, which makes sense, but I still think it's kind of mean to make such a big deal out of it. Some people are just more...unhygienic than others, right? But now I'm thinking about all those times I saw my little sister try to eat things that were covered in dirt and dust, and how she got sick from it, and how my mom freaked out about it.

Sometimes I feel like she doesn't care enough about what matters most—like our family and close friends—and that's why these moments happen more often than I’d like. It feels like there are some things in life she just doesn’t make time for, and that bothers me."

The thought sent me spiraling down a rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios. I started imagining myself stuck in this limbo forever, unable to find a new job. My mind conjured images of a life without purpose, where every day would feel meaningless. I couldn’t shake off the fear that I was losing everything—my reputation, my confidence, and even my marriage. My wife’s face kept flashing in my head, and I wondered if she’d even care anymore. If she’d still want me after seeing how easily things fell apart. I felt trapped, unsure if I could escape this cycle of self-doubt. Every moment passed like an eternity, leaving me more anxious than ever. I knew I needed to focus on the positive, but the fear of what could happen made it hard to breathe. I just wished"
