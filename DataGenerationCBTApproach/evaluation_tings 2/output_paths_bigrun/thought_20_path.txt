Thought: Me and my boyfriend have been going out for about 6 months, and he’s NEVER given me any reason to not trust him. He’s never cheated, lied, or anything remotely close to that. He’s always been honest with me and never fails to be affectionate and tell me how much he cares about me. But I can’t trust him. And I get extremely bad separation anxiety when I’m not with him. I always want to try and control him, who he’s with, where he goes, what he’s doing, and I never want him to do anything if I’m not involved. Which, clearly isn’t healthy at all. I get so anxious and jealous about everything he does that I’m not there for. And it’s starting to ruin our relationship.
