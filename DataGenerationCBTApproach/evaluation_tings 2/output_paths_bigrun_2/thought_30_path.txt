Thought: My son is now 13 and had been diagnosed ED / ADHD since he was 3.  I was a single mom the first 4 years of his life, and married when he was four.  I now have two other boys, 2 and 4, and my husband and I are struggling to deal with the oldest’s behaviors.  It is actually causing me to be very depressed at times and it is straining our marriage.  I’m not sure what I can do, to help him and us.  I feel like I’m going to literally lose my mind on a daily basis. I end up snapping at everyone or not dealing with normal issues, because I feel so overwhelmed.
