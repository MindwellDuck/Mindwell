My Albert would have loved it, but then again, he wasn't a stuck-up, pretentious... oh, never mind.

You've recently finished a painting that you believe is your best work yet. Today, you decide to take it to a prestigious gallery downtown, hoping for some recognition. However, the gallery owner dismisses your painting as unworthy. Write down Martha's reaction, reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Fortune Telling' in an anxious, sarcastic tone.\n\n**Martha Johnson's Reaction:**\n\n*Oh, isn't that just splendid?* I trudged home from that stuffy old gallery today, my precious painting tucked under my arm like a wounded bird. * Typical of them to dismiss my art without a second glance.* I can just see it now - tomorrow's headlines: \"Another Aspiring Artist Crumbles Under Gallerist's Scrutiny.\" *Oh, the tragedy!* They'll all be lining up to watch me wilt away in shame.\n\n*But you know what?* I won't give them that satisfaction. I won't let my dreams turn into some morbid spectacle for their amusement. No, I refuse to let this rejection define me. Because next time - yes, there will be a next time! - they'll see Martha Johnson's name in lights, not in some cheap, discounted frame.\n\n*Oh, but Martha,* you say, *what if that next time never comes?* Well, then I suppose I'll just have to create my own light. Because, darling, the world might be full of gallerists who think they know better, but it's also full of dreamers who prove them wrong. And I intend to be one of those dreamers."

Kid's barely old enough to grow facial hair, but he's already got an attitude like he knows it all.\n\nYesterday, we get a call about some punk busting up a convenience store down on 5th. I roll up with the kid, right? Storeowner's freaking out, cash register's busted open, and there's this goddamn hero complex bubbling under my partner's skin. He starts pushing me aside, says he'll \"handle it.\" I tell him to hold his horses, we need a tactical plan first.\n\nKid looks at me like I've lost my marbles. \"Sir,\" he says, all condescending, \"we don't have time for that. The suspect could be getting away.\"\n\nSo, I step aside, let the hotshot do his thing. He storms in there like Rambo on a mission, and what does he find? Piss-stained pants and a terrified teen hiding behind the counter, crying about how it was all just a misunderstanding. Turns out, some other punks dared him to rob the place.\n\nI watch through the window as my partner's got this \"I can't believe I fell for this\" face. And do you know what he does? He actually pulls out his damn notebook and starts taking down a statement!

But damn it, I know what I'm doing. I've been at this longer than he's been alive. He can't just...just look at me like that.\" I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to push away the mental image of his smug little face.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. \"It's not about him,\" I told myself. \"It's about the job.

Her heart pounded like a damn drum in her chest as she lay there, eyes wide open, staring into the darkness.\n\n\"Damn it,\" she muttered, \"not again.\"\n\nShe'd moved to this quiet neighborhood for peace, but it seemed even the silence was against her. Every creak, every whisper of wind through the old trees outside set her nerves on edge. She swore she could hear footsteps sometimes, slow and deliberate, pacing around her house.\n\nTonight, though, there was something else. A faint tapping at her window. It started soft, almost imperceptible, but grew louder, more insistent. Her breath caught in her throat as she strained to listen.\n\n\"Who's there?\" she called out, voice shaking. No answer, just the tapping, steady and rhythmic. She felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. \"Go away,\" she whispered, pulling her blankets tighter around her.\n\nThe tapping stopped suddenly. Silence hung heavy in the air. Then, a soft scratching, like nails against glass. Her heart leapt into her throat. She was alone here, so goddamn alone. No one to hear her scream if something... or someone... broke through that window.\n\nShe reached for her phone, fingers trembling as she dialed 911. But the line just rang and rang, no answer, no reassuring voice promising help on the way. She hung up, cursing under her breath.\n\nThe scratching continued, steady, relentless.

This was supposed to be peaceful, quiet. But it's just another sleepless night in this damn house.\n\nThat tapping? It's not some stupid bird or branch, she knows better. It's a message, a taunt from whoever's out there. They're laughing at her, mocking her fear with every tap. Why else would they stop and start again like that? She can't just ignore it, pretend it's nothing. Not like those idiot neighbors who'd tell her to \"just chill\" whenever she'd hear something strange.\n\nHer heart feels like a runaway train, smashing through her ribcage, threatening to explode out of her chest. It's not normal, this panic that grips her every night. But no one understands, no one gets it. They'd tell her she's overreacting, blowing things out of proportion. She knows better though, can't trust those idiots.\n\nThe phone rings once, twice... and then silence. No reassuring voice on the other end. Just more mocking silence from this godforsaken night. She feels a familiar anger rising in her chest, hot and bitter. This is why she can't rely on anyone else. They'll always let her down, leave her hanging.\n\nShe's alone here, completely alone with whatever's out there.

Today, he was alone with the man's decaying form, the stench of necrosis overwhelming despite the precautions taken.\n\nAs Samuel drew near the bedside, Mr. Hargrove turned his head, eyes glazed and unfocused.

He couldn't bring himself to touch that putrid ooze, let alone deliver such heartrending news to a grieving widow-to-be.
