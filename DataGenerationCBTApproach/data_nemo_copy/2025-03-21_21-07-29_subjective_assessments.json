He'd just hung up from another heated argument with the hospital board about funding for the new wing. Frustration coursed through him like a fever, his hands trembling slightly as he ran them through his salt-and-pepper hair.\n\n\"Christ almighty,\" he muttered, turning to face the wall adorned with framed photos of his family. His wife, Martha, and their two grown children smiled back at him, oblivious to the storm brewing inside him.\n\nThe phone rang again. He snatched it up without looking, snarling, \"What is it now?\" into the receiver. It was Martha.\n\n\"Henry,\" she said, her voice gentle but firm, \"you okay? I heard you shouting all the way downstairs.\"\n\nHe sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"It's nothing, Martha. Just... work.\"\n\nShe paused before saying softly, \"You've been snapping at everyone lately. The kids noticed too.\"\n\nHenry felt a surge of guilt mixed with anger. He slammed his fist on the desk, shouting, \"Fuck! I'm trying here, okay? But nobody seems to give a damn about what this hospital needs!\"\n\nHe could hear Martha's sharp intake of breath before she said quietly, \"You're not alone in this, Henry. We're here for you. Talk to us.\"\n\nHenry looked at the photo of his family again, their smiles now seeming like taunts. He felt a lump form in his throat, but he swallowed it down with a bitter curse.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" he snapped before hanging up, leaving Martha's concerned voice echoing in his head. \"Fuck,\" he said again, softer this time, as he sank into his chair, feeling the weight of his frustration like a physical force pushing him down.",

I'm the only one busting my ass for this godforsaken hospital, and what do I get? A fucking headache and a wife who thinks I need therapy.\"\n\nHe slammed back the rest of his drink, smacking his lips together like he could taste all their perfect little lives in it. \"You know what, Martha?\" he shouted at the phone after slamming it down. \"I'm doing just fucking peachy compared to some people. At least I ain't got a house full of kids who don't give a shit about my problems.\" He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms like he'd won some fucked-up argument with himself. \"Yeah, that's right.

Her hands, calloused from years of wielding knives, danced over the cutting board in a rhythm that was hers alone. The symphony of sizzles and clanks echoed around her, drowning out the din of the dining room.\n\nTonight's special: Coq au Vin. Her signature dish. She'd been looking forward to it all week. The kitchen crew had been prepping since dawn, the wine had been reduced to a velvety syrup, and the bacon was crisping in the pan like nature's perfect little snack. Everything was falling into place, or so she thought.\n\nHer partner, Tom, the ma\u00eetre d', had promised her that tonight would be different. No last-minute changes, no substitutions, just a smooth service from start to finish. They'd been together for years, both in business and in life, but lately, it felt like they were speaking different languages.\n\n\"Chef, we've got a problem,\" the sous-chef whispered, leaning into her space. She turned to face him, knife still in hand, eyes flashing with that familiar fire. \"Table seven wants their Coq au Vin without the wine.\"\n\nShe blinked, once, twice, three times. Then she threw down the knife. \"Without the wine? That's like ordering a hamburger without the beef!\"\n\nThe sous-chef shrugged apologetically. \"I tried to explain, but they insist.\"\n\nHer hands began to shake, not with fear or uncertainty, but with that hot, liquid disappointment that threatened to spill over into tears. She felt the familiar sting behind her eyes, the tightness in her throat.\n\n\"Where's Tom?\" she demanded, voice barely above a whisper. \"He promised me this would be different.\"\n\nThe sous-chef pointed towards the door, where Tom stood, charming patrons with his signature smile and smooth talk. He hadn't even noticed the storm brewing in his partner's eyes.\n\nShe stormed out of the kitchen, leaving behind a trail of shocked silence. She grabbed Tom by the arm, pulling him away from his adoring fans. \"Where's my Coq au Vin without the wine?\" she hissed, her voice low and dangerous.\n\nTom looked at her, confusion etched into every line of his face. \"I told them we couldn't do that,\" he protested weakly.\n\n\"Then why are they still insisting on it?\" She felt the disappointment boiling over now, threatening to consume her entirely. \"You promised me tonight would be different.\"\n\nShe could see the moment Tom realized he'd let her down again. His shoulders slumped, and his eyes filled with regret. But it was too late for apologies. Too late for promises.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she spat, turning on her heel and stalking back into the kitchen. \"I'll take care of it myself.\"\n\nAnd so she did, cooking until the wee hours, pouring every ounce of her disappointment into the dish that wasn't even being served as intended. She cooked because that was all she knew how to do. And when she was done, she stood there, surrounded by the wreckage of another night gone wrong, and she let herself feel every last drop of her disappointment.\n\nBecause tomorrow was another day, another service, another chance for things to go right. But today, tonight, she would allow herself this moment of weakness. She would allow herself to feel.",

Like she couldn't tell the difference between real cooking and some watered-down imitation. She sniffed, wiping her nose on the back of her hand.\n\nTom had promised her tonight would be different. But it wasn't. It never was. And now here she was, up to her elbows in last night's leftovers, trying to salvage something from this wreckage. Again.\n\nShe tasted the sauce, letting its warmth fill her mouth before spitting it back into the pot. She'd added extra wine anyway, just to spite them. Let them choke on that. It wasn't like they could complain now.\n\nHer phone buzzed on the counter, Tom's name flashing across the screen. She ignored it, pushing it away with the heel of her hand.

And what did they care? They wanted their bland, tasteless dish. Fine. She'd give them bland and tasteless.\n\nBut not tonight. Tonight, she'd drink her wine, eat her Coq au Vin, and remember what real food tasted like. Because tomorrow was another day, another chance for things to go wrong.

Never mind that I've been here every night for years, rain or shine, watching life go on outside while I'm stuck in this godforsaken store. No, they won't understand that. They're too busy living their perfect little lives.\n\nAnd look at them, all smiles and giggles as they pay. The boy even has the audacity to wear a wedding ring. Whole generations ahead of me, with no clue what life's really about. I suppose they think this is how it'll always be - easy, carefree, invincible. Well, let me tell them something: life isn't some grand love story waiting to happen. It's a tragedy, played out in slow motion, and everyone's a supporting actor, destined for their own miserable ending.\n\nBut no, they wouldn't understand that. They're too busy living their fairytale. And here I am, the old bitter fool, watching it all slip away. Entire nights spent alone, entire lifetimes wasted on regrets. That's my reality now. Always has been, always will be."
