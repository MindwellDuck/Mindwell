She'd worn her favorite dress, the one he said made her look radiant, hoping it might lift his spirits. But now, the fabric clung to her, suddenly too tight, too cheap.\n\nMrs. Thompson raised an eyebrow at the dress, then glanced at the empty space on her left hand where a ring should've been. \"Still no news from him, huh?\" she asked, loud enough for the other customers to hear. She could feel their stares burning into her.\n\nHer face flushed hot, and she stumbled over the prices, fumbling with the scanner. \"He's... he's just busy,\" she muttered, willing herself not to cry. She'd told them all he was on a business trip, but who was she kidding? He wasn't coming back. Not this time.\n\nThe bag broke open as she handed it to Mrs. Thompson, cans rolling across the floor like tiny, mocking drums. Laughter echoed through the store, and she wanted to curl up and disappear. Instead, she knelt down, gathering the cans with shaking hands, her dress riding up her thighs.\n\nFuck him, she thought, as tears blurred her vision. Fuck him for leaving her like this. Alone, embarrassed, humiliated. She stood up, wiped her eyes on the back of her hand, and forced a smile. \"Next customer?\"",

I've been doing this job for decades, but today? Today feels like I'm back to square one. And the bag breaking open? Typical. Always something going wrong.\n\nHe didn't even have the decency to leave on a good note. No, he had to make me feel small, insignificant. 'Busy', my ass. He's probably off with some young thing, laughing about how pathetic I am. Alone, embarrassed, humiliated... yeah, that's me alright.\n\nBut you know what? Fuck him. And fuck this stupid dress too.

He could see it now, a pattern as clear as if it were printed in bold on the screen of his mind: Emily, incapable of sticking around when life threw them a curveball.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest, a scowl etched deep into his face. The newsroom buzzed around him, but he was deaf to everything except the echo of Emily's words and the pounding of his own blood in his ears. This was why he'd never wanted to settle down, wasn't it? People always let you down, especially when they claimed to care about you.\n\nHis gaze swept over the newsroom, taking in the young reporters laughing at their desks, the editors deep in conversation, the whole damn office going on like nothing had happened. It was typical, really. The world kept spinning while his heart was being torn out of his chest. He felt a surge of anger, hot and visceral, bubbling up inside him. Never again, he thought. Never again would he let himself believe in happy endings."

I grabbed a clean shirt, black as my mood, and pulled it on. It felt stiff, unwelcoming, much like the woman who'd worn it once upon a time.\n\n\"As if wearing your clothes would make me forget,\" I scoffed at her empty side of the closet. \"As if anything ever could.\"\n\nI grabbed my phone from the charger - hers still sitting there, untouched, mocking me with its silence. \"Where are you, Sarah?\" I spat at it, as if it held some answers. \"Off screwing someone else, no doubt.\" I slammed the door shut behind me, leaving our shared past locked inside.\n\nAs I stormed down the stairs, each step echoing my resentment, I passed our wedding photo.

The ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to echo each beat of her heart, as she awaited the arrival of her former colleague, Martha.\n\nMartha, a vibrant woman in her late fifties, had retired from their bustling retail store last year, with a pension that Harriet could only envy. She had seen Martha's departure party, a spectacle of laughter and tears, while hers would likely be a somber affair, punctuated by the clinking of discount coupons instead of champagne flutes.\n\nThe doorbell chimed, shattering the silence like a gunshot. Harriet rose, her knees creaking in protest, and made her way to the door. There stood Martha, radiant as ever, carrying a bouquet of fresh flowers and a bottle of wine, her eyes twinkling with contentment. Harriet led her guest to the living room, her heart pounding like a drum in her chest.\n\nMartha settled into the sofa, crossing her legs elegantly. \"Harriet, darling,\" she began, \"I've been so looking forward to catching up. I must say, retirement suits me wonderfully.\" She paused, looking around Harriet's apartment, her gaze lingering on the faded curtains and the worn-out carpet.\n\nHarriet felt a prickling sensation in her chest, like pins and needles. \"Yes, well,\" she managed to reply, her voice tight as a noose, \"I'm sure it does suit you, Martha. You always did have everything.\" She heard the bitterness seep into her words, like poison into water.\n\nMartha's smile wavered, but only for a moment. \"Oh, Harriet,\" she said softly, leaning forward to pat Harriet's hand, \"you'll get there too, in no time.\"\n\nHarriet felt a surge of emotion, hot and overwhelming, threatening to consume her. She wanted to scream, to rail against the injustice of it all. But she simply nodded, her eyes burning with unshed tears, as Martha began to regale her with tales of her latest cruise.\n\nThat night, as Harriet lay awake, staring at the ceiling, she couldn't shake off the feeling of envy that clutched at her heart like a vice. She longed for Martha's ease, her freedom, her happiness. But all Harriet could see was the endless stretch of days, filled with the same old routines, the same old loneliness.\n\nShe turned onto her side, her body aching with age and envy, and whispered into the darkness, \"Why not me?\"",

Even retirement.\" She clicked 'like' on Martha's post, then grumbled, \"I doubt she even had to wait in line at the DMV to renew her license.

I could feel it gnawing at me now, like a rat chewing through wires.\n\nMy phone rang, the shrill sound slicing through the newsroom din. I grabbed it, seeing an unfamiliar number. \"Jack speaking,\" I answered, my voice tight.\n\n\"Mr. Thompson?\" A woman's voice, timid but determined. \"This is Dr. Patel from County Hospital. We found your contact information in your wife's... in Mrs. Thompson's belongings.\"\n\nI felt a chill creep up my spine. Her things were still at the hospital? I'd thought they'd sent them all to me.\n\n\"We've been trying to reach you about her effects,\" she continued. \"There seems to be something important among them. We thought it best if you came and took a look yourself.\"\n\nI gripped the phone tighter, nails digging into my palm. Important? What could possibly be important now?\n\n\"Fine,\" I snapped, \"I'll be there.\" I hung up without waiting for her response.\n\nHarry looked at me, his bushy eyebrows raised. \"Trouble?\"\n\n\"No,\" I sighed, rubbing my temples. \"Just... just something I need to take care of.\"\n\nAs I gathered my things, the newsroom seemed to close in around me. The silence was deafening, and every shadow whispered her name. Despair settled heavier on my shoulders, like a shroud. What fresh hell awaited me at that hospital? But I had to know. I had to face it, whatever it was.\n\nAnd so, with a heavy heart and an even heavier sense of dread, I stepped out into the pouring rain, feeling more alone than ever.",

You've been at this for years, but lately, every case feels like a damn cold case waiting to happen.\n\n**Text:**\n\nThe clock on the wall ticked like it had a fucking grudge against time itself. Another goddamn night, another stack of files taller than my caffeine tolerance. I took a swig of cold coffee, grimacing at the taste. Christ, even this shit was bitter tonight.\n\nI flipped open the top file, a domestic disturbance from last week. Kid's cries echoed in my mind like they were happening right here, right now. Fucking hell, who was I kidding? There was no 'right' place for that kind of shit.\n\nI scanned the report, the victim's statement. \"He just snapped,\" she'd said. \"Like a fucking light switch.\" Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before. But there was nothing in this guy's history to suggest he was anything more than your average Joe till now. So why the sudden storm?\n\nI tossed the file aside, running a hand over my face. It came back sticky with sweat and grime. Great, just fucking great. Another sleepless night, another dead-end case. When did every goddamn street in this city become a one-way road to nowhere?\n\nI picked up the next file, then the next, each one feeling heavier than the last. A damn graveyard of broken lives and wasted chances. And me? I was just some old bastard stuck playing guardian at the fucking gates.\n\nAs if on cue, the rookie, fresh-faced and eager, popped his head in. \"Hey, Detective,\" he said, \"anything you need help with?\"\n\nI looked up at him, my glare as sharp as a blade. \"Yeah,\" I growled, \"you can start by telling me where all the fucking answers are hiding. And while you're at it, how about some goddamn sleep too?\""
