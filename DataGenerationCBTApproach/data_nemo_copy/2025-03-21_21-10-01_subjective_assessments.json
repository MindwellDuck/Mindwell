I, Victoria Hartley, have toiled day and night to uphold its reputation as one of the finest culinary institutions in the land. Yet, today, resentment simmered within me like an untended sauce, threatening to boil over.\n\nThe morning had begun like any other, with the familiar clatter of pots and pans echoing through the kitchen. However, as I prepared for my class, a certain someone sauntered in, late as usual - Jonathan Sterling, my former husband. He was now the new sous-chef, an appointment made by our mutual boss without so much as a consultation with me.\n\n\"Good morning, Victoria,\" he greeted me, his voice dripping with condescension, as if we were still the happy couple sharing breakfast at home. I merely nodded, my teeth clenched tight enough to grind flour into dough.\n\nAs the class progressed, Jonathan's presence became increasingly intrusive. He corrected students who were mine to teach, offered unsolicited advice on techniques I had perfected over years of practice, and even took credit for a recipe he knew full well was mine. Each infringement was like a knife twistingly slow in my heart.\n\nThe final straw came when Jonathan approached me during a demonstration, his hand resting too familiarly on my shoulder. \"You know, Vicky,\" he whispered, using the nickname he knew I hated, \"you've lost your touch since we split. Perhaps you should step aside and let me take over.\"\n\nA red haze descended upon me. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to strip off my apron, seize Jonathan by his collar, and march him out of the kitchen. But I didn't. Instead, I stood there, seething, as he smiled triumphantly, believing he had won.\n\nBut Jonathan Sterling has underestimated Victoria Hartley once too often. By God, I will not be usurped in my own domain. Tonight, after class, I shall sharpen my knives and prepare a dish so exquisite, so divine, that even he cannot help but taste defeat. And when he does, I shall serve him his comeuppance on a silver platter.",

Fuck off, Jonathan! This is my kitchen, my domain. And he had the nerve to whisper that bullshit about me losing my touch? I've got news for him - I'm still Victoria Hartley, motherfucker!\n\nHe thinks he can just waltz in here and take over? Not on my watch. He's gonna regret the day he set foot in this kitchen again. I'll show him what happens when you fuck with me.\n\nTonight, after class, I'm gonna prepare something so goddamn delicious it'll make his taste buds weep. And then, bam! I'll serve him his ass on a silver platter. He thinks he's got this in the bag? Ha! I've been cooking circles around him since day one. This is my kitchen, and he's gonna learn that the hard way.\""

Might not make dinner.\"\n\nHer fingers tapped nervously against the polished wood, each word echoing like a distant thunder in her mind. She'd been stood up before, not just for dinners, but for important conversations too. Like the one about their future, which she'd initiated weeks ago and was still awaiting an adequate response.\n\nAmelia's gaze drifted to the framed photo of them on her desk - young smiles, carefree laughter. She remembered that time, when they were equals, partners in every sense.

The familiar anxiety clawed at her throat, threatening to spill over into tears. She pushed it down, burying it under layers of professionalism and routine.\n\nBut tonight felt different. Heavy. Like a weight on her chest, pressing down, making it hard to breathe. She looked at the clock, then at her phone. No new messages. Just that one sentence, hanging there like an accusation.\n\nHer heart pounded in her ears as she imagined him, laughing with colleagues, oblivious to her anxiety. Or worse, deliberately ignoring it. Maybe he was tired of her clinginess, her need for reassurance. Maybe he just wanted some space, and she was crowding him out.\n\nShe shook her head, trying to dislodge the thoughts. But they were persistent, like weeds choking a garden. She knew she should trust him, but insecurity had its own logic, its own voice that grew louder with each passing minute.\n\nHer hands trembled as she picked up her phone, typing out a message before she could stop herself. \"I'll be here. When you're ready.\"\n\nShe hit send, then quickly turned off her phone, unable to bear the thought of waiting for a reply that might never come. She took another deep breath, steeling herself for another night alone with her doubts and fears. Another night proving just how insecure she really was.",
