She'd been at it for hours, her irritation growing like the yeast in her bread. The young sous-chef she'd hired, fresh from culinary school and full of ideas, had insisted they try a new recipe today. \"It's just a simple dinner service, not a bloody cooking competition,\" Martha muttered under her breath.\n\nShe could feel the familiar sting in her right shoulder, the one that had been giving her grief since her divorce five years ago. But she wouldn't slow down. She couldn't, not with this eager beaver breathing down her neck, suggesting they add foams and powders to their classic dishes.\n\nAs the sous-chef approached again, Martha snapped, \"If you suggest we 'deconstruct' the coq au vin one more time, I swear I'll stuff that immersion blender where the sun don't shine.\" The kitchen went silent for a moment before erupting in laughter. Even Martha couldn't help but crack a smile, her irritation momentarily forgotten. She guessed she'd have to find some other way to vent today. Maybe she'd take out her frustrations on those stubborn carrots next.",

Her once-steady hands trembled slightly as she turned the yellowed pages, each one a whisper of time passed. The name on the top read: Emily Thompson.\n\nMartha's stomach churned with a familiar acidity as she recalled that young woman, her face pale and frightened, sitting in her office all those years ago. She had been so confident then, so sure of her expertise. But she hadn't seen it, hadn't heard the silent scream hidden beneath Emily's soft-spoken words.\n\nThe regret was a physical thing, a weight on her chest that made each breath a struggle. It was always there, gnawing at her like a relentless beast, but today, it felt different. Today, it felt like failure. She had missed something critical in Emily's case, and the consequence was a life ruined, a family shattered.\n\nHer mind's eye flashed back to that fateful day when she received the call. Emily's husband, John, his voice ragged with grief and anger, \"She tried to take her life, Martha. Because of you. Because you missed it.\"\n\nMartha clutched at her chest, gasping for air as if she were drowning. The clock on the wall ticked mercilessly, each second a mocking reminder of her inadequacy. She felt a cold sweat bead along her spine, her heart pounding like a trapped animal's.\n\nShe reached for the phone, her fingers shaking as they dialed John's number from memory. It rang once, twice, three times before he picked up. His voice was still raw, still filled with pain. Martha opened her mouth to speak, but all that came out was a choked sob.\n\n\"Martha?\" John's voice was laced with confusion and concern now. \"Are you alright?\"\n\nBut Martha couldn't answer. She hung up the phone, her breath coming in short, painful gasps. The regret was consuming her, burning through her like wildfire. She had tried so hard to outrun it, to bury it under work, under distractions. But it was always there, waiting for its moment to strike.\n\nAnd now, here it was, clawing at her heart, reminding her that some mistakes were unforgivable, some regrets inescapable. Martha slumped forward, her forehead resting on the cool glass of the desk, as silent tears streamed down her cheeks. She was drowning in a sea of 'what-ifs' and 'if-onlys', and there was no lifeboat in sight.",

She leaned against the counter, arms crossed, staring out the window at the darkening sky.\n\n\"What if Emily had come to me sooner? Would I have caught it then?\" She shook her head, running a hand through her silver hair. \"No use playing 'if only,' Martha,\" she said aloud, her voice echoing in the empty house.\n\nShe moved on to dusting the living room, her fingers trailing over photo frames - memories of a life lived, not one lost. \"What if John had listened to me? Maybe he could've helped Emily sooner.\" She sighed, placing the frame back on the mantel.\n\nMartha paused by the bookshelf, her gaze falling on an old medical journal. \"What if I'd just... what if?\" she whispered, picking up the journal and flipping through its pages absentmindedly. \"Stupid 'what-ifs,'\" she muttered, slamming the book shut and tossing it onto the couch.\n\nShe glanced at her watch, then picked up her phone. She hesitated before dialing John's number again. It rang once, twice... three times.
