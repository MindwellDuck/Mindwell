His divorce papers lay creased and forgotten on the couch, a stark white reminder of failure.\n\nSuddenly, his phone buzzed. An email from Sarah, his ex-wife. Subject: \"Your Birthday Gift.\" Jake scoffed, rubbing his eyes raw. As if she gave a shit about his birthday tomorrow. He clicked open the email anyway.\n\nIt was a photo. A goddamn selfie of her and some douchebag with a smug smile, holding up a bottle of champagne. They were at his favorite restaurant, the one he'd taken her to on their anniversary last year. The caption read: \"Celebrating your special day in style! Wish you were here. Love, Sarah & Tom.\"\n\nJake's stomach twisted into a knot. He felt the hopelessness wash over him like a black tide, threatening to drown him. He wanted to scream, to smash something, anything.

It was a taunting reminder of what he'd lost, of how Sarah had moved on while he was still stuck here, in this grimy little studio, debugging someone else's mistakes.\n\nHe clicked to enlarge the image, his eyes scanning every pixel as if searching for some hidden meaning. Tom's smile seemed too wide, too smug. The bottle of champagne gleamed under the restaurant lights, a stark contrast to Jake's own empty beer cans scattered across the desk. And Sarah... she looked happy. Too happy.\n\n\"She always did love expensive restaurants,\" he grumbled, his voice barely audible over the pattering rain. He could almost hear her laughter echoing through the image, mocking him. \"Always thought money could solve everything.\"\n\nHis birthday was tomorrow. Forty years old, and what did he have to show for it? A stack of divorce papers gathering dust on the couch, a laptop filled with someone else's code, and an inbox that held more spam than anything else.\n\n\"Happy fucking birthday, Jake,\" he whispered, his eyes never leaving the photo. He could feel the anxiety building inside him, like a storm ready to break. But he wouldn't scream, wouldn't smash something. No, Jake would just keep sitting here, in the grimy fluorescent light, until the rain stopped and the sun came up again. Because that's what grown-ups did, wasn't it? They endured."

Tired of carrying this goddamn weight, tired of living with this constant reminder of her failure.

He had been battling with lines of code that seemed to mock him in their refusal to cooperate, each stubborn character a reminder of how much easier everything was when she was still here to guide him through these technical labyrinths.\n\nHis heart rate spiked as the monitor went black for a fraction of a second before stuttering back to life. It wasn't just his computer; it was her computer now too, filled with her digital presence that he couldn't bear to erase. He had grown so accustomed to its rhythmic hum, its quiet company in the empty house, that this sudden revolt felt like betrayal.\n\nPanic surged within him like a tsunami, drowning out rational thought. His breath came in short, sharp gasps as if his lungs were collapsing in on themselves. He could feel the familiar tightness in his chest, the cold sweat beading at his temples. It was happening again - that irrational fear that he was losing control, that everything around him was crumbling into chaos because she wasn't here to hold it all together.\n\nHis fingers hovered over the keyboard, trembling like leaves caught in a storm. He wanted to reach out, to scream at someone, anyone, but there was no one left except the ghost of his wife lingering in these empty rooms and this defiant machine. He felt trapped, isolated, adrift in an ocean of panic with nothing but cold, unyielding code for company.\n\nThe room spun around him as he struggled against the urge to flee, to run until his legs gave out beneath him. But where could he go? There was no escape from this relentless grief that had taken root within him, no sanctuary from the memories that haunted every corner of their shared life.\n\nWith a roar that echoed through the silent house, he slammed his fist onto the desk, sending papers flying like startled birds. The monitor wobbled but held firm, its cursed screen still mocking him with lines of code that now seemed like hieroglyphics from some ancient civilization designed to torment him forevermore.",

Now look at this mess - a testament to my ineptitude!\" He glared at the offending device, as if daring it to challenge his assessment.\n\nHis breath came in ragged gasps, each inhale laden with accusations against unseen forces. \"Why must everything fall apart without her? Why can't they see how much harder I try, how much more I struggle alone?\" His voice rose, nearing a shout, but there was no one to hear save the silent house and its haunted echoes.\n\nSuddenly, he froze mid-stride, eyes wide with realization. \"No,\" he whispered, shaking his head vehemently. \"No, it's not my fault.

No television chatter, no pots clanging in the kitchen.\n\n\"Emily?\" His voice echoed through the empty house. No response. He checked his watch - 19:23.

This wasn't the home-cooked meal he'd been hoping for after a long day patrolling the city's streets.\n\nHe pulled out his phone, scrolling through messages from colleagues discussing case details, jokes about the new recruits. Nothing from Emily. A pang of annoyance shot through him. He typed out a message, \"Where are you? Dinner's getting cold.\", hitting send with more force than necessary.\n\nHenry stood up, pacing around the kitchen. He opened the fridge, its light illuminating his stern face. He grabbed a beer, popping it open with a familiar hiss. He took a swig, the bitter liquid doing little to wash away the frustration building within him.\n\nAt 20:15, Emily walked through the door, her cheeks flushed and laughter still lingering on her lips from whatever gathering she'd attended without him. She barely glanced at Henry, tossing her keys onto the counter with a casualness that grated on his nerves.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, her voice light and carefree.\n\nHenry looked at her, then at the cold pizza on the table. He said nothing, merely raised an eyebrow in silent reproach. But Emily was already moving towards the stairs, leaving him alone once more with his cold dinner and even colder marriage.",

Was this too much to ask?\n\nHenry couldn't help but feel that Emily's actions were directed at him. This wasn't about some gathering or late meeting. It had to be about him - his expectations, his rules, his life. She was doing this on purpose, trying to push him away.\n\nHe took another sip of his beer, the bitterness mirroring his mood.
