He started seeing signs everywhere - the way his coffee cup was placed on the counter, the fact that her favorite chair was pushed back instead of tucked under the desk. It was all screaming at him, \"She's mad! She's leaving you!\"\n\nThen came the note, tucked beside his microscope like a little bomb waiting to explode.

The clock's ticking seems louder than usual, each second echoing like a countdown to some unseen explosion.\n\nSuddenly, the fire alarm blares, its shrill wail slicing through the air. My heart lurches, pounding against my ribs like it wants out. I drop the box in my hands, spilling socks and scarves across the concrete floor.\n\n\"Fire drill,\" I mutter to myself, trying to remember when we last had one. The panic rises in my chest, gripping me like a vice. It's just a drill, I tell myself, but my legs feel rooted, refusing to move towards the exit.\n\nThe alarm screams on, and I can't help but think of that time, years ago, when smoke poured into the store from next door. The flames licking at the walls, the heat scorching my face as we huddled in the back room, waiting for the firemen to arrive. My wife's hand clutching mine, her nails digging into my skin, fear etched deep into her lines.\n\nI shake my head, trying to dislodge the memory. But it clings, sending tendrils of panic snaking through me. I need to move, to get out, but my body won't cooperate. I'm stuck here, trapped in this tiny room with the alarm blaring and the ghosts of fires past howling along with it.\n\nFinally, after what feels like hours, the alarm stops. Silence crashes down around me, punctuated only by my ragged breathing. I slump against the wall, sliding down until I'm sitting on the cold floor amidst the scattered clothes. My heart's still racing, but at least I can breathe again.\n\n\"Just a drill,\" I whisper to myself, over and over like a mantra. But it doesn't feel like just anything. It feels like a warning, a reminder that danger can strike at any moment, that panic is always lurking, ready to pounce when I least expect it. And that terrifies me more than any fire ever could.",

Today was no different, except that it felt more like an irritating buzz than its usual comforting lullaby. He glanced over at her, still snoring gently, cocooned in warmth while he shivered under their shared comforter.\n\nHe remembered when she'd bought the blanket, just after they moved into this house. He'd thought it was a silly indulgence, but Martha had insisted it would be worth it for those chilly winter mornings. And it was\u2014at first. Now, it felt more like a symbol of their marriage: her taking, taking, always taking.\n\nAlbert swung his legs out of bed, the cold floorboards sending a jolt through him. He could hear Martha's CPAP machine whirring in the corner, another thing that had invaded their once peaceful bedroom. He shuffled to the kitchen, the familiar creak of the old floorboards echoing his mood.\n\nHe started the kettle for his tea, then opened the fridge to find nothing but Martha's yogurt and low-fat milk. No bacon, no bread\u2014not even a stray egg. She'd been on another one of her health kicks again, leaving him with no choice but to eat her damn quinoa salad for breakfast.\n\nAs he waited for the kettle to boil, Albert heard the faint rustling of Martha's book club newsletter slipping from its place between the fridge and the counter. He picked it up, scanning the list of this month's selections. All romance novels, of course. She'd been pushing him to join the club, but he'd refused. What would they think if he showed up without his wife? Besides, why would he want to read about love when his own seemed to be dwindling away?\n\nAlbert poured his tea, the once comforting ritual now feeling like a chore. He sat down at the table, alone as always. Martha had been working late every night this week\u2014\"busy season,\" she called it. But Albert suspected there was more to it. She'd started taking her lunch breaks with that young man from accounting, laughing too loudly over their sandwiches.\n\nThe resentment bubbled up in him like the kettle's steam. He tried to push it down, but it was no use. It was always there now, simmering just beneath the surface. And as he sat there, sipping his tea and feeling the cold seep into his bones, Albert realized that this wasn't just about the electric blanket or the quinoa salad or even Martha's late nights. It was about something deeper, something darker. Something that had been growing inside him for years.",

This wasn't about the electric blanket or her stupid book club anymore\u2014it was about her disregard for him, for their marriage.\n\nHe stormed back upstairs, the cold floorboards no longer bothering him as his blood boiled. He yanked open the closet door, Martha's side filled with new clothes she'd bought on her latest shopping spree. \"She acts like we're still rolling in money,\" he muttered, grabbing a hanger and throwing it onto the floor. \"Like I don't bust my ass every day at that godforsaken job.\"\n\nHis eyes landed on her CPAP machine, sitting there like an accusation. Another thing invading their space, another sign of her needs coming before his. He felt a surge of jealousy, ridiculous as it was. Why did she get to sleep so peacefully while he was left awake, stewing in his own resentment?\n\nAlbert picked up the nearest book from Martha's nightstand\u2014a romance novel, of course\u2014and threw it across the room. It hit the wall with a satisfying thud, leaving a dent in the plaster. He stood there, chest heaving, as he surveyed the damage. This was what she'd driven him to. This was what his love had become. And it was all her fault.\n\nAs he stood there, surrounded by the wreckage of his anger, Albert felt justified. His emotions were real, tangible things, not to be questioned or examined too closely. They were his truth, and they demanded action. He would talk to Martha today, make her see the error of her ways. He wouldn't\u2014no, he couldn't\u2014let this go on any longer. Not when it felt so wrong, so real."
