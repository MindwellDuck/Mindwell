This was supposed to be my year, my breakthrough. But now, it's just another dead end, another wasted year. Either I'm a genius who deserves a Nobel Prize, or I'm a failure who can't even get her shit published.\n\nMy lab notebooks, filled with meticulous notes and theories, mocked me from the corner of my desk.

It's all or nothing.\n\nI slumped back in my chair, staring at the ceiling. \"Fuck it,\" I muttered, \"Either I'm onto something groundbreaking, or I'm just another crackpot scientist with a drawer full of rejection letters.\""
