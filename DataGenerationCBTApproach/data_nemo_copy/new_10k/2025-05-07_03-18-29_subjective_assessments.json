His editor never understood, couldn't understand, how each obituary was a reminder of his own loss, his own unfinished story.

You've been estranged from your brother for years, ever since he sided with your mother when she disapproved of your lifestyle choices. One day, a letter addressed to you arrives, unopened and weathered on the kitchen counter. The postmark reads your late mother's birthday.\n\n**Text:**\n\nBloody hell, what's this doing here? A letter from him, after all these years? I've not seen his scrawl since... well, since she was still with us. Mother's Day indeed! Typical of him to rub salt in the wound. I can feel it already, that familiar knot tightening in my chest. Must be my body telling me something, right? It's not like I'm making this up.\n\nThe envelope lies there, mocking me, daring me to open it. But why should I? He didn't bother when she was alive. Why start now? My gut's churning, and it knows what it's talking about. Emotions don't lie, do they? They're the truth in all this mess.\n\nI should just toss it out, let it join the decaying leaves in the yard. It'd be justice, wouldn't it? An eye for an eye. My heart pounds at the thought, like a drumbeat urging me on. See, even my body agrees! This is right, isn't it? I mean, if it feels this way, it must be true.\n\nBut wait... no, that's silly. It's just a letter, not some grand gesture. He probably doesn't even remember her birthday anymore. My mind's playing tricks on me, making mountains out of molehills. But then again, emotions don't lie, do they?"

She could almost see the headlines now: \"Economic Downturn Claims More Victims.\" And there they'd be, right in the thick of it, unless she did something about it. Unless she worked harder.\n\nShe couldn't bear the thought of them losing their home, of little Emily having to change schools again, of John's spirits sinking even lower than they already were. It was unbearable. Absolutely intolerable. She wouldn't let it happen. No, she simply couldn't stand it if things went south like that.\n\nSo, she'd work.
