It was as if the corners of my mouth had a mind of their own, betraying the polite smile I'd plastered on.\n\n'How lovely for you,' I heard myself say, my voice barely concealing the edge that had crept in. I mean, who could possibly enjoy such frivolities when there's lesson planning to be done and tests to grade? I certainly wouldn't have time for such nonsense, even if someone were foolish enough to invite me.\n\nI suppose it's just as well they didn't think of me. I've no doubt I'd have declined anyway; a weekend spent lounging around with colleagues hardly seems like a productive use of one's time. Besides, who needs rest when there are always more lessons to plan and papers to mark? It's not as if anyone could truly appreciate the effort that goes into my work, so why bother taking a break?\n\nI do hope Mrs. Thompson enjoys her little jaunt, though. Not that I'm envious or anything. It's just... well, it's not like she'll have any new insights to share when we return to school on Monday. There's no need for me to feel left out, really.\""
