She'd been a police officer for decades, but this morning's call still haunted her - the young man who'd taken his own life, barely more than a boy. Her partner had tried to talk to her on the ride back, but she'd shut him down, retreating into silence. Now, as she sat alone, the familiar weight of remorse pressed heavy on her chest. The untouched breakfast was a stark reminder of the family waiting downstairs, unaware that their mother's job had claimed another victim, this time not with a badge, but with a rope.",

Their eyes met in the photograph, hers sparkling with laughter and joy. A lump formed in his throat as he remembered that moment, now marred by the harsh reality of their current circumstances.\n\nTheir child's first birthday was approaching, another milestone they would navigate alone. He felt a pang of guilt, wondering if he should still celebrate without her. After all, it wasn't truly a celebration without both parents present. He carefully tucked the photo away, burying it once more behind the textbook, unseen and unnoticed.\n\nAs he went about his day, he found solace in the mundane tasks that filled his time. The house felt emptier than usual, but he pushed on, telling himself that such memories were best left untouched. He didn't need reminders of happier times; they only served to make his present feel more bleak. Besides, it wasn't as if their life together had been perfect. He preferred to focus on the reality of things, not some rose-tinted version of the past."
