Still, no reaction from him. * Typical*, I mused, feeling the familiar resentment bubble up within me like lava in a volcano. *Always engrossed in his little world, isn't he?*\n\nI'd spent all day listening to some customer drone on about their trivial problems, then had to endure the stifling heat of the commute home. And what did I get for my troubles? A silent house and a partner who couldn't even be bothered to look up from his screen.\n\n*And there he is*, I thought, spotting him on the couch, feet propped up like he owned the place. His laptop glowed ominously, casting harsh shadows across his face. *Wine untouched*, I noticed with a sneer. *As if he's too busy to even pour himself a glass*.\n\nI sighed dramatically, flopping onto the armchair and crossing my arms. *Well, isn't this just peachy*? Here I was, ready to share my day, my life, and all he could do was ignore me. * Typical*. Some days, it felt like we were ships passing in the night. Today was one of those days.\n\nBut then again, maybe it's not so bad, I reasoned with myself. *At least he's home*, I thought, trying to find a silver lining. *That's something*, right? * Though why that should make me feel any better was beyond me."
