His gaze drifted to his own worn-out shoes, the uniform he'd been wearing for years. When she stood up to leave, he saw the discreet 'L' engraved on her ring. A lifelong learner, she had once told him, not a wife or lover. Yet, envy gnawed at him nonetheless, as it always did when he saw her living the life he'd once envisioned for himself.",
