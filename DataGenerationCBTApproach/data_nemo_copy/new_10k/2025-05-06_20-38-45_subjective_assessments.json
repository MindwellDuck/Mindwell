The nerve of my body clock to wake me up at this ungodly hour, as if on cue to remind me of my impending doom. This deadline should have been met days ago, not hours. And where are my colleagues now? Probably tucked snug in their beds, enjoying a peaceful slumber while I'm over here playing cat-and-mouse with the dawn's early light.\n\nThis empty document is nothing short of a mockery of my professionalism. It's as if it's daring me to fill it, laughing at my lack of foresight. And don't even get me started on the editor. He shouldn't be breathing down my neck like this, expecting miracles just because he can't manage his own time effectively.\n\nMy stomach churns like a washing machine set on spin cycle. Anxiety is an unwelcome guest, making itself comfortable in my throat, whispering lies about impending failure. But I won't have it. This isn't how things should be happening. I've got this under control. I just need to buckle down and make this happen. It's not like the world will end if I don't meet this deadline... or so they say."

He remembered her laughter when they first met, how she'd encouraged his art even when he struggled.

A pang of guilt stabbed at him, sharp and poignant, as he realized he'd missed her birthday last month.

He saw himself drowning in an ocean of regret, unable to bear the weight of his negligence. The photograph seemed to mock him now, its cheerful image at odds with the impending doom he felt certain was approaching.
