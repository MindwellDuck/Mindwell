His partner, Martha, had texted him twice already, asking if he'd be home for dinner. He hadn't replied. Another error message flashed on his screen, and Bob felt a familiar frustration building in his chest. It wasn't the first time this week that work had kept him late, and he knew Martha would understand, but tonight, he just wanted to go home. The thought of another microwaved meal alone while she waited made his temples throb. He took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing sense of guilt as he reached for his phone to call it a night.",

She moved on to the microwave, checking the door seal, the buttons, the glass turntable. Each item passed under her inspection felt like a personal slight, an accusation of failure.
