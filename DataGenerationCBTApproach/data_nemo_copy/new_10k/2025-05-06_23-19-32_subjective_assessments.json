It's just rubbing salt in the wound, isn't it? The ink on that damned invitation is barely dry, but already it feels heavier than all my years combined. How could they be so thoughtless? So insensitive? It's not like there aren't enough reminders of my failed marriage around here. I swear, if one more thing goes wrong today, I might just lose what's left of my mind.\""

After years of teaching, I am accustomed to certain standards, but today I found myself in a situation that was quite frankly, unacceptable.\n\nThe markers, those supposedly indelible instruments of learning, were nothing short of useless. Not one, not even a solitary, decent marker functioned as intended. They were dry, lifeless, much like this school has become without my beloved students filling its halls.\n\nI am not one to place blame lightly, but I must ask, where was your diligence in ensuring these tools of our trade were maintained? It is your responsibility, after all, to keep such matters in order. How am I supposed to inspire young minds when I cannot even trust the markers to do their job?\n\nThis is not a trivial matter, Mr. Thompson. It reflects on the entire institution, on the very image of what we stand for as educators. I expect better. I deserve better. Our students deserve better.\n\nI await your prompt attention to this issue. Do not let me down again.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\""
