She'd always say, \"Morning, love!\" when she poured mine. Now it's just me and this fuckin' silence. I can't help but think, what if I'd woken up earlier that day? What if I'd told her to stay home, just one more fuckin' time?\n\nNow here I am, standing in our kitchen, asking myself 'what if?' like a damn broken record.
