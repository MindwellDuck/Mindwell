Her side of the bed was still warm, but fuck, it was empty. She must've dozed off on the couch again, waiting for me.\n\nI sighed, feeling that familiar hollow ache in my chest. It was always like this now - late nights, lonely beds. I couldn't remember the last time we'd shared a meal, let alone a laugh. The house felt like a fucking museum, silent and cold except for the goddamn ticking of that clock.\n\nI stripped off my clothes, leaving them in a heap on the floor.
