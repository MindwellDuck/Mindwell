The halls echoed with silence now that the students were gone, each one having left a little piece of chaos behind but none of it was enough to mask the emptiness she felt inside. As she checked off another paper, she noticed a small note tucked into her desk drawer - \"Miss, you forgot your lunch again today.\" A familiar pang of unhappiness stirred within her as she realized she'd once again lost track of time, consumed by work and the hollow silence that awaited her at home.",

It's always like this when they're gone, my students. The classroom, once filled with their chatter and laughter, now lies silent and empty. Each day feels heavier than the last, as if the weight of their absence is crushing down on me.\n\nI pick up another assignment to grade, but my mind wanders. It's always the same thought that plagues me: *I'm never going to get through all these.* The pile seems endless, growing taller with each passing day. I feel a familiar anxiety knot in my stomach as I realize, once again, that I'll be here until long after the janitor has finished his rounds.\n\nA small note catches my eye, tucked into my desk drawer. \"Miss, you forgot your lunch again today.\" It's not the first time they've noticed my absent-mindedness. In fact, it seems like *every* day, I leave something behind - my coat, my scarf, my lunch. It's as if I'm losing pieces of myself in these empty halls.\n\nThe emptiness follows me home too. The house echoes with silence, much like the classroom does after they've all gone. Each night feels like a choreographed dance of loneliness, a symphony of quiet desperation that never ends. *I'll always be alone*, I think to myself as I sink into my favorite armchair, another graded paper tucked under my arm. Always."
