As if she could understand what I was going through. Please, like she's ever had anything but perfect relationships.\n\nI snapped on my gloves, trying to ignore the buzz of whispers behind me. They were probably talking about me, comparing me to her. Again. \"Dr. Thompson handled that patient so smoothly,\" they'd say. \"She never would've let something like this throw her off.\"\n\nWell, I wasn't Dr. Thompson. I couldn't just switch off my emotions like she did. I was human, damn it! But why did it feel like everyone else saw me as some inferior version of her? It wasn't fair.\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself for the procedure. This wasn't about me or my stupid love life. It was about the patient on that table, counting on me to save them.
