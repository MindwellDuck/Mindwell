It was either them, happy as clams, or me, standing here like a loner. No room for anything in between. Their joy was a blinding light, mine was this dark, heavy cloud that hung over my head. Either they were enjoying themselves at my expense, or I was just being too sensitive. There was no middle ground where we could all just coexist without this annoying tension. I turned away, leaving them to their 'hilarity'. It was either ignore it or make a scene, and I wasn't ready for the latter yet.\""

His eyes were drawn to the chipped paint on their once-shared bookshelf, a stark reminder of her negligence. He took a sip, the burn doing little to dilute his resentment. Her laughter, now distorted in his mind, echoed louder than the city lights beyond the window. She had left him alone again, another night wasted while she pursued her own pleasures. His reflection seemed to sneer back at him from the glass, amplifying his anger. He couldn't see past the chipped paint, the echoing laughter, or the empty rooms. Everything was a sign of her abandonment, everything pointed to her fault. His perspective narrowed, honed in on these details, oblivious to the broader picture of their relationship."

He could almost hear her voice echoing from the past, whispering words she'd written long before their lives had taken this turn.\n\nHe unfolded the note carefully, as if expecting it to crumble at his touch. His eyes scanned the lines, each word a punch to his gut. She'd written about their plans for that weekend, about how they were going to plant flowers in the garden together, about how much she loved him. The past tense stung like salt on an open wound.\n\n\"She must have known,\" he thought, his mind racing. \"She must have known what was coming.\" It was as if her ghost had reached out from beyond the grave to warn him, to prepare him for the emptiness that now filled their home.\n\nHe folded the note back up, tucking it into his pocket like a secret. He didn't need anyone else knowing about this, didn't need them intruding on something so personal. They wouldn't understand, couldn't possibly comprehend what it was like to have your wife's words haunt you like this.\n\nAs he walked home, the note burning a hole in his pocket, he felt a strange sense of comfort. At least now he knew she'd been thinking about him, even at the end. Even when everything else had seemed so uncertain, her love had been steadfast. He didn't need to hear it from anyone else; he just knew.\n\nIt was enough to keep him going, one foot in front of the other, through the empty halls of their once-filled home."
