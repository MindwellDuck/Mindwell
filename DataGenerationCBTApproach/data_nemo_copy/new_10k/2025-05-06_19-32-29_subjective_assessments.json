Every paper, once neatly stacked and organized by him yesterday, was now scattered haphazardly, as if a small whirlwind had blown through his lab.\n\nHe could still hear Emily's sigh echoing in his mind from their phone call last night. It was subtle, almost imperceptible to anyone else, but Alexander caught it. It was a sigh that spoke volumes about the state of their home office, or rather, *his* office. He felt a surge of irritation rise within him.\n\n\"As if there wasn't enough to do today,\" he grumbled, picking up the mess with exaggerated care, as though each sheet of paper was a tiny, delicate artifact that could shatter at any moment. \"And why did she feel the need to come in here without asking? It's not like I don't have enough to worry about.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a small, bitter smile playing on his lips. \"I suppose it's just one more thing to add to my ever-growing list of concerns. But then again, what else is new?\""

I wrapped my fingers around it, letting the heat seep into my skin. It felt like a small connection to him, a silent 'he'll be here soon'. I took a sip, making a face at the now lukewarm bitterness.\n\nI sat on the couch, watching the door, willing it to open. Either he'd been held up, or... No, don't think about that. He's just late. It happens.\n\nI pulled out my phone, no messages, no missed calls. I hesitated before dialing his number. It rang, and rang, then went to voicemail. My stomach churned. Either something was wrong, or he'd forgotten his phone again. I couldn't decide which was worse.\n\nI turned on the TV, flicking through channels mechanically. I tried to focus on the bright colors, the loud noises, but my mind kept pulling me back to that empty chair at the table, that cold bed. It was either this - him not coming home - or everything being fine. There was no in-between.\n\nI waited, gripping his mug tightly. Either he'd walk through that door any minute now, or... Or what? I didn't want to think about 'or'. Not tonight."
