Her eyes dart between the clock and her phone, where an unread message from dispatch flickers like a warning light. The silence presses against her ears, amplifying every creak of settling wood and hum of distant traffic. Her heart races as she imagines what emergency awaits her at shift's start, each scenario more gruesome than the last. She struggles to breathe deeply, but her chest feels constricted, like she's wearing body armor even off-duty.",

Her hands tightened around her glass, the wine inside trembling. It was his lack of appreciation that caused this scene, not hers. She felt the heat rise to her cheeks, but it wasn't embarrassment; it was anger. How dare he judge her work so harshly? If only he had an ounce of her husband's talent, perhaps he'd understand.*\n\n*She looked around at the other attendees. They were all whispering now, their eyes flickering between her and her paintings. She blamed them too. Their silence was complicity, their stares, accusations. They should have stood up for her, shown some respect. But no, they just stood there, letting that man's words define them too.*\n\n*She took a deep breath, steeling herself. This was not her fault. She had poured her heart into these paintings. If anyone should be ashamed, it was him, for his lack of vision. And those whispering onlookers, well, they were just as guilty.*"

It was as if all those laughs, all that warmth, had been sucked out of me, leaving behind an empty void. The photograph felt like a cruel joke, a reminder of what once was but would never be again. I couldn't help but think, \"How could something so full of life now feel so hollow?\" It was as if the happiness in that picture was mocking my current reality, making me feel even more miserable.
