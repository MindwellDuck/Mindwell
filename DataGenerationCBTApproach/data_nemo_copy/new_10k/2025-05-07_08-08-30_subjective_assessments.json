There ain't no middle ground with Martha, never has been. It's always black or white with that one."

You remember old times well enough, but seeing John there, married, successful, and laughing it up with everyone - it was as if he'd stolen the spotlight from every other attendee.\n\nI couldn't help but notice how his children hung onto his every word, their eyes sparkling with admiration. Meanwhile, I sat there, sipping my drink, clinking glasses with no one but myself for company. It was almost like John had intentionally rubbed his happiness in my face, as if he knew it would make me feel small and insignificant.\n\nI mean, who does that? Who flaunts their perfect little family around while everyone else is left to wallow in their own mediocrity?\n\nI tried to engage in conversation with others, but my mind kept drifting back to John. His laughter grated on me like fingernails on a chalkboard. I couldn't help but feel that if he hadn't been so attention-seeking, maybe I wouldn't have felt so...left behind.\n\nBut enough about him. How are you doing? I hope the reunion wasn't too painful for you. It's always tough seeing how everyone else has moved on without us, isn't it?\n\nLooking forward to catching up soon,\n\n[Your Name]"
