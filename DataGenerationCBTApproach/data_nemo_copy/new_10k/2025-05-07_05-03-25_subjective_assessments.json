As she reached for the phone to call her younger colleague for help, she noticed an email from him, cc'ing their boss, suggesting that \"maybe it's time for someone with fresher eyes to take over this project.\" Her grip tightened on the receiver, knuckles turning white as anger surged through her like a hot current.",

Every color seemed pale in comparison to theirs, every line felt clumsy and amateurish. I caught sight of John's canvas \u2013 bold, confident strokes that seemed to dance across the surface. Mine, by contrast, looked labored and dull.\n\nI found myself constantly stealing glances at their progress, each one a stark reminder of how far behind I was. Their enthusiasm seemed to echo around me, magnifying my own creative drought. I sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from my forehead, and tried once more to coax something \u2013 anything \u2013 out of the paint.\n\nBut it was no use. The harder I tried to ignore the comparisons swirling in my mind, the more they seemed to consume me.
