She hangs up her white coat, the silence heavy and unfamiliar after the constant hum of the ward. In the dim light, she notices a framed photo of her and her best friend, Emily, taken on their last trip together before Emily moved away for work. Tears well in her eyes as she remembers the laughter they shared, now replaced by long distance calls that don't quite fill the void. She picks up the photo, tracing Emily's face with her fingertip, feeling a pang of sadness at the empty space beside her friend's smile.",

My apartment yawned back at me, empty as ever after another marathon shift. I tossed my coat onto the rack, the silence so thick it was almost mocking. Then, my eyes landed on that damn photo.\n\nEmily's smile, wide and carefree, stared back at me from our trip to Paris. God, we'd laughed until our sides ached that day. Now, her laughter was reduced to tinny echoes over crappy phone calls. I picked up the frame, tracing her face with my fingertip. Her eyes seemed brighter somehow, maybe because mine were blurry with unshed tears.\n\n\"She looks so... alive,\" I whispered, ignoring the rest of the photo\u2014the cheesy Eiffel Tower backdrop, my own grinning mug beside hers. It was just Emily and me now, frozen in time. I set the frame down gently, like it might shatter if I wasn't careful. \"Just you and me, Em,\" I sighed, feeling that familiar pang of sadness. Anything else? Nah, who needs context when you've got a heartache to wallow in?\""
