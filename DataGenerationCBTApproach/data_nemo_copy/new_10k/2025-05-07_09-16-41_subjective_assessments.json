He didn't even have the decency to wear gloves.\n\n**Response:**\n\nMy heart pounded as I watched him splash colors onto my canvas. His strokes were bold, confident - nothing like my timid dabs. I could feel the familiar anxiety rising in me, a wave of inadequacy threatening to consume. His hands moved with an ease I'd never known, even after years of practice. It was unfair, really. Here he was, just starting out, already better than me.\n\nI saw how his lines flowed, each one a testament to some innate talent I'd never possess. My own hands felt clumsy in comparison, trembling slightly as I tried to follow along. Why couldn't I be like that? Natural, fearless?\n\nEach stroke he made seemed to echo my failures - the classes I'd struggled through, the paintings I'd hidden away because they weren't good enough. He didn't know how lucky he was, not having to fight with every brushstroke.\n\nI found myself losing track of his painting, too consumed by the gnawing comparison. It felt like watching someone else live my dreams, except they were doing it better than I ever could. The unfairness of it all made my stomach twist into knots. Why did he get this talent when I had to work so hard for every ounce of mine?"

A soft breeze blew in through the open window, rustling the dried flowers pressed between the pages of a book on her desk - a gift from her late mother.\n\nShe picked up the book, running her fingers along its worn spine. Flipping it open, she noticed a small, yellowed envelope tucked inside, sealed with faded wax. Her name was written in her mother's familiar script. She took a deep breath, feeling a familiar melancholy wash over her as she carefully opened it.\n\nInside was a letter, dated twenty years ago on her birthday. It began, \"My dearest daughter...\" The ink was smudged, as if her mother had cried while writing it. As she read the words of love and pride, she felt a lump form in her throat. She missed her mother's presence more than ever, the studio echoing with silence instead of her laughter.\n\nThe breeze picked up again, this time carrying a few raindrops that splattered onto the canvas, blurring the paint. She watched as the rain began to fall harder, washing away the colors, just like time had washed away her mother's touch. A single tear joined the raindrops on her cheek as she closed the letter, tucking it safely back into the book.\n\nShe turned off the light and left the studio, closing the door behind her, leaving the rain to finish what it had started with the canvas - a melancholy dance of nature and loss.",
