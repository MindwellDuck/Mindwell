She sees him smile fondly at an image of himself with his old colleague, Lisa - the one who always made him laugh, who shared his passion for food and life before they had children, before life became simpler but quieter. His eyes linger on Lisa's face a little too long, stirring something bitter in his wife's chest. She feels her cheeks flush, her grip tighten around the kitchen counter as she watches him from afar, jealousy simmering like an untended pot.",

Maybe if I were more like Lisa... No, no, I can't think that way. But why does he still have that photo album? It's been years since they worked together. He could've thrown it away by now. But no, he keeps it here, right under our noses.

Or so I used to be. Now, I'm just 'The Chef Who Can't Concentrate,' apparently. I slammed the plate down onto the pass, earning a raised eyebrow from my sous-chef. \"Sorry,\" I grumbled, \"just... family stuff.\" She nodded sympathetically, but I could see it in her eyes too - 'Here comes another 'disaster' dish from our lovelorn leader.' I sighed internally, 'Disaster Chef' seemed to be adding itself to my ever-growing list of labels."

The room was silent save for the faint ticking of the old clock above the door - a wedding gift from her parents. It felt like an eternity since he'd heard her laughter echoing off these walls.\n\nHis hands, calloused from years behind the flame, fumbled with the familiar silver band around his finger. He hadn't noticed when it had begun to feel loose, but tonight, as he twirled it absentmindedly, it slipped off entirely and clattered onto the countertop. The sound was deafening in the silence.\n\nHe picked up the ring, turning it over in his hands. Its once-shiny surface was dull now, like everything else in his life. The inscription on the inside read \"Together forever\". He'd had it engraved to match her own, but hers lay buried beneath a cold stone miles away.\n\nThe fridge hummed softly, its light flickering on and off intermittently since she'd left him with it all those months ago. It was just another thing he hadn't bothered fixing. Why bother? Nothing mattered anymore without her.\n\nHe placed the ring back on his finger, pushing it down until it reached the knuckle. Then he turned to face the one photo they had left displayed - a framed picture of them laughing together at some long-forgotten picnic. Her smile was radiant, her eyes sparkling with life. He remembered that day vividly; it seemed like another lifetime now.\n\nTonight was supposed to be their anniversary. They'd planned it years ago, marking the date on the calendar with a red heart. But she wasn't here to celebrate. She wasn't anywhere.\n\nDespair weighed heavy in his chest as he looked around at the remnants of their life together - empty wine bottles gathering dust, half-read books left open on tables, her favorite cooking apron still hanging by the stove. Each item was another nail in the coffin of their once-happy marriage, another reminder that she was gone forever.\n\nHe reached for his phone, scrolling through old messages until he found one from her: \"I'm so proud of you darling! Your food makes people happy \u2764\ufe0f\" It had been sent on this day last year. His thumb hovered over the keypad before he could stop himself, typing out a message meant for no one but himself:\n\n\"I miss you so much tonight feels like my heart has stopped beating too.\"",
