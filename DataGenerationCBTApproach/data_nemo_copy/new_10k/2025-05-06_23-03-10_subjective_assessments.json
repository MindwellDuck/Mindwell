Do you have any idea how hard it is to get that kind of stain out? It's not like I can just throw some bleach on it and call it a day. This is going to take hours, maybe even days to clean up properly.\n\nAnd the kid? He just sat there, acting like nothing was wrong. Like he didn't fucking know his rotting lunch bag had turned my classroom into a fucking morgue. I wanted to yell at him, but I held back because, you know, \"appropriate behavior\" and all that shit.\n\nI've been trying to keep this place clean and respectable, and now it's ruined. All because some kid couldn't be bothered to throw out his old lunch. And don't even get me started on the health hazard aspect of it all.

Your assumption that your child's absence from the cast is an injustice is misplaced. The auditions were open to all students, with clear instructions disseminated weeks prior. An impartial panel made selections based on merit alone. Your child's exclusion does not signify any malice or favoritism, merely a reflection of their performance against others'. To suggest otherwise is unfounded and unbecoming of our usual cordiality.\n\n*Let me remind you,* Mrs. Johnson, that my classroom has seen many successful plays, each one a testament to the effort and talent of its participants. Your child's absence from this particular production does not diminish their worth or potential. It is but one instance in a career of opportunities yet to come.\n\n*I expect better discretion* from you in future interactions regarding such matters. After all, we are here to foster growth and learning for all students, not just those who receive our explicit approval. I trust that you will reconsider your perspective and approach these issues with the fairness they deserve."
