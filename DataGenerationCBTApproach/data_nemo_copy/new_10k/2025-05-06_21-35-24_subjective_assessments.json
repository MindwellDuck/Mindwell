It was supposed to be me and him, side by side until the end, not this... this... lonely mess.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that fucking smile of his. He was supposed to save that one for me, not whoever's warming his bed these days. God, I hate how much it still stings. We were supposed to be partners, in business and life. But now?
