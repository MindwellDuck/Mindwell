Evelyn. The bristles, still faintly blue, seemed to hold remnants of her spirit, her artistry. A soft sigh escaped me, a familiar ache resonating in my chest.\n\nI traced the letters on the paint tube, now faded but once bold: \"Evelyn's Sky.\" How many times had she held this very brush, her fingers stained as blue as her eyes? The memory was bittersweet, like the first sip of coffee on a cold morning. I could almost hear her laughter echoing in the studio, see her dancing with the paintbrush like a conductor with her baton.\n\nBut the studio seemed quieter now, the colors less vibrant. Her absence was a weight, a heavy silence that no amount of remembering could fill. The paintbrush, once a symbol of our shared passion, now felt like a reminder of what I'd lost. I couldn't help but think, *How could something so small hold so much sadness?* I placed it back where I found it, under the soft glow of the studio window, a silent sentinel to her memory.\n\nYet, amidst the melancholy, there was a spark of joy too. A whisper of her presence, like the first rays of sunlight breaking through clouds. But I pushed that thought away, as if allowing it to grow would diminish the pain I held so closely. After all, it's easier to hold onto sorrow than to let go and risk forgetting, isn't it?"

He probably sees this every time he thinks of me, and hates me for it.\"\n\nShe traced the faded words on the cover, her fingers trembling slightly. \"I never meant to hurt him,\" she murmured, as if the book could somehow convey her apology to him.
