His wife had left for her book club hours ago, leaving behind a faint scent of her perfume and the echo of her laughter. He poured himself a finger of whiskey, the amber liquid catching the dim lamplight as he swirled it gently in his glass. As he took a sip, he noticed a small photograph tucked into the corner of the bookshelf, one they'd taken on their honeymoon all those years ago. Their smiles were wide, eyes bright with love and promise. A wave of melancholy washed over him as he realized how much time had passed since that moment, and how much more still felt unfulfilled. He took another sip, the whiskey burning his throat, mirroring the ache in his heart.",

Stuck in this damn house, stuck in time.\"\n\nHe looked at the photograph, their younger selves laughing under a foreign sun. \"We used to talk about going back, making new memories there. But now... now I can't even remember what her voice sounds like.\"\n\nHis eyes flicked around the room, landing on her favorite chair, still draped in her blanket. He felt the familiar tug of sadness, a heavy weight in his chest. \"Guess that's why they call it 'the ache'. Feels like someone's reached into my ribs and squeezed, every goddamn time I think about her.\"\n\nHe knocked back the rest of his drink, welcoming the fiery distraction from the emptiness. \"But hey, at least I've got this. A glass full of courage, or maybe just a glass full of something.\" He chuckled darkly, pouring another finger. \"Either way, it's more than enough to keep me company tonight.\""

No one else will have it.\" They'd been so adamant, so reassuring. How could they betray me like this?

And now, those castles lay in ruins, blown away by the cold wind of reality. But it was a reality I'd brought upon myself, constructing it out of thin air and assumptions.\n\nYet, even now, I couldn't quite shake off the feeling that I knew what had happened, how it had all gone so horribly wrong. Because deep down, didn't everyone owe me this story? Didn't they know how much I deserved it?\n\nI turned back to my monitor, the article still open, still mocking. And for the first time in years, I felt at a loss, unsure of what to do next. But most of all, I felt betrayed. Not just by my source, but by myself. For believing that I knew better when, perhaps, I didn't know anything at all.\n\n---"
