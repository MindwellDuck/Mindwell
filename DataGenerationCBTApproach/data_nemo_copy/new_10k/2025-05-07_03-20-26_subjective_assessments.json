It was all-consuming, this guilt, a shroud that clouded her vision and drowned out every other thought.\n\nShe didn't notice the full moon casting its silver glow over the park, or the group of teenagers laughing as they played basketball under the lights. She didn't hear the distant wail of an ambulance, just another in the symphony of chaos she'd left behind. All she could see were the harsh lines of Mrs. Thompson's EKG, all she could hear was the echo of her own missed chances.\n\nThe dashboard clock ticked away the hours, each second a stab to her heart. She barely registered the turn into her apartment complex, her hands on autopilot as they steered her towards home. The world outside her car window ceased to exist; it was just her and her thoughts, locked in a cycle of regret that refused to let up.\n\nHer reflection in the rearview mirror caught her off guard - pale skin, dark circles, eyes that seemed to hold an entire ocean of sorrow. She looked away quickly, unable to bear the sight. She couldn't see beyond this moment, this failure. It was as if her world had narrowed down to a single point of pain, and she was powerless to widen her perspective."
