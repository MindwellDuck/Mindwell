Typical.\" My fingers traced the empty space where my name should've been. \"Maybe they mixed up the pages,\" I thought aloud, hoping for some miracle explanation.\n\nI couldn't shake this uneasy feeling, like I was standing on the edge of a cliff, waiting for the ground to crumble beneath me. \"What if they didn't make a mistake?\" I found myself wondering, my stomach churning at the thought. \"What if they're phasing me out? What if I'm not needed anymore?\"\n\nI paced around the living room, my mind racing with 'what ifs'. \"What if this is the beginning of the end? What if tomorrow's paper has no byline from me at all?\" My heart sank at the thought. I knew I was getting ahead of myself, but I couldn't help it. It was like a little voice in my head kept asking, \"But what if...?\" and I had no choice but to listen.\n\nI tried to push away the thoughts, telling myself I was being ridiculous. But the 'what ifs' kept coming, each one more dire than the last. I sighed, rubbing my temples. \"Well,\" I said to no one in particular, \"I guess tomorrow's just another day on the edge of the cliff.\""
