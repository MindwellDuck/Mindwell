The man, barely older than his dear, late Emma, had the audacity to smile at him, a smile so eerily similar it could've been hers. He felt his heart stutter, like a poorly tuned engine, and swiftly looked away.\n\n\"Of course,\" he thought bitterly, \"why shouldn't life go on smiling, when mine is stuck in this perpetual frown?\" His hands tightened around the IV tube, causing Mr. Thompson to raise an eyebrow. Henry quickly relaxed his grip, offering an apologetic smile that felt like a grimace.\n\n\"Seems everyone's got something I don't,\" he mused silently, \"a partner, a future, even a simple smile without it being tainted by memories.\" He sighed inwardly, feeling the familiar pang of unfairness. It was always there, lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce when he least expected it.\n\n\"Perhaps tomorrow will be better,\" he whispered to himself, though his tone held little conviction. After all, how could anyone else's life seem fairer than his own?"

The flies buzzed around it like some morbid symphony, and I couldn't help but wonder, 'What if one of those little pests lands on an experiment?' Or worse, 'What if a student comes in and sees this?' They might think we're running some sort of makeshift biology lab in here! And heaven forbid, 'What if the lab manager finds out?'\" I sighed, shaking my head. \"Really, who leaves their lunch to fester like that?\" I grumbled as I grabbed a trash bag and disposed of the offending item, all while my mind spun with endless 'what ifs'."

I could feel the hate simmering inside, like it always did when she gave me that cold shoulder.\n\nShe didn't even look up from her book this time, just a quick flick of those judging eyes before diving back in. \"Late again,\" she muttered. Like it was my fault we were short-staffed tonight, like I wanted to stay late and clean up after some drunken asshole decided to start a fight.\n\nI slammed the door behind me harder than intended. The house seemed emptier somehow, colder. It's not like she noticed anyway. She's always got her nose buried in one of those damn books, too good for this life we're living. I'm just the idiot who comes home late with bruises and stains.\n\nShe might as well have said, \"You're a failure, coming home like this every night.\" It's not like she ever sees how hard I work, how much I put up with at that shithole of a job. She doesn't care about any of it. Just her books and her silence.\n\nI kicked off my shoes, leaving them by the door like always. But tonight, they seemed louder, more noticeable. Like they were shouting at me, \"You're not good enough.\" I sighed, heading to the kitchen to clean up, again. It's not like anyone here notices or cares if I'm here or not.\n\nBut hey, at least she didn't complain about the mess this time, right? Even if it was just because she couldn't be bothered to look away from her fucking book. Small victories, I guess."
