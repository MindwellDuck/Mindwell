His colleague, Sarah, was showing another scientist the results of her experiment, hers pristine and neat compared to his own messy data. He felt his cheeks flush as he realized they were looking at his workspace, now strewn with crumpled papers and half-finished coffee cups. Their whispers grew louder, echoing in the sterile lab. He couldn't make out the words, but the pitying glances said it all. His heart pounded as he wished for the floor to swallow him up.",

Her messages, untouched, seemed to accuse him silently. He couldn't bear the thought of reading them now, not when she wasn't here to explain, to defend herself perhaps. She must have known he'd be back early today, why else would she leave without saying anything? His mind raced, weaving a tapestry of unspoken truths and deliberate avoidance. Each blue tick seemed to echo her indifference, her disregard for his feelings. He felt the weight of her neglect, as tangible as the cold, empty apartment around him. Yet, he couldn't bring himself to open those messages, not until he'd had time to stew in this newfound conviction of hers, whatever it might be."
