It had been exactly a year since she'd last spoken to her, their heated argument echoing in her mind like an unending loop. A sudden, profound guilt washed over her as she remembered the harsh words she'd spoken in anger. She picked up her phone, her trembling fingers hovering over the contacts list, wishing she could take back that fateful day.",

I've got enough on my plate without her constant criticism.\" She slumped back into her chair, arms crossed, and stewed in her anger, refusing to acknowledge the small, quiet voice inside her that whispered, 'Maybe she's feeling as guilty as you are.'"
