He pulled over, watching them kick up leaves in the late autumn sun. One little boy, with hair the same shade as his own at that age, was chasing after a ball. It rolled towards him, and he scooped it up, smiling. The boy's face lit up in recognition of his teacher, running towards him with open arms. He felt his heart ache, a sharp pang that stole his breath. Today would have been his younger brother's fifth birthday.",
