The heart emoticon made her stomach churn. Two hours ago? She couldn't remember the last time he'd sent her one of those.

Catch ya later!\n\nSarah felt a lump form in her throat. It was just a friendly message, wasn't it? Yet, she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. She minimized the window, her mind already painting dark scenarios. She'd been too busy with work and kids lately, had she missed something? Was Tom getting too close to J.L., whoever that was?\n\nShe decided not to mention it tonight. No use making a big deal out of nothing, right? But she'd keep an eye on things. Just in case."
