She took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of garlic and burnt butter that still clung to her uniform, a reminder of another late shift, another dinner missed with her partner. He didn't look up as she entered, his eyes glued to the pages of his book club novel, lost in someone else's world while hers crumbled around them.\n\n**Response:**\n\"Does he not hear me? Or does he simply choose to ignore my presence?\" She thought, her fingers drumming nervously on her knees. The half-eaten dinner plate on the coffee table caught her eye, a stark reminder of his unspoken complaint about her hours. \"He could have waited,\" she muttered under her breath, resentment gnawing at her like the unwashed dishes in the sink.\n\nShe longed to hear him say, \"You're home! I've been waiting for you.\" But all she got was silence, save for the occasional turn of a page. She searched her mind for any positive thought, anything that might ease this tension, but found only echoes of his complaints and her own fatigue.\n\nHer gaze wandered over the disheveled living room, taking in every crease on the couch, every dust bunny hiding in the corners. \"If he'd only help more around the house,\" she thought, her hands clenching into fists, \"maybe I wouldn't have to work so late.\" But no matter how many times she'd voiced this thought, it never seemed to change anything.\n\nShe felt a surge of anger, hot and biting like the scent of burnt butter that still clung to her uniform. She wanted him to acknowledge her, to appreciate her efforts. But all he did was turn another page, oblivious to her silent plea for recognition. \"He doesn't care,\" she thought, dismissing any counterargument as mere wishful thinking. Her heart ached, but her resolve hardened. Tomorrow would be different, she vowed. She'd make sure of it.\""
