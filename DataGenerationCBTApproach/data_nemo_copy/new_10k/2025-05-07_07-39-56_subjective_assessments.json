But tonight was different. His usual swagger was gone, replaced by a hunched, defeated posture. And those eyes... they were filled with something more than just booze, something that echoed the hollow ache in my own chest.\n\n\"Great,\" I muttered, stepping out of my patrol car into the pouring rain. \"Just what I need tonight.\" But as I approached him, he looked up at me, and it was like a punch to the gut. That raw sorrow, it was like looking into a mirror. It reminded me of... no, not now. I couldn't go there.\n\nHe whispered, \"I can't do this alone,\" before collapsing against me, his sobs wracking his body. I steadied him, feeling the weight of his grief press down on me like a physical force. My heart ached in response, like it had a mind of its own. I mean, really? I didn't even know this guy, and here I was, feeling all his pain.\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" I grumbled, struggling to keep us both upright. \"Let's get you processed.\" But as we made our way back to the car, I couldn't shake off that heavy feeling in my chest. It was like his sorrow had seeped into me, making my own demons feel closer to the surface.\n\nI mean, seriously? How could one drunk's tears make my night so much harder? But there it was, clear as day - or rain, rather. His emotions were my reality now, whether I liked it or not. And I sure as hell didn't like it."
