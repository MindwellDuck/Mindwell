He had his hand on hers as they both reached for the sugar. A hot needle of jealousy pierced me, but I shook it off. It's not like she doesn't have every right to move on. But why him? They looked so... comfortable. Too comfortable. I guess that's how these things go, huh? One minute you're sharing a life, and the next, they're with someone else, laughing like they've known each other for years. Probably planning their future together over coffee. I bet he's got a better job than me, drives a nicer car. Goddammit, why does this have to be so hard?"
