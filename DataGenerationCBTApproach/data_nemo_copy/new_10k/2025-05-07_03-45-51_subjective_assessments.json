But today, her ring isn't there. Panic surges as she remembers: she took it off last night to clean, placed it on the kitchen counter... and now it's gone. She rushes into the kitchen, eyes darting frantically over every surface, heart pounding like a runaway train in her chest. The room spins as she sinks to the floor, hands shaking, breath coming in ragged gasps.",

Why would he touch it without telling me? Is he upset about something? No, no, that can't be right. He'd tell me if something was wrong, wouldn't he? Or maybe... maybe he forgot, too caught up in his work again. Typical Mark. But why isn't he home yet? It's past six. Doesn't he care about this? About me? I need to find that ring.

My apartment's quiet, too quiet. The kind of silence that makes you hear your own heartbeat, and not in a good way.\n\nI reach for the book on my desk - 'To Kill a Mockingbird', I remember now. It was hers, once upon a time. And there she is, smiling back at me from behind the yellowed pages. Her hair's all wrong, her eyes too bright. She looks happy, but I know better.\n\nI trace her face with my finger, like maybe if I do it enough times, I can bring her back. Stupid, really. But I can't help it. It's like there's this little voice in the back of my head, whispering, \"What if she was still here? What if things were different?\" And then another voice chimes in, \"But what if they weren't? What if she was gone, and you were left here alone?\"\n\nThe 'what ifs' just keep coming, each one darker than the last. It's like I'm drowning in them, and I can't seem to find my way back to shore.
