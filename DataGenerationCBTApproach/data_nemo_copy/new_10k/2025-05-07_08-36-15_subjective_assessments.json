As she picked it up, her heart pounded with a familiar dread. She had felt this shame before, the sting of criticism from parents over a lesson plan gone awry. The envelope was thin, but its contents felt heavy as she slipped her finger under the seal. Inside, a single sheet of paper detailed a complaint about her teaching methods, signed by five parents. Her eyes scanned the lines, each word stinging like salt on an open wound. She felt her cheeks flush with heat as she realized how many people now saw her as inadequate. The letter was crumpled in her fist before she could stop herself, shame burning like acid in her stomach.",
