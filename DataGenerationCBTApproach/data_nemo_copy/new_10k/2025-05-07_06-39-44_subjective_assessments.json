Little Johnny 'Wonderboy' Thompson, barely old enough to grow a proper beard, has published his latest masterpiece. And what do you know, it's practically a carbon copy of my thesis from twenty years ago. I mean, the audacity! He didn't just borrow my ideas, he *paraded* them around like they were his own.\n\nI swear, if I had to hear one more colleague gush about how 'brilliant' young Johnny is, I might've thrown up in my mouth a little. Did they even bother to look at the publication dates? Or was it too much effort for them to notice that this 'groundbreaking' research was actually old news?\n\nI suppose I should be flattered, right? My work was so good, he couldn't help but steal it. But honestly, it feels more like a punch in the gut than a compliment. Here's Johnny, Mr. Big Shot, basking in glory that should've been mine. And now, who gets to sit pretty at the lectern, discussing my research like it was their own? Him.\n\nI just don't get it. How could they all be so blind? Or maybe I'm just being too sensitive. Maybe this is what progress looks like \u2013 stepping on the backs of those who came before you. Either way, it feels wrong. It feels *dirty*.\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I'm just the original author."

The uniform, once pristine, now faded like a distant memory, bore testament to her absence more potently than any photograph could. The white stripes seemed like bars of a prison she'd left me in, their starkness mocking me with her freedom.\n\nMy heart throbbed, a metronome counting the seconds since she walked out that door, leaving behind only echoes of laughter and remnants of scent. It was as if I could still smell her perfume on the fabric, a ghostly reminder of what once was. How could something so small hold such profound sorrow? It was as though she'd left me with nothing but reminders of her absence, deliberate cruel jokes whispered in the silence.\n\nI picked up the uniform, the weight of it heavy in my hands, heavier still on my heart. The fabric was rough under my fingers, like sandpaper scraping away at the scabs I'd thought had healed over. Each stripe seemed to scream at me, \"You failed her! You weren't enough!\" My mind raced with accusations, each one more damning than the last. How could I have missed this? How could she have left something so... so *her* behind?\n\nThe clutter of my apartment, once comforting in its familiarity, now seemed like a graveyard of our past. Every item whispered tales of her leaving\u2014each book unread since she went away, every plate unused because it was 'our' dish, not 'mine'. The uniform was just the latest tombstone marking another loss I'd tried to ignore.\n\nI sank onto the floor, the uniform clutched to my chest like a shield against the world. Why did everything have to remind me of her? Why couldn't there be something, anything, that didn't feel like another nail in the coffin of our relationship? It was as if my heart had become a museum of her leaving, every exhibit more painful than the last.\n\nBut perhaps it was better this way. Perhaps I deserved these reminders, these daily punishments for failing to keep her happy. After all, hadn't she said as much before she left? \"You're too self-centered,\" \"You don't listen enough,\" \"You're never home.\" Each accusation now seemed like a truth etched in stone, the uniform just another piece of evidence against me.\n\nI buried my face in the fabric, inhaling deeply. Her scent was gone, replaced by the smell of dust and regret. But still, I held it close, this symbol of her absence, this proof of my failure. Because even now, even after all this time, I couldn't bear to throw it away."
