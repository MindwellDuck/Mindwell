The faded ink and familiar handwriting stirred a quiet ache within her. It was from him - the man she'd loved years ago, before duty took precedence over their relationship. She remembered writing back, explaining why they couldn't be together anymore, but this letter, unopened, told her he'd never known why. A lump formed in her throat as melancholy washed over her like a familiar, unwanted visitor.",
