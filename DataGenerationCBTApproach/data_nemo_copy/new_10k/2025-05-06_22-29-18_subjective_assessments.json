Their laughter should not have been so carefree, so intimate. And most of all, this photo should not have existed at all. It was an affront to our marriage, a challenge to the narrative I had constructed in my mind.\n\nI felt a rising anger, fueled by the sense that something had been taken from me, something that I believed was rightfully mine: control over our shared past.
