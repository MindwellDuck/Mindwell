And look at this, it's from five years ago - almost as old as the memories I've been trying to preserve.*\n\n*I suppose some people might find this sentimental, a sweet reminder of Albert's presence even after he's gone. But no, not me. All it does is remind me of what I don't have anymore. While others are probably still sharing laughter with their partners over breakfast, here I am, alone with my coffee and this blasted letter.*\n\n*It's not that I envy them, mind you. It's just... well, it would be nice if life could've been fair for once. But then again, when has life ever been about fairness?*"

There we were, smiling wide at some long-forgotten picnic - her dark hair against my blonde, our laughter frozen in time. A lump formed in my throat as I traced our faces with my fingertip.\n\nI couldn't help but compare that carefree girl to the woman I am now. She had Mom's warmth, her joy so infectious it leaped off the page. Me? I'm just a pale shadow, stuck in this endless loop of sorrow and loneliness. Everyone else seems to have moved on from their losses, while I'm still here, drowning in mine.\n\nI tucked the photograph back into the textbook, its corners now dog-eared with age and memories. As I placed it in the 'donate' pile, I felt a pang of envy for those who'd never know this ache. They could keep their laughter carefree, their smiles untouched by sorrow. Not me, though. Not anymore."

Their smirks stretched wide, like they'd just heard the funniest joke in the world. I wanted to scream at them, \"It's just a bit of spilled sauce!\" But it wasn't just that, was it? It was my reputation, my perfectionism, laid bare.\n\nI felt my face flush hot, anger and embarrassment warring within me. How could they laugh like that, when I've poured my heart into this kitchen, into every dish I serve? Either you're a maestro, or you're a failure. There's no in-between, not for me. Not tonight.\n\nI walked away from Table 7, leaving them to their laughter, my steps heavy with disappointment. Every step felt like a admission of defeat. It was either I served perfection, or I was a laughing stock. There was no middle ground."
