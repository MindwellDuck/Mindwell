I noticed a young couple ahead, huddled under an umbrella, their laughter echoing through the quiet street. They were oblivious to the rain, lost in their own world, their love for each other palpable even from a distance.\n\nI couldn't help but compare our situation. She would have laughed too, her eyes crinkling at the corners, if she was here. But she's not. The ring in my pocket, now hers, felt heavier than ever, a constant reminder of what I no longer have. Their happiness seemed like a stark contrast to my solitary existence, each raindrop a testament to the distance between us.\n\nI quickened my pace, eager to reach the sanctuary of my empty home. Yet, even as I turned the key in the lock, I couldn't shake off the feeling that everyone else had moved on, while I was still stuck here, in this interminable limbo of grief and longing."
