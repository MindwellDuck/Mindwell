His heart pounded, not with exertion but with questions. Always questions, always what ifs. It was exhausting, this endless cycle of could-have-beens and never-weres. Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something else he should've done, some other path they could've taken. He sat on the bench, cold despite the summer evening. The tree loomed above him, its leaves rustling as if whispering secrets only she knew."
