Wilted, brown, like something out of a horror movie. I can almost hear it screaming, \"Touch me, Amelia. Feel my decay.\" My stomach turns just thinking about it. It's like they knew exactly what would set me off. But how could they? I never talk about my phobias.*\n\n*I mean, look at me. Dr. Amelia Hart, the woman who can't even touch a dead flower without feeling like she's going to lose her breakfast. Meanwhile, Dr. Thompson down the hall has patients sending him chocolates and wine. He doesn't have to worry about his desk turning into a graveyard.*\n\n*Why do they always send me the worst? The ones with the darkest minds, the most twisted souls. It's not fair. I'm just trying to help people here. Is that too much to ask for? A little normalcy in my life?*\n\n*I can't stop looking at it. Those tiny brown spiders dancing on my desk, mocking me. \"You're weak, Amelia,\" they seem to say. \"Weak and pathetic.\" I want to scream, to throw them all away, but I can't. Because that would mean admitting defeat. And I never admit defeat.*\n\n*But damn it, why does everything always have to be so hard for me? Why can't I just have one normal day like everyone else?*"

The solitude felt heavier tonight, a familiar loneliness that wrapped around her like an old coat.

She sighed, her eyes flicking to the empty chair again. *Was this some sort of punishment?* she wondered. *Had she done something wrong?* The questions swirled in her mind, each one more accusatory than the last.\n\nShe glanced at the clock, the hands moving slower than ever. It was barely eight, but the night stretched out before her like an endless, solitary road. She took a deep breath, her resolve hardening. *Fine,* she thought, pushing her plate away. *If he didn't want to be here, that was his choice. But he could have at least told her.*"
