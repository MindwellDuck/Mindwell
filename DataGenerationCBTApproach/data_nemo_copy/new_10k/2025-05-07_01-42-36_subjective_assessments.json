She hasn't painted anything meaningful since he left, two years ago today. A sudden gust of wind rattles the window behind her, startling her into dropping the brush onto the dusty floor. As she bends to pick it up, a small, framed photo tucked beneath an easel catches her eye - them laughing together on their honeymoon. The weight of that carefree happiness feels heavier now than any canvas could bear. She picks up the photo instead of the brush, tracing its edges with fingers that ache for something more tangible than despair.",

So, here I am, drowning in coffee and existential dread, trying to figure out why the hell I'm still alive if today's gonna suck this much.\n\nThen there was that meeting. You know, the one where everyone else seemed chipper and productive? Yeah, that one. I could've sworn they were all speaking a different language. Every word out of their mouths just made my anxiety spike like, 'Oh look, another thing to worry about.' My emotions were screaming at me, 'Run! Hide! This is horrible!' But hey, what do I know? I'm just the one feeling it.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on that email from Sarah. You remember Sarah, right? The one who always seems to have it together? Well, today, her email was all, 'Hey, can you take a look at this?' And my brain was like, 'Oh, it's just another mountain of work to prove we're not good enough.' I mean, who knows what she actually meant, but my emotions were like, 'Yeah, that's the one!' So here I am, drowning in self-doubt and more work than I can handle.\n\nBut hey, who needs sleep when you've got anxiety, right? At least it keeps things interesting. Not.\""
