You've recently noticed Emma, the new assistant manager, who seems to have quickly befriended your team. Today, you overheard them laughing about their weekends in the break room, but she didn't mention your recent successful sale. Later, she walked into your department without acknowledging you, immediately engaging with another sales associate. How do you react and feel about these situations?\n\n**John's Response:**\n\nI noticed Emma, the new assistant manager, huddled with our team in the break room today. They were sharing stories about their weekends, laughter filling the air. I couldn't help but overhear as I passed by. She didn't mention my recent sale, not once. It was as if it hadn't happened at all.\n\nI felt a tightness in my jaw, like a vice grip. I suppose she's new; she might not know how significant that sale was for our department. But still, it stung. It was like being ignored, invisible. Either you're noticed and appreciated, or you're nothing.\n\nLater, Emma walked into our department without so much as a greeting. She didn't even glance my way before launching into a conversation with one of the other associates, her laughter echoing through the empty aisles. It was as if we were strangers, not colleagues who've been working together for years.\n\nI found myself dismissing her, writing her off in my mind. Either she's incompetent and doesn't understand our dynamics, or she's intentionally ignoring me. There's no in-between with her, it seems. No gray area, only black and white.\n\nBut perhaps I'm being too harsh. Maybe she's just trying to find her footing here, like the rest of us once did. Yet, it's hard not to view things this way when you've been overlooked, especially after a notable achievement like that sale. It's either you're recognized for your contributions, or you're overlooked, forgotten. There's no middle ground in my mind today."
