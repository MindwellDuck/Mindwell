As he stepped back to admire it, he noticed a familiar figure across the room, whispering behind her hand to another guest, her eyes flickering dismissively towards his painting. He recognized that look of pity mixed with contempt, the same one he'd seen at every show for years. His wife's smile faded as she followed his gaze, misunderstanding his silence for pride. He felt a familiar heat rise in his cheeks, shame washing over him like an unwanted embrace.",

As she stepped back to examine it, a sudden gust through the open window sent her smock fluttering, knocking over a half-empty cup of cold coffee.
