The sight of our old address in his handwriting sent my heart racing. Two years gone by, yet here it was, tucked away like a forgotten secret. I could almost hear his voice whispering from the past, \"Mom, Dad...\" But why hadn't we seen it before?\n\nMy mind started spinning, weaving webs of what ifs. What if he had needed us? What if something had happened to him and we weren't there for him? What if... oh, God, what if he still blames us for everything that went wrong between us?\n\nI couldn't shake off the feeling that this letter was a sign. A warning perhaps. Or maybe it was just my overactive imagination, making mountains out of molehills like it always does. But isn't that what mothers do? Worry about their children even when they're not around?\n\nI sat down at the kitchen table, the letter still in my trembling hands. I didn't dare open it yet. Not until I knew what to expect. Not until I was sure it wouldn't break me apart all over again. Because what if it did? What if it tore open old wounds and left them bleeding once more?\n\nSo here I am, stuck between the past and present, unable to move forward without knowing what lies within this unopened letter. But maybe that's for the best. Maybe ignorance is bliss after all. Or maybe, just maybe, it's not too late to reach out and mend what was broken. If only I could stop these what ifs from echoing in my mind."

The yellowed envelopes seemed to sneer at him, like little paper judges. He knew what was inside - more complaints about his teaching methods, more echoes of his wife's disapproval.\n\nHe'd tried to imagine opening them once, late at night when sleep was a stranger. The words had unspooled in his mind like a grim film reel: *\"You're not doing enough...\" \"...needs more structure...\" \"...like other teachers...\"* Each sentence was a punch to the gut, leaving him winded and miserable.\n\nHe could practically hear their voices, cold and critical. It was going to be awful, he just knew it. He'd probably lose his job, his wife would leave him, and then where would he be? Alone, useless, a failure.\n\nSo, here they sat, the unopened letters, gathering dust like little time bombs. Every morning, every afternoon, they'd stare at him, accusing, waiting for him to finally face what was inside. But he couldn't. Not today, not ever. It was just too much."
