I handled that report, but did anyone notice? Hell no. It's not like they'd say thank you even if they did. The place is always so quiet, like a damn library. No one ever talks to me, let alone asks how I'm doing.\n\nComing home was the usual joyride. Empty streets, empty house. Just me and my shadow, dancing along the walls. Dinner? Ha! Who needs it when you've got memories for company? I sat down at the table, looked at that fucking picture... God, what a joke. I used to think life would be different. Better.\n\nI cried today. One tear, like a traitor, rolling down my cheek and dropping onto my untouched plate. It's funny how something so small can feel so heavy, you know? Like the weight of the world is sitting on that tiny little drop. But who cares about one stupid tear? No one notices anything around here.\n\nThe night's winding down now. I'm just waiting for sleep to take me, like it always does. Alone. Just another day in paradise.\""

The smell of burning oil filled the air, an acrid reminder of another fire, another time when everything had hung in the balance. My hands shook uncontrollably, betraying me at the very moment I needed them most.\n\nThere was no middle ground here, no room for nuance or gradual descent into panic. It was all or nothing - either I acted now, took control, or let the flames consume everything. There was no in-between, no option to merely observe and wait. My restaurant, my livelihood, my identity - it was all at stake, and I could not afford to do anything but fight back with every fiber of my being.\n\nWith a herculean effort, I shook off the paralysis and grabbed for the fire extinguisher hanging nearby. It felt like a lifeline, a chance to save what mattered most from total destruction. As I pulled it down, I knew there was no halfway measure here - either I succeeded in putting out the flames, or I failed utterly. There was no room for anything else."
