Her heart sank as she realized this meant no more Friday morning chats with Mr. H., no more sharing her passion for history with young minds.

She tossed it into the compost bin, an unwanted participant in this morbid charade.\n\nThe walk-in fridge was colder than usual, or so it seemed. It was like stepping into a frozen coffin, another reminder of how lifeless she felt inside. The normally vibrant colors of the produce seemed faded, their usual cheerfulness lost on her today.\n\nHer colleague, Sam, tried to strike up a conversation about last night's game, but she barely registered his words. \"Yeah, sure,\" she replied automatically, her mind already wandering back to that goddamn card in the trash. It was like an anchor, dragging her down into this endless pit of despair.\n\nThe lunch rush wasn't just busy; it was a fucking tsunami today. Every order felt like a personal attack on her capabilities. \"I can't do this,\" she whispered to herself, as she struggled to keep up with the tickets piling up in front of her. The familiar hum of the kitchen was drowned out by the cacophony of her own self-doubt.\n\nWhen the rush finally subsided, she found herself alone in the kitchen, cleaning down stations that were already clean. She didn't notice the small victories - the compliments from customers, the laughter shared with colleagues earlier in the week.
