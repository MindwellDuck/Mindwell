She knows it's John's birthday... or did she forget? No, can't be. Maybe they're all in on something, laughing about how I'm stuck here alone, the outsider. Jesus, this sucks.\""

Her head was thrown back, genuine laughter etched into every line of her face. Beside her, arms wrapped loosely around each other's shoulders, stood his partner's old flame. Their cheeks were flushed, glasses raised in mid-toast. The scene was one of camaraderie, of shared secrets and inside jokes.\n\nHe felt a pang, sharp as a needle prick, in the vicinity of his heart. Resentment began to simmer within him, slow and steady like lava building towards an eruption. His grip on the mouse tightened, knuckles turning white against the cool plastic. He zoomed in on their faces, searching for some sign, any sign, that this wasn't what it seemed.\n\nBut there was nothing. No telltale glances, no stolen kisses hidden behind raised glasses. Just two old friends laughing together at a party he hadn't been invited to. Yet, the pang persisted, growing into a dull ache as his mind began to weave its own story around the photograph. He could almost hear their laughter echoing through the empty halls of his imagination, filling in the gaps with whispers of shared history and renewed attractions.\n\nHe sighed, leaning back in his chair. His partner had never given him reason to doubt her loyalty. Yet here he was, drawing lines between smiles and glasses raised, constructing entire narratives from a single photograph. He felt a twinge of guilt at the thought, but it was swiftly overshadowed by the resentment that continued to simmer within him. After all, wasn't his imagination simply filling in the blanks? He deserved to know the truth, didn't he? Even if it meant constructing it himself from little more than conjecture and wishful thinking."
