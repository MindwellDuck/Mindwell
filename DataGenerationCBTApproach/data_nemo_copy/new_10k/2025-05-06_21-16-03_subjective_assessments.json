You've recently discovered an unopened letter addressed to your late husband tucked behind a bookshelf, postmarked two years after his death.\n\n**Margaret's Reaction:**\n\n\"Well, isn't that just peachy? Here I am, dusting off this old bookshelf - because heaven forbid I should let the house go to seed, unlike some people I know - and what do I find? A bloody letter from two years ago. Two years! Can you believe it?\n\nIt's addressed to him, of course. Because why would anyone write to me? I'm just the widow, the one who's left behind to pick up the pieces. Oh, but they didn't forget about him, no sirree. They remembered good old Henry, the life of the party, the charmer, the one everyone loved.\n\nAnd what am I supposed to do with this letter now? Open it and find out what he missed out on? Or maybe it's from some old flame, checking if he was still single. Wouldn't that be a kick in the teeth?\n\nOh, but look at me, feeling sorry for myself. It's not like I haven't got plenty to do around here. There's the garden, which isn't going to weed itself - although, who knows, maybe it would if I had Henry's green thumb. And then there's the bridge club, where they're always so attentive, so eager to hear about my 'little life', as if I'm not just as interesting as any of them.\n\nBut why should they care? They've got their husbands, their families, their perfect little lives. They don't understand what it's like to be alone, to have the world pass you by while you're stuck in the same old routine. They can't possibly know how it feels to find a letter like this and wonder... well, never mind what I'm wondering.\n\nSo, here's to me, the queen of self-pity. Let's see if I can make it through another day without letting the green-eyed monster get the better of me. Because really, who needs eyes when you've got ears? Everyone else seems to be doing just fine, so why shouldn't I?\""
