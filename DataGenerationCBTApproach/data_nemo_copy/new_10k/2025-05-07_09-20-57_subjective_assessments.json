It was Jane's name, typed out in her usual efficient style, and yet something about it gave me pause.\n\nI leaned back in my chair, rubbing my eyes with the heels of my hands before allowing them to focus on the screen once more. The email was discussing plans for a surprise birthday party... but not for anyone I knew. Not for Jane, or even myself, as far as I could tell. A strange sense of unease began to settle in the pit of my stomach.\n\n\"What if this is it?\" I found myself thinking, as my mind began to spin scenarios that were entirely speculative, yet somehow felt all too real. \"What if this is the beginning of the end? What if Jane starts pulling away, investing her time and energy into someone else's life instead of ours?\"\n\nMy heart felt heavy at the thought, a dull ache that seemed to spread from my chest outwards, filling me with an overwhelming sense of dread. I could feel it, like a physical weight pressing down on my shoulders, the future stretching out before me as a bleak and desolate landscape. How would I cope if Jane were no longer there by my side? If her laughter wasn't echoing through our shared space? It was almost too much to bear.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself against the wave of negativity that threatened to consume me. There was nothing concrete here, no evidence to suggest that anything was changing between Jane and I. And yet, there it was: the familiar sense of impending doom, the conviction that whatever was coming next would be something I simply couldn't stand.\n\nWith a sigh, I leaned back in my chair once more, allowing the darkness of the office to envelop me as I waited for whatever storm clouds were gathering on the horizon."
