The radio's static filled silence seemed louder than usual, as if holding its breath with him. He knew every house had its own story, but this one felt different. It was too still, too empty. His hand trembled slightly as he reached for the handle, the cold metal a stark contrast to his sweaty palm. He could feel it in his gut, that dreadful, familiar feeling of fear that never quite left him after the incident last year. But today was just another call, he told himself, trying to steady his breathing. Just another house.",

This wasn't some special case just because it felt like one. He switched on his flashlight, the beam cutting through the darkness as he stepped inside. \"Just another house,\" he repeated aloud, his voice echoing in the empty hallway. \"No need to get worked up over nothing.\""
