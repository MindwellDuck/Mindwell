It's as if a part of me has been amputated, leaving behind an empty desk and a void that echoes her laughter no more.\n\nThe sun dipped low today, casting long shadows over the parking lot, each one reaching out like a lonely specter. I can't help but think it's a cruel reminder of all the times we'd shared this view, side by side, on our way home together. Now, it's just another sunset without her. I'm not just missing her; I'm missing us. The 'us' that was woven into the fabric of this place, the 'us' that made our station come alive.\n\nI've always prided myself on my professionalism, but today, I feel like a shell of who I used to be. My badge might say 'Nurse', but my heart says 'Incomplete'."
