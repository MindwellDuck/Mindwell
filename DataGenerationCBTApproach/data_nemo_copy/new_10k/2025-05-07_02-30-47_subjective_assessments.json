The couple in the photograph seemed so carefree, so intimate. Her husband's smile was wider than she'd seen it in years, his eyes crinkling at the corners with unabashed joy. And that woman, her arm draped casually around him, her head leaned in close... who was she?\n\nShe felt a prickling sensation at the back of her neck, a creeping unease that seemed to seep into her very bones. It was as if an unseen hand had reached into her chest and squeezed her heart ever so slightly. She couldn't help but feel that this photograph, tucked away here, was meant for her eyes alone. A message, perhaps? Or a warning?\n\nShe turned the photograph over, hoping for some clue, some explanation. But there was nothing save for the fading ink of time. Her mind began to whir like a well-oiled machine, churning out possibilities, each one more disturbing than the last.\n\nHad he loved her once? More than he loved her now? Was she still in his life somehow, lingering like an unwanted shadow? The thought made her stomach churn, bile rising up into her throat. She felt a sudden urge to confront him, to demand answers. But what if... what if this was just a silly photograph from his past, nothing more?\n\nNo, she thought, tucking the photograph back between the pages where she'd found it. No, he would never do that to me. Would he? She looked at their wedding photo on the mantelpiece, her reflection caught in the glass, her eyes filled with doubt and fear."
