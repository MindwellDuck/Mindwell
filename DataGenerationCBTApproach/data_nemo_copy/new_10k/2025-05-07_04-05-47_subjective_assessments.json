He hadn't seemed suspicious at first, but now he was slowing down, matching her pace. She felt a chill run down her spine as she realized she'd taken this shortcut too many times before to remember where it led. The streetlights here were infrequent, and the shadows long. Her heart began to pound in her chest, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. She quickened her pace, but so did he. Fear gripped her, icy and paralyzing. She wanted to look back, but she didn't dare take her eyes off the path ahead.",

Always this desolate path to the library, always these shadows that seemed to stretch indefinitely. Never had she encountered such a situation, not once in all her years of traversing this route. The man in the hoodie was another confirmation, she thought, of the danger lurking on this street at night. She'd have to give up her late-night reading sprees; it was simply too risky now, whole evenings ruined by such encounters. Every step echoed with finality, sealing her fate as a prisoner in her own home after dusk."

Kids'll never let me live this down.\" I took a deep breath, trying to focus on the lesson plan, but all I could see was that damn lipstick stain looming like a fucking omen of tomorrow's humiliation."
