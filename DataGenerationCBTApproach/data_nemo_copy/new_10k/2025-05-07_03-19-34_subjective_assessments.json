I'm shaking now, but it's not from anger. It's determination. This time, I'll be thorough. No stone left unturned. Their carelessness will be exposed, and everyone will see who the real professional is around here.\n\nI start typing out a reply, each word punctuated by my resolve. I won't just fact-check their article; I'll dissect it, prove them wrong on every count. This is personal now.\n\nBut hey, who knows? Maybe they're having an off day. Or maybe they're just trying to shake things up around here. No matter. I've got this covered."
