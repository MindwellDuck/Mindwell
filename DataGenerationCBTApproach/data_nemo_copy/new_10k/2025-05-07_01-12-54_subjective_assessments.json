He hadn't realized it was so late; the hospital's fluorescent lights had tricked him into believing it was still early afternoon. His pager remained silent for once, no emergencies to attend to, just the quiet reminder that he was alone again tonight.\n\nHe hung his white coat on the hook by the door, noticing the faint stain of iodine that had somehow evaded his notice earlier. He sighed, feeling a familiar heaviness in his chest. Another long day, another lonely night. The emptiness of his apartment seemed to echo the emptiness inside him.\n\nIn the bathroom, he splashed cold water on his face, staring at his reflection in the mirror. The dark circles under his eyes seemed deeper than usual, the lines around his mouth more pronounced. He thought about calling someone - anyone - but who would understand? His colleagues were always too busy, and his friends... well, they had their own lives now.\n\nHe turned away from the mirror, unable to bear the sight of himself any longer. As he reached for a towel, his hand brushed against something tucked into the corner of the counter. It was a small, framed photograph of him and his sister, taken on her wedding day. They were both smiling, their arms wrapped around each other's waists.\n\nTears welled up in his eyes as he traced the edge of the frame. She had been his rock, his confidante, his cheerleader. But she was gone now, taken by a disease that even his medical expertise couldn't combat. He missed her laughter, her warmth, her unwavering belief in him.\n\nHe carried the photograph to his bed, clutching it tightly as he lay down. The room felt colder without her here, quieter. He closed his eyes, letting the tears slide down his cheeks unchecked. Another night alone with nothing but memories and sorrow for company.",

But no, I was too busy rushing off to work, like always. His pen was the last thing he used before... before everything changed.\n\nNow, every time I look at it, I can't shake these 'what ifs'. What if I'd been there for him? What if I'd insisted on taking the car that day? What if, what if, what if. It's like a damn merry-go-round in my head, spinning faster and faster until I'm dizzy with it all.\n\nI slam the drawer shut, hard enough to make the other pens jump. \"Fuck!\" I yell, startling my coworker at her desk nearby. She glances over, concerned, but I just shake my head, avoiding her gaze. This is why I hate finding these reminders. It's not just a pen, it's an invitation to torture myself with endless 'what ifs'. And yet, here we are again.\""
