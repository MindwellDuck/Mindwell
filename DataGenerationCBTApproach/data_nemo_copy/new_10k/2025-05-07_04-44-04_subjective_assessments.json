She'd been leaning over her desk, reviewing patient files by lamplight, her back to the clock. A sudden wave of dizziness hit her as she straightened up, her heart pounding like a drum in her chest. The room began to spin, the ticking sound now thunderous, each tick echoing like a countdown timer. She reached out for her desk but missed, stumbling sideways into a pile of books.
