She'd stayed up until midnight, marking them meticulously, yet today they mock her, a testament to her endless toil. It's not even noon when she hears it - the harsh, grating sound of chalk against blackboard, followed by a collective groan from her students. She turns around, rage simmering within her, to see Johnny, once again, leaning back in his chair, feet resting on the desk, chalk dusting his hair. He smirks at her, challenge gleaming in his eyes. The room is silent, waiting for her reaction.",

The scent of his old aftershave clung to the paper like a ghostly reminder. I'd long ago packed away his cologne, but this... this was him, in my face again.\n\nI remembered our last argument, his voice echoing in the empty house. 'You're never satisfied, Martha,' he'd snapped. 'Always comparing, always finding fault.' I'd denied it then, but now, here with just this faded receipt and his lingering scent, I couldn't help but feel it was true.\n\nI looked around our home, now my home alone. Everything seemed shabbier, smaller somehow. His absence was a chasm I couldn't bridge, no matter how hard I tried. I'd spent years trying to fill it with new furniture, fresh paint, but it was like plugging a dam with pebbles.\n\nI traced the lines of his writing, neat despite the crumple. He'd been so organized, so capable. Even in death, he seemed better than me. Leaner, stronger, braver. I felt that old familiar ache, that sense of inadequacy that had become my constant companion since he was gone.\n\nI crumpled the receipt in my fist, as if that could erase his handwriting, his scent, his memory. But it wouldn't go away, just like this heavy sorrow inside me wouldn't go away. It was always there, a dull ache reminding me of what I lacked, of who he'd been and who I wasn't.\""
