It wasn't just any brush; it was *my* brush, the one I'd used to paint the sunset that hung proudly on our living room wall. He was ruining it, destroying it with casual indifference.\n\n\"Careful,\" I wanted to shout, but I bit my tongue. I couldn't bear to see him labeled as careless or insensitive. But how could he be so reckless? Didn't he know how much that brush meant to me?\n\nI felt a pang of anxiety, my stomach twisting into knots. This wasn't just about a paintbrush anymore; it was about his character, his respect for my work. He was proving himself to be thoughtless, perhaps even selfish. I couldn't unsee this new label stamped onto him.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. \"Be reasonable,\" I told myself. But the anxious thoughts were already spiraling. How could I have been so wrong about him? Perhaps this was a sign of things to come. My mind raced with worst-case scenarios, each one painting him in an increasingly negative light."
