Total assholes, thinking they can just do whatever they want. Not like I have a life to live too.\n\nWork was a fucking joke. My boss sprang this new project on me at the last minute, acting like it's my fault we're behind schedule. Like I'm supposed to read his damn mind or something. He could've told me earlier, but nooo, he had to wait till I'd already planned out my day. Typical.\n\nThen there's her. My girlfriend. Two years down the drain, and she still hasn't figured out that I need some goddamn space sometimes. She was all over me last night, talking about how we should spend more time together, plan a fucking vacation even. Like that's gonna happen anytime soon with this shitstorm of a job. She just doesn't get it.\n\nAnyway, finally got home and crashed on the couch. Must've dozed off 'cause next thing I know, my phone's buzzing in my pocket. It's her again. \"Still up?\" she asks at midnight. What am I supposed to do with that? Tell her I'm fucking exhausted and just wanna pass out? So I delete it. No reply.\n\nBut guess who's the asshole here? Me, of course. 'Cause now, looking at my dating app, there it is again - her message. A fucking ghost staring me in the face.
