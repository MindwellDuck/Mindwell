As he struggled to adjust a crooked painting, his paint-stained smock caught on a hook, tearing loudly and revealing a bright, polka-dotted shirt underneath. The room erupted in muffled giggles.",

She had been divorced for over a decade now, but still found herself irritated by the occasional glance from strangers who seemed to pity her situation. Today, however, it wasn't sympathy that fueled her irritation; it was the sight of a young man parking his car diagonally across two spaces, leaving barely enough room for her compact car. She could see him, laughing and joking with his friends, not a care in the world about anyone else's convenience. As she struggled to maneuver into the tiny space left for her, she felt her irritation boil over. \"Really?\" she muttered under her breath, slamming her door shut harder than intended.",
