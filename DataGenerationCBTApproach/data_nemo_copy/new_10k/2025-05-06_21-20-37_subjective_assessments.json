I suppose I should start referring to it as 'your' old classroom now, given how empty it felt without you there. The silence was deafening, or so it seemed to me. It's odd how a room can feel so cold and lifeless when the heating is still on.\n\nI stood by your desk, or rather what used to be your desk. It's strange how something so insignificant as a pencil eraser can make you feel a pang of nostalgia. I picked it up, rolled it between my fingers, as if expecting it to hold some clue about where you've gone. But it was just an eraser, after all.\n\nI remember how you'd write on the whiteboard, your handwriting always a bit messy but filled with a certain charm. It's clean now, isn't it? Just like our classroom. Just like... well, everything seems to be these days.\n\nI can't help but think that perhaps I'm exaggerating this emptiness, this silence. Perhaps if I were to come back tomorrow, or the day after, it wouldn't feel so stark. But today, it was overwhelming. And yet, I can't quite bring myself to minimize these feelings either. They're real, aren't they? Even if they're not as bad as they seem.\n\nI hope you're doing well, [Her Name]. Wherever you are, I hope it's warmer than our old classroom feels now.\n\nBest,\n[His Name]"
