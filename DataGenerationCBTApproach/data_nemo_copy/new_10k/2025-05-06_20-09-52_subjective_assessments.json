You've found a crumpled note addressed to \"E\" in their pocket while doing laundry yesterday evening.\n\n**Sarah's Reaction:**\n\n\"I can't help but feel this is about me. It must be. Alex has never mentioned anyone named 'E'. I've wracked my brain all night, trying to recall if they've ever mentioned it casually or if there was any sign of something more... familiar than usual. But no, nothing. This note, it's like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit anywhere in our picture-perfect life.\n\nI mean, who is 'E'? And why was Alex carrying around this crumpled note? It can't be just anyone. It has to be someone they know well, someone significant enough for them to keep this note tucked away. It's not like Alex to be so careless with personal items. This isn't like the other receipts or random papers that end up in their pockets.\n\nI've been tossing and turning all night, my mind racing with questions. I can't help but feel that this 'E' is taking something from me, from us. It's as if they're encroaching on our space, disrupting our harmony without even being here. It feels personal, intimate almost, in a way that makes my stomach churn.\n\nI've tried to tell myself it could be anyone - a friend, a colleague, perhaps even an old flame trying to rekindle something that's long gone cold. But deep down, I know it can't be just anyone. This 'E', they're someone important, someone who threatens the stability of our relationship.\n\nI wish Alex would come home soon so we could talk about this. There must be a logical explanation for all this. But until then, I'm left here with my thoughts and this gnawing feeling that something is not quite right.\""
