After all, it's been my fault we've drifted apart. Your childhood was nothing but a series of my failures, I'm sure you must think so too.\n\nRemember how I used to burn the dinner, every other night? How your father would come home to find us in silence, you sulking and me trying to hide the charred remains? It was always me, Emily. Always my fault.\n\nAnd now, seeing him with her... it's just another reminder of what a failure I've been. He's moved on, found happiness again. But look at me, still clutching onto that damned watch like it means anything. Like it can bring your father back, or fix the mess I've made of our lives.\n\nI never meant for things to turn out this way. I only wanted what was best for you, but even that seemed beyond my grasp. You were right to leave, Emily. It's better that you're not here, seeing me like this - a pathetic old woman wallowing in her past mistakes.\n\nYour mother,\nMary"
