        "Triggering Event": "A middle-aged man, his skin weathered by years of late-night shifts and harsh disinfectants, stood at the nurses' station, flipping through charts with a growing sense of unease. His eyes scanned the rows of rooms, each one filled with patients who demanded care but seemed oblivious to the staff's tireless efforts. A junior nurse, barely out of her teens, approached him, her voice light as she asked about an upcoming shift swap. He turned to face her, his eyes flashing with sudden intensity. \"You know what?\" he snapped, slamming a chart onto the counter, \"I've been here for twenty years, and I'm sick and tired of you kids thinking this is some kind of game. We're not playing house here; people's lives are at stake!\"",

Fuck me, if I have to spend another shift dealing with these kids who think they're God's gift to nursing.\" He spun around, his eyes scanning the station, looking for any other signs of insubordination. \"Christ,\" he spat out, shaking his head, \"I swear, if it weren't for us old-timers keeping this place afloat, they'd all be drowning in their own ignorance.\""
