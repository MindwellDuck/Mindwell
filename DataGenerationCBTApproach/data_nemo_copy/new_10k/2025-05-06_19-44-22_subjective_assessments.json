Zip. Zero.*\n\n*I click around, checking notifications, emails, anything to avoid staring at that empty chat window.

Silence and emptiness echoing through every aspect of my life?* I thought I could find some solace in work, in the back-and-forth of collaboration.

If they won't respond, then I'll just have to... *I pause, my thoughts grinding to a halt as I realize I'm still staring at that blank screen, oblivious to anything else.*\n\n*There's a message from Sarah, sent fifteen minutes ago.

The stale coffee and quiet hum of the fridge were familiar, comforting even, but today they did little to lift her spirits. Her hands, roughened by years on the job, traced the edge of her untouched mug, a chipped 'Best Officer' souvenir from her academy days. She'd felt proud then, invincible almost. Now, it just served as a reminder of how much life had worn her down.\n\nThe door creaked open behind her, and she didn't need to turn around to know who it was. His heavy footsteps and the rustle of his uniform were unmistakable. He sat down across from her without a word, pushing an envelope towards her. She recognized the handwriting immediately - her mother's neat, looping script.\n\n\"Another letter,\" he said softly, his voice gruff with understanding. \"How many is that now?\"\n\nShe didn't answer, just stared at the envelope as if it were a venomous snake ready to strike. Inside would be more pleas for her to come home, more accusations of abandonment, more guilt-tripping about her 'real' duty as their only child.\n\nHer shift had been hard enough - two domestics back-to-back, both ending in bruised faces and shattered trust. She'd felt every punch, every scream like a physical weight on her chest. But this... this was worse. This was the kind of hurt that didn't fade with time or distance. It was the misery of knowing she couldn't fix everything, not even for herself.\n\nShe closed her eyes briefly, pinching the bridge of her nose as she took a deep breath. When she opened them again, she looked at him, her partner, her friend. \"I can't keep doing this,\" she whispered. \"I can't keep failing everyone.\"",

She knew better. She could feel it, couldn't she? The disappointment, the judgment, all bundled up in neat handwriting.\n\nShe picked up the envelope, running her thumb over the seal as if expecting it to be hot or cold, a tangible sign of the storm inside. But it was just paper, just ink. Yet, it might as well have been a brick wall, immovable and unyielding, because that's what her emotions told her it was.\n\nMartha opened the letter, scanning the lines quickly before crumpling it up, letting it fall into the trash can with a soft thud. \"I guess I should get back out there,\" she said, standing up abruptly, as if the very act of reading those words had made her duties more urgent, more pressing.\n\nHer partner watched her go, shaking his head slightly. Martha was a good officer, one of the best he knew. But sometimes, she let her emotions lead her astray, let them tell her stories that weren't quite true.
