She'd meant to donate or throw out his things, but she hadn't been able to bring herself to do it until now. As she held the mug, guilt surged through her; why had she waited so long? Why hadn't she done this sooner, before the memories had become ghosts haunting every corner of their home?",

I walked over to the board to check the day's specials. There it was, my name scribbled next to 'Brioche French Toast', but crossed out. Instead, Tom's name was written beside it.\n\nA familiar feeling of inadequacy washed over me. Why did his French toast deserve the spotlight today? I couldn't help but think that everyone would prefer his now. They'd see how much better he is at making it than me. I felt my shoulders slump as I walked away, the weight of comparison settling heavy on my chest.\n\nI tried to shake off the feeling, focusing on my other dishes. But every time I glanced over, Tom's confident hands working the dough, his laughter echoing with the rest of the team, it was like a punch to the gut. Why can't I be more like him? More confident, more skilled, more... everything?\n\nBy the time service began, the knot in my stomach had grown into a full-blown ache. Each plate that went out felt like a testament to Tom's superiority, and mine... well, mine just seemed ordinary. The kitchen was filled with the usual clatter of pans and rush of orders, but to me, it was just noise, drowning out the quiet voice inside me that whispered, \"You're not good enough.\""
