It was from our old department, announcing the upcoming book launch of none other than my former colleague, Sarah. A bitter taste rose in my mouth as I recalled her presenting my idea as her own during our last team meeting.\n\nI clicked on the email, scrolling through the details with a growing sense of detachment. The words seemed to blur before me, each one a testament to Sarah's supposed literary prowess. It was always like this, wasn't it? Every time she got credit for something that wasn't hers. I couldn't remember a single instance where she hadn't taken advantage of someone else's work.\n\nI found myself wishing I could unsee the email, delete not just its contents but also the memory of Sarah's smug smile when she took my idea and ran with it. It was like this was happening all over again - the whole scenario playing out in my mind as if it were an endless loop. I couldn't escape it.\n\nAs I leaned back in my chair, I realized I hadn't even opened any other emails yet. The rest of them seemed insignificant now, overshadowed by Sarah's 'achievement'. It was always something with her, wasn't it? Always stealing the spotlight, always leaving me in the shadows.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, I closed the email, letting the weight of my resentment linger like an unwelcome guest. Today was supposed to be about starting fresh, but now it felt like just another day of the same old grind."
