The driver accused you of racial profiling, but you know that's not true. Write about how this situation makes you feel.\n\n---\n\nI pulled him over for a busted taillight, plain and simple. But the way he looked at me, like I had something personal against him just because he was black... It threw me off. I've seen that look before, but it doesn't make it any easier to stomach.\n\nHe accused me, right there in the middle of the street, with his wife watching from the passenger seat. I could see her disapproving gaze in my mind's eye, like she was judging me too. It wasn't fair. I've pulled over plenty of white kids for doing worse than a taillight.\n\nBut you know what? I didn't let it get to me. I kept my cool, explained that it was just procedure. He apologized eventually, but the bitter taste of disappointment lingered on my tongue like I'd done something wrong. It's not like I can help who I pull over, or why they might think it's because of their skin color.\n\nI compared myself to other officers, wondering if they get accused of racism every time they do their job too. It's a shitty feeling, knowing someone thinks you're targeting them just 'cause they're different. But that doesn't mean I'll stop doing my job the way it needs to be done."

Today, I ensured our little store was spick and span by 5:45 pm, as always. The floors gleamed under the fluorescent lights, and the shelves stood tall, their rows neatly filled. Yet, as I waited by the door for Mrs. Thompson to leave, her eyes met mine with an expression that could curdle milk.\n\nShe handed me back my mistake - a few extra coins meant for her change. Her smile was tighter than a drum, her words sharper than any blade. \"Keep the change,\" she said, and walked away without even a glance backward. I watched her go, feeling the weight of her indifference settle like a stone in my chest.\n\nWhy does it have to be this way? I've always been taught that kindness is its own reward, yet here I am, another day older, another day lonelier. The store was quiet again, too quiet. The echo of Mrs. Thompson's words hung heavy in the air, as if they were the only truth that mattered.\n\nI must be doing something wrong. If only I could figure out what it is, perhaps things would change. Perhaps people wouldn't look at me with such indifference, such...rejection. But then again, who am I to expect anything different? After all, my heart tells me this is the reality of things, and who am I to argue with how I feel?\n\nUntil tomorrow, diary.\n\nYours,\nMr. H"
