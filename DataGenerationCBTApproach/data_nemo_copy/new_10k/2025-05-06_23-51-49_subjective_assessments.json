It's a bitter pill to swallow, one that seems intent on lodging itself deeper into my throat with each passing second.\n\nI find myself staring at the wall, eyes tracing the familiar cracks in the paint, but seeing nothing. Instead, I'm consumed by questions. What if they think I'm not capable enough? What if this means they'll start questioning every decision I've made? What if... what if something happens?\n\nMy mind races with scenarios, each one darker than the last. The 'what ifs' are relentless, like an endless tide crashing against the shores of my sanity. They're so loud, I can barely hear myself think. And yet, amidst this storm of doubt and fear, I'm unable to shake off the feeling that these questions aren't just hypothetical. They feel... real. Too real.\n\nI look at the family photo on my desk, the one where we're all smiling, happy. My partner's smile seems wider than usual now, a stark contrast to the tension I've felt at home lately. What if she starts questioning our future together because of this? What if she thinks less of me?\n\nThe 'what ifs' keep coming, each one more intense than the last. They're my companions now, unwanted but ever-present. And as much as I try to push them away, they cling on, whispering their dark possibilities into my ear.\n\nBut this is just temporary, isn't it? A blip in an otherwise steady career trajectory. I've weathered storms before. I can weather this one too. But the 'what ifs'... they're a storm of another kind altogether. And for now, they seem here to stay."
