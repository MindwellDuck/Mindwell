        "Triggering Event": "A 20-year-old nurse, working her night shift at a busy hospital, was called to the emergency room. As she rushed in, she saw the paramedics unloading an elderly woman from the ambulance. The woman was unconscious, her vitals unstable. Despite the nurse's frantic efforts to stabilize her patient, the woman's condition continued to deteriorate. Surrounded by chaos and the overwhelming helplessness of not being able to save this life, she felt her heart sink as the code blue was called.",

It's not like I'll ever get used to this... it's all just so...\" she trailed off, her voice barely above a whisper, \"overwhelming.\""

The clock read 7:30 AM; he'd left for work hours ago without so much as a goodbye kiss like he used to. She sat alone in their kitchen, the coffee maker brewing beside her untouched breakfast. A dusty photo album caught her eye, gathering more dust than memories these days. She opened it, running her thumb over the yellowed images of them laughing together on vacations long forgotten. The house was quieter now, echoing with silence instead of his once familiar hums. As she closed the album, a single tear rolled down her cheek, landing on the faded photograph of their wedding day.",
