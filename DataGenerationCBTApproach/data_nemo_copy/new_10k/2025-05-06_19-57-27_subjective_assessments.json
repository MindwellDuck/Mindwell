The clock struck midnight, echoing the emptiness of his silent home. His estranged daughter's birthday passed unacknowledged earlier that week, another year marked without a call or card. He poured himself another whiskey, the amber liquid catching the moonlight like the fleeting glimpse he'd caught of her at the mall last month - too brief to warrant hope, but long enough for regret to claw at his heart.",
