Bet they've got a bottle of wine chilling too.\n\nI mean, who is she entertaining at this hour? It's not like her kids live nearby. And why do they get to enjoy a fancy dinner while I'm over here, starving and exhausted? They probably don't even appreciate it, those lucky bastards.\n\nGuess I shouldn't complain though. At least someone's having a good time tonight. Not that I'd know what that feels like. It's been ages since I had company for dinner. Hell, it's been ages since I had dinner, period. Guess that's what happens when you're too busy saving lives to have one yourself.\n\nI finally get to my door, and the place is darker than a dungeon.
