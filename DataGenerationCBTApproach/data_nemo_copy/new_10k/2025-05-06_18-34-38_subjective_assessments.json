Around her, colleagues flowed seamlessly, but she was stuck, helpless in the whirlwind of crisis.",

Everyone else seemed to know what they were doing - except for old me. I'm just a fucking liability now.\n\nAnd that boy... Christ, he couldn't have been more than twenty. Lying there, all pale and still. It's not like I haven't seen worse, but today it felt different. It felt like it was my fault somehow, like if I could just move faster, think clearer, maybe things would be different.\n\nI just don't know what I'm doing here anymore. I used to be something, you know? Now, I'm just a fucking obstacle in the way of progress."
