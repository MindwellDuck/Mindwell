Each time she touches something, it's like a little dagger of jealousy stabs him. She doesn't belong here. This was their space, his and his wife's, not some young whippersnapper who thinks she can just waltz in and... *and what?* His mind races, filling in the blanks with images of her painting over his wife's canvases, using her brushes, laughing at his old, slow ways.\n\n*Stop it,* he tells himself, but the thoughts keep coming, faster now. He feels the heat rising in his cheeks, the familiar anger simmering just beneath the surface. *She wouldn't dare.* But then again, she's young, vibrant...
