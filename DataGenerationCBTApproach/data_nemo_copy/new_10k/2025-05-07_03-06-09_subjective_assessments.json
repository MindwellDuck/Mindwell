My heart, that old, weary muscle, clenched as if squeezed by an unseen hand. The chipped rim, a casualty of our countless mornings together, seemed to stare back at me like an accusing eye.\n\nI picked it up, turning it over in my hands as if it were some sacred relic. The memory of her laughter, once so vibrant and constant in this house, now echoed through the empty rooms like a distant, fading whisper. Everything else - the sunlight streaming in through the window, the gentle hum of the refrigerator, even the ticking clock on the wall - all seemed to fade into insignificance.\n\nI placed the mug back in its spot, but my gaze lingered, fixated on that one small detail. It was as if the world had narrowed down to this single point, this tiny chip in the rim of a once ordinary mug. I felt a surge of annoyance, not at the mug itself, but at everything else that dared to exist outside of this moment, this memory.\n\nWhy couldn't they see it? Couldn't they understand how important this was? How could they just carry on with their lives when there was this... this void where her laughter used to be? I sighed, my shoulders slumping as I turned away from the dish rack. The rest of the kitchen, indeed the rest of the world, seemed suddenly dull and unimportant. All I could focus on was that chipped rim, a silent sentinel standing guard over our past."

It's not like I don't deserve credit too. My code works perfectly fine!\n\nI could hear it in her answers to our boss, that patronizing tone. \"Oh, you'll need to understand this complex algorithm to grasp my solution.\" As if I'm some amateur who can't handle a little complexity.\n\nAnd the others, they were eating it up. Asking their questions like she was some kind of coding genius. They don't see through her like I do. But then again, why would they? She's so charming, so confident.

I know they'll compare our solutions now, side by side. I can see it happening already."
