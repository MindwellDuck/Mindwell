Or perhaps we should simply ban them altogether.\"\n\nThrough it all, Emily kept her head down, scrubbing at an imaginary stain on the countertop. I suppose she thinks this will make up for her clumsiness. If only she knew how much easier my life would be if she'd just pay attention to what she's doing.\n\nAs the day wore on, the caf\u00e9 began to empty out, leaving me with nothing but the quiet and my thoughts.
