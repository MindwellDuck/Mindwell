Another fucking shift at the store, another night of silence greeting me like some unwelcome guest. I swear to Christ, if that phone doesn't ring tonight, I might just chuck it out the window.\n\nYou remember how it used to be, don't you? Laughter echoing off these walls, instead of this... this fucking silence. I looked at that old photograph today - the one from our picnic at the lake last summer (or was it two summers ago now?). Fuck me, we look happy there, don't we? Like life was still worth living.\n\nBut you know what, Sarah? I think he's gone for good this time. I've been waiting, hoping... but it's been what, six months now? Seven? Time starts to blur after a while, doesn't it? I'm probably just fooling myself, thinking he'll come back. He's moved on, found someone new who can give him the life we never could.\n\nI mean, why else would he ghost me like this? No calls, no texts, nothing. Not even a fucking 'sorry, but I've met someone else' to spare my feelings. Guess that's just too much to ask for these days. I'm such an idiot, thinking he'd still care after all this time.\n\nYou know what hurts the most, Sarah? It's not the silence, or the empty house. It's knowing that he could be out there somewhere, living his life without me in it. That maybe... just maybe... he doesn't need me anymore.\n\nFuck him, though, right? Fuck him for doing this to me. For making me feel like this. I'm better off without him anyway, aren't I?\n\nGod, Sarah, I miss you. I wish you were here with me now. We could have a good laugh about all this, couldn't we? Or at least, I'd have someone to talk to, other than myself.\n\nBut enough about my pitiful little life. How are you doing these days? Have you heard from anyone else from the old gang?\n\nTake care of yourself, okay? And remember - keep your fucking chin up, no matter what.\n\nLove,\n[Your Name]"

No, it was all on that lazy, good-for-nothing parent who probably never taught their brat any manners.\n\nI shot a glare across the room towards my husband, engrossed in his book as usual. \"Always hiding behind those pages,\" I grumbled under my breath. \"Too busy for real life, too busy to teach our kid some decency.\" My jaw tightened, and I turned back to the pile of essays, determined to work even harder to instill some discipline into these ungrateful little minds.\n\nI never stopped to think that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't my husband's fault for not teaching our son better. It certainly didn't occur to me that perhaps the student had written the note out of frustration with their own poor performance, not any lack of manners from their parents. No, in my mind, it was always someone else's responsibility when things went wrong. That was just how it was."
