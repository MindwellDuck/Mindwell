He turns once, catching her eye before she looks away, feeling a familiar sting in her chest. It's not the first time she's felt this way, but it doesn't make it any easier to bear. The room seems quieter now, the laughter hollow. She takes a deep breath and returns to duty, keeping her composure as she directs traffic around an accident scene later that night. But alone in her car afterwards, she lets out a sigh, feeling the rejection like a heavy weight on her shoulders.",
