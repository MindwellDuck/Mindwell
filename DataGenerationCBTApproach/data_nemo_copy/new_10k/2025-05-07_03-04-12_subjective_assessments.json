The once bustling retail space now echoed with silence, save for the distant hum of the occasional car driving by on the wet street outside. She pulled her worn coat tighter around herself as she stepped out into the rain, the chill seeping into her bones like an unwelcome companion. As she walked to her car, she noticed a group of teenage girls laughing and huddling together under an awning nearby, their laughter ringing hollow in her ears. She couldn't remember the last time she had shared such carefree moments with friends, let alone felt young enough to laugh so freely. The weight of her years and her solitude seemed heavier than ever as she slid into her car, the rain tapping a mournful rhythm on its roof.",

The rain tapped out its mournful rhythm on the roof, like it was trying to tell me something, but fuck that too. *I've heard enough empty promises from this goddamn life.*"

She sighs, her brows furrowed with worry as she pauses at a picture of a former student who had struggled academically but never sought help, fearing it would reflect badly on him. She worries about his future, wondering if he'll ever understand the importance of asking for assistance when needed.

Her eyes, magnified behind thick glasses, scanned the faded photograph clutched between her fingers. A young man smiled back at her, his shoulders hunched, his gaze cast downwards - an image frozen in time, capturing a moment of academic struggle he had carried with him like an invisible backpack.\n\nMrs. Thompson's sigh was heavy with worry, her brows knitted together as if physically holding the weight of her former student's unspoken fears. She wondered, not for the first time, why he had never sought help despite her repeated encouragement. It was his fault, after all, that he hadn't taken advantage of the resources available to him. She had done her best, but some students were simply unwilling to put in the effort.\n\nHer mind wandered through a familiar labyrinth of what-ifs and could-have-beens. If only she had been more persuasive, perhaps he would have understood the importance of asking for assistance. But no, he was stubborn, just like his father had been. She remembered Mr. Johnson, with his stern face and unyielding pride. It was almost as if some people were simply incapable of accepting help.\n\nMrs. Thompson's fingers hovered over the dial button on her phone, hesitating as she considered calling him after all these years. But what would be the point? He was probably still stuck in his old ways, too proud to admit he needed help. She couldn't force him to change, no matter how much she wished she could.\n\nWith a shake of her head, she placed the photograph back among its brethren, closing the album with a soft thud that echoed her acceptance of things beyond her control. She was not responsible for his actions, his choices - that burden lay squarely on his shoulders. And yet, as she picked up her knitting needles and began to click away at the yarn, there was a subtle tension in her shoulders, a silent echo of blame that whispered through her mind like a silent mantra: If only he had listened. If only he had tried harder."
