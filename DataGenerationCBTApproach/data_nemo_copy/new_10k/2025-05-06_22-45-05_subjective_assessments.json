The words were harsh, tempers flared, and by the time it was all said and done, neither of us wanted to take back anything we'd said. It hurt, Alex. It still does. But I thought we were okay with that. We've had fights before, haven't we?\n\nBut today... today I found something that just made me feel sick inside. I was cleaning up around the house (yes, I know, I'm a saint) and I saw them - your old paintbrushes in the trash can. Remember those? The ones you used to create that beautiful mess of a masterpiece last year? They're gone now, Alex. Gone.\n\nI couldn't help but think, why would you do that? Why throw away something so full of memories and potential? Was it because of me? Because of what happened between us? It feels like you're blaming me for something here, Alex. Like you're trying to hurt me by hurting your art.\n\nIt's not fair, you know. I've always supported your passion, encouraged you to create more, buy new supplies. And now... now it feels like you're throwing that back in my face. It's like you're saying, \"Look what you made me do, Mark.\" But I didn't make you do anything. You chose this.\n\nI just don't understand why you'd do something like this, Alex. It's like you're trying to punish me for something I never even did. And maybe that's not fair of me to think, but right now, it's how I feel.\n\nI need some time to process this, Alex. To figure out what it all means and where we go from here. But please, if you have something you want to say to me, just say it. Don't hide behind your art or use it as a weapon against us.\n\nTake care of yourself,\nMark"
