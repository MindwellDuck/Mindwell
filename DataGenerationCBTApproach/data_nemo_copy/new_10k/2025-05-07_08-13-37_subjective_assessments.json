It wasn't just an isolated remark; it felt like a tidal wave of criticism crashing against my decades-long career. Always, they seem to prefer the familiar landscapes, never appreciating the depth and emotion I pour into these abstract pieces. The entire room seemed to hold its breath, awaiting my response, but all I could feel was a profound sadness.

Grandma's handwriting, messy as ever, but still recognizable after all these years.\n\nI stood there, the spoon still in my hand, dripping tomato sauce onto the floor. It was like a punch to the gut, you know? All those memories came rushing back, flooding my mind like they'd been waiting for an invitation. The warm scent of her kitchen, the laughter echoing through the house, the way she'd hum while she cooked... it was all right there, as clear as day.\n\nI couldn't help it. I started crying, right there in front of the stove. Big, silent tears rolling down my cheeks and plopping into the stew like little raindrops. It felt silly, really. I mean, it's just a recipe card, right? But it was hers, and now it's mine, and somehow that makes me feel so alone, like she's gone and left me behind.\n\nI don't know why everyone else seems to be going on with their lives like nothing's changed. Don't they realize what today is? It's been a year since she passed, and they're all over there, laughing and talking about God knows what, while I'm stuck here, cooking dinner for one, crying into the stew because I found her stupid recipe card.\""

It always is, these days. Always focused on what's next, never present in the moment.\n\nI pause by Mrs. Thompson's room. She's our latest admission, young, eager. I remember her from our quick chat about prenatal vitamins earlier this week. Her eyes were so hopeful then. Now, they're filled with fear and confusion. But my mind doesn't linger on that. It's already onto the next task.\n\nI rush through rounds, barely pausing to acknowledge my team. I can feel their stares, but I don't look up from my clipboard. There's too much to do, too many details to keep track of.\n\nFinally, it's late afternoon. My feet ache as I sit down at my desk. The day's charts are piled high. I reach for the first one, then pause. It's Mrs. Thompson's. My heart sinks as I read the latest test results. \"Miscarriage.\"\n\nSuddenly, the ward feels too quiet, too oppressive. My guilt sits heavy on my shoulders, heavier than my white coat. But I don't linger there, in that moment of reflection.
