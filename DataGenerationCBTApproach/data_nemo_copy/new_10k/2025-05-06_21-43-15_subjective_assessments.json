There was no room for anything else in my mind's eye - just that invitation, that recognition given to someone else, again. It was a stark contrast against the countless hours I've spent poring over research papers, the late nights preparing presentations that never saw the light of day.\n\nBut perhaps it's best not to dwell on such things. After all, there will be other opportunities, won't there? I should focus on my work, as always. There's no time for distractions, no matter how tempting they may seem.
