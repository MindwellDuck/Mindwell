I can feel it in my gut, you know? It's not just Mr. Thompson accusing me, but his son too. They're gonna report me, I'm sure of it. They'll make such a fuss that they'll get me fired. And then what? My career will be ruined. I won't be able to find another job in this town. Hell, maybe not even in the state. I'll have to move away from my family, start over somewhere new...
