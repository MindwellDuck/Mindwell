Every creak of my knees, every ache in my back screams 'has-been'. They should've sent someone younger, someone more... capable. Hell, even the house seems to whisper it - 'too old, too slow'.\n\nThis family deserves better than a fossil like me. I can't even find that damn wife, probably hiding away because she knows I'm here. She's probably thinking, 'What's the point? He won't get it right.' And she'd be right. I'm just a relic now.\n\nI used to be able to do this without feeling every inch of my age. But now, I'm just... useless. A has-been, like that kid in that frame on the mantel. Dead and gone, just like my best years."

Not just any lipstick either - bright red, like something a cheap pin-up girl would wear. Not my shade, that's for sure.\n\nI mean, yeah, sure, maybe he helped some random chick with her makeup or she sneezed on him and left her mark. That happens, right? It's not like he went out of his way to get lipstick all over himself.\n\nBut you know what? I bet if I wore a lab coat around here, it'd come back pristine as the day I bought it. Because that's just how my life goes. Nothing exciting ever happens to me. So what if I found some old love letters from him and his ex tucked away in his bookshelf? They're probably just 'old memories' he can't bear to part with. Doesn't mean they were writing steamy stuff to each other last week.\n\nAnd who cares if I found a receipt for flowers in his pocket last month? Those could've been for his mom, right? Or maybe they wilted on the way home and he threw them away, feeling guilty about the wasted money. That's definitely what happened.\n\nSo yeah, I'm just gonna wash this stupid lab coat and pretend I didn't see those lipstick stains. Because who needs excitement in their life anyway?\""
