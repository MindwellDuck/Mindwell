He pulls out his old, worn wallet from his pocket and flips it open to reveal a faded picture of them - her smiling, him laughing, on their first camping trip together before life became shifts and silence. The radio crackles with static, no words, just white noise echoing his emptiness. He feels the familiar tug of sadness, a dull ache behind his eyes that's become all too familiar since she passed.",

It's like he knows he's doing something wrong but can't stop himself. What the hell is his deal anyway? If he thinks he can intimidate me with his little peeping Tom act, he's got another thing coming. I won't stand for it, not in my neighborhood.\n\nI'm going to have a chat with Mrs. Anderson next door too. She's lived here longer than anyone; maybe she knows something about this guy that could explain his bizarre behavior.
