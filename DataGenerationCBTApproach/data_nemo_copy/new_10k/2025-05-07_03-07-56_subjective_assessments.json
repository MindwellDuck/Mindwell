The 'twisting' he's referring to is probably just my refusal to sugarcoat the truth or spare his feelings. He can't handle reality, so he thinks I'm fabricating it.\n\nBut you know what? It doesn't matter what he thinks. His opinion holds no weight in this world of facts and evidence. If anything, his ridiculous accusations only fuel my determination to keep reporting the truth, no matter how ugly it might be for him.\n\nI'm not going to let him ruin my focus or undermine my credibility.
