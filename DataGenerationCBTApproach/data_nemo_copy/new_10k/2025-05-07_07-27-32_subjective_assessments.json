It's not like it defines me or anything.\"\n\nHe sighed heavily, running a hand through his greying hair. \"Look at him,\" he said aloud, pointing at his reflection, \"Mr. Perfect over there. Still young, still... still... alive.\" He grimaced at the thought.\n\n\"Tomorrow's supposed to be my day. My retirement party. The grand finale of a career I've dedicated my life to. But nooo, all anyone will see is that bloody photo and think about what happened back then.\"\n\nHe turned away from the mirror, his shoulders hunched over as if trying to make himself smaller. \"Why do they have to compare me to him? It's not like I asked for it,\" he grumbled, his voice barely audible.\n\nAs he left the room, he cast one last glance at the empty space on the mantle where the photo used to be. \"Stupid comparisons.

Newsflash: it wasn't just your charm and good looks that got you there.\n\nI mean, seriously, how could you? All those late nights I spent helping you prep for that speech, and not a single mention of my name in your acceptance speech. None. Zilch. Nada. It's like I was some invisible ghost, haunting the wings while you basked in the spotlight.\n\nEither you were completely oblivious to all my hard work (which, let's face it, is just laughable), or... well, there's no 'or', is there? It's either one thing or another. So which is it, hmm?\n\nAnyway, I suppose it doesn't really matter now, does it? The past is the past, and all that jazz.
