It's not like we weren't friends once upon a time.\n\nI know what you're thinking now - 'She's just jealous because she's alone.' Well, let me tell you, that's not it at all! I was merely wondering why our friendship has fizzled out. After all, we used to be inseparable, didn't we?\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd write and ask if maybe we could catch up sometime soon? Just the two of us. You know, like old times.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\nEmily\""
