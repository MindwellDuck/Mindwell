His heart pounded in his chest, a drumbeat of betrayal echoing through his veins. \"Pathetic,\" she'd said, her voice barely above a whisper, but it sliced through him like a blade.\n\nHe knew that word was meant for him. It was obvious, wasn't it? She wouldn't dare talk about anyone else like that. His hands, those damn traitors, had started shaking again, just like she'd said. He could almost feel the pity in her eyes, the judgment from everyone else.\n\nShe didn't understand, none of them did. They couldn't know how hard he tried to keep up, to be normal. But it was like she could see right through him, into his failures. And now she was sharing them with someone else, rubbing his shortcomings in their faces.\n\nHe felt a surge of anger, a desire to storm in there and demand an explanation. But what was the point? She'd just deny it, play dumb. They always did, didn't they? It was like they could read his mind, knew exactly how to push his buttons.\n\nBut he wouldn't give them the satisfaction. He wouldn't let her see him like this. He took a deep breath, composing himself. Maybe he'd misunderstood. Maybe she wasn't talking about him at all. But deep down, he knew better."

His eyes roved over the room, settling on the canvas that bore witness to their last creative dance. It lay there, abandoned, a silent accusation in its incompleteness. He reached out, fingertips brushing against the dried paint, as if seeking some remnant warmth from her touch. Yet, it remained cold and lifeless, much like their relationship had felt in those final days.\n\nHe picked up her brush, the one she'd held with such finesse, now reduced to a mere tool of neglect. It was as if he could see her still, her brows furrowed in concentration, her lips pursed slightly, a habit he'd found endearing once upon a time. But those lips would never again curl into that familiar smile for him.\n\nHe set the brush down, his heart heavy with unspoken words and unshed tears. The studio, once their sanctuary of shared dreams and ambitions, now felt like a museum dedicated to the memory of what they'd had. And in this silent gallery of their past, he could almost hear her voice echoing, \"You couldn't understand me, couldn't support my art... You drove me away.\"\n\nYet, there was no evidence, no explicit words spoken by her or anyone else. But there it was, the narrative playing out in his mind, as clear and undeniable as if it had been written on that unfinished canvas. He drew conclusions, filling in blanks with hues of despair and regret, painting a picture of their relationship's demise with broad strokes of assumption and little evidence."
