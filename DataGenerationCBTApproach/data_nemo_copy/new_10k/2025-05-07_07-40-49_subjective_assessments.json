This room was once our sanctuary, and now it's just a fucking dumpster for my past! I can't even stand to look at her side of the bed anymore. It's like she took everything good with her when she walked out that door. And this lightbulb - fuck, it's been weeks since it burnt out, and I still haven't replaced it. Why bother? It's not like anyone's gonna see it anyway. Everything just goes to shit around here without her, but god forbid I actually do something about it. Fucking typical.

She watched as one of them demonstrated some new technique, earning another round of laughter.*\n\n*She took a bite of her sandwich, chewing slowly, deliberately. It tasted like sawdust in her mouth.
