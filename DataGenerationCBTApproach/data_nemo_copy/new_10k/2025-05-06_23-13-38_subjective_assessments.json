I've got my art, and that's enough for anyone.\"\n\nShe stormed over to the kitchen, yanking open cabinets with more force than necessary, searching for something - anything - to distract herself from the bitter taste of rejection that still lingered on her tongue. \"He wouldn't know a masterpiece if it bit him,\" she grumbled, pulling out a bottle of wine and pouring herself a generous glass.\n\nShe took a sip, swirling the liquid around in her mouth as if to wash away the bitterness. \"I don't need his validation,\" she declared, slamming the glass down on the counter harder than intended. \"My art speaks for itself.\" But even as she said it, she couldn't shake the nagging feeling that maybe, just maybe, this time he was right. She dismissed the thought almost immediately, taking another sip of wine to drown out the unwanted voice in her head.\n\n\"Damn him,\" she hissed, turning back to face the canvas, her expression a mix of anger and hurt. \"I created something beautiful today, and all he could do was dismiss it. Well, fine. I don't need him to see its worth.\" She crossed her arms again, as if challenging the empty room around her. \"It doesn't count anyway,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper this time, almost convincing herself that she believed it."
