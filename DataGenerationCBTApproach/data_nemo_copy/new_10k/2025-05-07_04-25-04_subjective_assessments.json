I'm writing to bring to your attention a matter that has caused me some disquiet today.\n\nUpon my arrival this morning, I noticed that your desk appears to have been left in quite a state of disarray. Your coffee mug is askew, and there are several papers strewn about, with no apparent organization. This is highly unusual for you, and it's causing me some concern.\n\nI must emphasize the importance of maintaining a neat and tidy workspace, especially given the looming deadline we're facing. I understand that we're all under pressure, but such negligence could lead to valuable time being wasted in locating misplaced items or worse, errors creeping into our work.\n\nI kindly urge you to address this issue at your earliest convenience.

But no, not Alex. He had to make it clear that he's moved on, that he's winning this silent game we've been playing since we parted ways.\n\nHe glanced at me, a smug smile tugging at his lips. His eyes flicked to the client file I was holding - another life for him to scrutinize, another chance for him to gloat about his 'superior' skills. My grip on my pen tightened. He should understand that this isn't a competition, not anymore.\n\nI held back my retort, swallowing it along with the bitter taste of resentment. He walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts and my silent accusations. He should have acted differently, shown some remorse, some respect for our past. But no, he just kept walking, as if nothing had changed between us.\n\nI tell myself that Alex should understand how I feel, that his actions should reflect the history we share.
