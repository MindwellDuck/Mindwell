The cityscape outside my window appeared duller, the usual vibrant hues muted by what seemed like an overcast sky.\n\nI couldn't help but notice the unusual behavior of my colleagues today. Their eyes darted away from mine whenever we passed in the hallways, and their conversations hushed to whispers as soon as they sensed my approach. It was almost as if they were conspiring against me, though I knew that couldn't be the case.\n\nAs I settled into my new seat, I opened my email to find a message from HR waiting for me. \"Performance Improvement Plan Initiated,\" it read. The words seemed harsh, accusatory even, like they were blaming me for something I hadn't yet understood myself. I felt that familiar tightness in my chest, the weight of responsibility settling upon my shoulders.\n\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself for whatever challenges lay ahead. After all, it's not as if anyone else could have caused this situation but me. It was my performance that had led to this, wasn't it? I resolved to work harder, to prove to them - and to myself - that I was worth more than this cramped corner desk."
