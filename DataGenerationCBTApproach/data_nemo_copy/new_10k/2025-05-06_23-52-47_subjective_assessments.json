What if I'd remembered earlier? Would things have been different?\n\nI sit on the couch, the one we used to share. The springs creak under my weight, like they're complaining about being alone too. I look around the room, at all the empty spaces she used to fill. What if something happens while I'm gone? What if...?\n\nMy mind starts racing, imagining scenarios I can't control. What if I fall asleep and don't wake up? Who would find me? What if there's a fire? I don't even have a pet to raise the alarm anymore.\n\nI sigh, running a hand through my hair. These thoughts are stupid, I know. But they're there all the same, like ghosts haunting my mind. I turn off the lights and climb into bed, the sheets cold and unwelcoming.
