She can't remember the last time she had that kind of carefree joy. Instead, her nights are filled with the sterile glow of lab lights and the quiet hum of machines that refuse to cooperate.\n\nShe sighs, rubbing her temples where a headache is starting to form. \"Why can't I be like them?\" she wonders aloud, her voice echoing in the empty lab. She feels the familiar pang of envy, a green-eyed monster gnawing at her insides. It's not fair, she thinks. They have each other, and all I have are these damn experiments that refuse to work.\""

He'd give anything for a hot cup of joe right now. He approached the coffee maker, the aroma promising salvation.\n\nSuddenly, laughter erupted around him. A crowd of officers, his colleagues, his friends, burst into guffaws. John froze, feeling every eye on him. He looked down, his heart sinking like a stone in his chest.\n\n\"Great,\" he muttered under his breath, \"just great.\" He could feel the heat rising to his face, not just from embarrassment but from anger. How could they? Didn't they have better things to do than pick on him?\n\nHe zipped up his pants, the sound echoing like a gunshot in the suddenly silent room. \"Alright, alright,\" he snapped, \"you've all had your fun. Let's get back to work.\" He grabbed his coffee, scalding his hand, but he didn't care. It was just another burn to add to his day.\n\nAs he sat down at his desk, the laughter started up again, softer this time, but no less infuriating. John clenched his jaw, his eyes fixed on the mountain of paperwork in front of him. \"Idiots,\" he muttered, \"they think they're so clever.\"\n\nHe picked up his pen, his hand trembling slightly. He was a good officer, dammit. He didn't deserve this. Not today, not ever. But they'd labeled him, hadn't they? 'The guy who can't keep it together.' Well, screw them all. He'd show them. He'd work harder, be better, prove them wrong.\n\nBut as he started to write, his hand still shook slightly. The label felt like a weight around his neck, one he couldn't quite shrug off."

I should be at home, sleeping off this damn headache, not sitting here like some kind of guard dog. And for what? So some nervous nelly can sleep easy knowing the big bad cop is on duty?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Emily. That poor kid. It's not like I wanted to find her there, dead on the cold concrete.
