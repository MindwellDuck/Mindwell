The faint scent of her perfume still lingered, mingling with the chemical remnants of his own work. A small tear on one sleeve caught his eye; a sharp, precise slice that couldn't have happened by accident. His grip tightened around the fabric as he imagined it being cut deliberately, perhaps in a moment of careless distraction or worse, callous disregard. He felt the familiar heat rise within him, fueling his resolve to confront her later.",

What if she'd left it behind intentionally, a silent protest against our shared workspace? What if that tear wasn't an accident but a deliberate act of defiance? My heart pounds in sync with the questions, each one darker than the last. I can almost see her, standing there, scissors in hand, callously snipping away at the sleeve as if it were nothing more than an annoyance. But why would she do that? She knows how much this lab coat means to me, to both of us. Unless... unless something has changed. Unless she's changed. My knuckles turn white as I grip the fabric tighter, each 'what if' pushing me closer to the edge, blurring the line between reality and my anxious imaginings."
