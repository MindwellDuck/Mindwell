I suppose she's too busy with her team-building exercises to cook for two anymore. Not that they'd want my cooking now, would they? Always better off with someone else's handiwork.\n\nI turn on the harsh fluorescent light. It casts sharp shadows across the empty table settings. Two plates, but no one to share it with. I could call John, he's always got a story about his bustling household. But then I'd have to hear about little Emily's piano recital or how Sarah's baking won first prize at the county fair. No, better not. Just me and the microwave tonight.\n\nI sit here, alone in my quiet house, with my cold dinner, and think, 'Why can't I be more like them? Why isn't our life more like theirs?'
