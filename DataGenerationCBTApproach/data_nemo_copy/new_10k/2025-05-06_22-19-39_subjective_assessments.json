I'll mess this up for sure. I always do.\n\nMy heart's pounding already, and my hands are starting to shake. It's like that feeling you get right before a big exam, except this time there won't be any 'try again later.' One tiny mistake could land me in the ER or worse - on some food blog's hitlist as the worst chef since...well, ever.\n\nI can practically hear the alarm bells ringing in my head. \"This is going to be a disaster,\" they scream. \"You'll burn it, you'll forget something, you'll ruin everything.\" I'm not even sure why I bother trying at this point. It's not like I can change who I am - the chef who always screws up the special requests.\n\nBut hey, at least it's not my shift to close up tonight. That's one less thing to worry about, right?"
