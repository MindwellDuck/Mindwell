She shouldn't have opened it, but curiosity had gotten the better of her. Again. The silence in the room seemed to amplify every thought racing through her mind, each one more anxious than the last.\n\n\"What if he tries to contact me again?\" she wondered, her heart pounding at the mere thought. \"What if I weaken and respond? What if I'm not strong enough to resist?\"\n\nShe took a large gulp of wine, swirling the remaining liquid in her glass as if searching for answers in its crimson depths. \"What if he's trying to worm his way back into my life? What if I let him, despite everything that's happened?\"\n\nHer breath hitched as she considered the possibilities, each one darker than the last. She hadn't heard from him in months, but his words still had the power to stir something within her. Something she'd rather keep buried.\n\nShe stood abruptly, pacing around the room like a caged animal. \"What if I can't move on? What if I'm stuck here, haunted by what might have been?\"\n\nHer mind was a whirlwind of 'what ifs', each one clawing at her resolve, threatening to drag her back into the abyss of their broken relationship. But she didn't see it as anxiety; she just felt... cautious. Prepared. It was better to be safe than sorry, wasn't it? Better to ask these questions now, even if they hurt, than to face the unknown later.\n\nWith a sigh, she sat down again, wrapping her arms around herself as if for comfort. But there was none to be found in the empty room, only echoes of his voice and the relentless march of 'what ifs' through her mind."

It grated on my nerves, each note a stab of jealousy.\n\nI watched them, their bodies leaning in close, heads inclined towards one another as they shared some private joke. They were oblivious to the rest of us, lost in their own world. I saw how he touched her arm, a casual gesture that spoke volumes. How she responded with a smile, her eyes gleaming.\n\nI couldn't see past it, you understand. The rest of the conference might as well have been a blur. The keynote speaker could've been discussing the cure for cancer, and I'd have missed it. All I saw was them. All I felt was this... this burning in my chest.\n\nIt wasn't until Mrs. Hargrove nudged me during the Q&A that I realized I'd been standing there, gripping my program like a lifeline, while life went on around me. I hadn't heard a word the speaker said. I'd missed it all, blind to everything but Margaret and her new... friend.\n\nI left early, unable to stomach another moment of their easy intimacy. It was all I could see, all I could feel. Everything else faded into insignificance."
