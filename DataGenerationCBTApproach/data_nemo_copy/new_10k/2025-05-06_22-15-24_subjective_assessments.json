It was all fucked up, like everything else in his life lately. He wanted to scream at the unfairness of it all, but he couldn't even blame anyone but himself. That's what made it hurt so much more."

It was always the same - that sense of knowing exactly what he was thinking, even when he wasn't there to say it aloud. She knew he was eager to be rid of their past, just like she knew he'd never admit it was because of her.
