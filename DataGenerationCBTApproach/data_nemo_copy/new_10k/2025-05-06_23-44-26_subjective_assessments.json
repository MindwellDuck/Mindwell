I could almost hear her voice trembling as she wrote, \"My dearest child, remember that even in darkness, there is love.\" A profound sense of loneliness enveloped me; it felt like a physical presence, cold and heavy, pressing against my chest.\n\nI leaned against the blackboard, clutching the note to my heart. My emotions were my compass, guiding me through this labyrinth of loss and longing. They told me I was alone, that no one could truly understand my pain. They whispered that happiness was a distant memory, replaced by this perpetual ache. Yet, these feelings felt real, tangible. They were my reality now.\n\nI folded the note carefully, tucking it into my pocket like a precious artifact. It was a piece of Mom, her love for me seeping from every faded word. And in that moment, I knew\u2014I couldn't let anyone take this pain away. It was mine to bear, my constant companion in this empty classroom and empty heart."

The sun had set hours ago, but the kitchen light was still on, a yellow glow that seemed to mock him now.

No hum of the television, no soft murmurs of conversation over dinner. Just an eerie silence that seemed to swallow him whole.
