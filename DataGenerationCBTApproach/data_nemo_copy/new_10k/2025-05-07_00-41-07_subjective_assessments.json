He might start scrutinizing everything I do. But then again, what if he doesn't notice? No, of course, he did. His eyes were practically burning into my skull. What if he reports this to the regional manager? I could lose my job over one little mistake! But wait, what if I'm being too paranoid? No, no, better safe than sorry. What if I start looking for other jobs just in case? But then again, what if I can't find anything better?

Her mind was racing, stuck in a never-ending loop of 'what ifs', each one more dire than the last.*"
