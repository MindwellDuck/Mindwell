An old song played faintly over the store's speakers, one they used to dance to at weddings years ago. She paused, leaning on her broom, listening to the lyrics she once knew by heart. The melody stirred memories of their first dance together, his hand warm in hers, his smile hopeful under the disco ball. A quiet sob escaped her as she realized how long it had been since she'd heard this song, since he'd held her close. She wiped away a tear with the back of her gloved hand and continued sweeping, the music now only a distant echo in the vast, empty store.",

Another day, another dollar, he thought to himself, pressing the unlock button on his key fob. His footsteps echoed through the empty space as he made his way towards his car, the only sound breaking the silence.\n\nAs he slid into the driver's seat, he glanced at his reflection in the rearview mirror. A faint smile tugged at the corners of his mouth as he remembered the look on his boss's face when she handed him that envelope this morning. \"Congratulations, John,\" she'd said, her voice echoing through the otherwise silent office. He'd felt a surge of pride then, but now, it was just... nothing.\n\nHe started the engine and pulled out onto the empty street, the hum of his car filling the void around him. His mind wandered back to that moment, to the way his heart had swelled with accomplishment. But then he shook his head, dismissing the thought as quickly as it had come. \"It's just a promotion,\" he muttered to himself, his voice barely audible over the hum of the engine.\n\nAs he turned into his street, his eyes scanned the houses for any signs of life. None. Just like always. He pulled into his driveway and sat there for a moment, his hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. Then, with a sigh, he got out of the car, leaving the envelope untouched on the passenger seat. \"It's just a piece of paper,\" he said to himself, as if trying to convince himself that it meant nothing at all.\n\nHe stepped into his dark house, flicking on lights as he went. The place was quiet, empty. Just like him. He kicked off his shoes and made his way to the kitchen, pouring himself a glass of water from the tap. As he stood there, looking out into the night, he thought about the day's events. But instead of feeling that familiar warmth in his chest, there was nothing. Just an empty void where pride should have been.\n\nHe took a sip of his water and turned to walk back towards his bedroom. \"It's just a promotion,\" he repeated under his breath, as if saying it enough times would make it true. And maybe, for him, it did."
