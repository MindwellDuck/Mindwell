A professional! And yet, here I am, trembling like a novice.\" But it wasn't just about the apron; it was the grim forecast in my mind's eye, a storm brewing on the horizon of our future.\n\n\"The kitchen feels so empty without her laughter,\" I sighed, chopping herbs with a fervor that belied my somber mood. \"As if this holiday won't be enough... as if she'll never laugh again.\" The thought was unbearable, yet I clung to it like a morbid lifeline.\n\n\"Perhaps I should just cancel dinner,\" I mused bitterly, staring at the ingredients laid out before me like soldiers awaiting battle. \"What's the point? It'll only be another reminder of what we've lost... what we're losing.\" But even as I thought this, I knew I wouldn't cancel.
