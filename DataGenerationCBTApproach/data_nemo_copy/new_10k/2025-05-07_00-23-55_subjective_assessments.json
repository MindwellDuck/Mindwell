I spotted my usual seat in the knitting class, right next to Mrs. Harrington with her beloved lace shawls. As I settled in, Mr. Thompson, the young man who always wears his cap low, caught my eye. He had that smirk on his face again, the one that made me feel like he knew something I didn't.\n\nI tried to ignore it, focusing instead on laying out my yarn for today's project. But then, disaster struck. My basket tipped over, sending balls of wool rolling across the floor like escaped prisoners. I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks as every pair of eyes in the room seemed to zero in on me.\n\nThe whispers started almost immediately, a low hum that filled the room. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but I didn't need to. I knew exactly what they were thinking: \"Clumsy old thing, can't even handle her yarn.\" It was mortifying. I wanted nothing more than for the ground to open up and swallow me whole.\n\nI could hardly focus on the rest of the class, that smirk and those whispers playing on repeat in my mind. Even Mrs. Harrington's gentle reassurances couldn't penetrate my humiliation. I left as soon as class ended, barely saying goodbye to anyone. All I could think about was that moment, that stupid moment when I lost control of my yarn.\n\nLater, at home, I looked at myself in the mirror. The woman looking back at me seemed older, frailer than usual. But she was also familiar, because this wasn't the first time something like this had happened. It wouldn't be the last either. That's just who I am, a walking disaster waiting to happen."
