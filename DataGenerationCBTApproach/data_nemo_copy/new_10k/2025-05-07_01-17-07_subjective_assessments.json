My hands were still shaking, but now it was more from annoyance than fear. Who the hell did they think they were? My art is my life, and they had no right to just waltz in here and shit all over it.\n\nBut then, the questions started. What if they were right? What if I really was just some delusional artist, pretending like I could make a living off this? What if I lost everything because of it?\n\nI knew I shouldn't think like that, but I couldn't help it. It was like once the what-if train started, there was no stopping it. It just kept chugging along, picking up more and more negative outcomes until my stomach felt like it was full of lead.\n\nI mean, come on, it was just one note. One crappy little piece of paper that didn't even have a signature on it. It shouldn't have bothered me this much. But here I was, three hours later, still sitting in front of my easel with nothing but blank canvas and anxious thoughts for company.\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my hair. Maybe tomorrow would be better. Maybe tomorrow, the what-ifs wouldn't seem so loud. Until then, though, it was just me and my anxiety, keeping each other awake all night long.\n\n---"
