It's always something these days: attitudes are rude, service is slow, and mistakes are frequent. The whole store seems to be unraveling at the seams.\n\nI understand that times have changed, but I cannot stand idly by while our reputation crumbles. Every interaction should reflect the values we've built this store upon - respect, patience, and professionalism. We're not just selling goods; we're fostering relationships with our community.\n\nI urge you to intervene before this becomes the norm. Never again should a customer be treated in such a manner.
