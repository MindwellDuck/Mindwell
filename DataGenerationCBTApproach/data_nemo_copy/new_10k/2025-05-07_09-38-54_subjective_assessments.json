He could feel it, like a dull knife sliding through butter that was once hot and melted but now cooled and hardened.

Their hands must be steady, their minds sharp as a tack.\n\nHe checked his watch again, the tremors in his fingers more pronounced this time.

An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen. He let it ring out, anxiety coiling tighter in his gut like a venomous snake. *Probably another fucking kid*, he thought bitterly, *wanting to know how the old man does it*. He knew they were circling, waiting for him to slip up, to falter just long enough for them to swoop in and steal another story.\n\nHe turned back to his screen, eyes burning from the glare. The words still wouldn't come, but he forced himself to type anyway, each letter a battle cry against the encroaching darkness. *Fuck them*, he thought, *I'm not done yet*.

He could see it now, the fucking future unfolding before him like some grim movie reel: him, alone; them, laughing; him, drowning in this endless sea of loneliness.\n\nHe slumped onto the couch, the springs creaking under him like some ancient, weary creature. *Why bother?* he thought, running a hand through his hair. *Why even try?* It's not like it would make any fucking difference.
