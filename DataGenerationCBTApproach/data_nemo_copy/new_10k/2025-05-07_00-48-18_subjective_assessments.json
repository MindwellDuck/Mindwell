You've been trying to replicate a colleague's groundbreaking results for weeks now, with no success. It's your fifth wedding anniversary today, and you've promised your husband, Tom, that you'd leave work early to celebrate. However, as the clock strikes six and you're still grappling with the data, you can't help but feel a sense of impending doom.\n\n**Text:**\nDamnation! Another bloody pipette bites the dust. I swear, these damn things are more fragile than my marriage at this rate. Tom will understand, won't he? He always does. It's not like it's just another anniversary we're wasting on this godforsaken lab bench. No, no, it's fine. Everything's under control. The fact that I've been here since dawn, that the clock is ticking closer to eight and there's still no sign of a breakthrough, that doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean that Tom will be sitting at home, watching the clock, wondering why his wife can't just once in her life... No, I won't think about that. This is important. This is bigger than us, than our pathetic attempts at normalcy. It's not my fault if everything else seems to pale in comparison to this. It's not like I'm minimizing the importance of our anniversary. I'm just... focused. Yes, that's it. I'm focused on what really matters."

But oh, how he took that as an affront! His grip on the counter\u2014well, I've seen marble sculptures with less tension. Veins like tributaries began to map his neck; it was almost artistic, if not for the growing storm.\n\nNow, diary, you know me\u2014I'm no stranger to drama. But even I could feel the chill of that growl as it reverberated through our once peaceful home. It's not every day one's kitchen becomes a stage for such... theatrics.\n\nYet here we are, another dish bites the dust\u2014a casualty of what I can only assume was his interpretation of my morning's efforts.

They couldn't understand what he'd been through, the years of hard work and dedication that had led to this moment.\n\nHe poured himself a glass of whiskey, the amber liquid catching the light like the glow of the kitchen range he'd left behind.

He was a man who had built something from nothing, who had weathered storms and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nHe sank into his favorite chair, closing his eyes against the world outside. Their voices faded, replaced by the comforting rhythm of his own heartbeat. They didn't know him, he told himself again. And that was just fine by him."
