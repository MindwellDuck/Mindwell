He'd seen it countless times from these fresh-faced youngsters, thinking they could just waltz in here and fix everything with their 'newfangled' ideas.\n\n\"No offense, son,\" he continued, voice laced with acidic sarcasm, \"but you're probably still learning to tie your own shoes.\"\n\nHe felt the intern's surprise, saw it out of the corner of his eye. Good, he thought. Let them learn early that age and experience trump youthful enthusiasm any day.\n\n\"But sir,\" the intern started, hesitantly, \"I just thought\u2014\"\n\n\"I know what you thought,\" he snapped, cutting him off. He didn't need some whippersnapper telling him how to run his software or his life.

The lipstick stain was unmistakable, smeared across the bristles like a neon sign screaming \"infidelity.\" She had been so careful, always cleaning her brushes immediately after use. But not him, apparently. He could just toss his aside without a care, letting it sit there, mocking her with its presence. It was probably his way of saying he didn't care about the mess, or their shared workspace, or even their relationship for that matter. She couldn't shake the feeling that this little stain was growing, expanding in her mind until it engulfed everything else, blotting out all the good times they'd had together. She sighed, tossing the brush into a jar of turpentine, watching as it swirled around, turning the clear liquid murky. Just like their relationship, she thought bitterly. A small stain ruining everything."

He had yesterday's lunch tray in front of him, picking at the remains like there wasn't a goddamn rule against it.\n\nI felt my stomach turn, bile rising in my throat. How could he be so... casual? So fucking comfortable in his own skin while I stood here, feeling like shit for even being seen eating leftovers from home last week.\n\n*Lucky bastard,* I thought bitterly. *Everything comes so easy to him.* He's got the perfect wife, the perfect job, the perfect fuckin' life. And here I am, stuck with a wife who works nights and a job that works me into the ground. I'm always the one cleaning up after everyone else, making sure everything runs smoothly, while Jake just... sits there, eating like he's on some fucking vacation.\n\nI grabbed my lunch from the fridge, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling in my gut. It wasn't fair. None of it was fucking fair. Why did he get to have it so easy? I had to fight for everything, and still, nothing seemed good enough. Not like Jake's life, always perfect, always fucking sunny.\n\nI sat down at the furthest table, as far away from him as possible. But even with the distance, I could feel his eyes on me, judging me. Or maybe that was just my imagination. Either way, it didn't matter. I was still the one left feeling like shit while he got to enjoy his fucking feast. Life's a bitch, ain't it?"
