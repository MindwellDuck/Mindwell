I guess it's my fault for marrying a doctor; we're never off duty, are we? But still, it gets exhausting. The entire relationship feels like one long shift at the hospital - non-stop, no breaks.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful that he wants to talk later. It's not like he *never* communicates with me. But honestly, I'm just tired of it all. Maybe this time, it really is over. Maybe this time, there won't be a solution, an answer, a fix. Maybe this time, it'll be the end of us."
