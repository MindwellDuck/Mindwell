Her heart caught in her throat as she stumbled upon a folder named 'Us'. She'd forgotten about that one. The shame washed over her like a physical force as she remembered the fights they'd had over finances, his constant reminders of how much she earned compared to him. Each photo was a punch to her gut - their laughter now seemed hollow, their love tainted by unspoken resentment. She closed the folder, but not before noticing a half-written message from him in the chat bubble: \"We need to talk about...\", left unfinished when he didn't come home one night. She hadn't read it then, couldn't bear to. But now, she felt that shame like a heavy stone in her chest, wondering what they'd fought over last, whether it was something she could have fixed if only she'd tried harder.",

The canvas before him was half-finished, the colors muted and dreary, mirroring his mood. He picked up his brush, but the weight felt unfamiliar, foreign even.

Today is different; she noticed the clock's ticking echoing loudly in the silent house, and Thomas is late from work again.\n\n**Journal Entry:**\n\nDear Journal,\n\nToday was one of those days where every little thing seemed amplified, like the hands on that blasted kitchen clock moving at an agonizingly slow pace. I swear, it sounded louder than usual, each tick echoing through the empty house like a metronome counting down to some unseen disaster.\n\nThomas is late again. Not that he's ever *really* on time, but today feels different. It's been hours since his shift ended, and not a single word from him. I've tried to keep myself busy with dinner preparations, but my hands seem to have a mind of their own, trembling as I chopped the vegetables. I imagine them flying off the board in erratic trajectories, causing untold damage. A shiver runs down my spine at the thought.\n\nThe house feels so... quiet. Too quiet. Like it's holding its breath, waiting for something dreadful to happen. Each time I glance at the phone, willing it to ring, the silence seems to grow louder, more insistent. It's as if the very air around me is conspiring against my sanity.\n\nI tried to tell myself that everything was fine, that Thomas was probably just held up with some paperwork or another. But every attempt at rational thought is drowned out by the relentless ticking of the clock. It's like a countdown to some catastrophic event that only I can sense.\n\nI've set the table for two, as always. But tonight, it feels more like an accusation than a habit. The second setting stares back at me, mocking my optimism with its empty chair and untouched place mat. I can almost hear it whispering, \"He won't be coming home tonight.\"\n\nI know I'm being irrational, but I can't shake this feeling of dread. Every negative thought seems to be given a microphone, amplified by the ticking clock, while any semblance of logic is reduced to a mere whisper, drowned out by the cacophony of anxiety.\n\nUntil Thomas gets home, I suppose I'll just keep chopping vegetables and trying not to imagine the worst. Perhaps if I focus on the task at hand, this feeling will pass. After all, it's not like Thomas has ever been late without a good reason. *Has he?*"
