She texts tentatively, \"Hey, everything ok?\" No immediate reply. Twenty minutes later, she hears the front door open. Her partner walks in with a bag from their favorite bakery, grinning, oblivious to the worried silence that hung heavy in their absence.",

After all these years? The audacity! As if he could still command my attention like one of his little puppets. Well, not today, John. Not anymore.\n\nI considered tossing it into the fireplace, letting the flames consume his words along with our past. But no, that would be too easy for him. He'd expect that. So instead, I placed it on my desk, a stark white square against the polished wood, a challenge waiting to be opened."
