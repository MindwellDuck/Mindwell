Orders piled up like unpaid invoices, and no matter how fast he worked, the tickets kept coming. He felt his girlfriend's eyes on him through the pass, her usual warm smile replaced by a furrowed brow of concern. But there was no time to comfort her or himself; tonight, it seemed, even the ovens were conspiring against him, smoking and spitting like angry dragons. As he reached for yet another ticket, his arm brushed against the hot plate, searing his skin. He yanked his hand back, but the pain was nothing compared to the helplessness that surged through him as he watched his carefully crafted mise en place crumble into disorder.",

It was as if the very air in the room was conspiring against me, whispering that life would never again be bright or warm or full.
