Her meal seemed even more pathetic now, a stark reminder of what she didn't have.\n\nShe took a bite, chewing mechanically, her eyes darting to the wall again.

It was everywhere, seeping into every corner of her apartment.\n\nShe pushed her plate away, the pasta congealing in the sauce she'd forgotten to make. She couldn't eat now, not with that joyous symphony playing next door. Her mind was a whirlwind, focused solely on their happiness, their togetherness, their shared meal. She couldn't see anything else, couldn't think about anything else. It was like a magnifying glass had been placed over her life, highlighting every detail of her solitude and loneliness, while everything else blurred into insignificance."
