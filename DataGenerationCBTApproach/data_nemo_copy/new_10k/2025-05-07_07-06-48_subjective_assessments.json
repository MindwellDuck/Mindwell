How dare they?\n\nI've spent countless nights poring over data sets, drafting and redrafting my findings, ensuring every detail was airtight. And for what? To be reduced to a mere 'no' from some faceless committee? It's laughable, really. Or it would be if it weren't so damn hurtful.\n\nI've always been my own harshest critic, but this... this is different. This isn't just constructive feedback; it's a slap in the face. My work was supposed to be groundbreaking, not groundbreakingly mediocre. Yet here I am, left with nothing but self-doubt and a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nI can't help but feel that if only they had seen beyond the page, beyond the numbers and statistics, perhaps they would have understood. But no, they chose to minimize my efforts, dismissing them as inconsequential. It's not just about me, you know?
