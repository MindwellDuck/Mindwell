I pry it open, my pulse thumping in my ears. There they are, messages from some unknown number. \"You're asking too many questions... It's getting dangerous...\"\n\nWhat the hell? I think, scrolling through. These aren't just innocent texts. They're late at night, secretive. I feel a pang of jealousy, anger. But then, it hits me - who am I kidding? Look at me, up all hours, worrying about something that might not even be happening.\n\nI mean, sure, we've had our ups and downs, but this? This is nothing compared to what other couples go through. I've seen them on reality TV, their lives a constant drama. Compared to that, this is just... banality. I'm probably making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\nI take a deep breath, close the phone, and place it back in his hand. Maybe I'll ask him about it tomorrow. For now, though, I'll just lie here, wide awake, thinking about how silly I've been, getting all worked up over nothing."

He walked faster, clutching his bag tighter. Another long day, another life saved. Yet here he was, drenched and exhausted, while that cat... That cat lounged on his windowsill, dry and content.\n\nHe felt a twinge in his chest, a pang of something bitter. \"Pampered,\" he muttered under his breath, more to himself than anyone else. The cat, it seemed, was everything he wasn't - cared for, cossetted, loved. He shook his head slightly, his wet hair flinging droplets onto the pavement.\n\nHe knew he shouldn't compare, but how could he not? His life was one of endless responsibility, while that creature had nothing to do but bask in warmth and comfort. He felt a lump form in his throat, an ache that wasn't just from the chill of the rain. It was unfair, isn't it? That's what it is - unfair.\n\nHe reached his doorstep, keys trembling slightly in his cold hands. As he opened the door, he cast one last glance at the cat. \"Lucky,\" he whispered, before stepping inside, closing the door on the rain, and the cat, and all the labels that swirled around him like a storm."

She feels an overwhelming surge of hatred towards herself, blaming herself for not being able to save him.\n\n---\n\nIn the silent confines of her clinic, she stumbled upon it - a prescription bearing his name, gathering dust since he'd slipped away six months ago. Her heart, already heavy with grief, seemed to plummet further at the sight. The hatred that coursed through her veins was intense, directed not at the world or even those who had failed him, but solely towards herself.\n\nHow could she have been so negligent? She, a doctor, had let this reminder linger, untouched and unnoticed until now. It was as if she'd been willfully blind to its existence, focusing on every other detail of her life except for this one crucial aspect. She couldn't comprehend how she'd overlooked it, how she could have gone about her days without acknowledging this glaring symbol of her failure.\n\nShe picked up the prescription, fingers trembling as they traced his name. The ink seemed to mock her, reminding her of her inadequacy. She wanted to tear it apart, to destroy anything that could serve as a reminder of her inability to save him. But even as she clutched it tightly, she knew that destroying this piece of paper wouldn't change what had happened. It wouldn't bring him back or absolve her of her perceived guilt.\n\nHer mind was a whirlwind of self-recrimination, each thought focused solely on her supposed shortcomings. She couldn't see past the cloud of hatred directed inward, couldn't perceive the broader picture that included all the love and care she'd given him while he was alive. All she could see was this one detail, magnified and distorted under the lens of her grief-stricken mind."
