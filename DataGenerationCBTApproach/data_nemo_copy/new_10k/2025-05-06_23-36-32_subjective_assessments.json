Just great,\" Emma muttered, slumping into her chair as she stared at the blank screen where her meticulous graphs and statistics used to reside. \"Months of work, gone. How could I have been so careless?\" She couldn't believe it. All those late nights, the precision, the double-checking - for nothing.\n\nHer mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, each one more critical than the last. \"I should've known better than to trust that outdated equipment. I should've backed up the data manually, not just relied on the system.\" She felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment and frustration.\n\nEmma barely noticed the comforting hand of her colleague, Mike, on her shoulder. \"Hey, it's not your fault, Em,\" he said softly. \"These things happen. It's just a setback.\"\n\nBut Emma was too focused on the mistake to hear him. She couldn't see past the lost data, the delayed grant submission, and the impending deadline. The whole picture - her dedicated team, their collective efforts, and the potential impact of their work - was obscured by the mental filter of her own perceived failure."
