It's been years since I've seen it, and its appearance today felt almost like a sign from him. You know how much his approval meant to me during my studies.\n\nThe photograph reminded me of the countless times he'd beam with pride at my dedication to medicine. But today, instead of warmth, I felt an inexplicable pang of regret. Why didn't I visit him more often when he was alive? He should have seen me grow in this field, not just heard about it from afar.\n\nI can't help but feel that things shouldn't have turned out this way. My father deserved better, and so did my career. It's as if life has deviated from the path I expected for us both.\n\nBut enough of my musings. I assure you, Dr. Thompson, this won't affect my commitment to our work here. In fact, it serves as a renewed reminder of why I chose this profession in the first place - to honor his memory and make him proud.\n\nI look forward to discussing our upcoming case further at our next meeting.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"
