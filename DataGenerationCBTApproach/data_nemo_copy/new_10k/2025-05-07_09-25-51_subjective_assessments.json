The hairs on the back of his neck stood up, a familiar prickling sensation that had become all too frequent lately. He could swear he heard muffled voices, but the house was empty when he'd left this morning. His wife's car wasn't in the driveway either. He reached for his radio, hand trembling slightly, as he whispered a request for backup. The shadows seemed to close in around him, each creak of the old house echoing like a gunshot in his ears.",

It's creepy, you know? And my partner, they act like it's no big deal. 'It's probably just a coincidence,' they say. A coincidence?! I've had enough coincidences to last me a lifetime.\n\nSo after my shift, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I marched over there, ready to give whoever was inside a piece of my mind.
