I stood there, blinking into the black, like that'd make a difference.\n\n*Must be the whole street,* I thought. *Probably some kid playing with wires again.* Last week it was their ball game crashing through Mrs. Henderson's window. I swore under my breath, still clutching the knife like an idiot.\n\nI fumbled for my phone to use as a flashlight. *See, no power indicator on there either,* I muttered to myself. *It's the whole damn grid.* My pulse quickened anyway, like it always did when something unexpected happened these days.\n\n*Probably just an overloaded circuit.* I'd seen that once in a movie. *Yeah, that's it.* I headed for the fuse box, phone light bobbing ahead of me. *Could've sworn I heard a crack though,* my mind whispered, but I pushed that thought aside.\n\n*Stupid kid,* I grumbled, flipping open the fuse box door. *Probably knocked over some candles or something.* I knew it was them without even asking. *Always up to no good, those kids.*\n\nI jammed my finger into the reset button. Nothing happened. Not surprising, really. *Bet they fried the whole damn thing,* I thought, slamming the fuse box door shut.\n\n*Great,* I huffed, turning back towards the kitchen. *Now what?* Dinner was ruined, and there was no way I'd get the kids to eat cereal for the third night in a row. *Might as well just call it quits.* I sighed, tossing my phone onto the counter with a clatter.\n\n*Guess I'll have to order takeout again,* I grumbled, feeling a familiar pang of guilt. *At least it's not like he's here to see this mess.*\n\nMy thoughts raced on, filling in every detail, every conclusion, without pause or proof. The power outage was just another piece of evidence stacking up against my new neighbors and their reckless kids. I never stopped to consider otherwise."

My mind latched onto that fact, clung to it like a lifeline. It dominated my thoughts, crowding out everything else. I didn't notice the book's title, or the fact that it was a novel she'd once loved, not a collection of letters or diary entries. I didn't consider how many hands this book might have passed through before ending up here. All I could see, all I could think about, was that one glaring detail: this wasn't my writing.\n\nI felt a surge of anger, hot and fierce, like a wildfire raging through my veins. How dare she? How dare she keep something like this from me? My mind raced, conjuring up images of secret meetings, whispered promises, shared laughter - all without me. I couldn't see the whole picture, couldn't consider that there might be an innocent explanation. All I could focus on was that one detail, that one glaring fact that seemed to scream betrayal in my face.\n\nI felt my grip tightening on the letter, crumpling it slightly. My breath came in ragged gasps, my body trembling with barely contained rage. This wasn't about the book anymore. It wasn't about the library sale or even the letter itself. It was about that one detail, that one thing I couldn't ignore, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nI didn't notice the tears pricking at the corners of my eyes until they spilled over, tracking down my cheeks in hot, silent tracks. I didn't hear the creak of the floorboards as she entered the room, or her soft gasp of surprise when she saw me standing there, clutching that old love letter like it was a lifeline.\n\nAll I could see, all I could think about, was that one detail.
