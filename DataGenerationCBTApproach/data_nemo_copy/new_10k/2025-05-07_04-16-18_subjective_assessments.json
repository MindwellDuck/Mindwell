It's not my fault if this house echoes with our past so loudly. You always did have a flair for the dramatic, even in its absence.\n\nNow, about the divorce papers... I know you're expecting me to fight you on this, but I won't. Not because I agree with your hasty decision - no, that's not my style at all. But because I understand how you feel, don't I?
