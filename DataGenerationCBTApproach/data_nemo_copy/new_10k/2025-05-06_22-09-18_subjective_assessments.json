She'd seen him again today, his eyes cold and distant. He hadn't even bothered to look at the menu she'd painstakingly crafted, let alone taste the dishes she'd prepared just for him. As she began to prep for the evening service, she felt a familiar sting behind her eyes. Another rejection, another missed connection. She tried to focus on the rhythm of chopping vegetables, but each thud of the knife against the board echoed with the same hollow finality as his words, \"It's not you, it's me.\"",

She was either a failure or a success; there was no in-between. Tonight, she was most certainly a failure. The kitchen, once her sanctuary, now echoed with the weight of his indifference. Each dish she prepared seemed to mock her, \"You're not good enough.\" She couldn't bear the thought of serving anyone else tonight. It was all or nothing; either he loved her cooking, or it was worthless. She found herself dumping the day's leftovers into the bin, a stark reminder that today had been another 'nothing' day. As she sank into her chair, exhausted and defeated, she couldn't help but think, \"If I can't make him see my worth, what's the point of trying at all?\""

He glanced up, darting his gaze around the room like a startled deer, taking in the emptiness where her laughter should have been echoing. The table by the window, their table, now hosted strangers, their faces ruddy with mirth and wine, oblivious to the void they occupied. His stomach churned, bile rising at the sight of shared plates, untouched by her hands. She wasn't coming. Again. The thought echoed in his mind, a relentless drumbeat drowning out the hum of distant conversations, the clink of glasses, the usual Friday night symphony that had always been theirs alone. He felt adrift, anchorless, in this suddenly alien environment, his world reduced to the cold, unyielding screen before him and the aching emptiness beside him."

His mind drifted back to the fleeting interaction he'd had earlier with Mr. Thompson, a patient he hadn't seen in years. The old man had looked up at him, recognition flickering briefly in his rheumy eyes, but no warmth followed. 'You weren't there when I needed you,' Mr. Thompson had whispered before turning away, leaving Dr. Green with an unsettling chill.\n\nThe words echoed in Dr. Green's mind, each syllable dripping with accusation. He felt a pang of guilt, his stomach churning with the certainty that he must have done something wrong. The old man's eyes had been so cold, so full of resentment. It was clear as day to him: Mr. Thompson blamed him for some past transgression.\n\nYet, for the life of him, Dr. Green couldn't remember any such incident. He'd pored over his records, searching for anything that might have warranted such a response. But there was nothing. Nothing to explain away the coldness in those eyes, the biting words. It must be his fault, though. It had to be.\n\nHe picked up his pen, intending to make a note about Mr. Thompson's state, but his hand hesitated. He could almost hear the old man's voice, laced with disappointment: 'You weren't there when I needed you.' The words were a knife, twisting in Dr. Green's gut. He knew what he had to do next time they met. He would apologize, make it right. Even if he didn't know what he was apologizing for.\""
