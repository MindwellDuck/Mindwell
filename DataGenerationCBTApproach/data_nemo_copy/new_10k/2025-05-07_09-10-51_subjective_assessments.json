Silence swallows her whole, heavy and oppressive. She steps inside, leaving a trail of weariness behind her.\n\nThe fridge hums softly, a mournful tune that seems to whisper, \"He's not here.\" A bunch of flowers, once vibrant, now wilted and forlorn, sits alone on the top shelf. They're like a shrine to his absence, a stark reminder of how long it's been since he was last home.\n\nHer stomach grumbles, but the thought of heating up another lonely meal makes her heart ache more than her hunger. She leans against the counter, eyes welling up as she looks at the empty spaces in their once shared life.\n\nShe pulls out her phone, fingers dancing over the screen, typing out messages that feel like lifelines thrown into an endless void. \"Where are you?\" \"I'm home alone again.\" \"When will you be back?\" But each message remains unanswered, hanging in the digital twilight, echoing her own loneliness.\n\nThe house feels vast and empty, every corner a shadow of his absence. She turns on lights, but they only seem to illuminate her solitude more starkly. The silence presses against her ears, a physical pain that seems to scream, \"He's not coming back.\"\n\nShe sits down at the table, picking at the cold dinner she'd prepared for two, now reduced to one. Each bite feels like defeat, each swallow a silent admission of his abandonment. Her heart feels heavy, a stone sinking in her chest, drowning out any hope or logic.\n\nShe believes her sorrow is a truth universally acknowledged, a testament to his neglect. She doesn't realize she's confusing her emotions for reality, weaving her fears into facts. She just knows that tonight, like every other night, will be another dinner for one."
