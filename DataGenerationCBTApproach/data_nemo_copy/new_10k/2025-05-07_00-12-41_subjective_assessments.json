It was empty now, like his heart, echoing with memories that refused to fade.\n\nA soft breeze rustled through the herbs hanging by the window, their leaves whispering secrets in a language long forgotten. He turned towards the sound, eyes falling on her favorite apron, still hanging there, waiting for hands that would never tie its strings again. A sob caught in his throat as he reached out to touch it, his rough chef's hands tracing the worn fabric gently.\n\nThe clock ticked, marking time he didn't want to keep, each second echoing like a hollow drumbeat in the empty house.
