He pulled out an old photo album from the shelf, its spine worn and pages yellowed with age.

His reflection in the dark window stared back at him, lines etched deeper around his eyes than before. He was still here, but everything else seemed to have moved on without him.",

I can't even enjoy a cup of coffee without thinking about how he liked his black, no sugar. This house is never free from his memory. The entire place is haunted by our past.\n\nI can't escape it.
