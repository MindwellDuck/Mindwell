He could almost hear her voice, fragile and frightened, \"What if it's like last time, Harold? What if we're left in the dark?\"\n\nHis hands, trembling ever so slightly, fumbled with the security camera controls. The screen flickered to life, displaying the empty shop from various angles. No signs of intruders, no visible damage. Yet, his mind raced ahead, painting grim scenarios with each flash of light.\n\n\"Perhaps it's not just a glitch,\" he muttered, pacing the length of the counter. \"Maybe they've taken advantage of the storm, ransacked the place while we were closed.\" His eyes darted to the ceiling, searching for signs of forced entry that weren't there.\n\nEach flicker seemed like a conspiratorial wink, each shadow an accomplice in his mental crime scene. He could feel it, he just knew it. This was more than a power outage; this was a sign of something sinister brewing. But why? Why now, after all these years?\n\nHe sank into the worn leather armchair by the fireplace, his mind a whirlwind of unproven fears and half-baked theories. The lights flickered again, casting him in darkness for a moment before the old bulbs grudgingly shone once more. He sighed, rubbing his temples. There was no use dwelling on what might have happened. Today was a new day, another chance to keep her memory alive. And yet, the nagging feeling persisted, clinging to him like the damp chill of winter."
