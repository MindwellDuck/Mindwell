The unusual silence was broken by an unfamiliar beeping from his partner's laptop, left open on the kitchen counter.

Panic surged as he realized no one else was there to deal with it.",

Asleep at the bloody wheel, aren't they?\n\nThis isn't some late-night party, for crying out loud. It's a goddamn disaster. All that hard work, up in flames... or rather, smoke. And here I was, thinking we were doing something worthwhile. Silly me, believing our progress actually meant something.\n\nI mean, who even cares about a few sleepless nights? We're scientists, not nannies! It's not like anyone gives a damn about us keeping quiet hours. Might as well have a bloody rave down there, for all the good our silence does.\n\nSo much for thinking we were onto something big. Just another smoke-filled fiasco, that's all it is. Typical, really. Always happens to us, doesn't it? Never mind the countless times we've pulled through. That doesn't count, does it? Not when there's a goddamn fire in our lab.\""

His wife's laughter still echoed in his mind from last night, but today she was out with friends, leaving him to an emptiness that felt heavier than usual. He looked around at the dusty corners and bare walls, wondering where all their plans for decorating had gone. A single white rose lay wilting in a vase on the kitchen counter, its petals falling like tears onto the yellowed post-it note it had arrived with: \"For you, from me.\" His eyes stung as he remembered her smile when she gave it to him yesterday. Now it was just another reminder of how quickly joy could fade into melancholy.",

His life was colorful again, even without his wife. He thought of Tom at work, who had lost a child and yet came into the office every day with a smile, a joke, a shoulder to lean on for others.\n\nHere he was, paralyzed by grief, clutching a feather like it was some precious artifact that might bring her back if he held it tightly enough. He felt a pang of envy, then shame for feeling that way when she was gone forever. But the comparison lingered, gnawing at him. Why couldn't he be stronger, braver, better?"
