But as he scanned the room filled with colleagues and friends, he noticed that Jim's chair remained empty. His wife leaned over and whispered that Jim hadn't arrived yet, but she didn't know why. John felt a sinking disappointment in his chest as the cake was cut without Jim there to celebrate with him.",

His eyes scanned the pages, but they weren't seeing the recipes printed there; instead, they were seeing her - his late wife, Emily, standing in this very kitchen, her hands dusted with flour, her cheeks flushed with warmth.\n\nThere, tucked between the pages of 'Italian Classics', was her favorite recipe for lasagna. The once crisp paper now bore the stains and tears of time, a yellowed echo of its former self. He ran his fingers over it, as if touching the past could bring it back to life.\n\nA knot formed in his stomach, tightening like a noose around him. How many times had she offered to teach him how to make it? But he was always too busy, too distracted by work, by life. Now, all he had left were these faded instructions and memories of her smile when she'd speak about their children's laughter over the aroma of freshly baked bread.\n\nHe should have made time for her. He should have learned this recipe properly, not just watched her hands deftly fold the dough, watched her eyes gleam as she slid the pan into the oven. But he hadn't. And now, it was too late. The guilt clawed at him, sharp and relentless.\n\nThe kitchen, once filled with her laughter and warmth, now felt cold and empty. He closed the cookbook gently, as if closing a door on a past that could never be revisited. As he rose from his chair, he made himself a silent promise. Next time - no, there wouldn't be a next time, would there? But still, he thought, next time, things should be different. He should make them so."
