He knows their antics have gone unpunished too long. Tonight, he decides, will be different.",

A note tucked inside, not mine. It was neat, with perfect handwriting. 'For Emma, who loves Atticus as much as I do - Love, Alex.' My heart sank. I remembered Alex, the valedictorian, straight-A student, and all-around perfect human. I could practically hear her voice, \"Oh, you liked that book too? Me too!\" as if she'd somehow been better at appreciating it than me.\n\nI tossed the book back onto the pile, feeling suddenly cheapened. It was just a book, right? So why did it feel like Alex had taken something from me? I mean, we weren't even friends. But here I was, comparing myself to her again, finding myself lacking. God, I hated that. The pang of guilt hit me hard too. Why hadn't I been more aware? More careful with my favorite book? Because clearly, Alex would've treated it better."

She stood there for a moment, unnoticed, feeling like an outsider in her own home. This was supposed to be their family time, yet here they were, laughing without her, sharing jokes that she wasn't part of.\n\nShe cleared her throat loudly, causing them both to turn towards her with surprise. \"I'm just going upstairs,\" she said quietly, turning away before either could respond. As she climbed the stairs, she felt a tear slip down her cheek. It was supposed to be different. They were supposed to be together in this.
