My heart seizes, squeezing like a vice, as memories come crashing back: him standing there, pouring that awful black sludge into it each morning, his hands steady and sure while mine trembled at the thought of another day without him.\n\nA solitary tear slides down my cheek, betraying me despite my resolve to remain stoic. I reach for the mug, fingers brushing against its cool, hard surface, and a shiver runs through me. *No*, I think, *not again*. But there it is, that dreadful sense of doom creeping in, as if his absence has left a gaping hole that threatens to swallow me whole.\n\nI cannot bear the thought of washing this cup clean, of removing the last traces of him from our kitchen. Yet, how can I leave it like this, a grim reminder of what once was? It's too much, too cruel. The very air around me seems heavy with his absence, pressing down on my chest until I can scarcely breathe.\n\nI don't know if I have the strength to face another day without him. How will I go on, living in this house, surrounded by these ghosts of our past? It's all too overwhelming, too unbearable. But what choice do I have? I must continue, one foot in front of the other, even as his memory haunts me from every corner of our home.\n\nI place the mug back where it belongs, empty and silent - a grim echo of the life we once shared. And I steel myself for another day of this endless, torturous existence without him."
