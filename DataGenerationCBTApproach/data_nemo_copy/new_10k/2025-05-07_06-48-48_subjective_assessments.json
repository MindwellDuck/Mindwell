Another slow day, another slow week. His reflection in the glass shelf catches his eye - the dark circles under his eyes seem to have deepened since yesterday. He feels an overwhelming urge to sit down right there amidst the dusty shelves, but the weight of his responsibilities keeps him standing. No one's coming tonight; they never do. Another night alone, another day wasted in this lifeless job. He can't help but feel that tomorrow will be more of the same, and the day after that, until it all becomes just an endless, hopeless blur.",

The empty space on her own left hand felt like a void, pulling her thoughts into an unwelcome whirlwind.\n\nShe tidied the display, her movements precise yet automatic. Her mind, however, was elsewhere. What if she never found someone who would fill that emptiness? What if she remained alone, surrounded by reminders of what could have been? She shook her head slightly, trying to dislodge these thoughts, but they persisted like a stubborn echo.\n\nThe store's clock ticked steadily towards closing time, each second punctuating her internal monologue. What if the next customer was another couple celebrating an anniversary? What if it was a lonely heart buying chocolates for one, mirroring her own solitude? She took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever the evening might bring.\n\nAs she started to close up, she paused by the window display. The streetlights cast long shadows, and she couldn't shake off the 'what ifs'. What if he walked past right now, with someone else? What if their eyes met, and his face showed nothing but stranger's indifference?\n\nShe sighed, turning away from the window. Tomorrow was another day, filled with endless possibilities - or so it seemed in her mind, each one a question mark leading to a bleak 'what if'. She couldn't help but wonder what tomorrow held, even as she locked up behind her and stepped out into the night."
