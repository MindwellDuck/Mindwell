She's been through a divorce, hasn't she? Not like it's affected her looks or anything, I guess that's the perk of being young and... available.\n\nI remember when Linda and I started dating, we used to exchange notes in class. It was romantic back then, but now... now it feels like ancient history. Flowers are for kids, right?\n\nLook at her, she's beaming. She's got that glow, that... youth on her side. I can't remember the last time someone looked at me like that. Is it because of my age? Or is it just me?\n\nI've been working here for years, and this is the first time something like this happens to anyone in our department. Why her? Why not me? I'm a damn good teacher too, you know. But no one sends me flowers.\n\nIt's not fair. It's just not fair."

He'd been hoping for a text, any sign she was thinking about them, but his phone remained stubbornly dark.\n\nThe fridge hummed, echoing in the hollow kitchen. He opened it, scanning the shelves stripped bare of her favorites. The divorce had been brutal, but this quiet, this emptiness, was worse. It was like being on call, waiting for a dispatch that never came.\n\nHe reached for a beer, then paused. Instead, he grabbed a bottle of water and slumped into his armchair. His uniform still smelled faintly of smoke from the warehouse fire yesterday. He closed his eyes, wishing for sleep, but all he saw were flames licking at the edges of his mind, threatening to consume him.\n\nHis hand drifted to his pocket, where her letter crumpled like a forgotten receipt. He'd meant to throw it out, but here it was, another silent reminder of what he'd lost. Hopelessness welled up inside him, as vast and consuming as the warehouse fire.",

It was her decision to go, after all. If she hadn't been so insistent on a change, they wouldn't be here now, him drowning in silence and her... well, who knows where she is? He sighed deeply, shifting the blame as seamlessly as he shifted his weight in the chair. The fire at the warehouse had been terrible, but it was nothing compared to this - this feeling of abandonment, this quiet that screamed louder than any alarm.\""
