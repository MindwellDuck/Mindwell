Your eyes fall on a note about an idea you'd dismissed years ago. Remember the heated discussion it sparked between you both. How do you feel now, looking at it?\n\n**Text Response:**\n\nWell, here it is - his neat handwriting filling these aged pages, like a glimpse into his mind from all those years back. And there's this note, an idea I'd once shot down as impractical. I remember the words flying between us, the heat in my cheeks when I realized maybe I'd been too hasty.\n\nBut, you know, it's just one page out of hundreds. It doesn't really change anything. He had plenty of other ideas that were more practical. This one was... well, it was just a fluke. Not like he made a career out of it or anything.\n\nIt's not like I'm proud of having dismissed it, but it's in the past now. No use dwelling on it. It's not like finding this notebook means I should reassess all my old decisions. Some things were just meant to be left behind."
