What if these documents are another wild goose chase? What if publishing them ruins any chance of redemption for myself or those involved?

Could I trust him with this? Or would he prove to be another 'what if' waiting to happen?\n\nThe room felt colder now, the shadows darker. What if this was a trap set by my editor all those years ago, waiting for me to take the bait? My throat tightened at the thought of being played again, of losing everything I'd built since the scandal. I could almost hear his voice, cold and unyielding, \"You should have known better, Catherine.\"\n\nI stared at the printed documents, their words blurring before my eyes. What if this was all for nothing? What if I couldn't prove anything, couldn't redeem myself or expose him? I felt a familiar numbness creep in, the same feeling that had paralyzed me after he spiked my story.\n\nBut then I remembered her face - the young woman whose life had been ruined by his corruption. Her eyes, filled with hope and despair, had haunted me for years. And suddenly, the 'what ifs' didn't matter so much anymore. Because what if I did nothing? What if she deserved justice, but got none because I was too afraid of failure?\n\nWith renewed determination, I picked up my pen and started to write.
