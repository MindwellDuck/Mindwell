Or maybe it's just his way of trying to get back into shape? No, that can't be right. He's already ripped enough to make a Roman statue jealous.*\n\n*But seriously, what if... No, stop it, Sarah. You're overthinking. It could be anything. Maybe he bought them in bulk or something. Yeah, that's it. He's just prepared for the apocalypse or some shit.*\n\n*God, I hate this feeling.

It's just a condom. Right?*\n\n*Okay, deep breaths. I'll wait until we're both relaxed and then casually bring it up.

It's not like we're short-staffed or anything. I mean, it's just a few extra pillows, for crying out loud. Doesn't she know some patients need that little bit of comfort to help them sleep better? And what's with the 'not a hotel' crap? We're here to care for people, not just shove pills down their throats and call it a day.\n\nAnd why does this remind me so much of my wife? She's always been caring, but lately... It's like she can't see past her own damn nose. She blew off our granddaughter's recital last week, said she was too tired. Too tired to watch that little girl shine on stage? Bullshit. She just didn't feel like it, pure and simple.\n\nI can't help but clench this chart so tight my knuckles are white. It's not just about the pillows or my wife's attitude. It's about respect, you know? Respect for our patients, for each other... Hell, even some basic decency. But maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe it's just been a long week. Either way, I can't shake this feeling of being surrounded by blindness - mine included."
