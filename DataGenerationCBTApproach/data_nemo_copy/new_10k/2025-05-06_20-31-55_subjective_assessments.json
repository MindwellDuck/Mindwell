Their eyes, steel-hardened by experience, contrasted starkly with my own, still wide with shock. They had walked into scenes like this, shoulders squared, faces impassive, while I stood here, retching at the stench, stomach churning like a damned amateur.\n\nI saw their badges, their medals, those silent testaments to years served in this hellish underworld. And there, pinned like a shameful brooch on my chest, was my shiny new insignia, glinting mockingly under the harsh crime scene lights. I felt it then, that familiar burn of inadequacy, the scorching heat of comparison igniting within me.\n\nHow could I stand here, green as they come, when they'd seen worse and not flinched? Their hands were steady, their breath even, while mine was ragged, my heart pounding like a terrified rabbit's. It wasn't fair. They had experience, the armor of years on the job. All I had was this raw, queasy disgust, this burning shame at being so green, so vulnerable.\n\nBut then, there it was again, that quiet whisper from my partner, \"Another one left to rot.\" And I realized, with a surge of bitter anger, that none of us were immune. Not the veterans, not me. We all stood here, united in our failure, because this wasn't about being better or worse, it was about being human. And that, I suppose, was something even the most jaded detective couldn't change."

And now, another invitation. Another reminder of what I didn't have. I could see it in their eyes as they handed me the card, the pity, the knowing looks. They thought I was lonely, that my life was empty without these celebrations. As if they knew better than me how I felt. It made me want to scream, to throw something, anything to break this cycle of them thinking they understood me when they didn't. Instead, I gripped the beaker too tight, and the acid splashed out, burning my skin. The pain was a relief, a familiar companion in this sea of misunderstanding."
