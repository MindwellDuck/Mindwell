The painting was a vibrant portrait of her late husband, painted years before their divorce. As she began to gently clean the canvas with a soft cloth, she noticed a small tear at the bottom corner, barely visible but enough to send a sharp pang through her heart. She remembered how he used to laugh at her meticulous care for her art, and now those echoes of laughter seemed only to emphasize the silence that had settled between them since their separation.",
