She unlocked the front door, the silence greeting her like an old, unwanted friend. No radio playing softly in the background, no scent of dinner cooking on the stove. Just the quiet hum of the refrigerator and the ticking of the clock she'd inherited from her grandmother. She hung up her uniform, running a hand over the gold badge that seemed to grow heavier each day. As she walked into the bedroom, her eyes fell on the empty side of the bed, the blankets untouched since he'd passed. A familiar ache stirred in her chest, and she felt the tears threatening again. Another night alone, another chance to miss him like hell.",
