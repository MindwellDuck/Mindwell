Today, as you're discussing tomorrow's surgery schedule, you catch sight of an unfamiliar number flashing on his phone screen before it goes dark again.\n\n**Sarah's Response:**\n\"Ugh, this is so frustrating! I mean, why can't he just use a normal ringtone like everyone else? Always that stupid vibrate mode. And what's with all these late-night texts? It's not like we're on call 24/7, you know?\"\n\nShe sighs loudly, her arms crossed as she leans back in her chair, avoiding Tom's gaze. \"I swear, if it turns out to be another 'work' thing...
