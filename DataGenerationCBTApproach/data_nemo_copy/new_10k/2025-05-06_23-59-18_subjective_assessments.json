Those ungrateful whelps, laughing like there's no tomorrow. *Disrespectful*, that's what they are! They don't know the meaning of hard work, dedication, and *respect*. Not like when I was teaching.\n\n*Look at them*, so carefree, so *happy*. They don't have a care in the world. And here I am, after all these years, still walking with this *damnable* cane. My hands... they're trembling! It's not fair, it's just not fair!\n\nMy wife, she doesn't understand. She never had to deal with such insolence day in and day out. She can't possibly know how this feels. I'm alone in my suffering, isolated by these youngsters' indifference.\n\nWhy did they have to come here? Why couldn't they laugh elsewhere, where it wouldn't *grate* on me like this? They're a reminder of everything I've lost, everything I'll never have again. It's not fair... *it's just not fair*."

What if they painted over it without seeing its true worth?\n\nThe canvas box felt heavier with each step, not just because of the empty space where my art once was, but also due to the weight of these 'what ifs'.

This wasn't rejection; it was just another step in my artistic journey. But still, the drizzling rain whispered its 'what ifs' into my ear, and I couldn't shake them off."
