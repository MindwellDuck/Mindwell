A chill ran down my spine as I considered what might happen if they turned and saw me. This would be the end, I just knew it. How could it not be? Every scenario played out in my mind was catastrophic; bloodcurdling screams echoing through the empty streets, the cold steel of a blade against my skin... It was unbearable to think about, yet I couldn't stop myself from predicting the worst. My legs felt like lead weights as I approached, my breath ragged and shallow. This was it, wasn't it? The terrifying future that had been waiting for me all along."
