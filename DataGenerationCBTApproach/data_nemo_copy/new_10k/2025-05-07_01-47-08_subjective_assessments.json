Tonight was supposed to be our quiet evening together, a chance to unwind after the long week, but unfortunately, work had other plans.\n\nYou know how it is at the newsroom - one minute everything is calm, and the next, it's like a storm has blown in. Today, that storm was my deadline. I was late, again, and the clock seemed to mock me as I rushed to finish my article. It felt like I was either going to meet the deadline or lose everything - there was no middle ground.\n\nMy editor appeared just as panic began to rise like bile in my throat. He pointed at my screen, his brow furrowed, demanding that we needed this piece now. I could feel the walls closing in, the weight of expectation pushing down on me. It was either meet this deadline or fail utterly.\n\nI know you're disappointed, and I'm sorry for letting you down again. But please understand, it's not that I didn't want to be there with you. It was just... it was all or nothing. There wasn't any room for compromise or balance tonight.\n\nI promise to make it up to you soon. Until then, know that my heart was with you even if my body couldn't be.\n\nYours,\n[Your Name]"

Among them lay one particular sketch, its corners slightly upturned as if beckoning him closer. It was signed \"Mom,\" her neat handwriting staring up at him like an accusing eye. He reached out tentatively, tracing the looping script with a fingertip, and felt it - that old familiar pang of grief, sharp and biting as ever.\n\nHow could she do this? he thought, his heart constricting around the words like a vice. How could she presume to still have a place here, among his students, after all that had happened? The drawings were hers now, wasn't that clear enough? She'd taken so much from him already; his marriage, their shared dreams for this school... and now this. This intrusion on what was once theirs but was now, undeniably, his.\n\nHe felt the anger rise within him like a tide, washing away rationality in its path. He knew he should be thinking logically, objectively, but how could he when every fiber of his being screamed that this was wrong, that she had no right? The drawings were just another sign of her audacity, her insensitivity, her sheer disregard for his feelings. She'd never understand the pain they caused him, because she couldn't feel it herself. Not like he did.\n\nHe snatched up the drawing, crumpling it into a tight ball in his fist. He would dispose of it, make sure none of their students saw it again. It was the only reasonable course of action, wasn't it? Anything else would be... unthinkable. Unbearable. Because if he let himself think about it too long, consider other possibilities, then perhaps he'd have to confront something far worse than grief or anger.\n\nPerhaps he'd have to confront the possibility that his emotions were not as reliable as he believed them to be."

They moved with purpose, unlike me, rooted to the spot, a statue of indecision. Their lives seemed so simple, so clear-cut, each box labeled neatly, its contents destined for a new life abroad.\n\nI couldn't help but compare our circumstances. They had jobs that took them places, gave them purpose. Mine was... well, it was just mine. It didn't matter where I went, my work would follow, as dull and sedentary as ever. Their lives seemed so much more... vibrant than mine.\n\nThe rain picked up, each droplet a tiny hammer against the pavement, echoing the pounding in my head. It wasn't fair. They had choices, opportunities. I was just... stuck. Stuck here, stuck with this life that seemed suddenly so small, so inadequate. The hoodie, once his, now mine, felt like an anchor around my neck, dragging me down into the muck of self-pity.\n\nBut what right did I have to feel sorry for myself? They were working, building a future. And here I was, wallowing in self-doubt, comparing their lives to mine and finding myself wanting. It wasn't their fault. It wasn't anyone's fault but my own. So why did it feel so unfair?\n\nI took a deep breath, the rain filling my lungs, cleansing them of self-pity. I wouldn't compare anymore. I would choose to see their strength as inspiration, not intimidation. After all, they were moving on with their lives, and by God, so was I."
