Why'd we have to find this now? It's been years since Lisa passed, but seeing her smile like that, all carefree and full of life... it's like a punch in the gut.\n\nI can feel it, you know? That dread. It's creeping up my spine, coiling around my heart like a damn snake. I just know something terrible's gonna happen again. It's been too quiet lately. Too peaceful. Something's gotta give.\n\nI can't even look at that photo without seeing more loss. More tears. More goddamn empty seats at holidays. My hands are shaking just holding it. It's like the past is reaching out, grabbing me by the throat, saying, \"Remember this? Here it comes again.\"\n\nI tried to be strong when Lisa died. I did. But this... this feels different. Worse. Like a warning. A bad omen. I can't shake this feeling that something awful's coming. And I don't know if I'll survive it this time.\""

Sales have been a bit slow lately, and that always gets me worried.*\n\n*But I think it might be more than that. When I saw Joe stirring his coffee this morning, barely touching his cereal, something just didn't feel right. He said he was thinking about the inventory, but he had that look in his eyes - you know, the one he gets when he's hiding something.*\n\n*I mean, why else would he be so quiet? It's not like him to be so distant at breakfast. We usually chat about our days ahead, plan our lunches together. But this morning, it was just me and my thoughts, trying to fill the silence.*\n\n*Now we're in the car, and I can't help but feel like there's a storm brewing. It's not just the rain outside, either. There's tension, and I know it's not just me being paranoid. Joe's been acting weird all morning.*\n\n*I wish he'd just tell me what's going on. We're partners, after all. We're supposed to face things together. But until then, I guess I'll just keep feeling this way - anxious, worried, like the world's about to crash down around us.*\n\n*Ugh, I hate this feeling. It's like everything's off balance, and I can't quite put my finger on why.*\n\n*Until next time,\nMe*\n\n*P.S. I hope he's not still dwelling on that argument we had last week. I really thought we'd moved past it.*"
