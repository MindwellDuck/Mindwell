I mean, how could she? Just because I took an extra moment to help Mr. Thompson to the bathroom. He's not some invalid yet, you know? But no, Nurse Ratched over there had to make her snide remark about me being slower than molasses.*\n\n*I guess that's what I am now, huh? Molasses. Sticky, slow, useless. I've been called worse, but this one hit different. It echoed in my mind all day, each drip of the word 'molasses' staining my self-worth just a little bit more.*\n\n*The worst part? Mr. Thompson didn't even notice. He was too focused on his dignity, and here I was, crumbling mine away with every drop of that damn syrup.*\n\n*I tried to shake it off, really I did. But every time someone asked me for something today, I felt my face flush with heat. It's like her words became a brand, searing into my identity. I'm not just slow now; I'm useless. A hindrance.*\n\n*God, I can't wait to go home and peel off this uniform. It feels tainted now, like it's got 'Molasses' embroidered on the name tag instead of 'John'.*\n\n*But you know what?
