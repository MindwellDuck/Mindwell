As he reached for his coffee maker, his hand trembled slightly, a subtle reminder of last night's late-night paperwork. Suddenly, the room spun, and he grasped at the countertop to steady himself.\n\n\"Honey,\" he called out, \"I don't feel so good.\" No response. He turned around, heart pounding, and saw an empty bed. His wife was gone. The panic surged through him like a tidal wave. He rushed to their bedroom door, only to find it ajar, the cool morning air seeping in from the open window. His mind raced with worst-case scenarios as he fumbled for his phone to dial her number. No answer. Just then, the front door creaked open downstairs, and he heard a familiar voice calling out, \"I'm home! Sorry I forgot my keys.\" He sank to the floor, relief washing over him like a warm shower, but the panic lingered, a shadow at the edge of his mind.",
