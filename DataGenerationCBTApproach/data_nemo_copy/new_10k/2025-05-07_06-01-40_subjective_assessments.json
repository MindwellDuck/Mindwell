I tell you, if looks could kill, they'd have been struck down where they stood.*\n\n*But mark my words, those insolent brats will come crawling back when they realize the error of their ways. They may think they've gotten away with something, but they haven't fooled me. I can see right through them. They're just waiting for a chance to apologize and make amends.*\n\n*I won't let this incident dampen my spirits, though. I'll simply wait for an opportunity to teach those young hooligans a lesson in respect and responsibility.

It was not anger, though he felt its familiar heat simmering beneath the surface. No, it was something else. Something akin to... gratitude? For what, exactly, he could not say.\n\nHis wife's picture, now hidden away, had been taken by her on their last vacation together. The sun had been warm that day, and they'd spent hours laughing over silly hats and ice cream cones. It had been a good day, one of many they'd shared. Yet, Harold couldn't help but think, as he stared at the drawer where the photograph lay forgotten, that it didn't really count. Not compared to all that was lost."
