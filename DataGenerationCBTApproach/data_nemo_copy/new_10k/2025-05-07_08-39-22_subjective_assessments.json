The clatter of pots and pans that had once been comforting now echoed hollowly through the empty house.

Another night alone in a home that used to be filled with love and life, but now felt like nothing more than a museum of happier times.",

Each step towards my car seemed heavier than the last, as if the very ground was conspiring against me.\n\nI'd spent hours, no, days preparing for this. Pouring over numbers, running scenarios, and yet it was all for nothing. They barely even glanced at my proposal before dismissing it out of hand. And her, that new principal, she just smiled like it was hers all along. She didn't even have the decency to look guilty.\n\nI could feel the familiar resentment bubbling up inside me, a hot, acidic sensation that seemed to burn away any rationality. I tried to tell myself that it wasn't personal, that these things happen, but it felt like a lie. It felt like another one of those times where my hard work was overlooked, while someone else reaped the rewards.\n\nI mean, look at this paperwork. It's not like they left me with nothing to do. But somehow, it just seemed like more evidence of their indifference, their unwillingness to recognize the effort I put in. I could almost hear them laughing about it later, \" Poor old Mr. T., still slaving away while we enjoy the fruits of our labor.\"\n\nI unlocked my car door, the harsh click echoing through the empty parking lot, and slid into the driver's seat. As I started the engine, I couldn't shake off this feeling that I was being punished for something, that I was always going to be on the losing end. It wasn't fair, none of it was. But what could I do? I was just Mr. T., the invisible, indispensable cog in the machine."

The clock on the wall ticked louder with each passing minute, as if echoing the racing pulse in her chest.

It was just Dr. Thompson, their senior scientist, stepping inside for a routine check-in. But his warm smile did little to calm her fraying nerves. She felt the familiar tightness in her throat, anxiety clawing at her like it always did when confronted with unexpected change.\n\n\"Everything alright here?\" he asked, noticing her flushed cheeks and shaky hands.

Fuck, not this again.\n\nI've always been a mess of nerves around my work, but now? Now every time I see that damn note, it's like a neon sign flashing in my face: 'Fraud'. It echoes through my mind, loud and clear, drowning out any other thought. Brilliant, my ass. I'm just a fucking imposter, waiting for someone to call me out on it.\n\nI slammed my fist down, papers scattering like leaves in autumn. Christ, even that small action felt like proof.
