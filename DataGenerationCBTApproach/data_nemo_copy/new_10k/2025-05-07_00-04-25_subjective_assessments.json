It's been too long since we last caught up. I'm writing to you today because I've just received news that our beloved hospital is in quite the pickle. They're crying out for nurses, and it seems they're desperate enough to scrape the bottom of the barrel.\n\n*Can you believe it?* All those years we spent building a team of dedicated professionals, and now they're reduced to begging for volunteers? I mean, who's running the place these days?\n\nI've been going through my old contacts, trying to rustle up some help. But really, *where are all the nurses?* It's not like they can all have vanished into thin air.\n\n*Honestly,* John, it's a shambles. I knew things were tough out there, but this? This takes the cake. We worked so hard to maintain our standards, and now it seems they've gone out the window.\n\nI'll do what I can from here, but *you know how it is.* Once you're retired, they don't exactly roll out the red carpet for you. Still, I can't just sit back and watch as they let our hospital go to ruin.\n\n*Keep your chin up,* old friend. It seems we've got some fighting to do yet.\n\n*Best,*\n[Your Name]"
