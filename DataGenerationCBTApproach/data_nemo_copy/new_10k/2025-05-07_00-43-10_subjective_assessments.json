There they were, two faces caught in laughter, his arm around me, our bodies pressed together like we were one person. The edges of the image were yellowed with age, but their smiles, oh, those were as bright and mocking as ever.\n\nHow could I have forgotten this? How could I have let it slip through the cracks of my mind, only to be dredged up now, like some grim reminder of what once was? My heart feels heavy, each beat echoing with a dull ache. It's as if that laughter, once so infectious, has turned poisonous.\n\nI trace their smiles with my fingertip, and I swear I can feel the warmth of that night again. The clink of glasses, the hum of voices around us, the way his hand fit perfectly in mine... And then, like a cold gust blowing out a candle flame, I remember. He left without warning. No explanation, no apology, just... gone.\n\nThe photograph might be old, but the pain it stirs feels fresh, raw. It's as if my heart is screaming at me, \"See? This is why you can't trust anyone. This is why love is a lie.\" I know, logically, that this isn't true. But right now, in this moment, with this photograph staring back at me like an accusing eye, it feels real. It feels like truth. And who am I to argue with my own heart?"
