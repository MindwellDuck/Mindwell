She had meant to review tomorrow's appointments, but worry gnawed at her. The latest letter from her daughter, filled with unspoken concerns about her father's health, lay untouched beside the keyboard. Her mind raced, envisioning worst-case scenarios, each one more daunting than the last. She sighed, rubbing her temples, as the clock ticked away another hour of sleepless worry.",

Mom called, again. She can't find her blasted dentures. It's the third time this month. She sounds breathless, confused. Like she's been crying. I can picture her now, pacing around that empty house, hands shaking as she holds the phone.\n\nI swear, sometimes I think she does this on purpose, just to worry me. She knows how much I hate these middle-of-the-night calls. But no, she wouldn't do that, would she? She's not that cruel. Or is she?\n\nI can feel it, diary, that gnawing feeling in my stomach. She's thinking, \"Why doesn't she just come over and help me?\" She knows I'm a better daughter if I drop everything and rush to her side. But how can I leave him? He's been so supportive lately, and he needs his rest. Besides, it's not like she actually needs my help at 3 AM. She'll find them eventually.\n\nI wish she could understand that she doesn't need to worry me every time she misplaces something. It's not like she can read my mind and know how much her calls stress me out. Or maybe she can? Maybe she knows exactly what she's doing. No, no, I'm being ridiculous. She wouldn't do this on purpose.\n\nI just wish... I wish things could be different. That she'd understand without me having to spell it out for her. But then again, that's not Mom's style, is it? She'll never change. And neither will these calls, I suppose.*\n\n---"

What if my neighbours have decided to move their party here without invitation?\" Her mind whirred like a runaway engine, each 'what if' spinning off into a labyrinth of catastrophic possibilities.

It bore no address or return label, only her name, handwritten in faded blue ink. She picked it up, feeling its weight, remembering the last time she'd held something like this. The memories rushed back, hot and shameful, as she opened it to find a decades-old photograph staring back at her - a reminder of that one story she never wrote.",

It was an old Polaroid, faded and worn around the edges - a snapshot of that fateful day when she had chosen not to write about the protest, choosing instead to protect her sources.\n\nShe scrutinized every detail, her eyes darting from face to face, searching for some hidden message or accusatory gaze. Each person in the photograph seemed to stare back at her, their expressions stern and disapproving. She could almost hear their whispered criticisms, each one a knife twisting in her chest.\n\n\"Did they send this to punish me?\" she wondered aloud, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Do they think I've forgotten? That I don't remember the choices I made?\" Her mind raced with possibilities, all centering on her own perceived guilt and shame.
