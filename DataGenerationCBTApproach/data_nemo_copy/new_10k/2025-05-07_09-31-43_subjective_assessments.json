He couldn't fathom how someone could just delete his work without a damn good reason. *It's black and white,* he concluded, *either they wanted him to fail, or they were incompetent enough not to know what they were doing.* His mind raced, stuck in its binary tracks, unable to consider any nuances or shades of grey. He was too busy drafting his resignation speech in his head, ready to walk out on this ungrateful team that had obviously turned against him."

His laughter used to fill these halls, not just hers echoing sadly off the empty walls now. She picked up his mug, her fingers tracing the lipstick stain that would never fade like his memory had started to. It was always this way, she thought bitterly, the whole lab a grim reminder of what she'd lost, an entire era erased by his leaving. The clock ticked on, its relentless march forward a stark contrast to her world that seemed stuck in reverse."

Her grip tightened on her pen, as if choking an invisible throat.\n\n\"Typical,\" she muttered, under her breath. \"They never learn.\"\n\nShe continued this way, each error magnified in her mind, until every paper was graded with harsh red marks and even harsher comments. She didn't notice the students who had improved, or those who had made insightful arguments despite their grammatical flaws. All she saw were the mistakes, her mental filter blocking out anything that might suggest she hadn't done enough to teach them."
