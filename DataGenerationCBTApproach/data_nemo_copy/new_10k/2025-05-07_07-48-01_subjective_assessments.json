It's like they're rubbing it in my face. They don't know what I've been through. Divorce wasn't easy on me, but here they are, laughing like nothing's wrong. Why can't they just... keep it down or something? It's not fair. Life isn't fair. Not for people like me, anyway. That ring in her hand... it's a slap in the face. A reminder of what I don't have anymore. Why do they get to have all that when I'm left with nothing but these empty halls and echoes of laughter from times gone by? It's not right.

He missed their shared meals, their late-night conversations, their Sunday mornings.\n\nHe blinked back tears, dropping the chopped onions into the pot with a heavier hand than intended.
