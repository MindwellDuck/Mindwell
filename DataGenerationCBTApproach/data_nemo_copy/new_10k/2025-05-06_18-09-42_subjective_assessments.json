He notices a framed photograph of his late father on the mantel, the glass slightly askew. He straightens it, his fingers brushing against the cool metal, remembering the countless times they'd talked about medicine over dinner. His wife, engrossed in her book in the next room, doesn't hear him sigh softly before continuing to the kitchen to pour himself a whiskey, neat.",

His gaze drifted back to the living room, where the photograph of his father still seemed to stare at him.\n\n\"What if I'd taken that call from Dad the night before he passed?\" Henry muttered, swirling the whiskey in his glass. \"What if I'd been there when he fell? What if I could've saved him?\"\n\nHe shook his head, taking another sip. \"But then again, what if I hadn't? What if it was my turn to be on call that night? What if I'd been the one who ended up in the hospital?\"\n\nHenry sighed, his reflection in the window showing lines of worry etched into his forehead. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for another round of 'what ifs'.\n\n\"Christ, Henry,\" he muttered to himself, \"you can't keep dwelling on these what-ifs. It won't change anything.\" But even as he said it, his mind was already spiraling into another scenario.\n\nHe drained his glass and set it down with a soft thud. As he turned off the kitchen light, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that there was more to life than just moving forward. But wasn't that just life? A never-ending series of 'what ifs'?"

My stomach churned, and a cold sweat prickled my forehead.\n\n\"Disgusting,\" I muttered, more to myself than anyone else. I felt a pang of irritation, an urge to dismiss this unpleasant incident as merely another trivial inconvenience in my otherwise flawless day. After all, hadn't I just successfully navigated a complex surgery? Didn't that deserve my attention and satisfaction?\n\nI grabbed the rat by its tail, trying not to think about how it had gotten there, or for how long it might have been trapped. I swiftly disposed of it, washing my hands afterwards with almost ritualistic fervor, as if cleansing myself of more than just physical grime.\n\nAs I stood there, the scent of disinfectant filling my nostrils, I felt a strange detachment from the moment. It was as if this incident hadn't truly happened, or at least, it didn't deserve to mar my otherwise perfect record. I couldn't allow it to tarnish the satisfaction I should have felt after today's surgery.\n\nI returned to my locker, hanging up my stained scrubs with a quiet sigh. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake off the sight of that lifeless rat. Yet, I found myself dismissing it, brushing it aside as an irrelevance. After all, wasn't my professionalism, my surgical skill, what truly mattered? Anything else was mere noise, best ignored."
