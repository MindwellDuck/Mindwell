Take little Max, for instance - his grades are slipping, but he's still full of energy when he's not in class. I see his mother coming in later, all put together with her perfect hair and designer clothes. She'll probably look at me like I've failed him somehow.\n\nAnd then there's Mrs. Thompson's daughter, Emily. Always ahead of the curve, always smiling. Her mother will sit across from me, hands folded neatly on her lap, waiting for another glowing report card. When I tell her about Emily's struggles in math, she'll probably think I'm incompetent. It's not fair, you know? Some parents seem to have all the luck - kids who breeze through school, families that always look picture-perfect.\n\nI just feel like everyone else has it easier than me.

What am I doing wrong?\n\nIt's not that I'm jealous or anything, but sometimes it just feels like the universe is stacked against me.
