As she hung up her nurse's coat, a small, faded photograph fluttered to the floor from its pocket. It was them, young and smiling on their wedding day. A wave of sorrow washed over her as she picked it up, tracing his face with a trembling finger. She had found the photo at the hospital, tucked away in an old textbook during her shift today. It had been a bittersweet reminder of their love amidst the sterile chaos of the ward. Now, alone in their empty house, she let her sorrow spill over, tears dropping onto the yellowed image.",
