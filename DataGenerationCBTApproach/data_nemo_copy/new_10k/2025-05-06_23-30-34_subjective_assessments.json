He hadn't called, too consumed by the patient who had slipped into a coma after his surgery. She'd understand, she always did. But as he finally stepped into their dimly lit home, greeted only by silence and the faint scent of last night's meal still lingering in the air, he felt it. Guilt, heavy and palpable, like a weight pressing down on his chest. Her untouched dinner sat on the table, now cold and unappetizing, next to a note that simply read, \"I waited.\"",

I'm sitting here, in our quiet home, with your untouched dinner still on the table, and I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of dread. You waited for me, as you always do, and I wasn't there to share a meal with you, to laugh about our days, or to simply be present.\n\nI can see it now, the clock ticking away the hours we could have spent together. Each second that passed without my call must have felt like an eternity for you. I picture you checking your watch, then the phone, before settling down at the table alone. The thought of you waiting, of the time stretching out endlessly, makes me feel sick with guilt.\n\nI know what you're thinking - \"He's too consumed by his work again.\" And you're right. But it's not just about the patient who slipped into a coma today. It's about the countless others I could have helped if only I'd stayed longer. What if something had gone wrong in those two hours? What if my absence cost someone their life?\n\nI know, I know. You'll tell me not to think like that, that I can't predict the future, that I'm being too hard on myself. But how can I not, when the weight of responsibility is so heavy on my shoulders? The ticking of our clock echoes in my mind like a countdown to some unseen disaster.\n\nI promise, tomorrow will be different. Tonight was just... tonight was just one of those nights where everything felt out of control, and I couldn't keep up. But you understand that, don't you? You always do.\n\nPlease don't wait for me again, not like this. It's too much to bear.\n\nYours,\n[Your Name]"
