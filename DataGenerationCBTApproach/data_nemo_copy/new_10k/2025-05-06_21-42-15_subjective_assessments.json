The ER doc calls it \"touch and go.\" She's heard that before too. But this time, it feels like a death sentence. Her heart pounds in her chest, anger surging through her veins like lava.

She should have been faster, smarter, better. She should have known this would happen. Her heart pounded against her ribcage like a trapped animal, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The rain seemed to mock her, each drop a drumbeat of guilt, each gust of wind a whispered condemnation. She wanted to shout back at them all, \"I know! I know it's my fault!\" But she didn't.

It's just me and this photograph, stuck in our own little world.\n\nI've got to pull myself together. Deep breaths. In... out... I can do this. I'll go downstairs, present my ideas, and everything will be fine. Everything will be normal. Because that's what matters, right? Normalcy.
