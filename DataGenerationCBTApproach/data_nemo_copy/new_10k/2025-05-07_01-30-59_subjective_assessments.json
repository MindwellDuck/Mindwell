Tonight was no different, until it was. There, among the usual spam and newsletters, was an email from him. No subject line, just his name in bold type.\n\nThree days old, it stared back at me, unopened, mocking my routine. I hadn't heard from him in months. Years, even. Not since... well, you know when. And now this? It felt like a punch to the gut, another reminder of the distance between us. Always so quiet, always so distant. It was as if he'd vanished entirely from my life.\n\nI couldn't remember the last time we'd spoken. It seemed like an eternity since his voice had echoed through our old house. The silence was deafening now, a constant companion that had seeped into every corner of my life. Every unopened email, every missed call, it all added up to one thing: he didn't care.\n\nI felt the familiar anger rise in me, hot and bitter. This was just like him, always pulling away, never reaching out. It was never-ending, this void between us. I couldn't remember a time when things were different. It was always like this, wasn't it? Always so hard, always so silent.\n\nI sat there for a while, the cursor blinking at me, daring me to open the email. But what was the point? It would only be another reminder of how things had changed. How they'd stayed the same, really. Because that's just how it is with us. Always has been, always will be.\n\nWith a sigh, I closed out of my emails and turned off the monitor. Another night without him, just like every other night. Just like always."

I bet he doesn't have the weight of this family on his shoulders.* He felt a bitter taste in his mouth, like bile rising. *She should be looking at me like that, not him.*\n\nHe wanted to say something, but the words stuck in his throat like dry bread. Instead, he glared at the back of her head, willing her to turn around and notice him. But she didn't.
