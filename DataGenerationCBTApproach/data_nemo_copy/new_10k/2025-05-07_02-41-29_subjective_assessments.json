You've been teaching at Westside High for the past decade, known for your patience and commitment to students' success. Today, however, a parent stormed into your classroom, accusing you of neglecting their child's education because of a recent dip in their grades.\n\n**Text:**\n*Deep sigh.* I can't believe Mrs. Harper just burst into my classroom like that. Fifteen years I've been teaching here, and this is the first time a parent has raised their voice at me. I mean, sure, little Timmy's grades have dropped, but I was going to contact her about it.\n\n*Looks at the pile of ungraded papers.* Oh, great. Now I feel like everyone else in the teacher's lounge has got this grading thing down pat except for me. They probably don't have stacks of papers mocking them on their desks.\n\n*Rubs temples.* It's not like I'm some rookie teacher. I've seen kids struggle before. But now, I can't help but think I'm failing them somehow. Why else would Timmy's grades be dropping? And why didn't I notice sooner?\n\n*Shakes head.* Maybe I should have taken Mrs. Wilson's offer to grade papers together last week. She always seems to have her classes under control. But no, I had to insist on doing it myself. Now look at me, drowning in ungraded assignments.\n\n*Sighs again.* I just need to get this grading done tonight. No distractions. Tomorrow, I'll talk to Timmy and figure out what's going on. Hopefully, Mrs. Harper will have cooled down by then too."
