I spent hours on that fucking plate, and this is what I get?\n\nI mean, look at him, sitting there in his fancy-ass suit, with his nose so high up in the air he can see China. He's probably never even cooked a goddamn egg in his life, but he thinks he can judge *me*? Me, who's been slaving away in this kitchen since before sunrise?\n\nAnd what's with that fucking fork of his? It's like he's scared to actually put it in his mouth, like he might catch something from my cooking. Fuck him and his tiny, judgemental fork.\n\nI bet he went to some fancy-ass culinary school too, learned all the right techniques, had all the right connections. Probably never had to struggle like I did, learning everything on my own, fighting for every fucking scrap of recognition. *He* doesn't know what it's like to have something you've poured your heart and soul into be dismissed like that.\n\nBut you know what? Fuck him. I didn't get where I am today by listening to every little criticism from some pretentious asshole with a superiority complex. He can keep his fancy fork and shove it up his tight, judgemental ass for all I care. I know my food is good, and that's all that matters.\n\nSo fuck you, critic guy. You might have your fancy reviews and your high-class patrons, but you'll never have the passion or the heart that goes into every single one of my dishes. And that, my friend, is something you can't buy with all the money in the world."

My vision tunneled until all I could see were his smug smiles and their empty compliments. The rest of the gallery might as well have been painted black for how much attention it deserved. All that mattered was him, him, him\u2014his betrayal, his ignorance, his gall.\n\nWhen he finally sauntered past me without so much as a glance, I couldn't take it anymore.

She didn't notice how the aroma of garlic and herbs usually filled their home, but tonight, it was barely perceptible, overshadowed by the cold dread that hung heavily in the air.\n\nAs she sat down to eat alone, her gaze flicked nervously towards his empty seat. She pushed her food around on the plate, picking at it half-heartedly. \"He'll probably just have a sandwich when he gets home,\" she reasoned aloud, ignoring the fact that she'd made enough for two. The once vibrant colors of her meal seemed dull and unappetizing now, as if reflecting her mood.\n\nLater, she settled into their shared bed, the sheets still warm from his absence. She reached out to touch his side of the mattress, finding it cold and empty. A shiver ran down her spine, and not just because of the chill. She clung onto the thought that he was probably working late, but even as she tried to convince herself, the niggling doubt lingered like a bitter taste in her mouth.\n\nShe turned off the lamp, plunging the room into darkness, save for the faint glow of the streetlight filtering through the curtains. She listened intently, straining to hear any sound from outside their home. Each rustle of leaves, each distant car engine revving seemed louder, more ominous than usual. Yet she couldn't bring herself to open the window, let alone step out onto the balcony for a breath of fresh air.\n\nAs she lay there, wide awake and vigilant, her mind whirred with thoughts of what tomorrow might bring. She could picture it now - his sheepish expression as he confessed to whatever secret he'd been harboring. The thought made her stomach churn, but also sent a pang of longing through her. At least then, she thought, I'll know for certain. The uncertainty was worse than any truth could be.\n\nShe clutched the covers tightly around herself, her body tense and rigid as she waited for morning to arrive. It promised no relief, only more questions and perhaps, answers she didn't want to hear. But still, she craved them. Anything was better than this...this nothingness that seemed to swallow her whole."
