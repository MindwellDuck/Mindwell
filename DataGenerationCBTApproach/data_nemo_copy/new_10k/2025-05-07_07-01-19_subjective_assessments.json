The coffee maker, that faithful companion of mornings, hummed softly in the gloom, yet its usual cheerful cadence felt hollow today. I reached for my phone, but it offered no solace either; not a single notification graced its silent screen.\n\nJust another Saturday morning, I thought to myself, as I sat down to breakfast. The table seemed larger than usual, almost hostile in its emptiness. Each bite tasted bland, the flavors of solitude settling heavily on my tongue. It was either joyous feasts with laughter echoing through these walls or this dreary silence. There was no middle ground, no comfortable gray area where I could find contentment alone.\n\nThe day stretched out before me like an unending expanse of white noise, devoid of any color or meaning. Either I was surrounded by people, their chatter filling every corner of my being, or I was adrift in this sea of solitude. There seemed no other way to exist, no room for nuances. It was either-or, always. And today, it was most definitely 'or'."
