A mere two years late and gathering dust like some forgotten trinket. One might think Mother had better things to do than pen her thoughts onto paper, but no, she found the time to send it nonetheless. And there it sat, hidden behind our wedding photograph - a reminder of happier times, no doubt.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful for small mercies; at least she didn't forget my birthday entirely this year. Though, comparing it to dear old John's mother who sends him handwritten letters every week... well, that's apples and oranges, isn't it?\n\nOne could argue that Mother's lack of punctuality in correspondence is her own failing, but then again, I'm sure she has more important matters occupying her mind. Not like me, stuck here, twiddling my thumbs and waiting for the postman to deign to deliver a scrap of paper from my own flesh and blood.\n\nBut no, no self-pity here. After all, it's not as if I've anything better to do with my time than moon over ancient letters and compare myself unfavorably to others. How utterly pedestrian."

Her reflection in the glass showed tired eyes, a stark reminder that today's experiment had gone awry again, another chance lost to prove her theory.

It was either usable or not, there was no middle ground for such things, she reasoned. She couldn't very well serve tea in a flawed vessel, could she? With a sigh, she placed it back on the shelf, pushing it to the farthest corner where it wouldn't be seen. After all, only the best would do. Anything less was simply unacceptable.\""

She imagines him, sitting at his desk, lines of code flowing effortlessly from his fingers. He always made it look so easy. She remembers their late-night coding sessions, her struggles paled in comparison to his fluid mastery.\n\nHer hands drop away from the keyboard, landing softly on the desk.

He could almost see her, her brow furrowed in concentration, her tongue peeking out at the corner of her mouth as she crafted words that would reach him from across the globe.\n\nHe set the pen down gently on the desk, his eyes drifting to the window where rain began its rhythmic dance. A shiver ran down his spine, not from the chill, but from the thought that invaded his mind: \"What if she'd never sent those letters? What if they'd been lost in transit?\"\n\nHe shook his head, a wry smile playing on his lips. \"For goodness' sake, man,\" he chided himself aloud, \"It's just rain.\" But even as he said it, his mind was already off to the races, conjuring images of floods and power outages, of her stranded somewhere without him.\n\n\"It's just a pen,\" he said, more firmly this time. But there it was again, that insidious little voice whispering in his ear, \"What if you'd never met?
