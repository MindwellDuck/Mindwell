The yellowed envelope was tucked behind the neatly stacked papers, its edges worn from years of being hidden and revealed. He hadn't seen this in decades, not since they'd first met. The handwriting was hers, but the words were now strangers to him. He unfolded it slowly, his eyes scanning the familiar lines: \"I'm leaving... I can't do this anymore...\" As he reached the end, his vision blurred. Thirty years ago today, she walked out on him, and every anniversary since, he'd pushed the memory back into that drawer, along with her letter. But today, it wasn't staying put. Today, it was a knife twisting in an old wound, fresh misery cutting through the familiar scar tissue.",
