The woman standing before her is a patient from years back, one she barely recognizes now. The woman's gaze meets hers, and for a moment, they're both lost in time.\n\nThen, the woman's eyes widen, filling with tears that seem to spill over instantly. \"You were supposed to save him,\" she whispers, her voice trembling around the words referencing Dr. A.'s late husband.\n\nDr. A. feels a pang in her chest, a sudden heat rising up her neck. She didn't expect this, not here, not now. She thought she'd left all the ghosts of her past behind when she moved back home. But here they are, staring at her through familiar eyes.\n\n\"It's been so long,\" Dr. A. says softly, standing up from her chair. \"I'm sorry for your loss.\" She reaches out a hand, wanting to offer comfort but feeling a strange tension in her own muscles. The words echo in her mind, \"You were supposed to save him.\" Wasn't she supposed to save everyone? Isn't that why she became a doctor?\n\nThe woman takes Dr. A.'s hand, squeezing it gently. \"It's not your fault,\" she says, but the tears keep falling, and Dr. A. can't help but feel like they're for more than just her husband.\n\nAs the woman leaves, Dr. A. sinks back into her chair, her mind racing. She can't shake off the feeling that this was a sign, a warning. Maybe she's not as ready for this homecoming as she thought."
