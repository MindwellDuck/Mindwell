The clatter of pots echoed as she began cleaning up, her reflection in the window showing wrinkles around her eyes that seemed deeper tonight. A soft melody from the old piano in the corner, untouched for years, drifted through the house. She paused, listening to the silence between notes, feeling the weight of unplayed tunes and unsaid words. His voice carried softly from the other room, \"Remember when we used to play that?\" she heard him ask, but it was too late; the moment slipped away like sand through her fingers, leaving her melancholy and alone with the dishes.",
