The sudden power outage had left me stranded in the dimly lit office, the only light now the faint, intermittent glow of distant lightning through the window.*\n\n*The silence was oppressive, heavy with anticipation, as if the very air held its breath awaiting the next crash of thunder. My patient, Mrs. Hartley, had been on the edge of her seat before the lights flickered and died, her anxiety palpable even in the gloom.*\n\n*It's all her fault, I thought, my mind racing. If she hadn't been so tense, so worked up, maybe the lights wouldn't have short-circuited. This is exactly why I'd asked her to breathe deeply, to calm down before we started our session. But no, she couldn't manage that simple task.*\n\n*I could feel the sweat beading on my forehead, the panic rising in my throat like bile. My thoughts were a whirlwind of blame and recrimination, each flash of lightning casting them into stark relief against the blackness of the room.*\n\n*Why did I have to draw such difficult cases? Why can't they just follow the instructions I give them? It's not like I'm asking for the moon here. Just some basic self-control would be nice.*\n\n*The storm seemed to rage on forever, each clap of thunder echoing my frustration and anger. But eventually, it began to subside, the lightning flashes growing further apart, the thunder retreating into the distance.*\n\n*As suddenly as it had gone out, the power flickered back to life, casting its warm glow over the room once more. Mrs. Hartley looked at me, her eyes wide with fear and apology. But I could only think one thing:*\n\n*Next time, just follow my instructions.*"

He found remnants of last night's takeout strewn across the counter, a half-empty glass still resting near the sink. His housekeeper, Maria, had been with him for years, but lately, her standards seemed to have slipped. He felt a twinge of contempt as he picked up the glass, muttering, \"Really, Maria?\"",

Last night's takeout boxes were still scattered across the counter, and there, beside the sink, sat Maria's half-drunk glass of god-knows-what. He felt a knot tighten in his stomach as he picked up the glass, the liquid inside swirling like the storm brewing within him.\n\n\"Christ, Maria,\" he muttered under his breath, \"This place is going to hell in a handbasket if you keep this up.\" He could see it now, clear as day. Another week of this, and he'd be drowning in pizza boxes and empty glasses. His once-pristine kitchen would become a dumpster, and all because Maria had lost her damn mind. He slammed the glass down on the counter harder than intended, the force making his knuckles ache. This was just the beginning, he knew it. Things were only going to get worse from here."

You've missed his last three calls, each one slipping into voicemail unanswered, adding fuel to your growing concern.\n\n**Text:**\n\"Seriously, where is that boy?\" I muttered, my eyes glued to the phone as if my stare could force it to ring. \"He knows better than to worry me like this.\" I picked up the receiver, dialed his number again, and listened to it ring out once more. Three missed calls now. I could practically feel the wrinkles etched deeper into my forehead with each unanswered ring. \" Typical teenagers,\" I huffed, slamming the phone down harder than intended. \"Always thinking they're invincible.\" I didn't notice the other officers exchanging concerned glances or hear the soft chatter about a car accident on the nearby highway. My world had narrowed to that damn phone and my nephew's late check-in. When it finally rang, it startled me so badly, I knocked over my half-empty mug of coffee. \"About time,\" I snapped into the receiver, before realizing it wasn't my nephew's voice on the other end."
