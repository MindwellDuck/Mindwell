It was as if he'd carved my entire being into two neat categories: 'bitter' and 'not bitter'. And apparently, I belonged firmly in the latter camp.\n\nI stood there, sipping my champagne, feeling the bubbles fizz against my tongue like tiny needles of justification. I wasn't bitter, no, not at all. I was simply... outdated. Obsolete. A relic of a bygone era. It was such a clear-cut distinction, wasn't it? Black and white. On or off. New software or old.\n\nI felt a warmth spread across my cheeks, but it wasn't embarrassment. No, it was understanding. This was how things were now, after all. I'd either move forward with the times, or I'd be left behind. There was no middle ground. It was progress or stagnation, evolution or extinction.
