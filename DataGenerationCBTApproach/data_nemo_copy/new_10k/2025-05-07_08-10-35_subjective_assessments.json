She opens an envelope containing a bloodstained letter meant for her, written by the convicted killer she'd helped put away years ago. The ink is smudged as if tears had fallen on it. Her heart sinks as she reads, \"I know you were just doing your job, but I can't forgive you. Not yet.\" She feels a familiar pang of guilt, followed by a creeping dread.",

She'd heard those words countless times before, from colleagues, superiors, even that sniveling lawyer who'd tried to argue self-defense for his client.\n\nBut not from him. Not from the man whose life she'd helped ruin. The man who was now rotting away in a cell, thanks to her. She felt the familiar pang of guilt, the weight of it pressing down on her chest like a physical force.\n\nShe tried to push the thought aside. Tried to focus on the good she'd done. The lives she'd saved by putting him away. But it was like trying to hold onto sand. It just slipped through her fingers.\n\nHer eyes fell on the framed photo of her and her team, celebrating their first big case together. She felt a twinge of something - pride? Joy? - but she dismissed it as quickly as it came. \"That was ages ago,\" she grumbled, turning away from the photo.\n\nShe spent the rest of the night poring over evidence, making sure every 'i' was dotted and every 't' crossed. Because that's what mattered. Not some stupid letter written by a bitter criminal. Not her team's long-forgotten celebration. Just the facts. The cold, hard truth. Anything else... well, it just didn't count."

But there was nothing but cold sheets and a lonely pillow. The clock read 6:30 AM, just like that dreadful morning three years ago when everything changed.\n\nI buried my face in his pillow, inhaling deeply for any trace of him. But it was no use; the scent had long faded, replaced by the sterile smell of fresh laundry. I let out a shuddering breath, feeling that familiar ache in my chest.\n\nAs I got ready for work, I couldn't help but feel irritated with everyone else going about their lives as usual. Didn't they know how hard it was to face another day without him? I caught myself snapping at the barista who forgot my order, and then felt guilty for taking my frustration out on her.\n\nAt the office, my colleagues seemed cheerful, discussing weekend plans like there wasn't a cloud in the sky. I found myself getting angry again. How could they be so happy when Tom was gone? It's not fair, I thought, as I slammed my locker shut harder than necessary.\n\nBy lunch, I felt exhausted from carrying around this burden of anger and sadness. But who else could bear it but me? After all, I was the one left behind, the one who had to keep going despite everything. Tom would have wanted that, I told myself, as I picked at my sandwich, appetite gone.\n\nThat evening, I found myself meticulously folding Tom's clothes, still tucked away in our closet. It felt like a small act of rebellion against the world continuing on without him. But even this simple task couldn't stop the familiar sting of tears threatening to spill over. Another day down, another day further from him.\n\nAs I climbed back into bed that night, the coldness of Tom's side seemed more pronounced than ever. I reached for my phone, scrolling through old photos of us, trying to hold onto any remnant of his warmth. But it was no use; he was gone, and I was left here, alone with my thoughts and this endless well of blame."

None of them seem to stick around long enough to actually get to know him.\n\n*Must be something wrong with me,* he muses. *Maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole dating thing.*\n\nHe tosses his phone back onto the couch, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees. His eyes scan the room, taking in the empty space around him.\n\n*Always alone,* he thinks. *Whole days go by without a single message. Entire weeks without so much as a like.*\n\nHe lets out another sigh, louder this time. He can feel the frustration building inside him, but he pushes it down. There's no use dwelling on it, right? That won't change anything.\n\n*Might as well just accept that I'm meant to be alone,* he thinks, picking his phone back up and opening the app again. *At least then I won't keep getting disappointed.*\n\nHe starts scrolling through the new faces, trying to muster some enthusiasm.
