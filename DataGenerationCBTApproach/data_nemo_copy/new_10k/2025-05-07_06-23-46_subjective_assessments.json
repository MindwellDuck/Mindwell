It's not as if I hadn't been diligent, hadn't poured over every detail with an almost obsessive fervor. But what good did that do now?\n\nI suppose some might find solace in the fact that it could have happened to anyone, that this was just one of those unfortunate occurrences that befall even the most meticulous scientists. But I can't shake off this gnawing feeling of failure. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to chalk this up to anything but a personal shortcoming.\n\nI've always been told that science is about objectivity, about dispassionately observing and recording phenomena without letting emotion cloud judgment.

My mind raced with questions, each one leading down a darker path than the last.\n\n*What if this was her way of taking over?* I found myself wondering. *What if she thought I wasn't capable enough to handle this project alone?* The thoughts swirled like a storm in my head, each gust bringing more doubt and anger.\n\nI could feel the hatred building within me, like a pressure cooker ready to explode.
