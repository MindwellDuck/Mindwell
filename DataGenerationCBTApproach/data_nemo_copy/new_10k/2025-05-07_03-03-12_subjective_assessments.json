I half-expect to see him walk through that door any minute now, complaining about how much he hates eating alone.*\n\n*I dropped my chef's coat on the floor earlier. Not like it matters where it lands these days. There's no one here to nag me about keeping things tidy anymore. He'd have a fit if he saw this place right now. 'A kitchen should be clean, not chaotic,' he'd say. But what does it matter? It's just me here.*\n\n*I found myself tracing that old recipe note again tonight - the one for his famous pancakes. We were supposed to make them together last Saturday. Remember that, Journal? Yeah, neither do I. Life has a funny way of not going according to plan.*\n\n*I shouldn't be feeling like this, though. It's been months now. People say time heals everything, but it feels more like a slow drip feed of salt into an open wound most days. I just want things to go back to how they should be.*"

My mind latched onto that one detail, fixating on it as if it were the most significant aspect of this memento from our past.\n\nI couldn't see beyond that small imperfection, couldn't appreciate the joy and pride captured in the rest of the photograph.

It seemed to encapsulate all my failures as a father, all the ways I'd fallen short.

No, that would be ridiculous. That would imply that maybe, just maybe, it's my fault for not being productive enough.\n\nPfft, as if. It's obviously his fault for putting me in this situation. He should've known better than to call and ask about the follow-up piece when he knows I'm struggling with writer's block right now. Typical of him to be so insensitive.
