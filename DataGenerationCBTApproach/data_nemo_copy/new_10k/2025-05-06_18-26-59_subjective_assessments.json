His heart sinks as he realizes it's for his best friend, passed away yesterday after a brief, silent battle with cancer. The house is quiet; his wife hasn't risen yet. He sits alone in the dimly lit kitchen, clutching his coffee mug, staring at the email as tears silently roll down his weathered cheeks.",

His wife stirred an hour later, padding down the stairs in her robe, yawning. \"Morning,\" she muttered, pouring herself a coffee. He didn't respond, just stared at the screen, his reflection flickering in the dark monitor.\n\nShe noticed his silence, his stillness. \"What's wrong?\" she asked, concern edging into her voice. He turned to her, his eyes dry now but red-rimmed. \"It's John,\" he said flatly. \"He's gone.\"\n\nHis wife gasped, a hand flying to her mouth. She moved towards him, comforting. But he shrugged her off, his tone abrupt. \"Don't touch me. Not right now.\" She recoiled, hurt flashing across her face before she composed herself.\n\nHe left for work early, the house thick with unspoken tension. At the office, colleagues offered condolences, but he met each one with a brusque nod, no words. In meetings, his responses were curt, black-and-white. Either/or. No room for nuance, for grey areas. It was all business, all the time, or nothing at all.\n\nLater that evening, they sat across from each other at dinner, their usual banter replaced by stiff silence. She reached out, placing her hand over his. \"We'll get through this together,\" she said softly. He looked at her, then at her hand on his, and pulled away. \"I don't need your sympathy,\" he snapped. \"Either you're with me or you're not.\""
