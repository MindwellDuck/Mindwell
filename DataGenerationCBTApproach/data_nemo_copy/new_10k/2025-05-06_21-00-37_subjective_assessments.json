It shouldn't have bothered me this much, but here I was, my heart pounding like I'd just run a marathon, while Tom sat there, lost in his book about some obscure war.\n\nWhy couldn't he see it? The chaos, the mess... wasn't he bothered by it? Or did he simply not care because he had better things to do? His calm demeanor only seemed to emphasize how neurotic I was being. He'd probably never even noticed these little things before. Maybe that's why our friends always commented on how 'put together' his place was compared to mine.\n\nI felt a pang of jealousy. Not just at Tom, but at everyone who could maintain a pristine home while I was over here, drowning in what seemed like endless tiny imperfections. Why was it so easy for them and so hard for me? What was wrong with me that I couldn't keep things together?\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself down. But all I could think about was how everyone else had their lives more together than me. It was overwhelming, suffocating even. I felt small, insignificant, like I was barely treading water while everyone else was swimming laps effortlessly.\n\nI wanted to scream, to shake Tom until he saw the mess too. But what would that prove? That I was crazy? Paranoid? Better to keep it inside, to bear this burden alone. After all, who was I to expect others to understand when even I didn't?"
