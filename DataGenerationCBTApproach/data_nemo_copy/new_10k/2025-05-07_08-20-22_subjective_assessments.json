Her gaze flicked to Dr. Thompson across the room, calm and collected, his movements swift yet measured. Sarah's breath hitched. He'd been here barely a month, but he looked like he'd been born in scrubs.\n\nShe shook her head sharply, pushing away the comparison. \"Status?\" she demanded, turning to the nurses, determined not to let that damn voice in her head distract her again."

She could picture him, his brow furrowed under his thick glasses, disappointment radiating from him like heat waves. Her heart pounded in her chest as she grabbed her coat, keys jingling wildly in her trembling hand. She had to get there, had to prove herself, had to show she wasn't a fraud.
