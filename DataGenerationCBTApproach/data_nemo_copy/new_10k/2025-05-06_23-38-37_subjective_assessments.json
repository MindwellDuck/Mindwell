It was quite unexpected, given the usually pristine state of his work. My immediate thought was, \"What on earth is this doing here?\" I couldn't help but feel that it was a clear sign that something was amiss, perhaps even an indication of some sort of inappropriate behavior. I mean, why else would my wife's initials be there? It can't just be a coincidence, can it? I made a mental note to have a little chat with Timothy about this during our next tutorial session."

It was my fault for leaving it there in the first place. But did he have to be so fucking passive-aggressive about it? Leaving it there like that, just waiting for me to find it. Typical of him to make me feel guilty without even saying a word.\n\nI slammed my locker shut, harder than I intended. A few heads turned, but I didn't care. I was used to people staring by now. I clutched the mug tighter, my knuckles turning white. It wasn't just about the damn mug anymore. It was about everything he did that made me feel small and incompetent.\n\nBut whatever. I'd show him. I'd be better than this. I'd prove him wrong. And if not... well, at least I'd have a clean mug to show for it.\""
