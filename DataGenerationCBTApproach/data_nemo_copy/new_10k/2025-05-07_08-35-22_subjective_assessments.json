The opening was in full swing, but she barely noticed the chatter and laughter. Her eyes were fixed on the painting at the far wall, the one he'd loved so much - their favorite.\n\nA tall, familiar figure leaned against the wall beside it, glass of champagne in hand, laughing loudly at something someone had said. It was him, or rather, his doppelganger, the man who'd bought her husband's entire collection after his death, claiming to be an admirer. She'd seen him before, but never like this - so alive, so indifferent.\n\nVengefulness surged within her as she watched him raise his glass towards the painting, as if in toast. Her hands tightened around the invitation clutched in her fist until its edges dug into her palm. She would make him pay for his callousness, for his pretension of affection for a man he barely knew. She just didn't know how yet.",

He hadn't known Paul like she had. They'd shared breakfast under that very painting, its colors dancing in the morning light. This stranger couldn't possibly understand that.\n\nHer grip tightened around the invitation, creasing it like a guilty conscience. She watched him raise his glass towards her husband's masterpiece, a mocking toast. How dare he? He didn't deserve this, any of it. If only Paul were here to see...but no, she couldn't think about that. Not now, not with this charade playing out before her.\n\nShe would make him understand, make him feel the weight of his actions. She just had to figure out how. This wasn't fair, none of it was. But life rarely is, is it? Especially when others are involved."
