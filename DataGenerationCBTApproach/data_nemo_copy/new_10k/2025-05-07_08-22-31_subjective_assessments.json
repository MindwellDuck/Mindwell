His heart had pounded like a drum, echoing in his ears louder than any sense of reason. Footsteps too, or so he thought. But now? Silence. Just his imagination playing tricks, no doubt. Yet another detail lost amidst the chaos of his mind, another brushstroke unpainted on this ever-empty canvas."

But nope, here she was, alone in the goddamn dark.\n\nShe flipped on the lights, revealing an empty dinner table. No romantic meal waiting for her, no 'Happy Anniversary' banner hanging from the ceiling. Just a lonely tablecloth and a bunch of fucking crumbs. She sighed, disappointment bitter on her tongue. \"What the actual fuck?\" she growled, hands planted firmly on her hips.\n\nHer mind started racing, questions firing off like bullets in her head. What if he'd forgotten? What if he was out with someone else? What if something had happened to him? Her stomach churned at the thought. She could feel panic rising, a familiar knot forming in her chest. She tried to push it down, but the 'what ifs' were multiplying like fucking rabbits.\n\nShe grabbed her phone, fingers hesitating over the screen. Should she call him? What if he was busy? What if he didn't answer? What if... what if he didn't care anymore? Her heart pounded in her ears, each beat echoing with doubt. She threw the phone back onto the couch, her breath coming in ragged gasps.\n\nShe knew she was overthinking it, but fuck, she couldn't stop. It was like a goddamn tidal wave, threatening to pull her under. And all because of one empty table and too many 'what ifs'."

No creaking floorboards betraying an intruder's presence. Yet here they were: open door, missing painting. It was too much of a coincidence to ignore.\n\nHer mind raced, piecing together fragments like a puzzle. The unlocked door meant someone had been in. They'd taken her masterpiece. It had to be deliberate. A thief, perhaps, casing the house for valuables.
