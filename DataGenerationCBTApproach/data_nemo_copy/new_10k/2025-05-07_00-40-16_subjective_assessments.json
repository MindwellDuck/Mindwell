The man, in his sixties with a weathered face and hands that bore the marks of years spent behind a cash register, paused for a moment, his eyes scanning the aisles. He was divorced, his once-warm heart now guarded by a fortress of resentment.\n\nThe store was quiet this morning, the usual hum of chatter replaced by an almost eerie silence. As he made his way to the back room, he noticed a young man, barely more than a boy, lounging against the counter, flipping through a magazine. The kid looked up as he approached, his eyes meeting those of the older man.\n\n\"Morning,\" the boy muttered, his voice laced with disinterest.\n\nThe older man didn't respond immediately. Instead, he walked over to the counter, his steps measured and deliberate. He reached for the register drawer, pulling it open with a sharp jerk. Inside, neatly stacked bills were disordered, crumpled almost deliberately. His gaze flicked up to the boy, his eyes narrowing as he took in the nonchalant expression.\n\nThis was his store, his life's work. And this kid, with his careless attitude and disrespect for the job, was an insult to everything he'd built. A surge of vengefulness welled up within him, a desire to teach this boy a lesson, to make him understand the value of what he had. But all he did was close the drawer with a soft click, his expression unchanging.\n\n\"Make sure it's tidy by the time you leave,\" he said, his voice steady despite the storm raging inside him.",

He could see it clear as day, that kid's thoughts written all over his face. 'This place is a dump,' 'He doesn't pay me enough to care,' 'I'll do whatever I want.' The old man could hear them, as loud as if the boy had shouted them in his ear. He knew he was right, he always was about these things.\n\nHe snatched up the phone, dialing the number for his daughter by heart. \"Hey, it's me,\" he barked into the receiver without waiting for her greeting. \"That kid you sent over to help out, he's a lazy piece of work. I can tell just by looking at him.\" He listened for a moment, then interrupted, \"No, you don't understand. It's not just about the money, it's about respect. You should see his face, all smug and entitled...\" He trailed off, rubbing his temples as he waited for her response."

And now, this reminder of my failure felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nI thought back to that day, years ago, when we made our promise. It seemed like such a simple thing then, but it slipped away from me, just like everything else since she's gone. I've never been able to shake off the guilt, the feeling that I let her down entirely. It's always there, gnawing at me.\n\nThe store feels emptier now, lonelier. Every corner whispers with memories of her, every shadow seems to harbor her disapproval. The weight of my promise broken hangs heavy over this entire place, like a cloud that will never lift. I've lost count of the times I've thought about leaving this job behind, starting fresh somewhere she can't haunt me with her silent disappointment.\n\nBut where would I go? This is all there is now, isn't it? Always, always, always."
