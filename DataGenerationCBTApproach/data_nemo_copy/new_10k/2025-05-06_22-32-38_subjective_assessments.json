Today, Emily sauntered into class late, laughing loudly with a friend, flouting the rules that Mrs. H. had enforced for years. As she passed by, Emily carelessly knocked over a stack of papers, scattering them across the floor. She didn't bother to stop or apologize. Instead, she flashed a smug smile at Mrs. H., who felt a bitter taste rise in her mouth.",
