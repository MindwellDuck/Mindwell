Its branches swayed gently in the moonlight, a silent echo of her laughter. He'd patrolled this park a thousand times since she passed, but tonight it felt different. The weight of his duty seemed heavier, his badge a mere trinket against the encroaching darkness. A group of teenagers approached, their voices loud and boisterous.
