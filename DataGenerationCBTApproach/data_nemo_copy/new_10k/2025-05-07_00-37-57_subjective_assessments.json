It was a complaint about his teaching methods, unsigned but harsh in its criticism.

Another voice telling him he wasn't good enough, another day where his passion seemed to fall on deaf ears.",

I'm just not getting through to them.*\n\nI couldn't believe this was happening again. Last week, little Johnny had dozed off during my lecture on the American Revolution. And now, this note. It felt like a slap in the face, a confirmation that I was failing at what I loved most.\n\n*Maybe I should've been more engaging today,* I thought, raking my fingers through my thinning hair. *Or maybe they're right, maybe I am just boring.* The words on the paper seemed to grow larger, bolder, taunting me with their harshness. *Why else would someone write this if it wasn't about me?*\n\nI felt a knot forming in my stomach, that familiar feeling of dread washing over me. It was like the whole world had stopped and was staring at me, whispering, \"You're not good enough, Thompson.\" I could feel the tears welling up, threatening to spill over. *Not here,* I told myself, blinking them back. *Not in my classroom.*\n\nBut goddammit, it hurt. It hurt because it felt like everyone else saw what I couldn't: that I was a failure as a teacher. That I wasn't making a difference. And that, more than anything, was unbearable."
