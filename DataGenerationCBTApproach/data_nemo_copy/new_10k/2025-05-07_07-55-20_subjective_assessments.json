His morning coffee is always left half-drunk when he returns from work, despite no one else touching it. He's started finding doors ajar that he swears he closed, and the TV turns on at odd hours with no one in sight. Today, as he sits down to write his latest article, he notices a faint, unfamiliar scent lingering around his laptop - like someone had been using it without him knowing. His heart races as paranoia surges; he's certain he'd left the house alone this morning.",
