As she undressed in the dim light, she caught sight of herself in the mirror - the blood stain on her uniform, now dried and brown, stared back at her like an accusation. She felt a pang of remorse; it was from the young woman she'd arrested, who'd fought back with desperation born from fear and abuse. She should have anticipated that reaction, been gentler perhaps. She climbed into bed, careful not to disturb her partner's sleep, but rest eluded her as she replayed the scene in her mind.",

As if she were some cordon bleu who had magically transcended the boundaries of taste and texture, while I remained chained to mere mortal mediocrity.\n\nI could almost see it in his smug little face, the thought bubble floating above his head like a grotesque cartoon: 'You're just a hack, old woman. Mother could make circles around you.' The audacity! The sheer gall of the boy to presume such things, as if he had any idea what went on behind my closed doors, in my private sanctum where I poured my heart and soul into each dish.\n\nI felt the heat rise in me, a slow-burning flame that threatened to consume my carefully maintained composure. My lips pressed together of their own volition, forming an unyielding line that betrayed none of the tempest raging within. Contempt, yes, that was the word. Pure, undiluted contempt for his presumption, his arrogance, his utter lack of understanding.\n\nBut oh, how I wished he could see what I saw, feel what I felt. How I longed to shatter that cocky facade and reveal the truth hidden beneath: that I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that his mother's best efforts would pale in comparison to mine. That her 'better' was merely a figment of his imagination, a ghost born of childhood nostalgia and fed by his youthful ignorance.\n\nYet, I said none of these things. For what good would it do? He wouldn't understand, not yet. Not until he had walked the path I had trodden, tasted the bitter herbs of failure, and emerged victorious with recipes etched into his very soul. Until then, he was blind, deaf, and dumb to the truth. And so, I kept my counsel, swallowing my scorn like a bitter pill, and turned away from him, leaving him to his foolish fantasies.\n\nBut mark me well, Timothy dear, one day you will see. One day, you will know. And on that day, you will regret your words, your doubts, your pathetic little attempts at rebellion. Until then, however, I shall continue to educate you in silence, my lessons written not with words, but with knives and flames and the slow, steady heat of a simmering pot.\""
