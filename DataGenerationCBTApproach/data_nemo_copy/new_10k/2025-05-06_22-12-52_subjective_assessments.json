His mind races as he checks and rechecks the lock on the door, worrying about its reliability. He wonders if he should have bought that expensive new one like the salesman suggested, but the cost was too high on his fixed income. His hands tremble slightly as he imagines intruders slipping through an insecure latch. The worry gnaws at him, keeping sleep at bay another night.",

This piece of shit looks like it could snap off with a good kick.\" He'd been staring at that lock for what felt like hours now, his hands shaking as he jiggled the handle again. The ticking clock seemed to mock him, each second echoing louder than the last. He couldn't unsee the cheap plastic, the worn-down latch, even when he blinked hard and rubbed his eyes. Everything else in his small apartment might as well have been invisible; it was just this fucking lock consuming all his thoughts. \"Fuck, I need to get some sleep,\" he growled at himself, but he knew better than to think it'd be happening anytime soon with that goddamn lock staring him down like a challenge."
