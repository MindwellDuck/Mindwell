Little Lily's fever spiked so suddenly, and her breathing became so labored that I barely had time to throw on my coat before rushing out the door.\n\nThe nurse who greeted us was familiar, one of those faces from the blur of Jim's funeral. Seeing her again sent a shiver down my spine, dredging up memories I'd rather keep buried. It felt like an omen, Emma, a grim reminder of what we've lost and could lose again.\n\nThe wait in the ER was agonizing. Each minute ticked by like an hour, each beep of the monitor a dagger plunging into my heart. I couldn't help but think, \"What if it's something serious? What if Lily ends up like Jim?\" My mind played out worst-case scenarios in vivid, terrifying detail.\n\nThe doctor finally arrived, calm and collected, but all I could focus on was his grave expression. It took every ounce of my self-control not to scream, \"Is she going to die too?!\" But he just said it was a severe case of pneumonia, treatable with antibiotics. I felt relief wash over me, but it was fleeting. After all, they said Jim would be okay too...\n\nI know I'm prone to worrying too much, Emma, but can you blame me after everything we've been through? I just want to protect Lily from any harm, no matter how small or unlikely. She's my world now, and I won't let anything happen to her.\n\nPlease don't worry about us. We're home now, and Lily's already looking better. I'll keep you updated on her progress. Just promise me one thing: next time we meet, let's talk about something happy, something far removed from hospitals and loss.\n\nYours,\nAlexandra"
