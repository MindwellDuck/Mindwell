She scrolls through social media, pausing at a photo of an old colleague who now works at a prestigious hospital abroad. The colleague is smiling broadly, surrounded by colleagues at a fancy gala, her awards and achievements proudly displayed on the mantle behind her. The nurse feels a pang in her chest as she compares her own quiet life to her former peer's flourishing career. She takes a deep breath, closing the app with a sense of resentment gnawing at her.",

She just kissed enough asses to get her name on a few plaques. BFD.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, I'm happy for her and all... but damn, it's hard not to feel like life's passing me by while I'm stuck here, wiping other people's shitty asses. It's not fair.
