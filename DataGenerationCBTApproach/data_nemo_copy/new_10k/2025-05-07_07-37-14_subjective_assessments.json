His eyes scanned the familiar lines, but today, they seemed written in a foreign tongue. \"Distinguished Service Grant... awarded to Dr. Thompson.\" He felt his brow furrow, the disappointment like a stone sinking in his gut.\n\n\"The hospital committee's choice should have been me,\" he thought, his voice barely audible in the silent room.
