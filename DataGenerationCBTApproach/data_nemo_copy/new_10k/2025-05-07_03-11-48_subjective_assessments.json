I am writing to express my frustration regarding a recent incident involving one of our patients, Mrs. Thompson. I had been treating her for her condition and had maintained professionalism throughout, despite her initial discourtesy towards me earlier in the week.\n\nToday, I received a letter from Mrs. Thompson, sent directly to our hospital administration, complaining about my 'unprofessional' bedside manner. Frankly, Dr. H, I find this accusation baseless and unwarranted. I have always maintained the highest standards of professional conduct with all my patients.\n\nI believe it is high time we address such unfounded complaints seriously. It is not only unfair to me but also sets a precedent for other patients to manipulate the system without consequence. I kindly request you to intervene in this matter and ensure that Mrs. Thompson's complaint does not tarnish my professional record unjustly.\n\nLooking forward to your prompt attention on this issue.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. M"

The kitchen was a symphony of clattering pans and chatter, but it seemed quieter somehow without his usual appreciative grunts echoing through.\n\nI glanced at his table. Empty, except for that untouched plate. His water glass still full, not even a ring from his fingerprints marring its smooth surface. That's weird, I thought. He's always first in line for the shepherd's pie.\n\nMy mind started racing, like it does sometimes when things don't go as they should. What if he didn't like tonight's batch? No, that can't be right. I followed the recipe to a T, just like I always do for him. Maybe he's not feeling well? But he looked fine when he came in. His face was its usual ruddy self, no sign of that pale, pinched look he gets when his arthritis is acting up.\n\nWhat if something happened? What if he suddenly decided he didn't like the shepherd's pie anymore after all these years? Or worse, what if he told someone else it wasn't as good as it used to be? Our reputation is everything in this business. One bad review could send us spiraling downhill faster than a snowball in July.\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear it of the whirling thoughts. It's probably nothing, I told myself. He'll eat it when he gets home, or maybe he was just running late tonight and had to rush off before finishing. Yeah, that's it. No need to worry about something that might not even be a thing.\n\nBut as I turned back to my station, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The 'what ifs' were still there, lingering like shadows at the corners of my mind. I sighed, focusing on the next order as best I could, but it was hard to ignore that untouched plate, mocking me with its silence.\""

His pager buzzed, but he ignored it. *They can wait,* he thought, turning left towards the ER. *My kid's in there.* He didn't notice the nurses bustling around, the other doctors already in scrubs and gloves, ready for another grueling shift. All he saw was that hallway leading to his daughter.\n\nAs he pushed through the double doors, he barked, \"Where is she?\" without looking at anyone in particular.

He didn't notice the charts waiting for his signature, or the code blue announcement paging over the intercom. All he saw was his daughter, pale and scared in that too-big hospital gown.
