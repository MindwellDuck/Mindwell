The clock ticked louder than usual, each second echoing like a gunshot in his mind. His breath hitched as he noticed the empty space beside him where her picture used to be. It was gone now, tucked away after last night's panic attack. His heart pounded, his palms grew sweaty. He felt it again, that familiar tightness in his chest. The room began to spin.

Sweat's trickling down my spine, and I'm on the floor, gasping for air. They're all out there, doing their jobs, being heroes. And here I am, a pathetic mess, crumpled on the kitchen tile. The radio's crackling, alive with their voices, their jokes, their confidence. It's like they're rubbing it in, showing me what I'm not. What I'll never be.\""

It was real, tangible, like a cold hand squeezing her insides.\n\nShe imagined him, stranded on the side of some desolate road, his car hood propped open as he helplessly watched the minutes tick by. Or worse still, the screech of metal, the shatter of glass, his lifeless body trapped amidst twisted wreckage. Her stomach churned at the vivid image, her palms slick with sweat.\n\nHer emotions were her compass, they always had been. They told her something was amiss, that danger lurked just around the corner. She felt it, so it must be true. The knots in her chest, the tension coiling her muscles, they weren't mere anxiety; they were warnings. Her heart knew what her mind didn't.\n\nShe reached for her phone again, fingers trembling slightly as she punched in his number. It rang once, twice, three times before clicking over to voicemail. His cheerful greeting seemed like a mockery now, a harsh contrast to the dread churning within her.\n\nShe paced faster, her heels clicking loudly against the polished floor.
