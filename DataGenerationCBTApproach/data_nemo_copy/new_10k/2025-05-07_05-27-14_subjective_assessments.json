Absently, she traced the intricate pattern etched into the wooden lectern, her gaze fixed on the tiny, framed photo tucked beneath the glass.

I've been meaning to write for ages, but time seems to slip through my fingers like sand these days.\n\nDo you remember those summers we spent at the lake house? The way the sun would paint the sky with fiery hues as it dipped below the horizon? Those were truly idyllic times, weren't they? But really, what's so special about watching a sunset when anyone can do it?\n\nAnd remember how everyone used to say I was the best cook in town? Ha! That was just because they hadn't tasted your grandmother's secret recipe apple pie. Mine was merely adequate, at best.\n\nEven our kids' childhoods were nothing extraordinary. Sure, we had some nice moments - like that time little Tommy scored his first goal in soccer and we all cheered from the sidelines. But really, it was just a simple joy, not worth making too much fuss about.\n\nI must say, though, I've been thinking about you more lately. Since John passed and the kids have flown the coop, this old house feels emptier than ever. It's strange how time can both slow to a crawl and rush by like a thief in the night, isn't it?\n\nWell, I should wrap this up before my tea gets cold again. Give everyone at your end a big hug from me.\n\nTake care,\nEmily"

Instead, he had this emptiness, this heavy unhappiness that felt like a second job. Tonight, as he took his first bite of cold chicken, he noticed a small crack in the porcelain plate - another casualty of his solitary dinners.
