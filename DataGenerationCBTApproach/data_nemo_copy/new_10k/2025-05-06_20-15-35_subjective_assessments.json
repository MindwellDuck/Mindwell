She couldn't remember the last time she hadn't felt this way - the anxiety that gripped her like a vice, making every breath shallow and labored. Today was supposed to be just another day of retirement, but it had started off like any other since he'd gone. She reached for her phone on the bedside table, hands trembling slightly as she scrolled through old emails from her journalism days, hoping to find some solace in familiar words. But all they did was remind her of what she didn't have anymore - a purpose, a deadline, someone to share it with. The empty house seemed even quieter now, echoing with unspoken thoughts and unheard conversations. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself, but the anxiety only tightened its grip. Today felt different somehow, heavier. Like something was about to change again, and she wasn't ready for it.",

She could almost hear him, his gruff voice echoing through the empty rooms, \"It's too early for this shit, woman.\" But he wasn't here anymore. No one was. She picked up her phone again, scrolling past emails until she found one from him. Just a forwarded news article with 'You'll like this' in the subject line. He'd always known what she liked, what she thought before she even said it. Or so it seemed. Maybe that's why his absence felt so heavy, so oppressive. Like he'd taken all the air with him when he left. She could feel it now, his disapproval, his worry, as if he was still here, standing over her, hands on his hips. \"You're overthinking again,\" she imagined him saying. But maybe it wasn't imagination at all. Maybe he was just... quiet today."
