Her face was contorted in agony, her breaths shallow and rapid. I had known her for years; her pain was real, not some imagined symptom born from anxiety. Yet, Dr. Harper barely glanced at her chart before declaring, \"It's just another case of anxiety. Let's get her some Ativan.\"\n\nA chill ran down my spine as I watched him turn away, his mind already made up. How could he dismiss her suffering so flippantly? It was clear to me that he had no intention of investigating further, no interest in pursuing other possibilities. His arrogance, his careless indifference, it was... inexcusable.\n\nI felt a surge of anger rise within me, my fists clenching at my sides. How dare he? How dare he dismiss her like that, without even considering the possibility that there might be more to it? He hadn't even ordered tests, hadn't asked about her recent activities or changes in medication. He had simply looked at her and decided she was just another anxious woman.\n\nAs I helped Mrs. Thompson settle into a bed, I could feel my hatred for Dr. Harper growing with each passing moment. His carelessness could cause more harm than good. It could lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, unnecessary suffering. And all because he couldn't be bothered to consider other possibilities, to look beyond the obvious.\n\nI made a mental note to keep an eye on Mrs. Thompson's case, to ensure that she received the proper care she deserved. I would not let her suffer due to Dr. Harper's arrogant assumption. After all, who was he to decide what was best for my patient? He didn't know her like I did. He hadn't seen her struggle, hadn't heard her fears and concerns. He had simply formed an opinion based on nothing more than a cursory glance at her chart.\n\nI knew then that I would never trust Dr. Harper with any of my patients again. His lack of professional curiosity, his refusal to consider alternative possibilities, it was unacceptable. And I wouldn't stand for it, not in my hospital, not on my watch."

I'd spent my life teaching, guiding, and here I was, forgotten like an old textbook gathering dust on a shelf.\n\nI couldn't bear the thought of being left behind. Every word she'd written seemed to taunt me now, a cruel reminder of what once was. It would only get worse from here, wouldn't it? A silent, slow descent into irrelevance. I could see it all playing out in my mind's eye, as clear as if it were happening right now. The isolation, the loneliness... I just knew it would be too much to bear.\n\nI sighed, folding the letter neatly and placing it back on the table. It was going to be a long night, I could feel it.
