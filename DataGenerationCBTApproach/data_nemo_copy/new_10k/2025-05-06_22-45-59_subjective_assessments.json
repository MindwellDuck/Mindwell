No, they don't. It's just my duty, isn't it? Always has been, always will be.\n\nAnd now, look at this mess! Flies buzzing around like we're some roadside diner. I swear, if it weren't for customers like him, I'd close up shop and call it a day. But no, I'll just have to clean this up myself. Again.\n\n*Honestly, where are the manners these days?*"
