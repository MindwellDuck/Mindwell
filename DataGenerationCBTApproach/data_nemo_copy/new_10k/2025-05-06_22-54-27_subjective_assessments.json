Beside him, Sarah slept peacefully, unaware of the storm brewing within him.\n\n*Why couldn't I make her laugh like that?* He thought bitterly, his stomach churning with jealousy. *She never touches me like that.* His mind raced, comparing every detail - Jake's confident smile, his perfect teeth, his broad shoulders. He felt smaller, paler, lesser in every way.\n\n*What does Jake have that I don't?* He wondered, anxiety clawing at his throat. *Why isn't Sarah happy with just me?* The questions swirled, each one a dagger plunging into his self-worth. He couldn't shake the feeling of inadequacy, the unfair comparison gnawing at him like a relentless beast."
