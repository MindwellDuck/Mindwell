She could swear she heard a faint click, like someone had just snapped their fingers. She shook her head sharply, trying to dislodge the thought that someone was out there, lurking, waiting. The bell above the door chimed suddenly, making her jump. An elderly woman stepped in, looking around with casual curiosity. But behind her, she could have sworn she saw a figure dart back into the shadows. Her heart pounded in her chest as she forced herself to greet the customer with a trembling smile.",

My fingers brushed against the cool ceramic of a mug that caught my eye - it was a bold blue, unlike any of the others. A warmth spread through me as I remembered the smile on my friend's face when she'd given it to me last Christmas. \"It's perfect for you,\" she'd said, her eyes crinkling at the corners.\n\nI felt a sudden pang of loneliness, missing her already even though we'd just seen each other yesterday. It must be true then, I thought, as I poured my coffee into the mug, the dark liquid swirling around the bold blue design. She's moving away soon, and things will never be the same. My eyes welled up slightly at the thought, but I blinked it away, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nI decided right then that I wouldn't use this mug until she was gone for good. It felt too final, too much like goodbye. So, I placed it back in the cabinet, leaving it untouched amidst its brighter, newer companions. As I closed the door, I couldn't shake the feeling of sadness that settled over me, a cloud on an otherwise sunny morning."
