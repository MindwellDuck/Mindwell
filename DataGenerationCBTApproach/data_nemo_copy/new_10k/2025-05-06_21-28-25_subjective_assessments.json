Would that have been enough to keep him here?\" My heart ached at the thought. \"Stupid what-ifs,\" I mumbled, closing the book and hugging it to my chest.\n\n\"Life's not some grand novel where you can go back and rewrite chapters,\" I told myself, standing up and brushing off my skirt. \"You can't change what happened, no matter how many times you ask 'what if?'\" I nodded to myself, as if that made everything okay. Because what else could I do? That's just who I am - always asking 'what if?' And maybe, just maybe, one of those 'what ifs' will finally make sense."
