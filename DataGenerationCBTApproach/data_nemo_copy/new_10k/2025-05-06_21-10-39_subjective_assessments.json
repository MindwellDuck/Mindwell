The warmth in his laughter grates on me like coarse salt on an open wound. I feel it, the personal affront, as if he has taken something precious and intimate, something that was ours, and made it his alone.\n\nI find myself leaning forward, my hands gripping the edge of the table, knuckles white with tension. I expect him to glance over, to acknowledge me, but he doesn't. It is as though I am not here, or worse, as if I never existed in this place that was once our shared haven.\n\nThe patrons laugh along with him, oblivious to the undercurrent of my disquiet. But how could they understand? They do not know what it is like to have your past rewritten without your consent. I feel a surge of resentment towards them too, for their complicity in his revisionism.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful that he keeps our husband's memory alive, but all I can feel is the hollow emptiness where my role in that story once was. It is as if I am being erased, one laughter-filled evening at a time.\""
