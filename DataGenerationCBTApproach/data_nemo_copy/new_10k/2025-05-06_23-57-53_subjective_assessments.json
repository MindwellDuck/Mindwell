Her reflection in the dark glass seems to stare back at her, echoing the silence that has become all too familiar since the divorce. The loneliness is palpable, like an unwelcome guest that's overstayed its welcome. She takes a sip of her now cold tea, her eyes lingering on the happy couple next door, before rising to clear her solitary place setting.",

Six freaking months it's been sitting here, gathering dust among the chaos of my office. I can't believe she had the audacity to send something without checking if it would even reach me. Typical of her, always so careless.\n\nI snatch it up, running my fingers over the familiar handwriting. It's still sealed, the ink smudged slightly where her pen must have leaked. My heart pounds in my chest like a battering ram. How dare she invade my space like this? After all we've been through, after all I've done for her...\n\nI struggle to tear it open, my hands shaking with anger. The paper cracks and crinkles under my grasp. Inside, there's just a single sheet of lined notebook paper, filled with her neat, looping script. I scan the lines, my eyes widening at each word.\n\nShe dares to apologize? To say she misses me? After everything that happened? **How could she?** Doesn't she understand how much this hurts? How could she send this and expect anything but anger in return?\n\nI crumple the letter in my fist, crushing it until it's a tight ball. I don't notice the other things - the small, heartfelt words about our past, the mention of her new job, the subtle hint at a possible reconciliation. All I see is red, all I feel is anger. She should have known better than to send this. She should have known how it would make me feel.\n\nI storm out of the office, leaving the mess behind me. I don't notice the other letters on my desk, unopened but not ignored like hers. I don't see how the rest of my life is moving forward while I'm stuck in this moment of anger and resentment. All I know is that she should have known better. She should have done something different. Anything but this."
