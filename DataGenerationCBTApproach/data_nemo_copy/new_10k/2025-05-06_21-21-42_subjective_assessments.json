His mother always expects perfection from him, and he tends to view situations as either perfect or disastrous.\n\n**Alex's Journal Entry:**\n\n*Dear Diary,*\n\n*Today was one of those days where I felt like everything was slipping through my fingers. I was in the zone, coding away at work, when an email popped up from Mom. The subject line alone sent a chill down my spine: \"Your Father's Ashes.\"*\n\n*You'd think I'd be used to it by now, the sudden reminders of Dad. But no, every time it feels like a punch in the gut all over again. It's not like I can just turn off these feelings or something.*\n\n*I opened the email, and there it was, her simple message about scattering his ashes. I could almost hear her voice, calm and collected, arranging everything just so. As if she could make up for losing him by planning the perfect ceremony.*\n\n*And then it hit me. The sorrow, like a wave crashing over me. It's been six months, but it still feels like yesterday. Some days I think I'm doing okay, managing without him. But other days, like today, it's like I've lost him all over again.*\n\n*I always thought I'd be the one to take care of Mom after Dad was gone. That I'd be strong for her, make sure everything was perfect. But today, I just feel... overwhelmed. Like a failure. It's either I'm doing everything right or nothing at all. There's no in-between.*\n\n*I don't know how to navigate this grief, diary. It's like walking on a tightrope, with only two choices: fall off one side into despair, or keep going until I collapse from exhaustion. There's no room for anything else.*\n\n*I just wish... I wish things could be different. That Dad was still here, that Mom didn't have these expectations, that grief wasn't so damn black and white.*\n\n*Until tomorrow,*\n*Alex*\n\n**Writing Style:** Informal, introspective, expressive.\n**Personality of Alex:** Struggles with expectations, feels the pressure to be perfect, keeps his emotions bottled up.\n**Situation:** Grieving the loss of his father while dealing with his mother's high expectations."

The sun dipped low outside, casting long shadows that seemed to dance mockingly around him. His wife's knitting needles lay untouched on the couch, a half-finished scarf still attached, as if she'd just stepped away for a moment. But he knew better; she was gone now, taken by a swift and merciless illness six months ago. The emptiness of their home was palpable, each room echoing with memories that only served to deepen his melancholy. Today, on what would have been their 50th wedding anniversary, he found himself not celebrating but reminiscing, the weight of her absence settling heavier upon him than ever before.",

Yet, there was no evidence to support his suspicions except the quiet and her untouched knitting.
