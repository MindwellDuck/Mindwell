The clock on the wall ticked louder than usual, each second echoing his weary thoughts. He tossed his keys onto the console by the door, the jingle sounding more like a funeral bell than its usual cheerful self.\n\nHe'd been looking forward to seeing Sarah's warm smile after such a dreary day.

He couldn't help but think that she was probably stuck in traffic or had stopped by the store without bothering to call, as if his day wasn't shitty enough.\n\nHe collapsed onto the couch, kicking off his shoes with a sigh. The house seemed emptier than usual, colder too, despite the warmth of the setting sun outside. He grabbed the remote control but didn't turn on the TV. What was the point?

Irritation? It felt bigger than that somehow, like a dark cloud hanging over him.\n\nHe stood up and started pacing around the house, his footsteps echoing through the empty rooms. He tried telling himself it was just one bad day, but it felt like more than that. It felt like everything was stacking up against him. He'd have to deal with this shitstorm alone because Sarah wouldn't understand anyway.\n\nHe stopped by the kitchen window, looking out at the gathering darkness. A solitary streetlight flickered on, casting long shadows across the quiet street. It reminded him of how he felt - alone in his despair, surrounded by darkness that no one else seemed to notice or care about.\n\nHe leaned against the countertop, rubbing his temples. His day had been tough, yeah, but wasn't it always? He couldn't remember a time when things had been easy for him. Maybe this was just who he was - destined to carry the weight of others' suffering while everyone else went on with their happy little lives.\n\nThe front door opened, and Sarah walked in, her face flushed from the heat outside. \"Hey,\" she said, smiling brightly at him. \"I'm sorry I'm late.\"\n\nHe looked at her for a moment before turning away, his shoulders slumped. \"It's fine,\" he muttered, walking back into the living room without waiting for her response.\n\nAs she closed the door behind her, the house seemed even emptier than before."
