The usual chatter was absent; everyone else had gone home to their families hours ago. She reached into her pocket for her wedding ring, a habit she hadn't broken despite it being three years since the divorce. As she rubbed the smooth band between her fingers, she noticed a photo on the bulletin board - a colleague's child in a police uniform, grinning from ear to ear. A pang of regret hit her like a punch to the gut. She looked at her own empty hands, no ring, no child, just calluses and a faint tremor from too many late-night patrols.",

Trying to rub it in my face or something?\" She shook her head, her grip tightening around the wedding band she'd been holding for years."

She'd been in here every Tuesday for the past year, and today was no exception - except it was. I could feel it in my bones.\n\nI tried to catch her eye, but she was already at the history section, her back turned towards me. Fine, I thought, maybe she's just having a bad day. I walked over anyway, eager to ask about that new biography she'd been eying last week. But as I opened my mouth, she spun around and gave me this... look. Like she hadn't even seen me.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said abruptly, her cheeks flushing. \"I didn't mean to waste your time.\" Then she was gone, leaving me standing there like a spare part.\n\nI felt the familiar sting of rejection, that old ache in my chest. She'd never blown me off like this before. I must've done something wrong, right? Maybe I hadn't restocked her favorite shelf fast enough yesterday. Or maybe it's because I didn't have that new releases catalog ready for her yet.\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my hair. Guess I'll just have to figure out what I did this time and make sure it doesn't happen again."

Mrs. Thompson felt a pang of irritation at the accusatory stance, but pushed it aside. After all, it was her mistake.\n\n\"Maybe you should check your work more carefully next time,\" the parent snapped, turning on their heel and walking away. Mrs. Thompson watched them go, a sense of guilt weighing heavy in her stomach. She knew she'd let herself down, but more than that, she felt like she'd let this student down too. She made a mental note to double-check every worksheet from now on, determined not to make the same mistake again. It was her responsibility, after all, to ensure every grade was accurate.\n\nThat evening, as she sat at her kitchen table, grading more papers, she found herself tensing up whenever she encountered one of this student's worksheets. She couldn't shake the feeling that it was somehow his fault she'd made an error, that he should have studied harder or asked for help if he didn't understand something. It wasn't fair, but she couldn't help but feel that way. After all, it was his grade on the line, not hers.\n\nAs she finished grading, she couldn't wait to get back to school tomorrow, determined to set things right with this student. She would spend extra time explaining the concepts he'd missed, make sure he understood everything perfectly before giving him another chance at the material. It wasn't just her job; it was her responsibility to ensure his success."
