It was as if all the warmth and color drained from the room, leaving behind an icy, empty void. His smirk lingered like a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nI stood there, frozen, as murmurs rippled through the crowd. My wife's hand found mine, giving it a squeeze, but I barely felt it. In that moment, I wasn't just an artist; I was 'that tired clich\u00e9 painter'. Harrington had labeled me, and now everyone else seemed to see it too.\n\nI couldn't help but think, \"Maybe he's right. Maybe my art is nothing more than worn-out ideas.\" The criticism echoed in my mind like a tolling bell, drowning out the usual buzz of a gallery opening. I felt exposed, raw, as if Harrington had peeled back a layer of skin to reveal something ugly and unworthy.\n\nBut despite the sting of his words, I refused to let them define me completely. I took a deep breath, steeling myself against the label he'd hung around my neck like an albatross. I wouldn't let him reduce me to just another 'tired clich\u00e9'. Not today."

No gentle stirrings from my better half, no symphony of snores to ease me into consciousness. I suppose they're still ensconced in some meeting abroad, while here I am, left to face the stark silence alone. My canvas... it's as untouched as if it were a stranger's, those brushes stiff with yesterday's dried dreams. One would think I'd lost my touch, looking at them.\n\nAnd that... that shadow! It darted across the bathroom door like some spectral critic come to haunt me. 'Just a dream,' I tell myself, but the fear lingers, cold and clammy, as if whispering, 'Not good enough.' I can almost hear it now, comparing my progress to those contemporaries who seem to have painted their way into some mythical realm of genius. Their success is so... loud, while mine seems to fade into this quiet, like an unfinished painting left out in the rain.\n\nI must get on with it. No time for such fanciful fears. Yet, here I am, standing before my canvas, feeling smaller than those artists who seem to have mastered time itself. It's absurd, really, this constant comparison. But then again, isn't that what art is? A conversation among equals? Or so it feels when the shadow of doubt creeps in.\""

It's dated three months ago, which is odd because he usually opens his mail right away. I can't help but feel a pang of worry. Why would he hide this?\n\nI've been staring at it all evening, trying to make sense of why he wouldn't want me to see it. The envelope looks official, with the return address of some law firm in the city. My mind's racing with possibilities - is he in trouble? Has something happened that he hasn't told me about?\n\nI keep going over the details in my head: the handwriting on the envelope, the date, the fact that it was hidden. It feels like there must be a reason for this, and I can't shake off the feeling of unease. Tom's been acting strangely lately too - working late more often, being distant when we're together.\n\nI'm not sure what to do with this information right now. Should I confront him about it? Or wait until he's ready to talk? All I know is that this letter feels like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit anywhere in our life together.\n\nUntil tomorrow,\nSarah"
