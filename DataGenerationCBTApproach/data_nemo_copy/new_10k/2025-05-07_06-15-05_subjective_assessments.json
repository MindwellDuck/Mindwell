No, that was 'before.' Before life happened. Before I happened.\" I could feel the bitter sarcasm dripping from each word like acid. \"Either it's all about work now, or it's... her.\" My voice caught on the word, but I forced myself to spit it out, as if saying it aloud would somehow make it less of a threat. Less of a reality. \"It's always fucking black and white with you, isn't it?\" I screamed at the empty room, tears stinging my eyes. \"Work or her. Me or them. There's no goddamn middle ground.\""

He was probably just running late, caught up in some silly little thing that wouldn't matter tomorrow.\n\nShe glanced at the clock, tapping her foot impatiently. He should have been home hours ago. But she knew him, he was reliable like that. She could practically see his schedule unfolding in his mind: the meeting that ran long, the traffic jam on their street, the last-minute errand he'd forgotten earlier today. It was just like him to be so thoughtless of her feelings.\n\nShe sighed, setting down the photograph and heading for the kitchen. She'd start dinner without him, but she'd leave his plate in the oven to keep warm. He'd appreciate that, even if he didn't say it aloud.
