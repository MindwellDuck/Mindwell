She's been dusting the same display case for what feels like hours, her gloved hands moving automatically while her mind wanders to the empty apartment waiting for her after her shift. The bell above the door chimes, startling her from her reverie. A young couple walks in, laughing and holding hands, their eyes shining with love. They don't even glance at her, but she feels a pang of loneliness so sharp it takes her breath away. She turns back to her dusting, blinking rapidly to hold back the sudden tears that threaten to fall.",

The whole day stretches out ahead of me, endless and empty. And now this couple walks in, laughing and happy, like a punch to my gut. They don't even see me, of course. No one ever does. It's always just me here, dusting away the time until I can go home to... to what? An entire apartment waiting for me, but it might as well be empty too. Why does everything have to feel so wholeheartedly alone?\""

No. She was probably still half-asleep downstairs, oblivious to the ticking time bomb in the kitchen.\n\nI stormed down the stairs, my footsteps echoing like thunderclaps. The timer buzzed just as I reached the bottom, a shrill, accusing sound. I rounded the corner into the kitchen, and there it was - her favorite cake, blackened and smoking on the counter. A ruined masterpiece because she couldn't be bothered to wake up two minutes earlier.\n\nI slumped against the counter, feeling the heat of the ruined cake through my shirt. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, but I blinked them back, angry now. This wasn't how it was supposed to be. We were supposed to be a team, waking up together, sharing in the joy and stress of baking her stupid cake. But she couldn't even do that right.\n\nI swiped at the flour on the counter, sending some of it flying into the air like tiny, white confetti. It landed on my face, sticking to the tears I hadn't been able to hold back. Great. Now I looked like a mess too. This wasn't how mornings were supposed to be. They were supposed to be... better."
