His wife had been forgetting things lately, but this small oversight gnawed at him. He felt unseen, his routines disrupted by her absentmindedness.

The house felt colder without her warmth, her presence reduced to mere echoes of her former self.",

I'd made it for her last night, just like every other morning this week. But here it was, untouched, a silent testament to her growing lapses. I could feel a knot forming in my stomach, a familiar frustration bubbling up.\n\n*She should have noticed,* I thought, *she should have thanked me.* Hell, she should have at least finished it before it went cold and bitter. But no, she'd left it there, just like she'd left me hanging this morning with her usual silent treatment.\n\nWhen I got home today, the house was quiet, save for the ticking of the clock. She was there, buried under a mountain of blankets on the couch, nose deep in some novel or another. She didn't even look up when I came in, didn't greet me like she should have. Just like every other day this week.\n\n*The house isn't supposed to feel this cold,* I thought, *not without her warmth.* But here we were, the echoes of her laughter replaced by the hollow tick-tock of time passing us by. She was there, but she wasn't really present, not in the way she should be.\n\nI sighed, running a hand through my hair. This wasn't how it was supposed to be. Not at all.\""
