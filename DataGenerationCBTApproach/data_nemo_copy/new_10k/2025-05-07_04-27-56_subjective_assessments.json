Her hand moved like lightning, snatching the phone from his grasp. Ancient? She would show him ancient. With a growl, she crushed the device in her fist, the plastic cracking under her strength. Into the waste bin it went, a symbolic burial of his disrespect. She could feel her rage boiling over, and she let it guide her words, sharp as scalpels. \"Either you show some respect,\" she spat, \"or I'll ensure you spend your internship scrubbing toilets.\" Her voice was thunder, echoing her anger, her reality. This was justice, her emotions screamed at her, and she acted accordingly."
