Some nameless, faceless art snob hiding behind a keyboard, deciding they know better than anyone else what's good or not. I spent months pouring my heart and soul onto those canvases, and this... this 'art expert' has the nerve to call it 'indulgent' and 'amateurish'. *Hmph.* Clearly, they've never had their world turned upside down by tragedy.\n\nAnd let me guess, because my wife isn't here to hold my hand through life anymore, that makes my art automatically subpar? As if grief is some sort of creative inhibitor. *Please.* It's not like I haven't created meaningful work under less than ideal circumstances before. But no, this critic has decided that my once-promising career (their words, mind you) is now nothing more than a pathetic attempt at artistic expression. *How very kind of them.*\n\nI mean, who even cares about some two-bit local rag's opinion anyway? It's not like they're The New York Times or something. *Pfft.* I bet this critic can't even paint their way out of a paper bag. But no, they sit there in their ivory tower, throwing around words like 'indulgent' and 'amateurish', acting like they know what real art is supposed to look like.\n\nI should be grateful for the 'exposure', I suppose? *Ha.* Well, let me tell you something, Mr. or Ms. Mystery Critic - you can take your exposure and shove it. I didn't get into this business for accolades or praise. I do this because it's who I am, because it's what my wife would have wanted me to keep doing, no matter how hard it gets.\n\nSo, go ahead, critic. Write all the nasty reviews you want. It won't change anything. My art is mine, and I'll decide whether it's good or bad, not some random stranger hiding behind a pen name. *End of story.*"
