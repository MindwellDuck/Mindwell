Or worse, what if he hadn't moved all day while she was gone? She quickly took the stairs two at a time, worry etched on her face.",

The soft thud from upstairs barely registered consciously, but my body tensed instantly. My heart started pounding like a drum in my chest.\n\n'What if,' I thought, 'what if that was Tom falling? He hasn't been himself lately.' The worry lines etched themselves deeper into my forehead as I envisioned him lying there, unable to move, waiting for me to find him.\n\nI took the stairs two at a time, my footsteps echoing through the quiet house. Each step seemed to amplify the dread growing within me. 'It could have been anything,' I rationalized, 'anything but a book falling.' I didn't even entertain the idea that it might be something as innocuous as a toppled picture frame.\n\nAs I reached the top of the stairs, I found Tom sitting up in bed, his back propped against pillows, a book lying open beside him. He looked at me, surprised but unharmed. 'Hey,' he said, 'I didn't hear you come home.'\n\nI let out a sigh of relief, my shoulders slumping as the tension drained away. But the worry lingered at the back of my mind, like a shadow I couldn't quite shake off.\""

Again?\" I muttered under my breath, glaring at the steaming pan of 'my' seafood paella now labeled as 'Chef Jordan's Special.' The kid grinned like he'd just won a Michelin star, while our owner, Monsieur Leclair, beamed at him like he was his own son. \"This is ridiculous,\" I thought, feeling that familiar knot twist in my stomach.\n\nI could see it now - the menus would change, and that little punk would take all the credit. Every customer raving about 'his' dish would be another nail in my coffin. My signature, my passion, stolen right under my nose. How could this happen? I'd slaved over this recipe for years, and now...now it was just another stepping stone for some upstart to climb on.\n\nI felt the panic rise like bile in my throat. Dinner rush would be a nightmare - every plate of paella served would be a slap in the face. How could I stand there, watching them enjoy 'his' creation? It was unbearable. I wanted to scream, to throw something, but what good would that do?\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. But it was no use - my mind raced with images of disaster. I saw the kitchen in chaos, customers complaining, Leclair firing me on the spot... All because some kid had the audacity to take my recipe and run with it. It was unthinkable, unbearable...and yet, it was happening right before my very eyes."

He stilled, guilt surging within him like an unwelcome, yet familiar flood.\n\n\"Retirement,\" he muttered to himself, as if tasting the word for the first time. It left a bitter tang on his tongue, a reminder of promises unkept. His eyes darted back to her smile, then to the potatoes awaiting his attention. He sighed, \"I should be cooking for our memories, not these strangers.\" Each potato seemed heavier now, their peels clinging stubbornly, echoing his own reluctance to let go of duty.\n\nHe picked up a potato, its rough skin brushing against his thumb. \"She would have wanted me to be happy,\" he mused, but the words felt hollow, overshadowed by the magnitude of his perceived transgression. He minimized her understanding, magnified his guilt. Yet, he was unaware of this cognitive dance, seeing only what he believed was truth: his continued cooking, a betrayal of her memory."
