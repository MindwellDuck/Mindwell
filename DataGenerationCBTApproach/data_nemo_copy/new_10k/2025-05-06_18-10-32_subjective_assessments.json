It was not a physical pain, but an emotional one, gnawing and insistent. She could feel it spreading like tendrils, threatening to consume her entire being.\n\n\"What if today is no different?\" she thought, her grip tightening on the pencil poised above the paper. \"What if I can't find inspiration? What if this emptiness becomes permanent?\"\n\nShe sighed, her reflection in the window revealing eyes filled with anxiety. The 'what ifs' were relentless, a ceaseless whisper at the back of her mind, each one more ominous than the last. She knew she should ignore them, push through them, but they were like a dense fog, obscuring any clear view of her artistic path.\n\nYet, despite the creeping despair and the endless procession of 'what ifs', there was also an undercurrent of annoyance. It was not directed at herself, nor at her art, but rather at the unseen forces that seemed intent on thwarting her creative spirit. She felt like a sailor lost at sea, buffeted by storms she could neither see nor understand.\n\nBut despite it all, she remained seated, determined. For even in the depths of her despair, she knew one thing for certain: she would not yield to the 'what ifs'. Not today. Not ever."

Instead, what greets me is an empty gasoline canister mockingly discarded in our garage. It's as if the last vestiges of fuel have been sucked dry, much like my patience after a long shift.\n\nI must remind myself that this wasn't done maliciously; it was merely another instance of my partner's absent-mindedness. Yet, it's these very instances that seem to accumulate, forming an irritating pattern that's hard to ignore. It's not as if they did something worthy of celebration today - like remembering to fill up the tank before running out, or perhaps asking whether we had any gasoline left before using the last can.\n\nNo, there were no such positive occurrences today. Just another careless mistake added to an ever-growing list. I suppose I should be grateful for small mercies; at least they didn't leave the lawnmower running while they went off to do who knows what. But even that thought feels hollow, discounted somehow, as if it doesn't really count in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI find myself standing here, surrounded by the echoes of their oversight, feeling a profound sense of unease. It's not just about the inconvenience of having to make an unplanned trip to the gas station before dinner; it's about the constant niggling feeling that my partner's positive actions are somehow nullified by these repeated oversights.\n\nBut perhaps I'm being unfair. Perhaps I should try to see this as a minor mishap, not another strike against their character. Yet, it's difficult to shake off this nagging sensation that such occurrences aren't merely isolated incidents, but indicative of something more... troublesome. And until that changes, it seems these empty cans will continue to punctuate our lives, like so many full stops at the end of a sentence - or perhaps, a relationship.\""
