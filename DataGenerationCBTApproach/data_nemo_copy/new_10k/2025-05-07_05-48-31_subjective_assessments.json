It was like the world was black and white, and he was stuck in the gray, fading into nothingness.\n\nHe sighed, crumpling the note in his fist before tossing it into the recycling bin. \"Guess I'm just not cut out for this 'initiative' stuff,\" he said quietly, as if confessing to an old, forgotten friend.
