He'd been reviewing her latest article, a piece she'd poured over for weeks, investigating a local corruption case that had left her sleepless nights and tense dinners. As she stepped in, he tossed the printout onto his desk, the pages dog-eared and inked with red markings. \"This is garbage,\" he growled. She felt her cheeks flush, anger simmering beneath her skin as she watched him crush her weeks of work into a crumpled ball.",

My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the next item to scan, my professional smile feeling forced and brittle.\n\nI'm not old enough to be anyone's grandmother, I thought bitterly. Not yet, anyway. The lines around my eyes, the gray hairs mixed in with the brown, they're just signs of a life well-lived, aren't they? My mind raced, painting vivid pictures of his shocked expression when he realizes how wrong he was, how rude he'd been to assume.\n\nBut what if he's right? What if I am old, outdated, replaced by younger, fresher faces? The thought sent a chill down my spine, a cold fear that settled in the pit of my stomach. I pushed it away, focusing on the next customer instead, but his face was blurred, indistinguishable from the one that still haunted me.\n\n\"Grandma,\" he'd said. And just like that, I felt old. Older than my years, older than my experiences, older than my very soul. I could feel it creeping in, the resentment, the anger, the fear. All because of two little words. Two little words that said so much more."
