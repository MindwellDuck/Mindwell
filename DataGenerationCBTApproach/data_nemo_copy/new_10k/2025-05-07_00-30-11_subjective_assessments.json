It was like a sudden storm cloud blocking out the sun. Either they understood art and hated my work, or they were ignorant fools who wouldn't appreciate true talent anyway. There's no in-between with these people, I thought. My painting is either brilliant genius or complete garbage. Anything less than full admiration is a personal attack on me and my abilities."

I'm not just some temp they can shove aside. But apparently, that's exactly what they did. I'm either invisible or a complete fucking failure now.\n\nI mean, come on! How could they pick him over me? It's not like he has any more experience than I do. He probably just schmoozed his way into it. That's the only explanation, right? Either you're a winner like Jake, or you're a loser like me. There's no in-between.\n\nI deleted the email as soon as I'd read it, but not before taking a screenshot. Call me petty, but fuck him if he thinks he can lord this over me. I'm better than that. Or at least, I should be. Either way, this isn't over.\n\nNow, I'm stuck here, stewing in my own pissed-off juices, while he's off celebrating his big win. It's either Jake's world now, or no world for the likes of me. Fucking brilliant.\n\n---"
