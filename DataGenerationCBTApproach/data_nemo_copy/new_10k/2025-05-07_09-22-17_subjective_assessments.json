The once vibrant colors were now muted and faded, much like her feelings of love and hope that seemed like a distant dream. Her fingers traced the edges of the frame, the cool glass sending an icy chill up her spine. She hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath until it all came rushing out in a heavy sigh. The weight of her past felt heavier than ever as she placed the photo facedown on her desk, a silent vow to not let it consume her again.",

It's just another fucking reminder of how everything went wrong.\n\nI mean, who gets divorced and actually feels better about themselves afterwards? Not me, that's for sure. I'm the one left picking up the pieces, wondering where all the good times went. They were probably just bullshit anyway, blown out of proportion by my idiot heart.

Even when there's food, it might as well be empty because nothing ever tastes right anymore. Breakfast is a chore, lunch is a bore, and dinner? Well, dinner is just another reminder that I can't even enjoy my favorite meal without this oppressive cloud hanging over me.\n\nWork is no different. Always the same old faces, always the same monotonous tasks. Every project feels like a mountain, every task an insurmountable challenge. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, a constant hum echoing my internal thoughts - 'This is never going to change.'\n\nEvenings are spent in silence, or so it seems. My partner sits nearby, engrossed in their book, the soft turning of pages another reminder of the void between us. I try to paint, but the brush feels heavy, the canvas vast and intimidating. Always an empty canvas, never a completed masterpiece.\n\nAnd then, the day is over. Another whole day spent in this endless cycle. The bed greets me with its familiar cold embrace, and as I close my eyes, I can't help but think, 'Tomorrow will be just like today. Whole days, wasted.'\""
