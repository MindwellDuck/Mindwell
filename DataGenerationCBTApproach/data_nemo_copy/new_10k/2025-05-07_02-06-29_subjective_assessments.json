You've always been careful about locking your door, but tonight you forgot to after letting your neighbor's cat in earlier. Suddenly, at 3 AM, you hear your door rattling. Describe how you react and what goes through your mind as you listen intently for any sound beyond the usual nighttime hum of the city.\n\n**Response:**\n\n*In the dead of night, my heart leapt into my throat as I heard the unmistakable rattle of my front door. The audacity! Who could it be? My mind raced through possibilities, each one more alarming than the last.*\n\n*The creaking floorboard outside my bedroom confirmed my fears. They were in the apartment. But why? What did they want? My thoughts whirled like a storm, all revolving around me, around this intrusion into my sanctum.*\n\n*I froze, barely daring to breathe. The city's usual symphony of nighttime sounds seemed muted, as if even it held its breath, waiting for what was to come. I knew every sound intimately; the hum of the refrigerator, the distant rumble of a late-night bus, the tap-tap-tap of rain against the windowpane. But this... this was something else.*\n\n*I felt a surge of annoyance. How dare they disrupt my peaceful night? Didn't they know I had work in the morning? As if the world revolved around their whims, their caprices. It was infuriating, really.*"
