A little laughter doesn't change that.\" She chopped the vegetables with efficient, precise motions, each slice an unspoken retort to their whispers. \"I mean, really,\" she huffed, \"As if a couple of whippersnappers could teach me something about running this kitchen.\" She didn't notice the way her shoulders hunched slightly, or how she avoided looking at the photograph of the residents enjoying last week's meal, beaming around the table laden with food. To her, those moments were just another day at work. Nothing special, nothing to dwell on. It was almost as if she couldn't quite see how much they loved her cooking, her warmth, her presence in their lives."
