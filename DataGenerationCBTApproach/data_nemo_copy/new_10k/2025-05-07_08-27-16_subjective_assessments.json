Always something slipping through the cracks, always some urgent matter that needs my attention right this very second.\n\nI swear, if this is just another form or request for something stupid, I'm going to lose it. The entire school can't function without me for five minutes, can they? It's never-ending, and I'm bloody exhausted. But do they care? Nope. Never do."
