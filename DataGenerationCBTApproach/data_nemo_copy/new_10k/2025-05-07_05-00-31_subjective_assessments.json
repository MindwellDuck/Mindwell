The metal felt cold, accusatory almost, as I wrapped my fingers around its grip. It seemed to reproach me, demanding answers for the years we'd let slip by without acknowledging what he'd given up.\n\nA sense of resentment began to simmer within me, like milk left too long on the stove. Why hadn't he spoken up? We could have discussed it, found a way to honor his past while moving forward together. But no, he'd simply shoved it aside, expecting me to pretend it didn't exist. And now, here I was, holding the weight of his silence in my hand.\n\nI couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance at him, at us. Why did everything have to be so difficult? So complicated? It wasn't as if I'd been eager to leave our old life behind either. But someone had to make the effort, take responsibility for our shared past. And it certainly hadn't been him.\n\nAs I placed the revolver back in its hiding place, I felt a pang of sadness. Not just for what we'd lost, but for the burden he'd laid at my feet without so much as a word. It seemed like such an unfair division of labor, one that left me feeling both angry and lonely.
