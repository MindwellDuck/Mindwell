Nothing but a fucking mirage in this desert of shit I call life.\n\nTomorrow's his funeral, and she'll be there, my wife. She'll cry, remember the good times we had with him. But me? I'll stand there like a statue, because what do I have to fucking show for it? A marriage that's as empty as this goddamn hallway, and a heart that's turned into a fucking black hole.\n\nSo, fuck you too, universe. You think you can make up for today with yesterday's happiness?
