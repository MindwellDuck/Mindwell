It reads: \"You're just an old hag.\" How do you react to this note, subtly reflecting the cognitive distortion 'Unfair Comparisons'?\n\n**Text:**\n\n*Oh, for crying out loud!* I thought, flattening the damn note against my desktop. *Old hag?* Really? I mean, sure, I've got a few more wrinkles than some of those peppy young things they hire fresh out of teaching school these days. But does that make me an 'old hag'?\n\nI can just see little Miss Perfect down the hall now, with her pep rallies and her 'Inspiration Board' that's always filled with the latest Pinterest trends. She probably couldn't even tell you what color my hair is naturally \u2013 it's been this mousy brown for so long, she'd think I was born like this.\n\n*I'm not old,* I muttered to myself, crumpling the note into a tiny ball and tossing it into the trash can with more force than necessary. *I've just... acquired more wisdom.* That's what it is. Experience. And experience counts for something, doesn't it?\n\nBut still, I couldn't shake that stupid phrase from my mind. *Old hag.* It stung. It really did. Because despite all the years I've put in here, all the kids I've taught and touched, there's always some bright young thing ready to sweep in and make me feel like yesterday's news.\n\n*Screw 'em,* I thought, slamming my desk drawer shut. *I'm not going anywhere.* They can have their Pinterest boards and their 'Inspirational Quotes of the Day.' I've got something they don't: time. And that counts for a lot more than they think."
