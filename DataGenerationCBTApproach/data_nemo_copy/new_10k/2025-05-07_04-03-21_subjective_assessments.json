We were supposed to retire together, cheersing over our last big story, not reading about each other in the obituaries. Stupid cancer. He was always so full of life, even when we were up against impossible deadlines. Damn it all, those were good times.\n\nBut what's the point of remembering that now? It's not like it brings him back. And who cares if we had some laughs, shared a few beers after hours. That doesn't change anything. He's still gone. Fucking cancer.\n\nI can hear Sarah, my wife, humming in the kitchen. She's making my favorite dinner, trying to cheer me up. But I can't just... switch off these feelings. It's not like I can appreciate her efforts right now. Not with this damn obituary sitting here, staring at me.\n\nTom deserved better. We all do, but he especially did. He was one of the good ones. And for what? For nothing. All those years, all that work... it doesn't mean shit in the end. So much for 'making a difference.' I can't even enjoy the memories anymore. They're just reminders of how unfair life is.\n\nFuck this. Fuck everything."
