My wife's favorites. She doesn't see me standing here, frozen like an idiot. Just places them on the counter where she used to pay, like they're a fucking habit or something.\n\nI can't take my eyes off those damn flowers. They're perfect, just like she used to like them. Yellow and white, all mixed up together. I swear to god, it's like she's here again, in this fucking store that's gone quiet as a grave since she left.\n\nBut fuck, why today? It's just another Monday, right? Another anniversary passing by like any other day. Except it's not, is it? Because there are these fucking daisies staring me in the face, and I can't fucking move or speak. Can't tell Mrs. Thompson to stop bringing them in.

It can wait. Right now, it's just me and these damn daisies, and they're not letting go anytime soon."
