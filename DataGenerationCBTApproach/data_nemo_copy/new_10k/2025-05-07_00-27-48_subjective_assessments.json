The air was thick with an unidentifiable aroma, acrid yet sweet, as if Nature herself had exhaled a secret breath into that forgotten space. My heart hammered against my ribs like a captured bird, each beat echoing in my ears as I stretched out a trembling hand towards the light switch. As illumination burst forth from the bare bulb, it cast long, dancing shadows across the stone floor, revealing what appeared to be an ancient medical mask, its rusted edges glinting menacingly.\n\nTime seemed to freeze as my gaze locked onto that solitary object. The world beyond it faded into insignificance, swallowed by the choking terror that gripped me. My mind raced, a whirlwind of paranoid imaginings. Was there an intruder? A prowler lurking in the shadows, waiting to pounce? Or perhaps something far more sinister - a plague-ridden rodent carrying God knows what manner of disease?\n\nI stood rooted to the spot, my breath ragged, eyes darting from shadow to shadow as if they might reveal some hidden horror. The mask loomed large in my mind's eye, a silent sentinel of doom, blocking out all other thoughts, all other possibilities. It was all I could see, all I could think about. My world had narrowed down to that single, terrifying detail.\n\nBacking away slowly, I never took my eyes off the mask. Each step felt like a monumental effort, my limbs heavy with dread. I was blind to everything but that one awful sight, deaf to anything but the pounding of my own heart. It was as if the very air had turned toxic, each breath drawing poison into my lungs.\n\nOnly when I reached the safety of the staircase did I realize how ridiculous I must look, cowering from a mere piece of old cloth. Yet even then, I couldn't shake off the creeping unease. The mask remained burnt into my mind's eye, a stark reminder of the unknown lurking in the darkness. It was all I could see, all I could think about. Everything else had faded to insignificance."

She could still taste the happiness, still feel the love that had radiated between them.\n\nShe sighed, putting the photograph back where she found it. \"Guess that's why they say time heals nothing,\" she muttered, wiping away a tear. \"It just makes you forget what happiness feels like.\""
