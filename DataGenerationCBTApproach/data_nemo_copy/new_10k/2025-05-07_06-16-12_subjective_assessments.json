He had expected praise for his handling of little Emma's behavioral issues, but instead, he found her mother complaining to the principal about his \"unnecessary roughness.\" The principal looked up, eyes cold behind his glasses, and said, \"We'll discuss this later, John.\" Now, as he poured himself a coffee, he noticed the others averting their gaze. A photocopy of a disciplinary form lay on the counter, his name printed at the top. He felt the heat rise in his cheeks as he realized everyone had seen it.",

He couldn't help but think they were all whispering about him now, laughing at his expense. His face burned with embarrassment and anger.\n\nHe glanced around, trying to catch someone's eye, but everyone seemed busy, avoiding his gaze. He felt the urge to defend himself, to explain that Emma had been out of control, that he'd only done what was necessary. But he held back, not wanting to make a scene.\n\nAs he sat down at the table, he noticed a few of them exchanging glances. He could almost hear their thoughts: \"Typical John, always getting into trouble.\" He clenched his jaw, determined to keep it together until he could talk to the principal and clear this up once and for all."
