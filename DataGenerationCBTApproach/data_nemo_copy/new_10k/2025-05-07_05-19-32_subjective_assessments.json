There it was, our family portrait, the very embodiment of happier times, now faded and pinned to that dreary bulletin board like some sort of morbid trophy. I felt a surge of anger, hot and fierce, unlike anything I'd experienced in months.\n\nHow could she do this? I thought, my heart pounding against my ribcage. She knew how much that photograph meant to me, to us. It was never just a simple keepsake; it was a testament to our past, to the life we once shared. And now, here it was, reduced to nothing more than a pathetic plea for attention.\n\nI felt my grip tighten around the pushpin, knuckles turning white with effort. This wasn't just about one photograph anymore; it was about every moment we'd ever shared, every memory that had been tarnished by her actions. I couldn't help but think, *This is always how she treats our past.* Always taking, never giving.\n\nAnd the words scrawled in her handwriting - \"Missing our old home\" - they were like a knife twisting in my heart. It was as if she'd taken our entire life together and turned it into some sort of sad, public spectacle. I felt a lump form in my throat, my vision blurring with unshed tears.\n\n*Why did she have to do this?* I wondered, the question echoing through my mind like a mantra. *Couldn't she just let things be? Why does she always have to stir up old pain?* It was never ending, it seemed. Always something new to remind me of what we'd lost.\n\nI stood there for what felt like hours, the rain pounding down around me, the world spinning out of control.
