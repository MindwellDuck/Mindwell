He stared at his phone, willing it to ring, but it remained silent. His partner, usually home by now, had sent a curt text hours ago: \"Working late again.\" A solitary wine glass stood on the counter, half-empty, its contents no longer appealing. He looked around their shared space, once filled with laughter and plans, now echoing with silence and emptiness. His despair grew heavier, each tick of the clock another nail in the coffin of their relationship.",

The words were messy, childish even, but the sentiment was clear: \"I hate myself because you said I'm stupid.\" I felt a pang of anger, like a hot coal in my chest. It wasn't my intention to hurt the kid, but there it was, in black and white. I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks, my heartbeat echoing in my ears. This was wrong, all wrong. I couldn't help but think, 'Of course he feels this way. He's a bright enough child to understand when he's been insulted.' My stomach churned at the thought of that poor boy, sitting there, hating himself because of something I said. It was my fault, wasn't it? I could feel it in my bones. There was no use denying what I felt, after all."
