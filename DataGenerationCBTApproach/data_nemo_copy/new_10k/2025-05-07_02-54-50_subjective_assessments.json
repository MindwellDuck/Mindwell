You've had a long day, and this is the third night in a row that your partner hasn't held up their end of the bargain. Write a monologue reflecting on this situation, using formal language, a frustrated tone, and sarcastic structure to subtly convey your 'What if?' cognitive distortion.\n\n**Text:**\n\"Upon entering my residence today, I was greeted by the sight of the kitchen sink, once again, playing host to an unseemly collection of dirty dishes. It appears that my partner has once more neglected their share of our domestic arrangement. One might think that after two previous transgressions, tonight would witness a change in this regrettable pattern.\n\nBut no, here we are, another evening spent contemplating the grim possibility of a sudden plague of dishwashing-related calamities befalling my household. What if, I wonder aloud to the silent kitchen, some unfortunate incident were to occur due to this chronic neglect? Might not a rogue bacterium, emboldened by such favorable conditions, launch an attack upon our unsuspecting silverware?\n\nOne could almost envision the headline: 'Local Police Officer's Cutlery Succumbs to Deadly Infection; Career in Tatters.' Or perhaps, more likely, I would find myself confronted with the sobering reality of a dishwasher malfunction, brought on by the insidious buildup of grime and grease. The horror!\n\nIt seems my evenings are now destined to be consumed by such morbid musings. But no matter, I suppose it's all in a day's work for a man tasked with keeping not only his city safe but also his kitchen spotless.\""

All of it seemed to pale in comparison to Sarah's critique. It was like a spotlight had been shone on one tiny imperfection, illuminating it while casting everything else into shadow.\n\nI felt a pang of anger, too. Why hadn't she just told me what she meant? What if I'd missed something crucial? The uncertainty gnawed at me, eating away at the satisfaction I'd once felt in my work.\n\nAs I sat there, staring at that comment, I couldn't help but feel like a failure. All because of those seven words. Everything else\u2014the hours of effort, the learning, the growth\u2014it all seemed to fade into insignificance. It was just me and Sarah's words, stuck on an endless loop in my mind.\n\nI knew I should look at the rest of my report, find comfort in the progress I'd made.

The way they'd looked at me, the smirks on their faces when I'd admitted to mixing up the meds. I should've known better, but it's not like I did it on purpose. But who gives a shit about that? Not them, that's for sure.\n\nI could see them now, standing there, laughing like they hadn't a care in the world. Like they weren't responsible for keeping patients alive too. I bet they never make mistakes like that. No, of course not. They're perfect little gods in their white coats.\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest as I stood there, frozen, watching them.

When all I could see, all I could feel, was the burning humiliation of my own mistake."
