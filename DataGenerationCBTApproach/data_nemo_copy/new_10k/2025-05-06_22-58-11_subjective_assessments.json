I never asked him to manage the books back then, so why should he suddenly have a say in this?\""

The room was dimly lit, the only sound the ticking of the old clock she'd bought at a flea market with him. Her eyes flickered to their wedding photo tucked behind an easel, now collecting dust.

It figures, just when I was finally getting some peace and quiet to work, the universe decides to throw a tantrum. I knew it was him, somehow. His ghost haunting my studio, making sure I don't forget. As if I could.\n\nI bent down, gathering the tiny confetti of our failed marriage. Each chip whispered his thoughts at me: 'You're not good enough.' 'You'll never finish anything without me.' 'This place is a dump without me here to keep it tidy.'\n\n'Shut up,' I hissed at the silent room, as if he could hear me. 'I don't need you to tell me what I already know.' But even as I said it, I felt that old familiar sting of doubt, like he'd whispered it right into my ear.\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear it. This was ridiculous. He wasn't here. He couldn't be. And yet, the more I tried to ignore him, the louder his imagined voice became. 'You're pathetic,' it said, echoing through the empty room like a mantra.\n\nI sighed, leaning against the wall for a moment, letting the coolness seep into my bones. Maybe he was right. Maybe I would never finish anything without him here to push me, to tell me what to do. But then again, maybe that was exactly why I needed to prove him wrong.\""

These aren't just paintbrushes; they're a testament to his selfishness, his carelessness. He couldn't even clean up after himself properly.\n\nAnd the nerve of him, using my space like that! As if I didn't have enough room for my own supplies. His art is everywhere now, contaminating mine. It'll be impossible to paint without seeing his colors, hearing his laughter echoing through these empty rooms.\n\nI should've known better than to fall in love with an artist.

I'm just another one of his muses, discarded when he's done using me up.\n\nThese brushes... they're a reminder of everything I lost, everything he took from me.
