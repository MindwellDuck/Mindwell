She had been married to him for decades, yet his sudden silence on the other end of the line, after asking about yesterday's article, felt like an abrupt divorce from their shared reality. Anxiety gnawed at her stomach as she realized tomorrow's paper was due, and she hadn't written a single word.",

What if tomorrow's paper was blank, an unyielding white void staring back at her like an accusation? She could almost hear the ticking clock, each second stretching into an eternity of uncertainty. Her hands, usually steady as she typed away at breaking news stories, now faltered over the keyboard, hesitant, unsure. She sighed, annoyed with herself for this sudden paralysis, but the questions kept coming, each one a tiny, insistent voice whispering catastrophic scenarios in her ear. She couldn't silence them, not even after decades of navigating the unpredictable world of journalism. But she was determined; she would write today's paper, despite the relentless chorus of 'what ifs'."

The old computer in my study hums away, casting its eerie glow down the hallway like some sort of sinister beacon. It's never been this loud before.

The call goes to voicemail again, her cheerful voice chirping out from the speaker like a fucking parody of our current situation. \"Hey, it's me!
