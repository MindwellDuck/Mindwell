But here I am, sweating bullets and imagining every worst-case scenario known to man.\n\nShit, even my neighbor's kid handled that noise better than me last week. He just rolled his eyes when the trash cans fell over. Fuck, why can't I be more like him? Calm and collected, not this anxious mess.\n\nFucking hell, what if someone saw me trembling here in the dark? They'd probably think I'm some kind of pussy who can't even handle a loud noise. Goddammit, why am I such a weakling compared to everyone else?\n\nI gotta pull myself together. No one's gonna save my ass but me. Fuck this noise bullshit, I'm not letting it control me like this again.\n\nChrist almighty, just take deep breaths, man. You're stronger than this."

He refused to acknowledge the brief moments of success he'd had earlier in the week, or the fact that her smile could have been a simple expression of politeness rather than a damning indictment of his worth. No, he would focus on this failure, on the bitter taste of inadequacy it left in his mouth.\n\nHe stormed out of the lab, leaving the remnants of his shattered pride scattered among the broken test tubes and discarded notes.
