Yesterday, it was the damn lawnmower that wouldn't start.\n\nHer husband had been gone for six months now. Six fucking months of people tiptoeing around her, like she was made of glass.

She'd seen and experienced more than most could imagine.\n\nShe grabbed her coat, shoving her arms into the sleeves with more force than necessary.

She was done with sympathy. Done with grief. It was time to get back into the game, time to find a story that would make people forget all about her loss.

What if every message, every memory, every damn breath is a reminder?\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her reflection staring back at her in the glass. \"What if I can't keep doing this?\" The words were barely a whisper, but they echoed in her mind like a shout.\n\nShe shook her head sharply, as if to dislodge the thoughts. \"No,\" she said firmly, turning back to her desk. \"No 'what ifs'. That's not how I operate.\" But even as she spoke, another 'what if' was already forming, ready to keep her company through the long night ahead.\n\nHer phone buzzed again, another message flashing across the screen.

She'd have to start from scratch, and with the conference in two days, time wasn't exactly on her side. As if reading her thoughts, Richard breezed into the room, completely oblivious to the chaos he'd caused.\n\n\"Amelia, darling,\" he said, flashing his charming smile, \"I've got tickets for us to that new exhibition at the museum tonight.

The one where I'm supposed to be presenting my life's work?\"\n\nRichard waved a hand dismissively. \"Oh, come on, Amelia. It's not like they'll notice if you're not there. You've given enough talks in your lifetime.\"\n\nVengefulness, long dormant beneath her usually composed demeanor, began to stir.

Alone. Maybe they'll notice my absence there too.\"\n\nAs he opened his mouth to protest, Amelia held up a hand, her eyes flashing with a challenge he hadn't seen since their early days together. \"And don't bother asking where the laptop is.

Her mind wandered to Tom's warm bed, now empty and cold without him. She imagined his arms around her, his steady heartbeat lulling her to sleep. But duty called, and Emma was nothing if not dutiful.\n\nHer phone buzzed, breaking the quiet. It was Tom, checking in. \"Still at it, I see,\" he wrote.

She felt a flicker of annoyance. Wasn't it enough that she was already burning the midnight oil? Did they have to pile on more work?\n\n\"I'm almost done with the mayor's speech,\" she said, her voice level but tense. \"I'll get to the council meeting notes once I'm finished here.\"\n\nHer editor nodded, but his expression remained stern. \"We need both pieces by morning, Emma. Don't forget, we're running on a tight schedule.\" With that, he disappeared into his office, leaving Emma with her thoughts and her screen full of unyielding words.\n\nAs she turned back to her work, Emma couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. She was tired, yes, but there was something else gnawing at her. A sense of being taken for granted, perhaps? Or was it self-doubt creeping in, whispering lies about her worth?\n\nEither way, she knew one thing for certain: tonight's deadline wouldn't be the last.

Yet, his tone had been so matter-of-fact, so assured, it was almost as if he could peer directly into her mind's eye and witness the chaos within. The untouched document, the half-formed thoughts, the gnawing fatigue - all laid bare before him.\n\nIt was absurd, really, this notion that he could discern her inner workings with such ease. And yet, there it was, a creeping sense of exposure, as if she were a glass display case, open for all to see and judge. She felt the familiar warmth of indignation rising within her, but she pushed it down, burying it beneath layers of duty and obligation.\n\nShe knew better than to challenge him outright, after all. He was her superior, her gatekeeper to the world outside this fluorescent-lit prison. No, it would not do to confront him directly. Instead, she would simply nod along, feign ignorance, and silently resent his intrusion into her mental sanctuary.\n\nAs Emma turned back to her screen, she couldn't help but feel a sense of violation, as if he had reached into her mind and plucked out her thoughts without her consent. It was ridiculous, really, this idea that anyone could read her so easily. And yet, here she was, bending under the weight of his unspoken expectations.\n\nShe sighed, her fingers hovering over the keyboard once more.

It wasn't just a typo or a logical error; it was as if someone had purposefully sabotaged it. But who? And why?\n\nHer mind raced, worry gnawing at her like a relentless virus. She couldn't remember the last time she'd seen such chaos in her beloved code. It was like finding graffiti in an ancient library. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. This wasn't like her. She was Martha, the rock of TechCorp, the one who could solve any problem with just a few keystrokes.\n\nBut today, she felt... old. Her fingers hesitated over the keyboard, unsure. And that worried her more than anything else.",

She sighed, her grip tightening on her mouse. \"Kid doesn't even know what proper syntax looks like,\" she muttered. Her gaze returned to the screen, but the code seemed more alien now, more hostile.\n\nShe couldn't shake off the feeling that this was Sam's doing. He'd been struggling with the basics since he started. Maybe he got frustrated and... \"Damn it,\" she whispered again, her heart pounding harder. She didn't want to believe he'd do something like this on purpose, but why else would the code be like this?\n\nShe leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. This was why they shouldn't hire kids fresh out of college. They didn't understand how things worked around here. How Martha worked. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what she had to do next. She'd have to clean up his mess again, explain it all to him like he was five. \"Jesus,\" she muttered, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, ready to dive into the wreckage and salvage what they could.\n\nBut as she started typing, she felt a pang of guilt. Maybe she was being too hard on him. Maybe this wasn't his fault at all. She sighed, shaking her head. \"Either way,\" she said aloud, her voice resigned, \"someone's gotta fix it.\""
