They're just not that important to me.\n\nI do hope that this award will help inspire other women in entrepreneurship, though.

Not to mention the fact that I've already invested so much time and energy into building a life here.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm just not cut out for this whole adulting thing. Maybe I'm too picky, or maybe I'm just not good enough. But deep down, I know that's not true. I'm a capable person, and I deserve better than to be treated like I'm somehow less worthy because I won't settle for anything less than what I want.\n\nAs I continue to search for my dream apartment, I'm starting to feel like I'm losing myself in the process. I'm constantly comparing myself to others, wondering if I'll ever measure up. But I refuse to give up. I'll keep fighting until I find a place that truly feels like home \u2013 no matter how long it takes."

I swear, some people just have more luck than talent. Anyone else feel like they're stuck in a rut? #designstruggles #fakingittillyoumakeit\""
