It's like we're competing in some kind of invisible Olympics, where the winner gets to bask in the glory of success and the loser is left to pick up the pieces.\n\nBut what really gets me is when people ask me about my \"big break.\" You know, that one project that launched my career into stratospheric heights? Yeah, I don't have one. At least, not yet. And when I try to explain why, I get these condescending smiles and sympathetic nods. Like, \"Oh, you'll get there eventually, Jamie.

They're the ones who already have a track record of success, who can point to tangible proof of their worth. Me? I'm just a ghost hovering on the periphery of the design world, waiting for someone to notice me.\n\nIt's frustrating, because I know I'm capable of so much more. I pour my heart and soul into every project, but somehow, it never seems to translate into real-world results. Maybe it's because I'm just not good enough, maybe it's because I'm too scared to take risks.

Maybe I should just stick to a 9-to-5 job, where the only thing I have to worry about is meeting deadlines and avoiding micromanaging bosses. At least then I'd know exactly what I'm getting myself into.\n\nBut deep down, I know that's not true. I love the freedom of being my own boss, of having the flexibility to choose projects that truly excite me. So I keep pushing forward, even though it feels like I'm running on a treadmill and getting nowhere fast.
