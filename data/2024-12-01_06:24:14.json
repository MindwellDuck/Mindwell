I refuse to entertain any notion that this might simply be a minor oversight, as that would imply a level of incompetence that is simply unacceptable.\n\nAs I walked into the office, I was met with the sight of chaos and disarray, a stark reminder of the abyss that separates us from true professionalism.

The pressure is suffocating me, making it hard to breathe or think straight.\n\nMy friends seem so much more organized, effortlessly juggling multiple clubs and sports teams while maintaining perfect GPAs. They're like superheroes, effortlessly balancing everything. Meanwhile, I'm just barely holding on by a thread. If I had a dollar for every time I've felt like giving up, I'd have enough money to pay for college tuition.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying; it's just that life has become too overwhelming. Every day feels like a marathon, with no finish line in sight. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother showing up to school, knowing I'll just end up feeling like a failure.
