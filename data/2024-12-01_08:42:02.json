I thought maybe if I just gave him more space, he'd come around. Boy, was I wrong. The more space I gave him, the more he seemed to shrink away into himself.

My ex and I were never compatible; we were just two people who happened to share a roof for a while. And now that it's over, I'm excited to start fresh, to find someone who actually gets me.\n\nAs I look back on our relationship, I realize that I was just a pawn in his game of emotional manipulation.

The moment I stepped off the plane, I knew something was off. The humidity hit me like a slap in the face, making my skin crawl. And don't even get me started on the traffic on the way to my hotel. It took forever to get there, and by the time I arrived, I was already exhausted.\n\nBut what really put a damper on my trip was the weather. I had been looking forward to spending days lounging on the beach, but instead, I spent most of my time stuck inside, trying to avoid the torrential downpours. And when the sun finally came out, it was too hot, beating down on me like a relentless drumbeat. I swear, every day felt like a struggle just to make it through.\n\nAnd then there were the bugs. Oh, the bugs. They seemed to be everywhere, buzzing around my head and biting at my skin. I'm pretty sure I lost count of how many times I got stung or bitten. It was like they were trying to drive me crazy.\n\nDespite all these setbacks, I did manage to squeeze in some writing time. But let's be real, it wasn't exactly productive. My mind kept wandering, and I found myself getting distracted by all the little annoyances around me. Like the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, which was supposed to be soothing, but ended up driving me nuts. Or the smell of the frangipani flowers, which was lovely, but made me feel nauseous.\n\nLooking back, I realize that maybe I was expecting too much from this trip. Maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment. But honestly, who needs sunshine and beaches when you can have rain and mosquitoes? Not me, that's for sure.\n\nAs I sit here now, reflecting on my trip, I'm reminded of all the things that didn't go right. And to be honest, it's hard for me to see any positives. I mean, what's the point of going to Hawaii if you're just going to spend your days cooped up indoors, waiting for the storm to pass? It's just not worth it.\n\nIn retrospect, I probably should have just stayed home. At least then I would have known what to expect. But no, I had to go and try to \"get away\" from everything. Big mistake. Next time, I'll stick to the mainland."
