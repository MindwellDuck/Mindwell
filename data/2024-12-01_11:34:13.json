As I navigated my early career, I found myself constantly evaluating those around me - colleagues, clients, even acquaintances - into two distinct categories: incompetent and exceptionally talented.\n\nIt started innocently enough. A meeting would go awry due to a colleague's lack of preparation, and I'd think to myself, \"This guy is really struggling.\" Or, on the other hand, when a client nailed a presentation, I'd mentally file them away as \"a real winner.\" It was almost second nature, this binary thinking.\n\nOver time, however, I began to notice that these labels weren't just limited to work-related interactions. My friends and family members would get lumped into these same categories, too. My sister, for instance, was often seen as \"clumsy\" by our parents, while my best friend was consistently regarded as \"the smartest person I know.\"\n\nAs I reflected on these patterns, I realized that my tendency to label others was deeply ingrained. But what struck me most was how these labels influenced my own behavior. When I encountered someone labeled as \"incompetent,\" I tended to take charge, offering solutions and guidance. Conversely, when I met someone deemed \"exceptionally talented,\" I'd often find myself trying to learn from them, seeking their advice and input.\n\nIt wasn't until I had a particularly heated argument with a coworker that I began to see the impact of my labeling more clearly. We were discussing a project, and I'd made a comment about his lack of experience leading to a flawed approach. He took offense, pointing out that I was essentially saying he was incapable of doing the job. In that moment, I realized that my labeling had created a power imbalance, making him feel belittled and defensive.\n\nSince then, I've made a conscious effort to avoid these labels, recognizing that they're not only subjective but also potentially damaging.

The minute he began, I noticed the font size on his slides was off by a fraction of a point \u2013 it's astonishing how something so trivial can throw off the entire visual flow of the presentation. Furthermore, I'm quite certain he mentioned the Smith report only twice, whereas I distinctly recall him referencing it no less than five times throughout the presentation. It's almost as if he was trying to obscure its significance.\n\nMoving on, I couldn't help but notice that the graphs were slightly askew, which detracted from the overall clarity of the data. And what's with the awkward pause after slide three? It seemed like an eternity before he continued. Not to mention, I'm fairly certain he failed to address the Johnson study altogether, despite mentioning it in passing earlier in the day.\n\nDespite these... minor issues, I do want to commend John on his enthusiasm. His passion for the subject matter was palpable, even if his execution left much to be desired. Nevertheless, I'm still struggling to understand how someone so clearly unprepared could have managed to present such a lackluster performance. One would think that with more preparation, John might have been able to overcome some of these glaring shortcomings."

It is almost as if the academic community has an unspoken preference for the flashy, paradigm-shifting discoveries that capture the imagination of the general public \u2013 rather than the painstaking, incremental advancements that underpin the very foundations of our discipline.\n\nI must confess, however, that I am not entirely surprised by this phenomenon. After all, have we not all witnessed instances where the most innovative ideas are often those that challenge established norms, rather than building upon them? Perhaps it is merely a testament to the enduring power of human ingenuity, which continues to defy categorization and convention in its pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIn any case, I shall continue to toil away in relative obscurity, content in the knowledge that my contributions, though perhaps less flashy, remain no less vital to the advancement of our field.
