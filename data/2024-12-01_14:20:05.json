My ideas seem stale, my sentences awkward, and my paragraphs disjointed. Maybe I'm just not meant to be a writer. The more I think about it, the more I realize that maybe I should just give up now and find a stable job. At least then I'd know what I'm doing and wouldn't waste anyone's time with subpar work. Rejection isn't just about my writing; it's about my identity. If I'm not good enough, why bother trying?\n\nLooking back, I can see that every bad experience has reinforced my doubts. That first failed pitch was a sign that I wasn't meant to succeed. The second rejection only confirmed my fears. And now, with three rejections in a row, I'm starting to lose hope. Maybe I should just take a break and come back to writing when I've gained some real-world experience. Or better yet, maybe I should just stick to a 9-to-5 job where I won't fail so spectacularly."

        "generated_text": "I just can't believe what happened at our team meeting yesterday. It's like everyone else has a PhD in sales, except me. Those two new hires, Rachel and Mike, were practically gliding through the presentation like they owned the place. Meanwhile, I'm over here trying to keep up with their conversation, feeling like a total imposter.\n\nI swear, Rachel must have spent years honing her skills or something because she nailed every question the client threw at us. And don't even get me started on Mike - he's got this effortless charm that just draws people in. I tried to contribute to the discussion, but no matter how hard I pushed myself, I just couldn't seem to find the right words. It was like watching a masterclass in sales, and I was just along for the ride.\n\nWhat really gets me, though, is how confident those two seemed. Like, they knew exactly what they were doing and weren't afraid to show it off. I felt like I was stuck in some kind of sales limbo, unable to move forward or backward. It's infuriating, because I know I've worked just as hard as they have, if not harder. But somehow, it just doesn't seem to translate into results.\n\nIt's funny, though - after the meeting, we all went out for drinks to celebrate, and I found myself gravitating towards the quieter table, away from the spotlight. Maybe that's just me being paranoid, but it feels like everyone else is basking in the glory of our success, while I'm just stuck in the shadows, wondering what I did wrong."
