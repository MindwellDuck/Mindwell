But whenever I see those popular kids laughing together, sharing stories, and having the time of their lives, I'm reminded that I'm probably just not good enough.\n\nDespite knowing that's not true, I still can't help but label them as \"popular.\" It's like a badge of honor, a symbol of something I'll never achieve. And when I catch myself doing it, I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself I'm just observing reality. But deep down, I know it's more than that \u2013 it's a reflection of my own insecurities, my own feelings of inadequacy."

Last week, we were supposed to pick up milk and eggs together, but she strolled in 20 minutes after I'd already finished shopping. Not only did this inconvenience me, but it also meant I had to spend extra money on unnecessary items because I couldn't get everything I needed before she arrived.\n\nFurthermore, the state of our apartment is a reflection of her laziness. The dishes pile up in the sink, and I've lost count of how many times I've reminded her to take out the trash. Yet, every time I bring it up, she makes excuses or claims she'll do it \"later.\" Later never comes, and now our place looks like a college dorm room.\n\nWhat really gets under my skin is when she expects me to cover for her mistakes. Like the time she forgot to pay the electricity bill, leaving us with a hefty fine. I was the one who ended up paying it, despite having barely enough money myself. It's not fair that I always seem to bail her out while she reaps the benefits of our partnership.\n\nRachel needs to step up her game if we're going to live harmoniously.
