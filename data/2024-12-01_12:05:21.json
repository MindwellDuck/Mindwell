It started when Ryan Thompson casually mentioned that I was \"the only one who actually knows what's going on\" around here. At first, I brushed it off as a harmless compliment, but now I'm starting to wonder if he meant it as a jab.\n\nAs we were brainstorming ideas for our new campaign, Ryan kept interrupting me with his own suggestions, which, let's be honest, weren't exactly revolutionary. But what really got under my skin was when he said, \"Emily's always been great at thinking outside the box \u2013 almost too good.\" Now, I know what you're thinking \u2013 it sounds like a backhanded compliment, but I genuinely believe Ryan was trying to say that I bring a fresh perspective to our team.\n\nHowever, every time I try to talk about my ideas or share my thoughts, Ryan seems to dismiss them or downplay their importance. And those comments from him keep echoing in my head, making me question whether I'm truly cut out for this role. Am I just too sensitive? Maybe I am overreacting. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like I need to prove myself all over again.\n\nIt's funny, because before the retreat, I thought I was doing a great job, and everyone seemed to appreciate my work. But now, I'm starting to doubt my abilities. Is it possible that I've been fooling everyone along? The more I reflect on Ryan's words, the more I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop."
