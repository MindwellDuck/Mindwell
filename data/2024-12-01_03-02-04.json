I could feel my heart racing, and my palms were sweating so much I thought they might fall off.\n\nBut then, something shifted. The CEO smiled, and suddenly the entire atmosphere changed. She asked me about my passion for marketing, and I felt this surge of confidence course through my veins. I launched into a speech about how I would revolutionize their brand, and I swear, she was hanging on my every word. For a brief moment, I forgot all about my crippling anxiety and just let my enthusiasm shine through.\n\nIt was only when she asked me about my weaknesses that reality set back in. I stumbled over my words, and before I knew it, I had accidentally revealed my deepest fear of failure. But even that couldn't bring me down. Because, let's be real, if I didn't mess up, it wouldn't have been worth it. If I hadn't blown it, I wouldn't have learned anything valuable. And besides, who needs humility when you're destined for greatness?\n\nAs I left the office building, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd either won the lottery or lost everything. There was no middle ground. Either I nailed it and became the CEO's new best friend, or I bombed and never spoke to her again. It was black and white, with no shades of gray in between.

My brain feels like mush, and I end up scrolling through social media instead of doing anything productive. It's so frustrating because I know I'm capable of more, but somehow I always manage to fall short.\n\nI've been trying to set goals for myself, but honestly, I don't think I'll ever be able to achieve them. I mean, have you seen the size of the textbooks we're reading? They're huge! And our professor expects us to read three books per week? No wonder I feel overwhelmed. Maybe if I just had better resources, I'd be able to keep up.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying to slack off or anything. I really do want to succeed, but it just doesn't seem to be working out that way. I guess some people are just naturally more driven than others, and I'm just one of those people who's not cut out for this whole academic thing.\n\nDespite all my best efforts, I still find myself constantly falling behind. I've tried making schedules and reminders, but nothing seems to stick. Maybe I'm just not wired right for this kind of stuff. Oh well, at least I can say I tried, right?\n\nI did manage to finish that one paper last night, but only after I spent hours re-reading the same paragraph over and over again until I got it exactly right. And let's be real, it wasn't even that great of a paper anyway. Our professor was pretty harsh on it, and I'm pretty sure she didn't even notice how hard I worked on it. Still, I guess it's something to be proud of...if you consider getting a C+ a accomplishment."

They see me, hear me, but don't truly understand - I'm just a fragile, broken thing, unable to keep up.\n\nIn class, I watch as my peers effortlessly grasp concepts, their confidence a palpable force that only serves to highlight my own inadequacy.
