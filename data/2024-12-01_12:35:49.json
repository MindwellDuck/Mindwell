My mind's a jumble of colors and shapes, but somehow, I manage to tame them into something beautiful \u2013 or so I tell myself.\n\nAs I scroll through social media, I'm constantly reminded of how far behind I am. Those fancy designers with their sleek portfolios and six-figure salaries? They're the rockstars of our industry, and I'm just a struggling artist trying to keep up. It's like watching a Formula One car speed by while I'm stuck in neutral, wondering why I even bother.\n\nBut here's the thing \u2013 I'm not bitter. No, not me. I'm just...selectively optimistic. Yeah, that's it. I mean, who needs to compare themselves to others when you can focus on your own strengths? Like, have you seen my latest project? The client loved it, and I nailed the deadline. That's all that matters, right?\n\nIt's funny, though \u2013 every time I try to talk to other freelancers about our careers, they always seem to be doing better than me. \"Oh, I landed a major client last quarter,\" or \"My rates just went up.\" Meanwhile, I'm over here trying to scrounge up enough work to pay the bills. It's like we're speaking different languages or something.\n\nStill, I wouldn't trade this job for anything. Well, maybe for a steady paycheck and benefits, but that's beside the point. What I love about being a freelancer is the freedom to take risks and push boundaries. It's like being a painter, except instead of brushes and canvas, I get to wield a keyboard and a mouse.\n\nOf course, there are days when self-doubt creeps in \u2013 when I wonder if I'm good enough, if I'll ever make a real living off my art. But those moments are fleeting, and I quickly remind myself of all the times I've crushed it. After all, as any successful entrepreneur will tell you, it's all about perseverance and hard work.\n\nSo, yeah, I may not be the most successful designer out there, but I'm definitely in the running. And hey, who knows? Maybe someday I'll be the one giving the keynote speech at Adobe MAX. A girl can dream, right?"
