About 12 years ago before I got married I cheated on my boyfriend who is now my soon to be ex-husband with a married man.

Anything can trigger it but I seem to have narrowed it down to three general triggers.

If a group is together and Iam part of it, at some point I cry. 2) When anyone shares anything the least bit sentimental. For example a a friend of mine was talking about her sonas kindergarten graduation. His teacher taught the kids the sign language sign for aI love youa so that the next year that would be their secret signal around the school. Cute right? Cute. She was telling me this and I burst into tears! To the point I couldnat speak. This happens all the time. 3) Anytime I have to speak about anything spiritual. Iave almost stopped going to church.

Hi. I just need to get this clear. My soon to be ex has seen the same psychiatrist for 25 years. He has an ongoing Rx for Xanax but does not take it frequently except in times of stress. He is a moderate drinker. He has had trouble holding a job and blames me for almost everything. I have grown unwilling to put up with this. I grew up with an alcoholic mother and have recently started attending Al Anon. His blaming behavior seems so much like hers. Do you think he might be addicted or dependent? Donat you think 25 years seeing the same shrink without massive improvement seems off? Any suggestions other than keeping calm and doing what I need to do to protect myself?,1.0

"Since I can remember, I have had an awful relationship with my mother. I have never really felt love from her, only resentment. I think it May have something to do with the fact that she hates my father for no reason. Anyway in all my adult relationships I have not been able to connect to the other person emotionally. Iave never seen my mom be a nurturing or caring person and I fear that I have not been able to establish lasting relationships because honestly I donat know HOW to care for another person. I donat know HOW to nurture and make people feel like they matter to me. I also have two beautiful children who I donat want to feel like I donat care about them because I truly love them with all my heart. so my question to you is am I always going to be disconnected in relationships because of the relationship I have with my mom? or is there someway I can learn to be a more nurturing person?",1.0

I can relate to my clients when they sometimes feel the anxiety and unsure feeling when trying to find the right person to seek therapy and aid for important life challenges. And there are times in life when even emotional counselors and therapists need and want to seek help from a professional. As a therapist it can be difficult (for many reasons) to seek help themselves. What steps do you suggest to someone in that situation? Are there links and resources specifically to help people in our particular profession seek professional help when facing emotional or familial difficulties? What types of therapist/credentials/education level should they look for? Would it be wise to disclose the similar career field in therapy? What types of questions would be significant enough to ask the therapist before making an appointment when faced with this issue? There is very little information about this in our field that I am aware and would love to get some insight if possible. Thank you for your time.,1.0

Usually it starts around 9-10p, sometimes later, and will continue often throughout the night. I am concerned that he is either bulimic or alcoholic. He seems to binge on food, often making repeated trips to the kitchen, and hiding trash from junk food in his room. Sometimes though, it seems as if it is from drinking. I have found bottles in his room, he seems to stumble around, has mysterious dents and scratches that recently appeared on his car, etc. We are very concerned about his behavior, not to mention that itas creating a disturbance at home and giving me anxiety at night.",1.0

"Hello, I am inquiring about the plausible causes of some symptoms that I have experienced. Sometime during my prepubescent years, I believe to have had mild auditory hallucinations. Beginning shortly after laying my head down on a pillow at night, it often sounded like two people were conversing in the distance. It was never coherent, and when I would pick my head up to try and listen, it would abruptly stop. This was a common occurrence for a couple of years, but is rare to happen now. However, I still do experience mild auditory hallucinations from time to time. It seems as if I perceive them as an outside stimulus, rather than hearing it ain my heada. Occasionally I will hear someone calling my name (when no one actually is), doors being opened or closed (even if there is no one else in the house), or the distinct sound of this really noisy fan that has not been in use for quite some time now.",1.0

She sees herself as if she was not in her body and believes her body to be another person. So far the episodes only last about 20-30 seconds. I think this is too strange to ignore, although she thinks it is not anything to worry about yet. She did express concern that perhaps it could get worse suddenly and she might not ago backa to her own body and identity.

I guess I should add that while working there I had to handle and clean the deceased, which was also the first time I actually saw someone who was mentally ill. At the time however it really didnat affect me or I didnat think it did. So about maybe 3 months after I finished my internship I started to worry about having a medical condition (brain tumor, brain aneurysm, HIV, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer). So my first attack came when I was googling a symptom and I raised my hand to say ahey I have thata well my husband asked me why I raised my hand and I went blank and thought there was something wrong with me because I didnat immediately say something after I raised my hand. That time I felt more of the psychical symptoms of anxiety. So the attacks lasted about maybe a month or so and then went away for a year.",1.0

My mother lives in my home in exchange for childcare, but lately itas as if she is raising my daughter since I cannot be around due to work and school.

Would people disrespect me if I chose this option? Would that make me a bad mother? More importantly, my daughter is only 5 years old, how would this affect her? This is really a heartbreaking and stressful situation for me. Thank you.",1.0

He just likes to spend his time on his laptop playing Minecraft (and other games) and watching youtube videos, he never studies, barely actuallya just before the exams, and ignores his chores, we canat talk to him because he is just angrya And in our religion, praying is quite important, it relaxes the mind and he never prays, just wastes his timea We can barely afford his high school fees (30k dirhams which is around $8,167.71 US Dollar) and donat even know how will we afford his college fees, he probably wonat receive a scholarship.",1.0

"I started self harming when I was 12. I punch myself in the leg as hard as I can. I will often be sore for days after. However, because I was born with cerebral palsy, I am not strong enough to leave bruises on myself. I recently began to scratch myself as another form of self harm. I will do this until I skin the area Iam scratching, however I am not able to make the area bleed. I have gotten mixed reviews about whether this counts as self harm. I often try to convince myself that because the punches wonat bruise, and because the scratches donat bleed, it is not a serious issue. However, some of my closer friends have told me that is still should consider it more serious and that I need to stop before I go any further. What Iam wondering is, are behaviors intended to cause harm to oneself, but which do not cause visible tissue damage or bleeding, considered self harm?",1.0

"Hello, I am on here regarding a recent introspection I seem to be having of myself. I am no expert, I havenat a PhD, but Iave noted over the past year my emotions have become more and more dull. I rarely feel bad about hurting other people emotionally and physically, in fact, the other day I almost bludgeoned my sister with a hammer. I only pretend to be apologetic. I get an adrenaline rush instead of guilt, and the lines between fear and excitement in my mind have become blurred. Iam still doubtful though because I am a sadomasochist, I like to get hurt as well as hurt people. Iam not completely emotionless, I cry (albeit over selfish reasons). I get angry. I laugh. I know how to act nice as well, everyone who is not close to me can rarely discern my intentions. At certain times I can make myself feel a certain way. I am still a teenager so maybe I am in way over my head, but I am reaching 18 soon, and I fear I will let this part of me consume my being.",1.0

Our children are very close in age and very high strung a itas likely genetic as I am also high strung and have had issues with ADHD since childhood. He seems to be getting less and less tolerant and more easily over-stimulated. He yells frequently, but he is not physically or verbally abusive in my opinion. He is constantly at odds with my daughter and part of the reason is because he competes with her in defense of an issue. He is always wanting to have the last word and fights endlessly for his point to get across. He is this way with me as well. He is always growling and barking, and seems to be constantly annoyed by the kids. He loves them, but they just seem to be a burden to his being.",1.0

My own actions regarding this have not warranted this type of behavior to happen; I try my best to be empathetic, caring and understanding to many people that I have come across, but I always either receive nothing in return or get outright, unreasoned hostility. I tend to talk to people that are no lesser from my own life, for they have also undergone the same issues that I have, but it has become clear to me that not even they want to associate themselves with me.",1.0

Hey. Iam just really looking for some serious advice. I really believe my husband is a sociopath. When we first started dating he would mention that itas hard for him to have feelings. He also said when he was a kid he would torture cats to the point where he would kill them. He said he saw a therapist when he was younger but he doesnat know the diagnosis. Iave caught him lying constantly. He has anger issues and it comes out in our relationship. He has never physically put his hands on me but he did tell me that he wants to know what it feels like to kill someone. He is in the military and we have a daughter together. Iam worried about him and our relationship. Will he ever hurt me? He bought a gun recently and this really puts me on edge. Should I just leave him? Can he love at all? Should I confront him? I have never openly asked him about his desires to kill because it scares me. He also bought this sharp pointy like weapon and he says he wants to stab someone in the throat with it. What do I do?,1.0

Strangely, since her death, more and more, I feel my life closing in around me with a certain sense of personal paralysis. Itas very difficult to put myself out there in the world and do the things I know I can do. The anxiety is so severe that Iave chosen work as a pet sitter and house cleaner so I can feel safely under the radar and work alone.

"Hello, Over approximately the last year and a half I feel as I have become a very unstable person. I am constantly becoming angry over very little things and sometimes I notice that I am angry for no reason at all. It is usually a very intense anger and I feel as it controls me and I mostly cannot control it. It is like every little thing sets me off into a rage and I make very poor decisions such as punching something, breaking something or throwing something. I have punched three holes into the walls of my house and have broken more things than I can count. I have also been having a constant feeling of emptiness, it is hard to describe but it literally feels like something is missing from inside me and nothing can fill it. Sometimes if I drink alcohol the feeling subsides but sometimes it can make it worse to. But nothing else I have tried make the feeling go away.",1.0

I learned in psychology that one can learn aggressive behaviors from an adult when young.

Can she be fully conscious that their actions are wrong, knowing she understands right from wrong fully, and be able to change her behavior? Or can one FULLY attribute her behavior to the behavior of the sibling and the way she was conditioned to aggression or does the she hold some accountability of their actions, based off that she understands right from wrong and does behave well in other settings?",1.0

"I am 16 and have been thinking how to word this for days. Firstly, I am terrified by all social situations and people terrify me. To cope with this I like to analyse situations in my head before I do them. Sometimes I see small details and they get to me really deeply. When it comes to confronting the problem I get angry with myself and them. When this happens I often just forget all emotions and memories (everythjng i am) and start to have urges and feelings. All my emotions are usually certain or confused at this point. I donat do happiness or sadness when this happens. I just am a blank canvas. Sometimes when this happens I start to have homicidal thoughts towards the other person, I can stop myself but I hate myself afterwards. To escape from this I have my own world in my head where all my problems are solved. If I canat calm myself down enough to do that I self harm. Usually this is with a hammer and in places it canat be seen as a knife would be noticed.",1.0

In reality, if the call had even gone through, it would have made no difference. But I canat get over the fact that there was nothing I could do. From that day, I canat stop thinking about all my family dying in a horrible way. Everyday, when I walk home from school, I think about the ways they could die and what I would do without them.",1.0

" Iam slowly coming to the realization that there is a greater possibility that I have some mental issues.

"Hi, Iam a sophomore in college right now and Iam becoming more aware that I might have a mental illness. I do not know which one I have, however. When I was younger, I questioned if somebody was controlling me, if there was someone thatas making me do the things I did. There was a voice inside my head arguing against me. I thought it was just plain puberty, but that is probably not the case. As I grew older, I started to have more disturbing thoughts inside my head as well, like murder and beheading people. I thought it was just puberty striking here again. In addition, I frantically worry about my health. I was scared that my mental cognitive ability would decline and that I would get AIDS virus. I was frantic and checked to see if I would have any of the symptoms. I also thought about people plotting against me, and if my food contained poison.",1.0
