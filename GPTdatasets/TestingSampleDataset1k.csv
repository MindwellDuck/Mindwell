"I have been having this aproblema for a while. Initially I didnA t think it was bad, I just thought it was part of my personality. However, I have seen, for a few years, that it is an obstacle. I donA t seem to understand feelings. I know, in theory, what they are, but when i have to interpret them or understand why they are happening, I get confused and frustrated. I have emotions and feelings, that much I know. I usually see the world in a more logical manner, as much as possible, but i canat run from feelings and when an emotional situation occurs (with me or others) i try to put it together but itas too complex for me, which I think itas odd because other people around me comprehend them so easily. For example, I know how anger, happiness, etc, looks like, but in a real-life situation, I canat understand them or why people express them with such ease. Maybe itas a skill that I should have learned when I was a kid? Should I tell someone? (from Portugal)",1.0

Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience. For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past. In other words , a person who grew up in a religion , and changes his religion, can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past. In other words how much control do humans have to truly shape their reality based on their logic and not be biased based on any past experiences or at least not make a decison base on that fully.",1.0
