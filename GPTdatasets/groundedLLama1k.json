Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'Should Statements', that means they 'tell themselves that events, people\u2019s behaviors, and their own attitudes'should' be the way they expected, not as they are.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'I was watching the Bachelor while eating snacks.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'What if?', that means they 'continuously ask hypothetical questions focusing on potential negative outcomes.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'My wife has an 11 year old half-brother (D.), and I have a question regarding something D. did this past Thanksgiving.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'All or Nothing Thinking\/Polarized Thinking', that means they 'view a situation, a person or an event in 'either-or' terms, fitting them into only two extreme categories.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'Thoughts wonat shut up, devouring soul, frightened to death.

    "modified_text":"You are an expert at rewriting text to subtly introduce a cognitive distortion while keeping the original writing style and tone.\nYour task is to take an existing human-written thought and make minimal, subtle modifications so that it exhibits the given cognitive distortion.\nEnsure that:\n- The tone, style, and flow of the original text remain unchanged.\n- The distortion is added in a way that feels natural and not forced.\n- The modification is subtle and does not completely alter the original meaning.\n- The person in the text must not realize they are thinking in a distorted way.\n\nModify the following human-written text so that it clearly and naturally exhibits the cognitive distortion 'All or Nothing Thinking\/Polarized Thinking'. Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'All or Nothing Thinking\/Polarized Thinking', that means they 'view a situation, a person or an event in 'either-or' terms, fitting them into only two extreme categories.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'My 7 year old son on numerous occasions has acted out inappropriately in front of his friends and other boys his age, butt touching, pulling down his pants and the other boys pulling down their pants, always wanting to look at his 4 year old brotheras body parts down there, theyare always touching each otheras butts and laughing about it and he knows itas wrong donat know what to do about this.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'Blaming', that means they 'assign responsibility for negative experiences solely to others or themselves.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'i was astonished to find the amount of articles and editorials that stated to the effect while we all feel an agitated state of affairs over slavery it would be preposterous to suppose cessation and possible war might be the result'\n\nModified text: \n\ni was astonished to find the amount of articles and editorials that stated to the effect while we all feel an agitated state of affairs over slavery it would be preposterous to suppose cessation and possible war might be the result\n\nit's almost as if the people who write these articles think they're above the fray, sitting pretty in their ivory towers, completely disconnected from the pain of others.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'What if?', that means they 'continuously ask hypothetical questions focusing on potential negative outcomes.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'For one year I have been experiencing very intense emotions and sadly also had difficulties regulating concealing I am very scared of other people.Iave always been a different girl.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'Mental Filter', that means they 'pay attention to one or a few details and fail to see the whole picture.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n' I was addicted to gambling for about 12 years.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'Should Statements', that means they 'tell themselves that events, people\u2019s behaviors, and their own attitudes'should' be the way they expected, not as they are.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'I have been in an unhappy marriage for five years, since our daughter was born to be exact.

Expand the context to make the text align with this distortion while preserving the original tone and style. DO NOT USE BIG FANCY WORDS. BE AS HUMAN AND AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL TEXT'S GRAMMAR.\nYou should add 1 to 3 sentences at the end in the same style as the original to very subtly display the distortion and add context, but the core writing should feel unaltered.\n\nRemember, if a person has the cognitive distortion of 'Emotional Reasoning', that means they 'believe their emotions reflect reality and let them guide their attitudes and judgments.'.\n\nDo not include the name of the cognitive distortion or its definition in the final text.\nHere is the text to modify:\n'I was planning to attend classes this summer.

My heart is absolutely right.\n\nNote: The original text was written by a student who was upset about having to pay 1000 out of pocket for classes, while the modified text exhibits the cognitive distortion 'Emotional Reasoning'. \n\nLet me know if this modification meets the requirements. \n\nThe student's original text was written in the style of a student who is upset and frustrated with the situation, and the modified text should preserve this style and tone. \n\nThe student is upset because they don't think they can afford the",
