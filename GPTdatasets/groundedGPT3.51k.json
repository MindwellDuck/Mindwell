My husband was away traveling and I didnat get to grieve properly. Iam 34, Chinese-German woman who just moved to Prague with my husband and two sons (age 2 and 4). We moved after my nervous breakdown of sorts. My husband got a good job here so i dont have to work and can focus on getting better. I had been working full-time in an extremely stressful job as well as looking after the children. I returned to work within a few months of each birth, despite being complicated and difficult birth of 2nd son and the sudden death of my mother when he was only a few months old. My husband was away traveling and I didnat get to grieve properly. **If only my husband had been there for me during that time, maybe I wouldn't have broken down. It's like he doesn't understand how much I was dealing with on my own.**",
