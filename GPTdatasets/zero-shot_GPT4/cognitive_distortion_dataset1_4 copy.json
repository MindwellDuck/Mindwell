Tim just got promoted, Maria is engaged now, and even Jake managed to pull off a marathon. How do they do it? I mean, I have my small victories too. I managed a whole month of sticking to my exercise regimen and I've been trying new recipes, not really a promotion or a diamond ring, but still. Somehow, it just feels like peanuts compared to their grand achievements. After mingling around, I just felt... well, a bit small, ya know?",

I'm not saying I'm not successful, but there's something about being around them that just makes me feel, I don't know, insignificant?
