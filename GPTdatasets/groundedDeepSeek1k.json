I\u2019m no longer able to pinpoint why these feelings occur, but they seem to come from somewhere inside me. I rarely have any interest in deepening relationships with others\u2014whether emotionally or physically. My emotional responses are often cold and distant, though I still experience emotions\u2014I just can\u2019t keep track of them well at any given moment or feel them clearly. Additionally, I lack empathy, making it hard to connect with how others might be feeling. I sometimes find myself being very manipulative and prone to lying almost without thinking. To the extent that I lie frequently for no apparent reason, it\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to protect myself from situations where I might feel judged or vulnerable. This impulsive nature has led me to change my habits quickly\u2014picking up new hobbies and dropping them just as fast. Without much thought towards long-term goals in life, I often find it challenging to commit to any direction or plan ahead. I\u2019m not always able to anticipate how things will turn out, which makes it difficult for me to stick to the goals I\u2019ve set for myself.
